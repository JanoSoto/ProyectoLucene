Do I particularly agree? No. But nonetheless, I think it is a great movie. It has some of the dated characteristics of cinema of it's period, the 1940's, but a lot of it's characteristics are still strong nowadays. I understand that the plot has some parallels to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst, but I don't know all that much about him, so I'm going to talk about only the film, which is great itself. The film is an important figure in the history of cinema, technologically and in terms of storytelling.The story is really not all that complicated, but the way it unfolds is great and engaging, and almost makes it seem complex, and it's told from a number of perspectives. The film opens up with the death of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the owner of the Inquirer, a New York newspaper. Just before dying, Kane utters the word Rosebud. Then an approximately ten minute long newsreel summarizes the story of Kane, representing the public's view of him, and an overview of the story. Then, for the rest of the film, we are shown more details and depth of the story via flashbacks as news reporters go around and obtain information about Kane and his life.For those of you who haven't seen the film, I won't fully spoil it for you. I'll just give an overview. Kane achieved success and rose to power, but eventually suffered a major blow to his reputation, and he crashed. Along the way, he even gets married and divorced twice. With the aid of his closest friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), Kane starts builds a nationwide newspaper empire. He is ruthless as he achieves this, yet generous at the same time in a few ways, such as being willing to lose a million dollars a year to gain more newspaper circulation. Eventually, he runs for a political position, but his success to this is lost as his rival uncovers his affair with a singer, and after this, his reputation is destroyed and his life's success declines. There is more to the story, but, like I said, I'm only giving a summary; I'm not giving the full story away, for those of you who haven't seen the film.All the while, we, the audience, and the reporters in the film, wonder who Kane really was, not just the story of the events of his life, from his rise to his fall, but who he really was underneath. They believe that a key to finding this out lies in his dying word, Rosebud. At one point in the film, a reporter, Thompson, says, about the word, Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. At another point, someone (I don't remember who) says, I don't think one word can describe one man's life. The entire movie is a puzzle, a puzzle of Kane's life, and not just that, but of who he really was (for lack of a better, deeper term). Rosebud is just one piece, a missing piece, of that puzzle, but it may be an important piece. Although, then again, maybe not. We do eventually find out what the word represents and what its origin is, and it represents one of the important messages of the movie, but I won't spoil it for, again, those of you who haven't seen the film.The film is great in terms of its storytelling. In addition to its storytelling, the film is also an important point in cinema in terms of a few other factors, such as cinematography. One of the most striking of the cinematographic effects is this stark contrast between brightness and darkness. Also notable are the camera angles - which create many unique shots throughout the film - and the use of deep focus, enabling images both in the back ground and the foreground to stay clear in focus. I also liked the music score. Bernard Herrmann, who also composed the score for Psycho (1960), created an effective score with very good combinations and uses of harmony, orchestration, melody, and other musical elements, and really supports the drama and moods of the film.So, in summary, while I personally don't think Citizen Kane is the best film ever made, I did find it to be great. Watching it was a very good experience for me.

But goes in a more character driven direction without the constant jump scares and has some drama that actually works. Yeah, it may lack the tension but it has other good elements to back it up. In fact this is a ghost movie that maybe even the whole family can watch. No, it isn't kid friendly and childish and is far from being a children's movie. But it's deep without being too complex. But if you want to be frightened by seeing ghosts on screen you might be disappointed in that aspect. The ghost in this doesn't make much of an appearance but plays a important part in this story. The actors and actresses in this is spot on most of the time, even the children in this. The actor that stood out though is Federico Luppi who plays the doctor and head guy at the Spanish orphanage, he reminded me of another actor Christopher Lee in a lot of ways. The acting style and demeanor is just very similar. While I liked The Orphanage another ghost movie better than this one. Although the style is different but that one was a bit more scary. This is still a solid movie that is worth a watch if you like creative ghost stories. Where the human motives and decisions are actually intriguing. Sometimes a ghost doesn't have to be frightening to be a good ghost movie that is also not kid friendly. Showing that men\/women are more evil and scary than ghosts when a lot of people fear dead spirits over people. It's not saying don't trust people necessarily but that men\/women are capable of a lot of evil. This is a ghost story that takes place during the Spanish civil war so in a way it's kinda like a companion piece to Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth but this has less special effects. Overall I didn't think this was a amazing movie because of the entertainment factor but it's still a good one that is enjoyable. It might not be for everyone. But recommended for those that submit themselves to movies, rather than submit movies to themselves. Or you may really dislike this one.7.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 July 2012","score":"","review":" This isn't one of those traditional ghost\/horror movies that most American audiences are use to.

Imagine my surprise upon reading reviews for this film that many critics proclaimed this to basically just be Scorsese going over old ground and being too much like Goodfellas. Why they presumed this I can see, but when looked at closer it is actually not that much alike.The cast contains a number of similar faces in each movie such as De Niro, Pesci, Vincent Etc. But on the whole I found Casino to be more gripping than Goodfellas and just as well made. A scene near the end of this movie has the consequences of the characters actions throughout the movie shown to music by the animals in the form of the house of the rising sun. In Goodfellas the same similar consequences are shown to music from Derek And The Dominos' Layla (another captivating scene).Going over old ground or not you can't deny that Casino is another winner for Scorsese, and if you think Joe Pesci was nuts in Goodfellas. you ain't seen nothing yet. From the soundtrack to the camera-work to the editing this film is almost perfect. Another reason I prefer this to Goodfellas is De Niro. He has a lot more to do in this than what he did in Goodfellas and the film benefits from him being lead again. James Woods also shines in almost a cameo role the way he struts in and out of the film several times then showing up for comedy effect later in the film. Sharon Stone got best Actress at Oscar for her performance (though good, I'm not her biggest fan) and she probably deserved it.The opening credits should also get a mention for being quite possible the best I've ever seen and any film that opens with the 'death' of Robert De Niro would have anyone hooked. In Conclusion this is a total masterpiece in my eyes and was way the best film of 95 and the fact it was beaten to best picture by Braveheart sickens me.

The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a sleeper, on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been Pulp Fiction and Heat. I didn't see Forrest Gump until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose Shawshank will fall below some other films.

What's more, the assassin has left him with an untreatable illness known as short-term memory loss. The last thing that Leonard is able to remember is the death of his wife, and thus, he is now on a deadly and vicious hunt for the man who took the love of his life and left him handicapped. On his journey he meets a few mysteriously suspicious people (especially Nathalie and Teddy), who sometimes want to take advantage of 'this thing that he has'. His brain isn't able to work in a proper manner, so in order to understand where he lives, who he meets, what he did, and what's the real purpose of his actions, he takes photos of people and locations and even tattoos important notes all over his body. When someone tries to discourage him by saying 'you aren't going to remember your revenge' he convincingly states 'my wife deserves the revenge whether I remember it or not' and 'the world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes'.In the movie the viewer encounters two interconnected stories, one told forward (in black and white) and the other backwards (in colors). The former goes on as we see Leonard talking on the phone with an unknown person, while he reminisces about a man named Sammy Jankis, who had to deal with a similar memory loss problem. The latter shows all the events that lead up to the first scene (shot overlooking a negative of a dead person and a killing prior to that), actually revealing all the missing elements. Even though with every consecutive sequence the story starts to take shape and becomes less and less complicated, it still is confusing. But that's good, because the viewer has to assume that this is the sole purpose of the movie, and re- watching it or reading various interpretations online won't support us with any new hints, only random divagations and probably more confusion on the way. That's why I think the movie leaves the best impression when seen only once.Considering the fact that the narrative technique is straightly nonlinear, Leonard still operates on a daily basis in the regular timeline known to human mind. He isn't able to form any new memories, so the fact that the viewer observes all the events in a totally different order doesn't necessarily help the main character.As we move on with the often perplexing storyline we stumble onto a maze, which sort of produces another maze, and, in the process, intentionally creates a puzzle within a puzzle (with the peculiar interest in riddles and perplexing plots it's easy to see why Nolan went on to direct Inception in 2010). Memento is said to be one of the most scientifically accurate movies that deal with the problem of memory loss. In psychological evaluation, it not only realistically explains all the symptoms of this illness, but also presents one man's struggle to go on living his life no matter whether he will remember it or not. He just needs to have a certain goal that will make it all worthwhile. And the surprising ending, which I won't spoil here, gives him exactly wanted he wanted, and, in a deeper sense, all his actions seem to be justified in the thrilling finale.

I'm not saying that originality is bad; I like it, it's good, but it's a minor factor in how good a movie\/story is. The story doesn't necessarily have to be original, but it has to be compelling to people; has to capture the emotion and interest of the audience and keep them riveted throughout. Titanic does just that. It captures the heart and interest of the viewer and keeps it completely riveted all the way through the end (it did for many people, anyway, including me).Titanic combines fiction with non-fiction, the more important of which is probably the non- fiction aspect the tragic sinking of the luxury cruiser R. M. S. Titanic in 1912. There have been a few films that portrayed the tragic event (such as Titanic in 1953 and A Night To Remember in 1958). Then, in 1997, along came James Cameron, who, despite some weaknesses with script and dialogue, is good at storytelling, and always pushes the advancement of visual and special effects, and uses them to his advantage. Therefore, a film about the Titanic was a perfect project for him. The recreation of the ship is great, with excellent detail and scope. Except for a few brief moments here and there when something doesn't look quite real, it's it looks spellbindingly realistic, and, while watching it, it felt almost like I was really there. James Cameron really spent his $200 million budget wisely.Some of that money also went into filming some footage of the actual wreck at the bottom of the ocean. This footage is seen in a scene at the beginning of the movie, shot via a remote- controlled underwater camera. As Roger Ebert says, These shots strike precisely the right note; the ship calls from its grave for its story to be told. However, instead of only telling a story of only the real event, he also weaves a fictional story ingeniously into it, specifically an almost Romeo and Juliet-like story of forbidden love. In modern times (actually, during the time the film was made), a fictitious survivor of the Titanic sinking, old Rose DeWitt Bukater (Gloria Stuart), tells the story via flashback, and tells about her brief yet intense forbidden love affair with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).Seventeen-year-old Rose (Kate Winslett), from a wealthy upper-class background, is betrothed to a rich snob, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). She hates this, and is extremely miserable. Meanwhile, Jack is basically poor, and he wins a ticket to the Titanic in a lucky win in a card game. He eventually finds Rose, who is about to commit suicide by jumping off the ship, and he saves her life. What follows is the development of their forbidden love story, which is told in such a way that shows off different parts of the magnificent cruise ship. It's a simple, predictable, and clichéd story, but it's still very compelling, especially since we know how that the ship is going to sink eventually and cause heartbreaking results on their romance (predictability is actually good here).Meanwhile, there is the subplot regarding the actual historical events leading up to the sinking - the arrogance of the builders and the people who ran the ship (they thought the ship was unsinkable). At the midpoint of the movie, the ship hits the iceberg, and the second half of the movie begins, and develops into a thrilling yet tense and dramatic race for survival. The entire movie, from start to finish, is handled extremely well in terms of story, and is completely full of heart and soul; it's all very strong in emotion. And yes, it's predictable, but in this case it actually adds to the power of the movie. But it's not completely predictable. There are a lot of things that are not fully given away, like exactly who dies (besides Jack) and who lives (besides Rose), and some other things along the way, too.Some people would definitely argue that the love story between Jack and Rose is completely unnecessary, but it actually helps the movie. It adds more emotion to the story and makes it that much more compelling. It also provides more structure to the story and the showing-off of the ship, and even allows the audience to really connect with the passengers on the ship (innocent people whose lives are ultimately ruined or permanently altered as a result of the builders' arrogance and ignorance &#x96; unsinkable, yeah right). And the special effects also made the film work well, too. However, despite having great special effects in his film, James Cameron did not lose sight of what's truly important &#x96; story, characters, emotion, etc. The movie does not rely on special effects. It wouldn't have worked nearly as well without them, but they are not the main driving force of the film.If I had to criticize one thing about the film, it would be the length. In my opinion, it's too long, at three hours and fifteen minutes. However, it still works brilliantly as it is. Every moment of the story serves a great and important contribution to the story, the drama, the emotion, and everything else. The performances by the actors were very good, the pacing of the film is great (if a bit lengthy at times), and the tone of the film is great. James Horner's score is fantastic, very memorable, absolutely beautiful, and perfect for the film.

In other words they love the drama.The other team, The Frustrated, have had their expectations of this film thwarted. They have most likely seen the high IMDb score or have heard good things about it. They watch and are frustrated by its lack of a driving narrative and the lack of a rounded payoff, especially considering it's nearly 2 hours long. Further infuriated is felt because of their opposition the Art Rebels, who are responsible for bigging it up and directly to blame for the boredom felt. The Frustrated too love the drama of battle and will rate the film lower than they actually feel about it.I have given it a rating of 5\/10, which was actually only to give the impression that I'm impartial. My real rating is 3\/10. This film lacked crucial direction. It does create a mood, it does have bits of engaging scenes and dialogue, and it does create something of a buildup at the start, but my goodness, the hopeful setup turns into a plot less, confused fog and any momentum already created soon plummets into a painful, painful boredom.

The film stars the chameleonic Johnny Depp as Edward, an odd man-child who was created in a spooky castle by an elderly inventor, played by horror maestro Vincent Price (in what would become his last film role). Edward's based on Burton's own life as an angst-filled loner growing up in Burbank California. Misperceived, ostracised and constantly brooding, he created Edward as a teenager, the character's scissor hands (he's literally unable to get close to anyone) emblematic of Burton's feelings of isolation, his inability to connect with others, and the misconception others placed upon him. Cute.Burton worked with Price earlier on Vincent, and clearly adores the actor, or rather, what the actor is associated with; expressionism, classic B movies, early horror films etc. Edward Scissorhands, with its popcorn Gothicism, Expressionism and Surrealism (Lang, Murnau and most of all Czech surrealist Jan Svankmajer, are huge influences on Burton), itself borrows liberally from Frankenstein, Beauty and the Beast, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Elephant Man, The Phantom of the Opera and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and is arguably better than the filmed versions of each. It's an ugly tucking tale, but Burton puts his own spin on things and doesn't overreach; his film stays on the level of a simple children's tale, very whimsical, magical and charming. The film's memorable score is by Danny Elfman, though Burton initially approached Robert Smith of the English Gothic Rock band The Cure to do the soundtrack. Edward, and even Burton in real life, strongly looks like Smith. Not so cute.Hold me, a character played by actress Winona Ryder whispers. I cant, Edward cries. The couple spend the film caught in the porcupine's dilemma, someone getting hurt whenever they get close. As is typical of these films (see Elephant Man et all), the townsfolk and angry locals who bully our ugly duckling hero are ridiculously caricatural. They're a horde of dumb bad guys who, reminiscent of the final scenes in James Whale's Frankenstein, arbitrarily decide to pick on poor Edward, form a gang and run him out of town. In response Edward, like Quasimodo and The Phantom of the Opera, flees and consigns himself to a tower overlooking regular folk. Ryder's character then spends the rest of her life lost in a lover's lament, missing the scissor man who stole her heart. The film's bookends are magical, Burton's tale offered as an explanation to a sleeping child as to why snow falls from the sky. Snowflakes, we learn, are essentially the sadness of our hero, Edward, as he carves ice sculptures from the mountaintops of the love he never had. Coppola would cast Winona Ryder in his Dracula film some years later, recognising the similarities in her role here with the classic damsels of horror-tales past.While Edward is essentially a cyborg, the film portrays him more as a monster or freak. Tod Browning's hugely influential Freaks is its granddaddy (also the ancestor of Lynch's Elephant Man), as Burton goes to great lengths to draw parallels between suburban life and horror movies. All these films attempt to simultaneously humanize the monster whilst revealing the monstrosity of normative, non-disabled society. Edward may be part Frankenstein, part Freddy Kruger, but the townspeople living around him are themselves torn straight out of a John Waters or David Lynch (Blue Velvet) freak-show, all regular people painted in such a light as to seem grotesque and hideous. Even their surroundings are freakish, normal towns and homes exhibiting a plethora of kitschy artifacts (1950s interior decorating and costuming) and garish colour schemes. Burton also goes to lengths to highlight the clockwork routines of the townsfolk; their stifling conformity and machine-like normative lives. Meanwhile, everyone treats Edward's existence as a disability or a correctable medical condition, recommending various doctors or quick-fix solutions to rectify his incomplete state. Unsurprisingly, regular folk only grow to value Edward when he makes himself a tool and starts working (grooming dogs, trimming hedges, barbecuing, cutting hair). Difference doesn't matter, so long as you conform to homoeconomicus, becoming a functional and productive worker within society.The film's villains are heavy-handed and its romance rushed, but this is nevertheless one of Burton's better films. It was released in 1990, before Burton became a brand-name, typecast and spokesperson for all that is emo. Today Burton's a bit of a joke; an ageing goth rocker, or freakish blend of Botox and black mascara, marketed as a morbid outsider yet fully ingrained in Hollywood.

Along the way, the dead bodies start piling up, and Harry finds things just getting more and more gloomy as his search moves inexorably towards its devastating conclusion. I think that a key to this films' success is that it *can* work even for the viewer who knows the major revelations beforehand, or guesses at them early on. It's the gravitas that Parker and his fine cast brings to the proceedings that make it so compulsively watchable. Also appearing are Charlotte Rampling, beautiful as ever, in the role of black magic practitioner Margaret, and the stunning Lisa Bonet, who's memorable in the role of young mother Epiphany. Familiar faces in smaller roles include Pruitt Taylor Vince, as a detective (he acted again for Parker in Mississippi Burning), Kathleen Wilhoite, as a nurse, Michael Higgins as a drug-addicted doctor, musician Brownie McGhee as Toots Sweet, and Dann Florek ('Law & Order SVU') as an attorney. As this story plays out, one just knows that whatever Harry finds out, it won't be pleasant, and the dark tone extends to the memorable sex scene, which is erotic and creepy in equal measure. The music score by Trevor Jones is suitably eerie and there's a serving of blues music that is irresistible, adding to the overall experience. In the end there's a strong message about the nature of living a lie, and the final confrontation between two characters is brilliantly subtle, depending on acting rather than spectacle or much in the way of cheese. This represents a solid effort from all concerned. Eight out of 10.

When Vicki Vale starts to date Wayne she find's out that he is not who she thought he was. While this happens,Jack Napier is sent by Carl Grissom to rob the Axis Chemical Plant but the whole thing turns out to be a set up by Grissom, and while confronting Batman, he falls into a vat of chemicals turning him into the Joker. The Joker now even more crazy then he was before decides to poison Gotham's like him when he puts the same chemicals that made him into products like shampoo,deodorant,etc. Batman foils his plans but the Joker has a dastardly plan to dump money onto the crowd at Gothem's festival ,painting him to be the good guy and batman as the villain. Batman then takes his balloons that were meant to kill the crowds at Gotham but did'not. the film ends with Batman finding out that the Joker killed Batman's parents and the Joker finds out that Batman is Bruce Wayne. This film is one of my favourite films of all time and unlike the inferior sequels,the film is a hell of a good time. Micheal Keaton is superb as Batman\/Bruce Wayne.

However, I am convinced that Disney is a major typographical error, and this is really a 68 minute long Looney Tunes episode. There is a fine line between Animated Feature and Cartoon, and The Adventures Of Ichabod And Mr. Toad crosses over to the Cartoon side.The Adventures Of Ichabod And Mr. Toad is a two part film. The first part is a story involving Mr. Toad, a crazed amphibian with no respect for the property of others. He is charged of stealing an automobile, though Mr. Toad claims he did not steal it. His friends and he must prove his innocence.The second part is about a man named Ichabod Crane. He's skinny and odd, but despite this, he's a real lady magnet. But when attractive Ms. Katrina comes to town, it's a fight for the lady between Ichabod and town bully, Brom Bones.I don't know why these two stories were combined into one movie. They're completely different from the other. The only thing they have in common, is that they're both exhausting. Mr. Toad's story has some fun to it. Some of Toad's antics are amusing, and there are a couple of good lines. But overall, it's dull, and the slap-stick goes way overboard.I decided to remain optimistic though. I had hopes that the second half with Ichabod would be better. Well, I admit I was wrong. The second half is even worse. There is almost nothing noteworthy in the second half. The songs are dull and rather flat. It boasts an unoriginal story line. Also, somehow, the headless horseman gets worked into the end and it doesn't make even the slightest bit of sense.The one good bit in the Ichabod half of the film, is a dance sequence where Ichabod and Brom are both trying to dance with Katrina. Yes, this kind of thing isn't all that original, but it's easily the best scene in the film (which, admittedly isn't saying much).Ichabod's bit also ends with a chase scene between Ichabod and the Headless Horseman (who's involvement doesn't make even the slightest sense). This is incredibly dull and I can't imagine a worse way to end the film.The animation is mostly bland. But it's kind of silly that the character's lips rarely match what they're actually saying (though this isn't a problem during the second half, where it's mostly narrated).The Adventures Of Ichabod And Mr. Toad is not a film. It's merely a cartoon disguised as a film (and the veil is relatively thin, at that). Disney rarely makes a bad animated film, but The Adventures Of Ichabod And Mr. Toad is a major exception. I suppose the reason that Ichabod And Mr. Toad is such a bad film, isn't so much that it's flawed (though it is), it has more to do with it being rather dull and forgettable. It does little to separate itself from the average Saturday morning cartoon.

His passion for the films that came out of Hollywood were precious to him, in that those pictures affected him and the way he conceived to present his work. Although not imitating Hollywood, he improved his narratives by creating characters that captured his audiences' imagination with his cool vision of criminals at work.Bob le fambleur is sort of an indicator for the big turn the French cinema wag going to experience with the arrival of the New Wave directors in the late 1950s. Their films were considered innovative, daring and different, but one does not have to go too far to realize Mr. Melville had been there ahead of all of them. Watching the film today, one marvels at the technical details employed by the director, as well as his camera angles. Take, for instance, the shots in which the sanitary trucks spray water on Paris streets. One almost feels being there, trying to step away from getting splashed!The screenplay by the director and Andre Le Breton, plays flawlessly because it feels real. The characters reflect an era of a bygone Paris where the night life was intense. Montmartre with its sexy clubs and night clubs were the haunt for the small time criminals that populated the area in the 1950s. We are given a glimpse at a different Paris even though its flavor has disappeared. The world of wise guys, prostitutes and the crowd they attracted are clearly depicted in the film.Melville, as he is credited here, took a big risk in the casting of Roger Duchesne as Bob, because of his problem with alcohol. It would be inconceivable to think of anyone else playing the cool Bob, but him. There are other rewards in the talented cast Melville assembled for the movie. Isabelle Corey, seen as Anna, was perfect as the young woman Bob wanted to save from the life he had chosen. She, in turn, was a pivotal figure in the story. Daniel Cauchy is marvelous as young Paolo, the man who admired Bob without any reservation. The supporting cast makes an excellent contribution.The black and white cinematography of Maurice Blettery and Henri Decae captured the lower depths of the Paris underworld which enhances the flavor of the film and ultimately, our enjoyment.

The supporting cast makes an excellent contribution.The black and white cinematography of Maurice Blettery and Henri Decae captured the lower depths of the Paris underworld which enhances the flavor of the film and ultimately, our enjoyment. The jazzy score by Eddie Barclay and Jo Boyer gives texture to the production. Ultimately, it is Mr. Melville's talent that brought all the elements together to give appreciative audiences one of the best pictures of this genre.

I said NO THANKS! but my friend told me I'd like it. Guess what? I liked it. Elvira was so good at her delivery. I'm surprised she didn't do more films, since she was a natural on camera. This movie is not to be taken seriously obviously, but the one-liners kept stacking up. Many that I would consider using in the future.I could go into the plot, but it is a paper thin plot which is okay. The film has a kitschy fun playful mood and that's the plot as far as I'm concerned. I'd recommend this if you grew up in the 80s and have a fun sense of humor. This isn't trying to be a masterpiece. It's just fun, and having seen so many movies that attempt this kind of film I am glad to have discovered it. Congrats, Cassandra, you did well!
