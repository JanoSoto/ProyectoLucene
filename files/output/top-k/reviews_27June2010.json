Goldfinger was the first of four Bond movies Guy Hamilton directed and with a budget of $3million and the gross revenue being $124.9million, it is safe to say that it was the crown jewel of his career and of the James Bond franchise.The film has a rather basic storyline of how Goldfinger plans to raid Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world and Bond sets out to thwart him. Though the storyline may have been nothing special but the film's use of iconography and presentation that made it outshine other Bond issues. Unlike the more recent Bond films such as Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace etc, Goldfinger has that James Bond feel to it. What I mean by this is that the newer Bond issues lack the conventions, which made it successful and unique for example there isn't as much use of gadgets in newer Bond films. I mean you have a beautiful Aston Martin DB5 and not only has it got the speed, but those gadgets within it which Bond can utilise when he is in a chase scene, that can help make it epic and breathtaking. This was shown very well in this film as Bond can shoot from using in his car, track villains down, and one particular gadget, the ejector seat, which simple but effective and amusing. There is something else which also stands out in this film and which is decreased in the newer Bond films and that is clichés. For me I think it is a huge mistake of not utilising clichés in up coming Bond films, as you look in modern times, we can watch so many films of the action\/adventure genre, who now also use the similar conventions such as the gadgets, the fast cars etc, that you would want a film which is unique on its own. This is where I feel clichés are really important and how it shows this film having that James Bond feel than of Quantum of Solace for example. One real famous cliché, which is used in this film, is when Sean Connery's character says The names Bond. James Bond. The use of clichés in this film like the one I just quoted can show the iconic status of James Bond. The acting in Goldfinger was absolutely superb especially of Sean Connery and Gert Frobe, who both had unique characters and were the perfect match in the antagonist and protagonist. This film displayed Auric Goldfinger as a real legitimate threat and as a sadistic psychopath. There is a famous scene which shows this aspect of his character where a laser beam is about cut Bond in half, James says Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger? to which Goldfinger replies No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!. In the following moments we see Bond worried and I feel this can allow us to recognise Auric Goldfinger as a powerful enemy and as an equal to Bond. The fact that we see James Bond anxious is very rare in the franchise as he has a very strong screen presence and there is an expectation of him being the powerful, authoritative figure. With this expectation, the franchise shows itself as a fairytale and the film also displays this. The character of Bond shows to be a resilient hero that defeats the bad guy and saves the world. But the earlier Bond character, which was acted by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, showed wit and humour which so dearly lacks now. Now that we distinguished the traits and personality of the good character and the bad character, what else does every evil, manipulative villain need in the James Bond franchise? For those who haven't guessed it, there is one word, which I'm looking and that's henchman. Henchmen's play a huge part in the Bond film chain (Stamper, Tee Hee and Gobinda to name a few) as they are presented as the unstoppable force that 007 has to fight. The main henchman in this film is Oddjob who is played by Harold Sakata and to be quite honest with you, he is my favourite henchman throughout the whole series. The reason being is that he is silent, manservant of Goldfinger but is a ruthless killer and ends up having an epic battle with James Bond, who has to use his intelligence and resiliency to defeat the Korean born wrecking machine. As always every Bond film needs Bond girls! Now first of all I would like us to consider the fact that Goldfinger was made in 1964, so naturally back then, the female gender was seen as the inferior sex however that did not stop the persistent use of sexual innuendo but it isn't as explicit as it used in the more recent Bond movies. The main Bond girl in this film goes by the name of Pussy Galore (note the strong use of innuendo in the name!), but she isn't the stereotypical Bond girl that gets taken in by 007. When we see her first meet James Bond, there is a clear indication that she will not be seduced and she is playing hard to get. With this we can make the clear assumption that she is not the stereotypical female, and to emphasise this further, in the film her profession is a pilot and she also has learnt judo, thus revealing the masculine nature in the character, evidently summing up why she isn't easily taken in by Bond. Eventually however, she falls for him and again it's mainly about Bond's character, his wit, his bravery, and his intelligence. Having such characteristics is sure to woo even the likes of Galore.

Leading role can focus the power all over the world on saving the earth or human beings. This is the most excited thing in the world I think.Another theme which is usually talked in this sort of disaster movie is humanity. But there is a little in Independence Day, the shrinking violet Secretary of Defense, who is completely different with our young and energetic President Thomas J. Whitmore. Who can save the world? The answer is clear in every audience's heart I suppose.As for the golden combination, Captain Steven Hiller and David Levinson, they separately represent wisdom and courage. Two parts of a prefect saver. This method makes heroes more like an ordinary person by giving each part some weaknesses.David Levinson is a scientist without great aspirations. He has a simple life. He likes laying chess with his old father and riding bike. To him, the life now he has got is the one he wants the most, besides the part of he and his ex-wife. He has been in deep love with his wife even after they got divorced. His charming wife, Constance Spano, is a presidential assistant. Her busy work and his easy life make a sharp contrast in theirs daily life; this contrast is also the reason of their divorce. If Constance were not the Presidential assistant, I think David can't save the world because he has no chance to talk to the President. Captain Steven Hiller is an excellent soldier with a strong body and honesty. People would simply deem that Steven is a nice guy at the first sight of Will Smith's face. Jasmine Dubrow, Steven's girlfriend, who has a little boy and his father isn't Steven. Steven treats him like his own son. We can realize that in the scene of Steven went back to his base, he made a promise of setting fireworks after he accomplish his mission with that little boy. In the end of the final war, the boy watches the fireworks made up by remains of aliens' spaceship.One person breaks the code of aliens' communication and comes up with the idea of saving human beings, the other person has the ability of driving spacecraft, strong body to fight with a real alien and the courage to challenge unknown. These two guys make all the expectations come true. David's idea of beating aliens is implant virus into mother ship of aliens to make all spacecrafts 'get cold '. And it just comes from David's father's comforting words. From the very beginning, they two have no tacit understanding in the battle. I think their only tacit understanding is embracing their beloved woman as soon as possible after winning the war. Maybe love is the real theme of this disaster movie.We have another hero in this movie, the President. He wanted to be a President full of passion and energetic. But there was no opportunity before aliens' invasion of Earth. I'm a combat pilot, I belong in the air.  This is my most memorable lines. Do you like this kink of president? A president attends a war in person, an act to inspire everyone's patriotism to protect their own nation. The President is a normal person, he loves his cute daughter. But he can not be an ordinary person because he is the President of the United States. He is responsible to the whole National; so he can't express his sorrow of wife's death completely.Aliens are poor, because they are usually beaten by American for strengthening National cohesion and proving the achievement in Special Effects. Everybody has a unique imagination of aliens, but most of them are aggressive. Nobody hates aliens; we all have sympathy for the weak and loathe aggressive part. If men invade other plant for its resource, audiences will also acclaim for men's failure. For example, in the movie Avatar, the audiences applaud for human beings' failure of invading Pandora.Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

Casper, however, really struck me a being wide of the mark for a family audience, as it doesn't appear that children were really taken into account much when the film was made.This movie may be fine for older children and adults, but please heed the PG rating - there is a great deal of smoking in the movie, and quite a bit of language and humor that is far too adult for small children. It resembled to me more of a poor remake of Ghostbusters, rather than an honest-to-goodness family film. The special effects skew toward the disturbing side, the humor is mostly violent slapstick, the subtext is desperately creepy, and the casual attitude towards suicide, murder and death is really, really inappropriate.

Many of my peers have already done that. I'm just want to say, that in the day and age of shows like CSI Miami, this film did what is was supposed to do - entertain. CSI Miami is not necessarily known for it's plausible plots, but do I love it? Yep, every time Horatio crosses that screen. Beautiful scenery, a plot I don't have to read a companion novel to follow, and eye candy. A great way to unwind after a long day...If you watch the deleted scene content with narration by Sylvester Stallone, there might be more insight into what SS was going for, in terms of the distortion of one's values and to what length people will go to achieve fame. There were sub plots that got lost in the edit. Some of that would have made for better developed characters. And yes, not all of the race sequences or rescue for that matter, were completely accurate. Then again, this is Hollywood exercising their creative liberties. Sue 'em...If anything, Days of Thunder was more painful to watch.I don't have a problem with SS and Burt Reynolds on screen. OK, not the deepest script - but, how many guys look as good as SS at 54? Today at 63, he's still in great shape. Would love to see a sequel to Get Carter.Grab a nice glass of beaujolais, relax, and be glad you didn't pay full boat to watch it. Hip, hip hooray for cable!
