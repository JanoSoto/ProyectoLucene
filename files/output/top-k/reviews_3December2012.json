[{"date":"3 December 2012","score":"","review":" Rushmore (1998) *** (out of 4) Wes Anderson's unique look at prep student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) who falls in love with one of his teachers (Olivia Williams) while also trying to get close to a rich steel maker (Bill Murray). RUSHMORE takes a familiar character (a prep student), a familiar location (the prep school) and pretty much makes it something original. I think what I enjoyed most about this picture was that unique feel that comes with all of Anderson's films. It's certainly not something any other director in the world could come up with, I mean, when you're watching a film from Anderson you know it could only come from him. I also thought the Fischer character was a very interesting one as he was the type that could be great at anything he wanted but he always ends up falling short because he's trying to be great at everything. The performances are certainly another major plus as Schwartzman does a wonderful job in the lead and easily manages to carry the film. Williams was incredibly delightful as the teacher who he falls in love with. Murray, who has always done great work in supporting parts, adds another memorable character to his career. The screenplay by Anderson and Owen Wilson perfectly nails the atmosphere of the school, the kids and the various characters that come into play. I did find several flaws in the picture including the final acts, which become a bit too dark for their own good. I'd also say the film runs on a bit too long. With that said, RUSHMORE is still a pretty unique vision and original picture.
