You really don't get to know much of anything about the characters, and the movie is fairly short anyways(around 80 mins.). The summary of the plot is Lola's boyfriend Manni was supposed to transport 100,000 Marks to a local gangster(Ronnie), but he loses the money. So as a last chance, he calls Lola and informs her that in twenty minutes he needs the 100,000 or he's a goner. Thus begins the roller-coaster ride. If you liked how that sounded, then by all means you should check this movie out! Now What you DO get though is a techno score through out the whole film(most of it anyways) that keeps the movie zipping along at a quick pace. I kept on noticing how the movement on the film would quite often synch up with the music score which was very nice. I've never been a fan of techno, but it really fit this movie well and, in my opinion, is a major contributing factor that makes this movie so cool. The camera work is also excellently done. Lots of different camera angles that you usually don't see in films. All in all, if you're running short on movies to watch, or just want to see something different then by all means check this out!

If you were hesitant to see this film, I would suggest it to you for the sheer enjoyment of seeing Close out of her element and being as sultry as ever. Douglas plays the classic, not to creative, father\/husband\/lover that must battle a barrage of threats coming from a woman that deserves every bit of respect from him. The script is jagged, at times nearly laughable, but still an enjoyable two hours of some amazingly tense scenes handled well by Adrian Lyne, who continues to wow us with his beautiful vision and racy talent behind the camera with film favorites like Unfaithful and Jacob's Ladder (two completely different films that highlight his true talent). I also think that the premise to this story is something to tote about as well. It is one of those rare occurrences when you could see the honesty of the story. It is an everyday occurrence, husbands cheating on their wives, and the reality that one could just snap after a night of sheer pleasure connects with such a mass viewing audience. Fatal Attraction is one of those films that creates the tension from the reality of the crime or passion, which is scarier than any horror film out there.The greatest pull for this film has to be Glenn Close. I have seen several of her films and I must admit that this one sent shivers up my spine. She was superb as the strong-willed woman who knew what she wanted, went for it, then sought her revenge when the man wasn't able to reciprocate the feelings back to her. She really gave some depth to this film, transforming what could have been this simple psychotic character into one with many layers and depth. There are times that you somewhat feel sorry for her character because of the way that Douglas' character has treated her. While some will say that she forced him into it, Douglas knew what he was doing from the beginning, and should have been ready for any of the consequences. I will also say that I think Close's portrayal of Alex is a very feminist one. She could have easily decided to portray her as this weak and disturbed woman, but instead I really saw her as this independent woman who wasn't going to be walked away from after a weekend of love. Her heart was not going to be cut out and handed to her just because she was just as aggressive as most men. I was very impressed with Close in this film. All the while I thought Douglas was not coming out of his box. He brought nothing spectacular to his role and in fact I found myself laughing whenever he was to portray being flustered. It just didn't fit him. The same goes for Archer who played a cookie-cutter wife with no emotion. I feel that she was probably the worst character of the film. Apparently the writers gave her no information on her character and the only direction that Lyne gave her was to act pretty. What a waste of talent. Finally, what was up with the boy-ish looking daughter they had? To me, that was one of the more frightening elements of this film.Outside of the characters, Lyne does a fantastic job of building suspense and tension between Douglas and Close. He consistent and powerful use of the phone to add that extra violin shrill was a blast. I jumped a little bit each time the phone rang in the film, which showed the power that Lyne had with this household devise. He also structured the story well, giving us just the right amount of space and time with each of our players. He didn't focus heavy on just Douglas, but jumped us back and forth with Close as well allowing us to see different perspectives and development. My only struggle with the structure of the film was the why for Douglas. Was it pure spontaneity to sleep with Close, or was there some tensions or troubles at home? I would have liked to understand a bit clearer as to why Douglas decided to destroy his seemingly perfect family.Overall, I was impressed with this film. While I do not think that it was exceptionally good, I do credit it for keeping my attention during the two hours that it ran. I literally could not keep my eyes off Close. She was amazing in this film, and if you see it for no other reason than her performance, you will not be disappointed. It was a classic every man story that included that Lyne atmosphere of tension and erotica. The script could have used some tweaking, but the intensity was there. I couldn't answer my phone for a week after I watched this.

With its elaborate special effects and action sequences, ridiculous yet imaginative plot and cheerfully broad characters, this is a movie that speaks to the fourteen-year-old inside all of us. And yes, I was fourteen when I first saw it on the big screen.First of all, this movie is basically a nerd's dream come true, with James Spader playing Daniel Jackson as the quintessential nerd who gets a chance to prove his theories about ancient Egypt when a woman working with the US government enlists his help translating some writing found on a mysterious artifact. Right down to the fact that he leaves his coffee mug perched on a metal pipe as he hurries into a meeting, Spader's performance is pitch-perfect.The whole first act is so good, as we watch Spader at work and the suspense builds toward the opening of the Stargate, that it's almost a shame the movie didn't make better use of the Stargate and give it a bigger payoff. A more profound film might have put the journey into the Stargate at the climax of the story, and the result could have been something like the mind-blowing trip at the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey or the walk into the spaceship at the end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.But this movie has other ideas, so Spader joins Russell and his presumably crack team of soldiers (we never really learn much about them) on a reconnaissance mission through the Stargate to explore whatever lies on the other side.SPOILERS AHEAD! My favorite shot of the movie comes when Spader and Russell walk a distance out into the desert that they find on the other side of the Stargate, then turn around and see that they've just walked out of a pyramid with three alien moons above it. It's the sort of simple yet striking visual that distinguishes the best science-fiction it's done in the style of a pulp magazine cover, but it's intriguing and leaves a lot to the imagination.Unfortunately, the movie hits a snag at about the same time Spader does finding a strange animal, he stands in the exact spot that allows him to be caught in the animal's harness and dragged, seemingly for miles, to the next location required by the script. This is a stupid plot device I have no trouble believing in the Stargate, but I can't believe that Spader would suffer no serious injury from being dragged through miles of hot sand.A similarly tacky moment occurs when Spader befriends the chief with a Fifth Avenue bar, an obvious parallel to E.T. (not to mention an obvious bit of product placement). Indeed, the more this movie progresses, the more its patchwork quilt of ideas becomes apparent.When the bad guys finally appear, they come with a bewildering array of hardware that, impressive as it is, seems designed not to evoke ancient Egypt but to facilitate the sale of action figures and plastic play-sets to kids. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence, but even so there's something so irresistibly toy-like about this movie that it's impossible not to think that older children were part of the target audience.For the most part, the special effects and action sequences in this movie are still impressive even after ten years, but what's sorely lacking is a strong human element. This movie loses its way dramatically, according to Leonard Maltin, but it doesn't so much lose its way as it does lack a dramatic hook even from the very beginning.Characterization is a big problem with the exceptions of Spader, Russell, and to a lesser extent French Stewart's sardonic soldier, none of the good guys in this movie have any real personality. Motivation, or rather its absence, is another problem we never understand whether the soldiers volunteered for this mission or whether they were assigned to it, or how they feel about their situation in any case.My favorite scene is the one in which Spader questions Russell about why he came on the mission, and Russell simply says that his son died and he no longer thinks he has any reason to live. I had thought before I watched the scene again recently that Russell went into greater detail about how his son died, but my point is that we at least know how he thinks. Far too many science-fiction movies don't even attempt to explain their characters' motivations just once I'd like to see a movie of this genre that explains why everyone's willing to do what they do.Anyway, like most other Roland Emmerich movies (notably Independence Day) Stargate has a great first act, a progressively conventional second act and a third act that goes overboard on action and special-effects spectacle. Basically the final reel of this movie turns into Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Stargate, with lots of shooting, blasting, exploding, punching and even a little attempted brain-frying thrown in for good measure.Despite its flaws, I actually like this movie better than most Emmerich efforts. It's a B movie like Independence Day, but not nearly as overblown. It's more energetic and imaginative than either Universal Soldier or Godzilla, and it's not nearly as pretentious as The Patriot.I haven't bothered seeing The Day After Tomorrow yet, because at 24 I'm feeling a little too old for the Roland Emmerich world of entertainment. But there are days, particularly when I'm thinking about Stargate, and how much I enjoyed it at age 14, that I wish I wasn't.Rating 6 (I like it, but I can't quite recommend it.)

But there are days, particularly when I'm thinking about Stargate, and how much I enjoyed it at age 14, that I wish I wasn't.Rating 6 (I like it, but I can't quite recommend it.) ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"14 January 2005","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Although it's hardly a good movie, Stargate is yet another one of those movies that I can't completely dislike because I was the appropriate age when I first saw it. With its elaborate special effects and action sequences, ridiculous yet imaginative plot and cheerfully broad characters, this is a movie that speaks to the fourteen-year-old inside all of us. And yes, I was fourteen when I first saw it on the big screen.First of all, this movie is basically a nerd's dream come true, with James Spader playing Daniel Jackson as the quintessential nerd who gets a chance to prove his theories about ancient Egypt when a woman working with the US government enlists his help translating some writing found on a mysterious artifact. Right down to the fact that he leaves his coffee mug perched on a metal pipe as he hurries into a meeting, Spader's performance is pitch-perfect.The whole first act is so good, as we watch Spader at work and the suspense builds toward the opening of the Stargate, that it's almost a shame the movie didn't make better use of the Stargate and give it a bigger payoff. A more profound film might have put the journey into the Stargate at the climax of the story, and the result could have been something like the mind-blowing trip at the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey or the walk into the spaceship at the end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.But this movie has other ideas, so Spader joins Russell and his presumably crack team of soldiers (we never really learn much about them) on a reconnaissance mission through the Stargate to explore whatever lies on the other side.SPOILERS AHEAD! My favorite shot of the movie comes when Spader and Russell walk a distance out into the desert that they find on the other side of the Stargate, then turn around and see that they've just walked out of a pyramid with three alien moons above it. It's the sort of simple yet striking visual that distinguishes the best science-fiction it's done in the style of a pulp magazine cover, but it's intriguing and leaves a lot to the imagination.Unfortunately, the movie hits a snag at about the same time Spader does finding a strange animal, he stands in the exact spot that allows him to be caught in the animal's harness and dragged, seemingly for miles, to the next location required by the script. This is a stupid plot device I have no trouble believing in the Stargate, but I can't believe that Spader would suffer no serious injury from being dragged through miles of hot sand.A similarly tacky moment occurs when Spader befriends the chief with a Fifth Avenue bar, an obvious parallel to E.T. (not to mention an obvious bit of product placement). Indeed, the more this movie progresses, the more its patchwork quilt of ideas becomes apparent.When the bad guys finally appear, they come with a bewildering array of hardware that, impressive as it is, seems designed not to evoke ancient Egypt but to facilitate the sale of action figures and plastic play-sets to kids. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence, but even so there's something so irresistibly toy-like about this movie that it's impossible not to think that older children were part of the target audience.For the most part, the special effects and action sequences in this movie are still impressive even after ten years, but what's sorely lacking is a strong human element. This movie loses its way dramatically, according to Leonard Maltin, but it doesn't so much lose its way as it does lack a dramatic hook even from the very beginning.Characterization is a big problem with the exceptions of Spader, Russell, and to a lesser extent French Stewart's sardonic soldier, none of the good guys in this movie have any real personality. Motivation, or rather its absence, is another problem we never understand whether the soldiers volunteered for this mission or whether they were assigned to it, or how they feel about their situation in any case.My favorite scene is the one in which Spader questions Russell about why he came on the mission, and Russell simply says that his son died and he no longer thinks he has any reason to live. I had thought before I watched the scene again recently that Russell went into greater detail about how his son died, but my point is that we at least know how he thinks. Far too many science-fiction movies don't even attempt to explain their characters' motivations just once I'd like to see a movie of this genre that explains why everyone's willing to do what they do.Anyway, like most other Roland Emmerich movies (notably Independence Day) Stargate has a great first act, a progressively conventional second act and a third act that goes overboard on action and special-effects spectacle. Basically the final reel of this movie turns into Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Stargate, with lots of shooting, blasting, exploding, punching and even a little attempted brain-frying thrown in for good measure.Despite its flaws, I actually like this movie better than most Emmerich efforts. It's a B movie like Independence Day, but not nearly as overblown. It's more energetic and imaginative than either Universal Soldier or Godzilla, and it's not nearly as pretentious as The Patriot.I haven't bothered seeing The Day After Tomorrow yet, because at 24 I'm feeling a little too old for the Roland Emmerich world of entertainment.

To fully appreciate why the characters behave the way they do (for instance, Mary saying goodbye to her baby son Ben, while husband Roger stands by) it is worth watching the film twice. Peter's character also unfolds in a logical way, and his actions become crystal clear as the film progresses. Carol - seemingly a B-list celebrity who thinks she's a legend - turns out to be a multi- layered character, and is certainly one of the most memorable.The only drawback to this rather character-driven film is that sometimes I watch it and think I have obviously missed a scene somewhere. Although I cannot identify with everything the characters have been through, they are all reasonably fleshed out. As the audience gets further into the film, the layers of show and pretence are peeled back like onion skins. The two extra characters are eliminated with reasonable explanations. I can see what makes all of the characters tick - except for Brian. Roger and Mary are a good couple, stressed and yet strengthened by the way they finally deal with their personal tragedy - in fact I feel like the holiday is quite cathartic for them. Carol and Andrew, although a bit showbiz for my liking are obviously moulded and shaped by their Hollywood surroundings - they are clearly used to fulfilling a role on and off camera and somehow I don't feel that the audience for this film sees the ultimate end of their relationship. Sarah, another thespian type (evidently with a colourful past) seems to do some serious thinking about her approach to relationships. Maggie - oh, I do like Maggie! - the rather bookish spinster undergoes a total change before balancing her old self with the new self she has tapped into. Peter, excellently played by Stephen Fry, makes a courteous host, friend and confidante to all, reluctant to burden his friends with a problem far more stunning than anything his friends have been faced with (perhaps Roger and Mary's is on a par?).But I have tried and tried, and watched this film over and over and I still feel as though I have somehow missed a key scene that would help me understand Brian. Where is it, I ask? I still don't get the Greta Garbo joke - I can only surmise that it is a story he finds humour in where nobody else ever could, because the punchline never made it to the final cut. A line from him after upsetting Mary states, It's not like me to put my foot in it - how ironic when he spends the rest of his time in the film spoiling the moment (particularly after the revue group's lovely song by the piano) and upsetting others. So where the others have a bit of backstory - we know who went out with (or slept with) who at university - and can be empathised with, Brian appears one-dimensional. His character as it stands is the only real flaw in the film, his only real purpose is to be cast off by Sarah when Andrew helps her see how wrongly she approaches her relationships.A notable mention also goes to the soundtrack. I only wanted to see this film initially because it featured Tears For Fears' 1985 single Everybody Wants To Rule The World, but this is in no way the only musical highlight. The opening sequence was one I enjoyed very much.

Many of the reviews already posted seem to fault the film for not being more faithful to the TV cartoon. I was already a grown-up when this one came out and had never seen the cartoon, so I took it at face value as a stand-alone film. The decision to set most of the picture on earth (which I'm told was done for budgetary reasons) actually gives MASTERS a nice TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE quality that I find quite appealing. All in all, I think this is the best of the many low-budget STAR WARS imitations that came out in the 80s and a very entertaining drive-in style night at the movies. My own kids love it as much as I do!

Back then i thought it was a decent Sci-fi action movie. Recently i saw it again on DVD (after seeing the horrible train-wreck of a sequel The Chronicles of Riddick) and actually liked it more on the second viewing.A ship containing a mixed group of settlers, traveling businessmen, pilgrims and one dangerous captive (and his captor) crash-land on a deserted planet. The planet is a desert wasteland and the survivors try to survive first the heat and then nasty beings that awake when all the planets' three suns are blocked by a total eclipse.Pitch Black is nothing special really. It doesn't break any new ground and is not very innovative. Rather the strong point of the movie in my opinion is how much they manage to make out of so little. The ingredients are simple. A crashed ship, a bunch of survivors with different skills, a dangerous convict that creates tensions in the group and finally an alien species bent on killing them. And considering how many movies are made with themes like this Pitch Black feels clearly above average. There is suspense, action, crappy one-liners and CGI to go around and it never really becomes boring.Of course there are weak points as well. I have a hard time accepting Vin Diesel who becomes almost like comic relief with his deep voice and flexing muscles. Also the story is nothing to cheer about although i think it does the job.I would recommend Pitch Black as a Friday night entertainment. It's a lightweight and entertaining no-brainer without being overly stupid or weak. But stay away from the sequel however, it's a completely different experience and shares nothing with this movie except the main character. Goes to show that a large budget can never get you farther than a good script. I rate this 6\/10.

Cruise is effective as a hot prospect with too much cojones' and not enough brains, as is Mastrantonio in the role of Cruise's street-smart girlfriend. There are so many memorable scenes and lines from this one that just rattle around in my head years after the last time I've seen it. Excellent and lasting blues score. I used to think this lost focus a little towards the end, now I'm not as sure.

It is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. You will either get it, or you won't, laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is an odd filmmaker (putting that mildly), mixing both innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well, who knows what his intentions were. It is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one.The thing that makes Waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that form the plot of Pink Flamingos. Surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of The Filthiest Person Alive. What makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that Waters creates giddy, self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. The people in his films are completely in tune with one another. For instance, when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because Crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer, Babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her, in a conspiratorial aside, That little shed's just PERFECT... At this point, we do not know yet that Crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while Cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that Waters creates.Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the Marbles' deviant butler. The first time we see them, Waters cuts jarringly from a scene in Connie's cozy office to Channing descending into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very much alive and p***ed off. Susan is not a cowering victim, but is enraged and abusive to Channing, leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. They both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. She does not let up for one second while Channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into the Marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that Divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the Marbles are pandering--here is something Divine is unfamiliar with, a corruption devised by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. Furthermore, while kidnapping does not seem like something Divine would think twice about, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free, relishing the revenge that they take on Channing.At the other end of the filth spectrum, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world. The first time we see Connie, she is belittling a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of Divine's title as the filthiest person alive, revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.Something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially Divine, who doesn't miss a note. Not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given, and it takes Pink Flamingos to a new level or weirdness. People actually believed Divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who made it. Since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.But even more so, Pink Flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now (I say mostly because the a**hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince), I still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming.
