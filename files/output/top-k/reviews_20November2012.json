Its a film about so much more than fly on the wall look at the Porn Industry of the 1970s and the character types that inhabited that world, its a statement about the excesses that permeated the end of one decade and the beginning of another. Mark Wahlberg brings in a confident performance, demonstrating once again, that it can all be about the material that the actor is given. He plays Eddie Adams, a bus boy in the valley of Los Angeles at the club of Luis Guzman who is soon brought to the attention of adult movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in what is probably his best ever performance) and soon turned into super porn star thanks to his considerable talents below the waist. Director Anderson made no secret that the story was partially inspired by the late John Holmes, but here he seems to be represented also by a supporting character, played by a young Thomas Jane.Though initially the journey is that of Eddie into porn star Dirk Diggler, Anderson very capably gives all his supporting characters flesh on their bones and their own stories which endear us to them all. John C Reily, Nicole Ari Parker (Massively underrated actress) Don Cheadle, Melora Waiters (Superb) all bring life to the ensemble of the piece as the rest of the adult stars in Horners circle of friends, all of their characters have flaws and weaknesses, but all of them too seek something beyond the porn industry that they find themselves. Julianne Moore is the mother of the group taking on Dirk and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) as her siblings in place of her estranged son, who her ex husband will not let her have contact with because of her involvement in the industry - She copes with this by consuming vast amounts of drugs and showing her affections on her co-stairs instead. Anderson uses a number of interesting techniques to make dialogue scenes a little more interesting and the film, though long, passes through the 6 decades it covers at a bouncy pace. The production design here must be commended too as its all spot on, and the colours of the film make you feel like you are watching a movie from that era. Anderson manages to blend both the tragic and hilarious moments of very life seamlessly as they often are in reality to great effect here. The fact is the porn industry here is used as the catalyst to study the excesses of the era, but you didn't need to be in the porn industry to be involved them. Although the ending maybe a little unsatisfying, showing you that some characters have moved on while us are much where we found them in the first place, it is true to life and the study of character here is first rate. Every single supporting role has a pitch perfect cast too which include a young Seymour Hoffman, already showing his metal and William H Macy as Little Bill in one of the first roles I remember him in. A recent re-watch of this on DVD encouraged me to leave this review and at first I was thinking 'God this hasn't aged well' but actually yes it has, I just forgot that I was suppose to feel like I was in the 1970s, then I remembered, that is the point.

A classic ghost story revolving around a town's centenary coinciding with the arrival of a ghostly fog. As with the director's previous films the use of music and sound plays an important role in creating tension. After an opening quote courtesy of Edgar Allen Poe, the film begins by taking us to a camp fire beginning with a close up of a ticking pocket watch and an old fisherman telling children by a crackling camp fire a ghost story perfectly setting up the plot and tone of the film. This is in part thanks to Carpenter's self-composed piano score complementing the visuals to create a suspenseful underscore. As the film progresses the verbal rhetoric of the town's priest, reading from his ancestors diary, helps to reveal more and more detail of what happened 100 years previously. This ensures that we stay with the film to find out why the fog has returned to the town. Additionally it serves to fill in a motive for the ghosts lurking in the fog. Although this is not the only sound used to drive the plot as the sound of things breaking and car horns going off in the opening scenes alerts us to something sinister taking place. However the most effective use of sound has to be the monotonous banging of a hook by a spectral figure on numerous characters' front doors, by the ghostly sailors hiding in the fog. The use of this sound effect accompanies a character's slow pace towards the door effectively creating tension; we know they shouldn't open the door but can't stop them. Furthermore the sound of breaking glass and ticking clocks are used perfectly to reinforce the idea that we should expect something bad to happen. The ticking of analogue clocks is also significant because it reinforces a crucial plot point. This is further reinforced by the inclusion of clock like sounds in the films electronic score a clever indicator to the films plot the time at which the leper ship sunk causing the death of the crew at 1200 midnight 100 years previously.Another effect use of sound is the repetition of rhythms using synthesisers a notable scene is the repetition of the same two notes succeeded by a percussion sound. This is used to great effect in that it gives the sense that the fog is moving further and further inland and makes it feel like an unearthly creation of science fiction. Along with this Carpenter's electronic film score is an important authorship device as his electronic often self-composed scores have now become synonymous with him as a director. The Fog may only be regarded as a minor horror classic possibly due to it being the follow up to the seminal Halloween (1978); but that does not stop it from effectively using a combination of sound effects and sinister theme music to aid the visuals in creating suspense. The sound of hooks banging on a door alone is enough to make you think twice before you answer the door.

As with other Bond films of the era the film is subject to debates surrounding gender and the representation of women. The film is very male dominated in that most of the central figures are male. The film supports the idea that women are passive sex objects with the opening credits sequence. This is demonstrated with lingering shots of a belly dancer's legs and stomach. This implies that the titles are designed to satisfy the male audience the film is ultimately aimed at. This is further reinforced later on in the film during a scene at a gypsy camp. Furthermore the idea gender representation is further reinforced by Bond's first meeting with obligatory Bond girl Tatiana Romanova. This scene sees Bond enter his room to find her lay in his bed further alluding to the idea that women are there for the satisfaction of men. However a medium shot of Bond's naked upper body subverts this by demonstrating a female gaze as well as a male gaze. Along with this it is true that many of the male figures have major roles but this is view is opposed with the character of Colonel Rosa Klebb. Therefore subverting the traditional view of woman championed by Feminists like Mulvey. That being that she is the main villain and has a high rank in not only the Russian army but also as Number 3 in SPECTRE. However the fact the role of the villain is associated with men is implied by the masculinity of Klebb a woman the complete opposite of Romanova. Romanova is the classic example of what a woman was expected to look like and is referred to by Bond as one of the most beautiful girls he's ever seen. The films two primary female characters are complete juxtapositions in that Romanova is attractive and yet really passive, she just lets herself be hit by Bond later in the film whilst he's trying to get information from her. However villain Klebb is a stronger woman but has sacrificed her looks and femininity. A way of interpreting this could be that women can try to better their lives or remain passive and stay beautiful. Whilst Romanova is portrayed as falling madly in Love with Bond and told to obey him, the character, to the audience feels as though she is just being almost pulled through the film. This is further highlighted by how she is manipulated into unknowingly deceiving Bond. The film's main focus is on its central character of Bond and the traditional film hero is often male. The male characters are either or both physically and mentally strong an example being the iconic fight onboard the Orient Express.Although the film contains the traditional representations of gender it's still one of the best films of the series and a great Cold War Thriller.

As with other Bond films of the era the film is subject to debates surrounding gender and the representation of women. The film is very male dominated in that most of the central figures are male. The film supports the idea that women are passive sex objects with the opening credits sequence. This is demonstrated with lingering shots of a belly dancer's legs and stomach. This implies that the titles are designed to satisfy the male audience the film is ultimately aimed at. This is further reinforced later on in the film during a scene at a gypsy camp. Furthermore the idea gender representation is further reinforced by Bond's first meeting with obligatory Bond girl Tatiana Romanova. This scene sees Bond enter his room to find her lay in his bed further alluding to the idea that women are there for the satisfaction of men. However a medium shot of Bond's naked upper body subverts this by demonstrating a female gaze as well as a male gaze. Along with this it is true that many of the male figures have major roles but this is view is opposed with the character of Colonel Rosa Klebb. Therefore subverting the traditional view of woman championed by Feminists like Mulvey. That being that she is the main villain and has a high rank in not only the Russian army but also as Number 3 in SPECTRE. However the fact the role of the villain is associated with men is implied by the masculinity of Klebb a woman the complete opposite of Romanova. Romanova is the classic example of what a woman was expected to look like and is referred to by Bond as one of the most beautiful girls he's ever seen. The films two primary female characters are complete juxtapositions in that Romanova is attractive and yet really passive, she just lets herself be hit by Bond later in the film whilst he's trying to get information from her. However villain Klebb is a stronger woman but has sacrificed her looks and femininity. A way of interpreting this could be that women can try to better their lives or remain passive and stay beautiful. Whilst Romanova is portrayed as falling madly in Love with Bond and told to obey him, the character, to the audience feels as though she is just being almost pulled through the film. This is further highlighted by how she is manipulated into unknowingly deceiving Bond. The film's main focus is on its central character of Bond and the traditional film hero is often male. The male characters are either or both physically and mentally strong an example being the iconic fight onboard the Orient Express.Although the film contains the traditional representations of gender it's still one of the best films of the series and a great Cold War Thriller.

Force of Evil, based on the novel, Tucker's People is directed by Abraham Polonsky in his directing debut. Sadly, Polonsky would be blacklist in the 1950's Red Scare and rarely made any more films. The film tells the story of a lawyer, Joe Morse (Garfield), working for a powerful gangster, Tucker, who wishes to consolidate and control the number racket in New York when everybody around him wants to quit it before it gets violent. Joe Morse to be the very best, has to step on a few familiar faces to take control. One of which is a smaller number racket by Morse's older brother Leo Morse. He's willing to snitch on his friends and family if it takes him to the top. The movie is full of messages about the different between good and bad, and also have frequent biblical allusions ranging from Abel & Cain, Juda's betrayal and stigmata. It's a great poetic, literary speech that Abraham Polonsky & Ira Wolfert wrote in Force of Evil. The dialogue is rich and ornate that it resembles a modern urban verse play.The lines are catchy. Most of the speeches is lush, incantatory in its repetitive rhythms, and plays like a soliloquy. He wrote with a fatalistic moral vision, a view of a world filled with kaleidoscopically complex nuances & ironies. The story arc is almost allegorical, interpretation keeps intruding on the tougher elements of the plot. This factor adds no distinction and only makes the going tougher. Garfield, as to be expected, comes through with a performance that gets everything out of the material furnished. Unburdening himself of conflicted feelings about his own corruption, Joe Morse plays a syndicate lawyer, but secretly brutal. With each bad intention, he intellectual reexamining the premises of his life more and more. A great film noir that uses the numbers racket as a metaphor for the pervasive corruption in life. Polonsky makes elaborate form of dialogue that plays in a way, that it's sounds like confessional meditation on morality. What's great in Force of Evil is just the fact that not all gangsters talk like a thug. Also to note in this terse, melodramatic thriller is the realist location photography. The New York locale shots give authenticity. Great use of shadows, and classical music. Check it out if a huge fan of film noir. It's one of the better ones.

Her interview that is part of the presentation is wonderfully charming, deeply insightful, simply humble, funny, and utterly perfect. What she offers is an invaluable contribution to the motion picture audience. Criterion has made Watson's work so clear it will leave you breathless, literally fighting to catch a mere gulp of oxygen. Whether one cares for this film or not, the fact is that Emily Watson gives a historic performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come, as long as there is cinema. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so stunned, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time.

Since any of his friends may be anxious to see Jackson killed, just to shut him up, Jackson demands that an outside negotiator be called in. The stranger is Kevin Spacey.Jackson and Spacey, together with help from the skills and knowledge of the several hostages, discover the heavies and all is resolved, but not before tear gas, stun grenades, bullets, bloodshed, and the destruction of several items of office furniture that probably came from WalMart and are more easily replaced than the corpses.It's really a tough film and it's filled with suspense. There are holes in the plot or, at any rate, questionable developments that are left unexplained. Two stone-faced FBI agents take over the situation, straight out of Dog Day Afternoon, although it was unclear to me exactly what their jurisdiction is. Moreover, they call for an immediate breach of the hostage space, when, in fact, the FBI has a highly skilled division of negotiators.It's filled with electrifying moments but it's a rather dumb movie too.

The cutting is instantaneous. There are flashes of flaring automatic weapons; instead of a startling stun grenade there are half a dozen. The room is demolished by plunging bodies.And, at the climax, when the principal heavy is on the lawn, wounded and surrounded by a horde of now wised-up cops, Jackson is allowed to pick up a pistol, walk in slow motion to the downed and grimacing villain, raise the pistol, point it at his head, he finally turns the weapon over to the Chief of Police without firing it. All this is in very slow motion, designed to draw out the suspenseful scene and keep the audience breathless. But how stupid do they think the audience is? Everyone knows that Jackson, a decent man who has been framed, is not going to pull the trigger now.If the director wants to manipulate us, okay.

If this makes Eugene sound a bit sick or at least majorly weird, it gives him various characteristics and confirms his heterosexuality.The semi-autobiographical series of plays by Neil Simon seem stagy to some, but in an era of blockbusters, Hamlet on screen with Laurence Olivier would be stagy! Silverman's Eugene is surrounded by a wonderfully eccentric Jewish family, much like Woody Allen's clan in Radio Days, just miles away at Far Rockaway. The wonderful Blythe Danner allows her beautiful face to be dowdied as the hard working mother with a hidden bitterness towards her sister, Bob Dishy as the quietly understanding father whom everybody goes to for sage advice; Stacey Glick as the precocious sister (watch Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt and see if you don't see a similarity with that family's youngest daughter, Anne) and Brian Drillinger is the troubled older brother who is faced with humiliation for standing up to his tyrannical boss. Ivey, one of the gems of stage, screen and television, totally reminds me of the lovable Dianne Wiest's character in Radio Days with her ever optimistic attitude that never fades even though romances come and go. Dishy, who played a couple of eccentric characters on Golden Girls (Mr. Terrific, for example) is totally recognizable, but the usually sophisticated Danner (Will Truman's mother on Will and Grace, DeNiro's wife in Meet the Parents, etc.) bravely lets herself go, and gives a performance of massive strength and understatement.While Radio Days took place throughout World War II, this is set in the late 1930's, with mentions of Europe at War on the radio that Dishy demands that nobody touch. This is more of a linear plot line than Woody Allen's sketchy but hysterically funny film. The sweetness and less in your face crudeness of today's films helps make this stand out in a nostalgic yet not cloying manner of We had a better life than you do today way that some film makers remind us of. Ivey and Danner would ironically be reunited 15 years later for the first Broadway revival of Follies. Teenagers and adolescents of the 30's and 40's in my opinion did have it better, with the Masked Avenger Ring and Jitterbugging a great predecessor to today's I-Pads, Cellphones and Crap Music.

Ivey, one of the gems of stage, screen and television, totally reminds me of the lovable Dianne Wiest's character in Radio Days with her ever optimistic attitude that never fades even though romances come and go. Dishy, who played a couple of eccentric characters on Golden Girls (Mr. Terrific, for example) is totally recognizable, but the usually sophisticated Danner (Will Truman's mother on Will and Grace, DeNiro's wife in Meet the Parents, etc.) bravely lets herself go, and gives a performance of massive strength and understatement.While Radio Days took place throughout World War II, this is set in the late 1930's, with mentions of Europe at War on the radio that Dishy demands that nobody touch. This is more of a linear plot line than Woody Allen's sketchy but hysterically funny film. The sweetness and less in your face crudeness of today's films helps make this stand out in a nostalgic yet not cloying manner of We had a better life than you do today way that some film makers remind us of. Ivey and Danner would ironically be reunited 15 years later for the first Broadway revival of Follies.

It was the biggest disappointment since IT you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book.This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks.Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

I recently downloaded a copy of the film for my sister and she thoroughly enjoyed. She actually enjoyed it so much, she watched in 3 times in the next week! She told me it was a great film and I began to watch it. I must admit, at first the film seemed a little weird but very soon the film introduces you to Kalvin, Reg and Murph and the bully leader Ox. That was one particular strength for the film. Also, when the coach gives Kalvin the tickets, you can start to connect with the character and understand what his life as an orphan must be like. The film got my attention and I began to enjoy it. It had, to be fair, not many laughs but the story was good, closely resembling the story 'Holes' in many ways. Tracy Renalds was a brilliant addition to the film and he really connected well with Kalvin. This was, in my opinion, the biggest strength of this film. Brenda Song does a great job as playing Reg. I'm a big fan of 'Suite Life of Zack and Cody' where she does an amazing job and I thought her performance was great in this film. Bow Wow did a very good job in the film. Overall, definitely ignore IMDb on this circumstance and watch this film. However, note that this film is not for all ages and its mainly for little children but I myself being a 16 year old liked it.

The plot revolves around Pryce's attempts to correct an administrative error and find quite literally the girl of his dreams. Although Brazil can be and is often tagged as a black comedy this only serves to deceive us from the ideological messages at play. First of all the film acknowledges probably the greatest threat to 1980s Britain the IRA's bombing campaign in retaliation to Bloody Sunday in 1972. Brazil was released 13 years after and is referenced by a character in a news report The bombing Campaign is now in its thirteenth year. This can be directly perceived as a nod to the real life terrorist attacks. However an ideology is presented through the ideological state apparatus of television by the senior authority figure of Mr. Helpmann trying down play the terrorist attacks as nothing more than bad sportsmanship. Therefore implying that television is a means for which the public can be deceived by those in power; the media makes people powerful, implying that politicians and authority figures lie to you. However the greatest influence on the films plot has to be the ideologies taken from Orwell's 1984. That is the idea of a nightmare future where no one is free and everything revolves around administration and paperwork. The way the numerous administration departments rely on unreliable machines which are a cross between typewriters and computers could be perceived as warning not to over rely on technology.However the film effectively tries to subvert the ideology of everyone following strict rules through its primary protagonist, Sam Lowry. This is conveyed to the audience through his spontaneous dreams where Lowry can escape the monotony of the system and life's difficulties, he dreams of his ideal existence and girl of his dreams. Possibly creating a sense of hegemony for Lowry where there is more to life than record keeping and information storage. This plays on the belief that our mind is separate from our body following a duellist belief, opposing Helpmann's reference to 'the ghost in the machine'.The verbal rhetoric is arguably the greatest asset in voicing the film's ideologies. A particular example being an engraving on a statue The Truth shall make you free as well as the repeating of the phrase where all in this together further enforcing the notion that the future will be administrative nightmare where everyone is oppressed. However once you realise this you can try to escape it linking back to how people in the film are deceived into living a certain way, they do nothing to change because they are duped into believing that their existence is perfect.Brazil may be overlong but presents some very strong ideologies courtesy of George Orwell's 1984; the look of the film being heavily influenced by 1940s perceptions of what the 1980s would be like. Gillian gives us an effective film which presents an apparently efficient but bleak vision of the future. The audience ultimately presented with the ideology that they should be radical and break away from conformity despite the consequences.
