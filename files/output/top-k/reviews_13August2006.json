[{"date":"13 August 2006","score":"","review":" Computer animation was a novelty by the summer of 2001. Pixar films were breaking records left and right. Disney's traditionally animated features after Tarzan (1999) were turning disappointing box office returns and mixed critical reviews. Other studios like Warner Bros. were out. DreamWorks had scored a good amount of hits prior to Shrek. Shrek was their first computer animated film since the critically praised Antz, and it was a film that was remarkable.Being a huge Disney (and Pixar) fanatic, I think it's nice to see competition. Disney can't always rule the roost. That would be like saying Spielberg should rule the roost at Hollywood, or anyone else. Despite a very troubled production history and the fear that it would be a bust, Shrek is an animated classic.At heart, Shrek is a comedic spoof of Disney's adaptations of fairy tales, and it does it well. But, Shrek has a strong story and great characters. It was a very competent film for its time (And more competent than any other DreamWorks animated film today) and it was an alternative to Disney and Pixar. Unfortunately, I feel that Shrek can't match the sheer genius of the Pixar films. But it outdoes some of the modern Disney animation efforts.But enough of the Disney comparisons, even though its highly inevitable. The title character is a funny and also grumpy character. He hates being disturbed, especially by mobs. The worst happens when he's accompanied by Donkey. Donkey, being an obnoxious character, is the perfect companion for the grumpy ogre. The duo work perfectly.Pretty soon, they are sent on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona from the villainous Lord Farquaad. Farquaad was a great villain, who was funny and menacing at the same time. He was basically a little guy with a complex. He was perfect. Aside from the main characters was a hilarious supporting cast. Gingy, the Mirror, the Dragon and the other fairy tales characters were all likable. No uninteresting characters or anything.The use of songs worked quite fine, and it strengthened the romance between Shrek and Fiona in the second act of the film. The idea of Fiona secretly turning into an ogre at night was also a great subplot, as it is implied throughout the film until we actually see it. The action scenes were great, from the castle scene to the final battle, Shrek delivers in that department.The animation was also very good, and stylized. It still looks fine today. There's a great attention to detail in this film. While the Pixar films have stylized humans (Nothing wrong with that), Shrek shows humans that look more realistic. But they don't look better than Pixar's humans, as Pixar does caricature with their human characters.As an animated feature, Shrek succeeds. It's funny and heartfelt at the same time. Some minor flaws are the use of pop culture jokes, but they are mostly subtle. Sometimes the film gets a little ahead of itself, but that's only a minor issue I had with the film. Otherwise, it was a fine animated film that was very competent and tried to get more adults into animation. Unfortunately, DreamWorks basically gets cocky about animation because this film was what really launched them in the animation industry. Aside from all of that, Shrek will still be an animated classic.A 9.5 out of 10. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 August 2006","score":"","review":" Computer animation was a novelty by the summer of 2001.

If that had been the case, perhaps things would have turned out better. Instead we have three different timelines of L'Merchant placed in a 90 minute movie and I feel you can see lots of things left out. The whole film feels uneven and I never could shake the idea that post-production killed an interesting premise. The first timeline shows Phillip L'Merchant creating the puzzlebox for demented magician Duc de L'Isle(Mickey Cottrell)and his pupil Jacques(Adam Scott)who wish to summon a demon for their pleasure and servitude. Angelique(Valentina Vargas)is a prostitute who is selected for such a purpose and once she is killed, her soul is resurrected but this time it's in demonic form. I'm guessing Jacques and Angelique decided they didn't need L'Isle because when Phillip wishes to destroy the puzzlebox he finds the magician almost dead and badly beaten. He is attacked by Jacques when Angelique gets his attention and almost dead when he informs his wife to flee with their unborn child. This first story is badly underdeveloped and that might be due to cutting it into a 90 minute film. This story suffers, but the second film had much potential. This time, the setting is modern day New York and John Merchant has become quite a famous artiste extraordinaire. His design for a high-rise has a sculpted puzzlebox artform. Angelique wishes to dump Jacques and kills him when he breaks some sort of demonic rule or code(this doesn't get proper explanation). She awakens Pinhead from his puzzlebox layer thanks to a doorman who thinks he's about to get the greatest lay of his life. Instead Angelique suckers him into opening the gateway and releasing Pinhead and his demon dog upon the earth. Pinhead stays within a hidden room in the highrise for he desires for Merchant to open a much larger puzzlebox from a design in the building(this whole angle makes little sense and has some sort of connectional link with a computer). John's wife is played by Kim Myers of A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 fame and looks great if I might say so. Anyway, John's son is used by Pinhead as bait to open the large puzzlebox gateway in the high-rise. While this scheme is being concocted, Pinhead has a little fun with twin security guards having them crushed together. Unfortunate for Pinhead, John's wife has courage and opens the smaller puzzlebox while the inventor programs his computer to overload the larger design model to explode. The smaller puzzlebox pulls Pinhead and Angelique back inside(along with the demon dog..Myers fought them all bravely), but not before our star demon of pain killed John via beheading by chain. In the third story, Dr. Paul Merchant(who also serves as narrator to a group of soldiers assigned for some reason to bring him back to Earth)has designed an elaborate space station and brought Pinhead, Angelique, the demon dog, and the twins(now some sort of conjoined monster)out from within their small puzzlebox. The soldiers assigned to bring Paul back to Earth search the spacestation and become victims of pain thanks to Pinhead and his posse. For some reason, Paul is considered a threat to Earth so the soldiers check throughout to see why he is in space. Paul has told them why he has created this vessel and his goals to finally put an end to Pinhead forever, but this final act feels severely cut and one might wonder where Angelique and the twin monsters vanish to after they kill some soldiers. Pinhead has no idea that Paul has designed the spacestation as a uniquely created puzzlebox in the design of L'Merchant to destroy him. This whole film seems like one crudely pieced together exercise. It's incredibly nice to look at and Pinhead has much more screen time than in the next few films that will be made. He gets supplied plenty of eloquent phrases describing the pain he shall cause. He declares to some victims..I..am..pain! I particularly like the final sequence when he realizes he has been defeated and finishes the film with his final word..Amen. The film really seems to have much potential if it had been a series of films as perhaps planned by Kevin Yagher. There so many problems with the story of Pinhead and Angelique I don't know where to begin. Does Yagher abandon the third film's ending. How come the puzzlebox is in this pillar of the building and how does she know it is there(in modern day New York)? How does she even know about Pinhead and vice versa? Perhaps much back story is missing because of bad editing. What has been left on the cutting room floor? That perhaps in the ultimate question. Too much of meat is missing and all we have in this film is leftovers. It isn't all bad for like I said above..we do get to see the ominous Pinhead much more, but the what ifs of what a trilogy of stronger, more beefed up stories containing Pinhead & Angelique does have me ponder what might've been.

The script is pretty slow going even at the best of times & tries to return to the days where horror relied on good storytelling instead of relying on special effects, violence & bad language. It moves along at a sedate pace but the character's are decent & it's sort of involving, it manages to draw the viewer in quite well & all the careful build up helps the effective twist ending. A lot has been said about the twist & I for one think it works extremely well although there simply is no denying that it's more or less exactly the same as The Sixth Sense (1999) which was made at least two years prior to The Others. I'm in two minds over The Others, I liked it for what it was but it was slow going & sometimes I found it hard to maintain my interest in it & the effectiveness of the entire film depends upon it's ending which is great if you haven't seen The Sixth Sense but if you have I'd imagine you'd feel a little de ja vu & not be too impressed. There are a few holes in the plot & logic but nothing too detrimental.Director Amenabar does a fantastic job of giving the film a creepy look & atmosphere, the colours & the the use of light & shadow are excellent. There are some nice shots & some eerie scenes although on the negative side it's a bit lifeless & bland at times. The 40's period setting suits the film perfectly & it's superbly realised throughout. There's no gore or violence & I can't remember any rubbish CGI computer effects (yeah!).With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 The Others is well made & has nice period production design, it shows that a lot of time went into the look of the film. While watching The Others I realised that because of the types of films that I like (horror, exploitation, low budget, sci-fi, etc.) I haven't actually seen a Nicole Kidman film before now. I was impressed & I thought she was great, she's very pretty & very good in this. Her ex Tom Cruise was an executive producer on The Others, presumably before they split. Everyone else does a fine job including ex Doctor Who (2005) Christopher Eccleston.The Others is a good solid ghost story that I found watchable & effective, unfortunately it's a bit on the slow side & the ending really isn't as original or groundbreaking as it could have been although it's still highly effective.

There are a few holes in the plot & logic but nothing too detrimental.Director Amenabar does a fantastic job of giving the film a creepy look & atmosphere, the colours & the the use of light & shadow are excellent. There are some nice shots & some eerie scenes although on the negative side it's a bit lifeless & bland at times. The 40's period setting suits the film perfectly & it's superbly realised throughout. There's no gore or violence & I can't remember any rubbish CGI computer effects (yeah!).With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 The Others is well made & has nice period production design, it shows that a lot of time went into the look of the film. While watching The Others I realised that because of the types of films that I like (horror, exploitation, low budget, sci-fi, etc.) I haven't actually seen a Nicole Kidman film before now. I was impressed & I thought she was great, she's very pretty & very good in this. Her ex Tom Cruise was an executive producer on The Others, presumably before they split. Everyone else does a fine job including ex Doctor Who (2005) Christopher Eccleston.The Others is a good solid ghost story that I found watchable & effective, unfortunately it's a bit on the slow side & the ending really isn't as original or groundbreaking as it could have been although it's still highly effective. Well worth a watch but I doubt many would want to see it more than once so perhaps wait for it to turn up on TV or cable.
