[{"date":"12 July 2011","score":"","review":" Take your pick. Now, decades ago there was a film--Rocco And His Bros.--about a poor kid who gets into boxing, where he succeeds, until he meets a prostitute, which brings the ruin of both. Yet nobody called that an anti--prostitution film. It was simply a sad story just like the one here. Now, I understand that some viewers have the notion that everything in life got to be black or white, so they have problems accepting that things are far more complex than that. People just don't say one day, in a whim OK, I'll start doing drugs now but such a thing is usually the fruit of serious personal problems and hang ups&#x97;usually born of parental abandonment, mental illness, poverty, etc--and not the result of some lucid decision by anyone. So let's be clear These three youths were already screwed up when RFAD started. They had no interests in life, no social interactions, even if their projects may have given them an aura of normality--to open a shop for ex. These are deranged individuals, so this is in no way a message for you, normal people, but for others, which don't even give a hoot for this flick anyway.That doesn't mean there isn't such a message; but we aren't here to judge intentions, only artworks. Another ex. Don Quixote was voted time ago the greatest literary work in History, as a masterful metaphor of the eternal struggle in the soul of man between his idealistic & materialistic sides. But what Cervantes intended when writing it was very different; he just wanted to vent against the pulp fiction of his era, the XVII Century Harry Potters, which he judged stupid, so he wrote a satire about it. Aranofsky may have made us an anti-drug flick here but who cares?. We must judge this as a work of art and there's where the problems start, at least for me. First, the cinematography I understand this is cinema art so I won't vent much against camera angles, fade outs, FF, Slow Motions, Close Ups, or about the omnipresent jump cuts and so on but I'll say that after a while they become annoying, at least for a non-artsy like me. Someone here mentions a return to the Soviet cinema of the 1920s and I agree; so much so that when the leads were being tortured, all at the same time, I feared to see somewhere a stroller running down some stairs. But the acting is great, especially from Burstyn, and the musical score a gem. As for the pacing, editing, directing, setting, I have only four, non-judgemental, words too artsy for me.But the main flaw of RFAD is that its characters are uninteresting. They have no depth, no complexity. They are just cartoons, stereotypes, and for that they are not memorable. And yet, it would have been so easy to give them an identity. (See how much mileage Kubrick got out of his Alex by making him a Beethoven fan.) Imagine for ex. Harry as a Sartre devote, carrying with him at all times L'Etre Et Le Néant. That at least would have given philosophical roots to his addiction. Or if Marion had been sexually molested by her dad when a child. That kind of background detail makes wonders for a character. Instead, all we got have is people who like drugs. The only one who explains herself is Sara, in the best RFAD scene she feels lonely.So, a flick good enough to keep me interested but not enough to entertain me or give me food for thought, i.e. a 6\/10.

But hey, if you are one of those rare cases that missed out on this movie due to some unforeseeable twist of fate, then by all means, please read on.Translated and re-scripted into English, this is a re-make of the Italian film Profumo Di Donna (1974), or Scent of a Woman. Little can be said about the original Italian movie, except that it served as an inspiration for producing one of the greatest movies Hollywood has ever made. In its entirety, the film is a character study of two very different individuals with just one similarity; the virtue of integrity. Having lost his sight during the service, retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is resented by his family due to his profane outspokenness and tongue in cheek sarcasm, amplified by his total disregard for other people's pity. While his family prepares for an out of town Thanksgiving holiday trip, prep school student Charlie Simms answers an advertisement to look after Slade till the latter's family returns. Within minutes of meeting Slade, Charlie is flustered and insulted. As a scholarship hopeful for Harvard, Charlie needs the extra money for his Christmas holidays and reluctantly agrees to babysit Slade. Unknown to Charlie, Slade has other plans, including a first class trip to New York. Arriving in the Big Apple, both men confront each other, where Charlie faces a disciplinary procedure that threatens his collage scholarship, while Slade has a few wishes to fulfill before blowing his brains out. By the end of this review, I will have justified why Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors of all time. For now, let's leave that last statement out of the equation. Out of the staggering eight times Al Pacino has been nominated for an Academy Award, this is the first and only time he has won an Oscar for his leading role as the unbelievably difficult Colonel Slade. This in itself is an indication of Pacino's powerhouse performance in this movie. With absolutely no doubt in my mind, I can confidently say that there isn't any other actor alive today, who could have played Slade like the way Pacino did. To me it doesn't matter if Pacino receives another Academy Award, because if there ever was an actor born to play a particulate role, then there can be no greater example that this. Pacino's greatest achievement in this film is making the audience like his character despite his utter loathsomeness. There is so much depth to his character, yet you can't take your eyes off him because you don't want to miss a second of what he will do or say next. Speaking of which, Al Pacino has to be the single most dialogue savvy actor there is or ever has been. I am not sure if his one-liners are specially written for him or whether he improvises on the script, but some of the greatest lines by an actor has been uttered by this man. If not only for his acting prowess, his one-liners will be his final legacy to the world of motion pictures. Then there are the facial expressions. Besides his excellence in portraying a blind man, Pacino's Slade really comes to life when describing the beauty of a woman; her essence in creation and her distinct perfume. Ooh Ha! In this regard, one of the highpoints of the film is Al Pacino's tango with Gabrielle Anwar; Poignant, everlasting, and with his facial expressions, poetry in motion. Incidentally, Anwar's recognition into mainstream cinema follows this short but memorable tango with Pacino. Another actor who credits this movie as his call to fame is Chris O'Donnell. As the young Charlie Simms, this is O'Donnell in his defining moment as an upcoming actor. Evidently, there is a lot of work put in attempting to measure up to Pacino's on screen presence. Even so, O'Donnell holds his ground and is perfectly cast opposite Pacino. Together, they make a great team, and by the end of the movie, they are almost father-son like. Two other standouts are Philip Seymour Hoffman as Charlie's two-faced friend and James Rebhorn as the headmaster they pull a prank on. While the latter is great as the pompous headmaster, Hoffman is excellent as a rich kid and Charlie's seemingly caring friend.Also nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Director and Best Picture), this is Martin Brest in easily his best directorial feature ever. There isn't a single loose or drab moment in the film's two and half hours of run time. Overall, this is an excellent film with no perceivable flaws. Brest maintains relevance to the plot on hand without giving in to the temptation of speculating Slade's days in the army or what makes him a bitter person. However, Brest's real success is in bringing out messages of courage and integrity as perceived by two very opposite individuals. By the end of the film, Brest's message is loud and clear, irrespective of Charlie's and Slade's perceptions. If you haven't seen this movie, or if you are not a movie person, you have missed out on one of the greatest moments in cinema history. However, it is never too late to treat yourself to one of the greatest movies ever made. Mark this down as a must see.

He spent most of the 1958 picture The Defiant Ones shackled to Tony Curtis, challenging movie goer perceptions of black\/white antagonism in a man to man relationship further compounded by their role as escaped convicts. My personal favorite is 1967's In The Heat of the Night, where his character Virgil Tibbs returns a slap to the face of a bigoted white man, demonstrating what he proclaims to his father in THIS film - I think of myself as a man.Some reviewers decry the fact that Poitier wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here, citing an aggrieved sense of injustice based on racial grounds, but I don't know if I'm buying that. He actually WAS nominated for a Best Actor with co-star Curtis for The Defiant Ones nine years earlier, a film in which he had over the title billing in his first lead role. Then again, Cecil Kellaway was a Supporting Actor nominee here with less screen time and less importance to the film, so who can say. You just can't figure sometimes.For those who find the film dated, as many reviewers on this board have, I would like to offer that lemon a chance to make some lemonade. As a time capsule reminder of where we've come from as a society, it's interesting to note that Joanna (Katherine Houghton) uses the term 'Negro' and 'colored' to describe her fiancée, and those descriptions come up elsewhere in the story. It's only Monsignor Ryan (Kellaway) who refers to 'blacks' as a race. Interesting to note, as his character was a Catholic priest who had the most enlightened approach to racial relations of all the 'older' characters, including Dr. Prentice's parents. While the Drayton's and Prentice's were examining their own racial attitudes, the Monsignor had already leaped that hurdle, never batting an eye when first introduced to Dr. Prentice.But like a number of reviewers, I do have some issue with the character of Joanna Drayton. Her character was written with so much goodness and light that she came across as fairly one-dimensional, and a definite lightweight compared to her fiancé's accomplishments. This was probably the main thing that distracted from my enjoyment of the picture, as Joanna could be counted on to present a happy face to everything, even though her situation presented profound obstacles to struggle through and overcome. Even if love conquers all, the challenges could have been more pronounced to make the effort more worthwhile.What's undeniably true is Spencer Tracy's observation to the Monsignor on the state of black and white relations from the standpoint of the picture's original release date. While bemoaning the fact that his daughter marrying a black man would have no impact on the attitudes of millions of people at the time, he was also prophetic in stating that it might take 'fifty or a hundred' years to reach that point of acceptance in society. Well it's almost fifty years, and a lot of the stigma presented in the film has been dealt with and overcome. On that basis, the film did knock down some barriers on the way to racial harmony, even if the country has experienced some bumps in the road along the way.

While bemoaning the fact that his daughter marrying a black man would have no impact on the attitudes of millions of people at the time, he was also prophetic in stating that it might take 'fifty or a hundred' years to reach that point of acceptance in society. Well it's almost fifty years, and a lot of the stigma presented in the film has been dealt with and overcome. On that basis, the film did knock down some barriers on the way to racial harmony, even if the country has experienced some bumps in the road along the way.

They are destined to fight and decapitate each other until only one is left, and the last remaining immortal will get the prize of supreme power and knowledge!

Five years later, he was found by Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, a fellow immortal, and finally learned the truth about himself and the destiny of his kind. Soon after that, Ramirez was killed in a sword fight by the Kurgan, an evil immortal who is determined to be the one to get the prize!

I wasn't sure how the movie would turn out when I saw the beginning with the wrestling match, but we then see the first flashback to MacLeod's days in the Highlands, which is a memorable one. After that, the sword fight in the parking garage is a pretty good action sequence, and it is followed by another good Highlands flashback. When the police find MacLeod (or Nash) and take him in for questioning, I was not impressed with how over-the-top the Garfield character turned out to be, and there's some pretty juvenile dialogue between him and Nash during the questioning. I also didn't care for Roxanne Hart's performance as Brenda Wyatt at first. However, none of this lasts, and we see lots of action and suspense as we see the immortals battle, both in 1985 and centuries earlier. Sean Connery plays Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, and although this isn't a huge part he plays, it's constantly entertaining as the character teaches MacLeod about immortals and how to fight his rivals. This original Highlander is also a visual treat with its cinematography, special effects, beautiful Highland scenery, etc. With all these merits plus the Queen songs (if you're a fan of that band), I would say this cult film is a really good choice for fans of the action\/fantasy genre.

The first hint we get of this is when Stevie starts getting bad vibes. When Sonny argues with him that the crime is already underway, but Stevie leaves the scene, you realize then that these three guys are complete amateurs.What sets this movie apart from other heist movies is that it really isn't about the robbery, it's about the characters, mainly Sonny and Sal. Sonny is presented as a complex person. He can be kind-hearted, on the one hand, worrying about whether his hostages are hungry for example, but on the other hand he can explode in anger. His reason for the robbery was to fund a sex change operation for his homosexual lover. And, oh, Sonny is also married with children. Getting to know Sal is a different matter. Cazale plays him as a withdrawn loner who could easily kill without remorse. The FBI quickly sizes up the situation, tagging Sonny as someone they could probably deal with, but recognizing Sal as a true menace. Absent Sal this movie could almost be seen as a satiric comedy; with Sal, a dark cloud hangs over the proceedings.The movie offers some searing commentary on the media and its effect on behavior.

The lodger, of whom, takes minimal belongings for such a hike and whose reply to such an accusation is dry and understated, as if something were brewing in his mind and he were never going to return to here. Away from the more congregated goodbyes sits a young girl inside of an establishment, she shares an exchange with her father which is granted a more personalised and lower-key sense, during which she is established to be quite the one for having her own voice; rather sharp on the accounting side of things and takes a stance on an issue to do with the purchasing of ponies before stating such a standpoint in a concise manner.The young girl is a certain Mattie, played extraordinarily by Kim Darby; a character whose role it is to waltz into the male dominated patriarchy of the western genre and upset the balance as this young; seemingly frail, but ultimately female, presence putting her foot down. The crux of authenticity in Darby's quite stunning performance runs in tandem with that of her character's predicament; within the film, she is somebody whom must confront and often stand up to certain individuals of a hardened and established ilk, before often coming to have to dominate proceedings in their presence. This is something in lieu of Darby's own predicament, that of having to match up to that of a figure of John Wayne's stature in this, a Western, and have to match him within the frame as well as the universe of the film.In short, Henry Hathaway's bare boned 1969 western is a near faultless masterpiece; an exciting, unpredictable and more than substantial film balancing several acts at once as it breathlessly tells a tale that is difficult to find anything less than thoroughly absorbing. The film is directed with distinct aplomb; make no mistake, his film is unafraid to place children on the front-line and in the firing line of a west we very much sense is wild. It is a west that sees animals get caught up, and often killed, in the ensuing chaos; a west that sees an array of lowlifes all intermingling with one another and the elements, those of whose actions and motivations we can never take for granted and of which are told amidst a background of brutality lending a great air of ambiguity to proceedings as we wonder if anybody is entirely safe.The catalyst for proceedings is in the tragedy that is Frank's death; shot and killed by his accomplice lodger whilst trying to help him in the aftermath of a poker game. In reaction to this, Mattie journeys to the town in which he was killed so as to hire a Marshall to find the man and garner some justice; her witnessing of several other criminals guilty for similar crimes publicly hung allowing her exposure to what awaits such justice. That Marshall eventually turns out to be a certain Rooster Cogburn, John Wayne's Civil War veteran, who's living a life of rounding up disparate arrays of crooks and bandits from local territories and holding them in cells overnight so as to take courtroom lectures the following morning over, what we perceive to be from Cogburn's perspective, negligent intricacies over whom shot what first and in what order this-and-that happened. The manner in which Cogburn kicks an inmate towards the jail house in that lazed manner, as if he's done it so many times before that it's become too many times before, is prominent; a sense of the guy going through motions in rounding these guys up with little pleasure derived from the fact he has helped bring peace to those to whom it matters.Mattie and Cogburn eventually link up, his enthusiasm only truly omnipresent when she is able to show him hard cash; her smaller, sharper posture, more colourful display of attire and verbal eloquence in relatively stark contrast to that of his larger build, slurred tone, more erratic body movements and clothing dulled by months of dirt. Along for good measure is that of a Texan ranger named La Boeuf (Campbell), somebody who challenges Mattie's transgressions and whose stake for the same man she's after is a lot more on account he's guilty of killing a politician. Where the film is effectively Mattie's as a tale of revenge, the film does really well to encompass Cogburn's arc of going out to find a wanted man, like he always does, but this time identifying what he's doing and for whom he's doing it. Principally, the coming to learn; accept and acknowledge life, or justice, as something worth going out and fighting for or battling toward, in the action of searching for this man rather than merely treating it as a part of the daily grind, is prominent. The film keeps the interplay between the three of them tasty throughout, and we enjoy Mattie's ability to bring a sense of the controlled or of the informed to her surroundings as well as to those with whom she interacts, in what is a persistently captivating series of clashes Hathaway keeps moving and brooding with and affecting eye on numerous things.

The crux of authenticity in Darby's quite stunning performance runs in tandem with that of her character's predicament; within the film, she is somebody whom must confront and often stand up to certain individuals of a hardened and established ilk, before often coming to have to dominate proceedings in their presence. This is something in lieu of Darby's own predicament, that of having to match up to that of a figure of John Wayne's stature in this, a Western, and have to match him within the frame as well as the universe of the film.In short, Henry Hathaway's bare boned 1969 western is a near faultless masterpiece; an exciting, unpredictable and more than substantial film balancing several acts at once as it breathlessly tells a tale that is difficult to find anything less than thoroughly absorbing. The film is directed with distinct aplomb; make no mistake, his film is unafraid to place children on the front-line and in the firing line of a west we very much sense is wild. It is a west that sees animals get caught up, and often killed, in the ensuing chaos; a west that sees an array of lowlifes all intermingling with one another and the elements, those of whose actions and motivations we can never take for granted and of which are told amidst a background of brutality lending a great air of ambiguity to proceedings as we wonder if anybody is entirely safe.The catalyst for proceedings is in the tragedy that is Frank's death; shot and killed by his accomplice lodger whilst trying to help him in the aftermath of a poker game. In reaction to this, Mattie journeys to the town in which he was killed so as to hire a Marshall to find the man and garner some justice; her witnessing of several other criminals guilty for similar crimes publicly hung allowing her exposure to what awaits such justice. That Marshall eventually turns out to be a certain Rooster Cogburn, John Wayne's Civil War veteran, who's living a life of rounding up disparate arrays of crooks and bandits from local territories and holding them in cells overnight so as to take courtroom lectures the following morning over, what we perceive to be from Cogburn's perspective, negligent intricacies over whom shot what first and in what order this-and-that happened. The manner in which Cogburn kicks an inmate towards the jail house in that lazed manner, as if he's done it so many times before that it's become too many times before, is prominent; a sense of the guy going through motions in rounding these guys up with little pleasure derived from the fact he has helped bring peace to those to whom it matters.Mattie and Cogburn eventually link up, his enthusiasm only truly omnipresent when she is able to show him hard cash; her smaller, sharper posture, more colourful display of attire and verbal eloquence in relatively stark contrast to that of his larger build, slurred tone, more erratic body movements and clothing dulled by months of dirt. Along for good measure is that of a Texan ranger named La Boeuf (Campbell), somebody who challenges Mattie's transgressions and whose stake for the same man she's after is a lot more on account he's guilty of killing a politician. Where the film is effectively Mattie's as a tale of revenge, the film does really well to encompass Cogburn's arc of going out to find a wanted man, like he always does, but this time identifying what he's doing and for whom he's doing it. Principally, the coming to learn; accept and acknowledge life, or justice, as something worth going out and fighting for or battling toward, in the action of searching for this man rather than merely treating it as a part of the daily grind, is prominent. The film keeps the interplay between the three of them tasty throughout, and we enjoy Mattie's ability to bring a sense of the controlled or of the informed to her surroundings as well as to those with whom she interacts, in what is a persistently captivating series of clashes Hathaway keeps moving and brooding with and affecting eye on numerous things.

It has one goal, and one goal only - to make people laugh. It has no aspirations of looking to be anything more than what it is, and has the most fun it could possibly have presenting the audience with the immense amounts of ridiculous situations it sets up.There is a very loose plot to the film. It opens with the appointment of Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) as leader of the bankrupt country of Freedonia. Soon after, we learn how the neighboring country of Sylvania looks to take over Freedonia. The rest of the film consists of Firefly and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (played devilishly by Louis Calhern) trying to get rid of each other by any means necessary, including trickery, deceit, and violence, all leading to a madcap, insane finale.The plot takes a backseat to a lot of gags that incorporate the sense of humor that embodies each of the Marx Brothers' distinct personalities, a handful of which are non-sequiturs. Normally, when comedies tend to let their jokes lead the film, they end up only working to a certain degree - or not at all, as they might give in to conventional plot themes that make the film feel contrived and ruin the balance of the film. I mean, who hasn't seen their share of movies where they find themselves laughing at some hilarious one-liner a character makes one moment, and then another moment later groaning when the film decides to move the plot along? However, Duck Soup is much smarter than that. It knows exactly how to weave the plot in between the jokes, just enough to let the audience know exactly what they need to know before moving on to a new gag. Also, it's the actions of each Marx Brother in certain gags that allows for the plot to move forward, mainly those of Groucho's Firefly. His great wit and comedic timing suggest he is a somewhat intelligent man, although he is also stubborn, and contains a faulty enough mindset that causes him to exaggerate a situation, causing for many antagonistic interactions with Trentino.Outside of Groucho's one-liners, the majority of the jokes stem from a great deal of slapstick humor that the Marxes are known for. Chico and Harpo are responsible for a majority of the physical gags, although Groucho takes part in a great deal of these sequences, as well. For most comedians to pull off a visual gag or any sort of physical humor, they have to worry about how they go about the slapstick. Anyone can just walk into a wall or slip on a banana peel, but only a select few can make the joke funny, as it's the way they hit into that wall or slip on that banana peel that determines if the joke worked or not. For some, it's difficult. However, the Marxes pull off each and every visual gag with ease, immensely exaggerating their body language and constantly expanding jokes that could have been a few seconds long into a few minutes long, although never to the point where the joke is played out.Duck Soup stands today as a comedy classic. It allows for us to look back at a time where most comedies simply had to make the audience laugh in order to fully work. It's a stark contrast to the majority of today's greatly revered comedies, which could generally also be classified more as dramedies, dark comedies, or any other genre mix.

Consequently, the audience witnesses the decline of a seemingly healthy man to a man who's body has been ravaged by an incurable disease. It's really quite heartbreaking. Tom Hanks worked well for this Oscar. Along side Hanks is Washington, who also gives a fine performance as the conflicted lawyer Miller. Like Beckett, Miller goes through a significant change as well - only his soul changes, not his health. It's really quite interesting to see Washington and Hanks work together on screen, as I've never seen it happen in any other film.

The workshop is still, to this day, a fully functioning company, that recently worked on Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are (2009). Aside from Henson's more forward thinking for the development of his craft, he has endowed the collective consciousness with a collection of enduring, lovable characters. Jim Henson had been developing a puppetry style for television since the 1950's. However, after the success of the Children's Television Workshop's Sesame Street (1969 - present), he wanted to be able to take creative control over a show featuring his Muppet puppets.The cultural phenomenon that was The Muppet Show, began in 1976 and ran until 1981. The show was set in a theatre, which was harking back to the days of vaudeville. This element of variety was carried over into the first film, The Muppet Movie (1979), and has also been developed in their second feature, The Great Muppet Caper. Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear are twin brothers who, along with Gonzo, are playing investigative journalists. After being fired from their newspaper, they decide to pursue a story about jewel thieves in England. There they meet a whole host of other Muppet characters, and become embroiled in a mystery involving brother and sister, Nicky and Lady Holiday (Charles Grodin and Diana Rigg).

This element of variety was carried over into the first film, The Muppet Movie (1979), and has also been developed in their second feature, The Great Muppet Caper. Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear are twin brothers who, along with Gonzo, are playing investigative journalists. After being fired from their newspaper, they decide to pursue a story about jewel thieves in England. There they meet a whole host of other Muppet characters, and become embroiled in a mystery involving brother and sister, Nicky and Lady Holiday (Charles Grodin and Diana Rigg). There are some catchy musical numbers, and a Busby Berkley inspired synchronised swimming sequence with Miss Piggy and its centre.It is testament to the characters that Henson created here. They still endure today. I have many fond memories of the Muppets. This was unfortunately the last great Muppet film. (Here's hoping that this years The Muppets will reinvigorate the franchise.) Caper is a fun film. The characters constantly refer to themselves being in a film (this is a device that Henson used also in The Muppet Movie). There are some decent cameos from John Cleese, Peter Falk and Peter Ustinov (who plays alongside Grouch from Sesame Street) Ustinov What are you doing here?. Grouch A very short cameo. Ustinov Me Too.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family"},{"date":"12 July 2011","score":"","review":" This is one of my favourite comedy films of all time. I like this film slightly better than the first. Mike Myers is just hilarious as both Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard. He always knows how to tickle your funny bone. One of my favourite scenes in this movie is the Johnson rocket scene where someone is about to say what it is and when before they are about to say what it is it switches instantly to the next person and that person says the word. I laughed so hard when I saw that scene. I also liked Heather Graham's performance in the film. This has to be the best movie in the Austin Powers Trilogy. This movie is definitely a must see. If you have not seen it, get off the couch and rent it or buy it. When you see it, you will laugh so hard that you will take a pee or take a dump in your pants. This is one of those you can watch over and over again and it will still make you laugh and you will never get tired of it. That is how funny it is. A lot of repeat value.

There are movies you kinda enjoy, good ones and even the occasional welcome surprise. And then, seldom, you come across a movie like this one.

This is a story which will take you on a truly beautiful journey, through all possible emotions, always under the steady guidance of Morgan Freeman's unequaled narrative. Tim Robbins is simply brilliant, making the evolution from docile, even fragile, inmate to jailbreak mastermind a riveting experience.
