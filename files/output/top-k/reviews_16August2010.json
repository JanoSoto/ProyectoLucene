But listening to my own criticisms of Eat, Pray, love, I had to think back to one of my own personal favorite films, the Bill Murray version of The Razor's Edge. Some have argued that the Maugham novel was far better than the film, but I disagree. I've read the Maugham novel. I saw the movie. I prefer the film, though I liked them both a great deal.The themes of the novel are there in the film, but the movie chooses to focus on the themes through Larry's story rather than through Uncle Elliot's. The novel focuses most of the time telling Elliot Templeton's life, with this strange bird Larry floating in and out of the scene from time to time. They are both characters on journeys seeking meaning. They both find what they need to find at the end, and it isn't what they set out to find in the beginning.The reason I love this story, no matter which way it's told, is that it fundamentally understands reality in a way that the current rendition ('Eat, Pray, Love') does not. Life is not always going to be pretty, and certainly not just because you have some sort of higher 'mission' to find true meaning in your life. The bad people in A Razor's Edge end up being so much more reprehensible than those in Eat, Pray, Love, and yet you end up hating the lead character in the latter film oh so much more for being so banal. (Isabel is one of the truly evil creatures in literature. Liz is just a thinly veiled version of the author, who naturally can't see that she's vile.) The themes of the two stories? The Razor's Edge, both versions, is truly a student of existential philosophy, The only meaning, the only reward, in life is the experience you have in living it. Eat, Pray, Love, on the other hand, is a child of excess whose only message seems to be, It doesn't matter who you hurt along the way as long as you feel good in the end. There is a certain self-indulgence required in this sort of 'journey of self-discovery' tale. But no one can really say that Larry didn't pay for going on his journey. Maybe it's just as self-indulgent that he did so, but I ended up truly liking and admiring Larry at the end of his journey.

And lastly, he does atmosphere so extremely well, it's really just about beyond reproach. All of those are evident here. He takes an old and famous legend(which, I should point out, I have not read, all I know of it is what was in this, and that dull made-for-TV movie that I've also reviewed, from the same year and of the same title, save for adding The Legend of to the beginning... so I can make no comparisons or judge the accuracy of this adaptation), reinterprets it and puts together a period piece of immense enjoyment even for those not necessarily into such(I should know, I am one). The plot is interesting throughout, and develops nicely. It's not too predictable, and the twists are great. This is a rather satisfying mystery. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, this is never boring, and the action is cool and exciting... you really can not go wrong when you let Ray Park loose in front of a camera and give him someone to beat up or slash at(the choreography is masterful). This has great acting by most... putting Depp(as the squeamish and eccentric Ichabod) and Ricci(am I the only one who can just get lost in those doe-eyes?) in the same film makes perfect sense, especially under this man's direction. Even Van Dien and the children are pretty convincing. Richardson utterly steals the show, and it looks like she was as ecstatic to be in this as it is for us to watch her. The script is well-written, and the dialog is marvelous. In addition to being bleak, creepy and a stunning recreation of the look of the period(with magnificent sets and costumes), this is wacky and comical. Somehow, the tone works. Fantastic score. The FX hold up well, and are used as a tool, not the focus. A young police officer(Johnny) openly protests the horrible conditions of the justice system of 1799, and advocates science in place of imprisoning people based on pure suspicion. A judge(played by Christopher Lee, who commands the screen in his short cameo) sends him to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, under the guise that he is to capture whoever has been killing its citizens recently. What he isn't told until he gets there, is that this is no mere mortal... it is the feared headless horseman(who is built up well, and has an impact whenever we see him in this). Will he have to reconsider his stance, that everything has a natural explanation? And what, precisely, *is* going on? There is quite graphic, bloody violence and gore in this, some material is disturbing, and there is a little bit of mild sexuality and language. The DVD comes with an informational and funny commentary track by Burton, a 29 minute documentary entitled Behind the Legend(I will review it on its own page here on the site), 11 minutes of cast interviews(worth the time, note that they contain spoilers for this, as does the cast list here), a teaser and a trailer for this and finally a small photo gallery.

It wasn't paced with the current I-Phone or the Droid X. It was in tune with the dust devils and people liked it that way back then. Heck, I might like it toned down to finally enjoy life.#2 that line by William Munny (Eastwood) was repeated multiple times, both by Munny and his peers. Obviously, it's done as a premeditation.

Not one single copy seemed to be available over here in Europe. That was until 2007, when I finally got my hands on a Region 1 DVD copy.If you like anthology movies, then you have no excuse for not seeing this one. One of the best anthology movies of the 90's (it's up there with Tales From The Dark Side The Movie and Necronomicon, if you ask me). And probably the best horror movie from the hood with a nearly all Afro-American cast ever made (because I can't really say I've ever seen a ghetto-horror flick that was actually any good). Three hood-rats, out to collect some 'shiiit', visit a freaky coroner who tells them 4 terrifying tales of the supernatural.The first tale is about three corrupt white cops who had it coming... Wings Hauser is especially enjoyable in this one. He already evoked my interest at the time after having seen his enjoyable performance in Night Shadows (AKA Mutant). And by know I simply love the man. Second story is about a boy and his bruises, which are being caused by... a monster supposedly living in his house. Great and fascinating conclusion this one had. The third tale has some killer-puppet action going on in it of which Charles Band could easily be very jealous. CorbinThe DentistBernsen stars in this segment that revolves around voodoo and slavery. The fourth and last segment gives a big nod to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Enough said about that one. The wrap-around story wraps it all up nicely, and has a very satisfying conclusion. Tales From The Hood is actually more than 'just a horror movie'. With Spike Lee being executive producer, you can rightfully expect that this movie will carry important themes & topics like racism, politics, police brutality, guilt, child abuse, brothers killing brothers, etc. The message always comes across, but possible statements & points of view never become too dominant. This film's primary goal is to entertain a horror audience. And it splendidly succeeds in that. The filmmakers also clearly know the rules of the horror-anthology-genre as well as the tricks of the trade, all to great success.

They are nevertheless incredibly successful, taking out a massive camp of rebels in a fashion that is, by Arnie standards, very believable (let's just say we aren't asked to believe he succeeds because 50 guys can shoot at him point blank with automatic weapons and not give him so much as a scratch, as in the ridiculous Arnie flick Commando).The spot the elite team is in, with a valuable captive in tow, is apparently too hot for an airlift so they have to go through a nasty stretch of jungle, where they quickly learn they are being stalked by something evil. They have to fight it off, and that's pretty much the movie.I have always been underwhelmed. It's true that the actors do everything you could expect, and the script isn't weighed down by silly moral and political posturing, love interest subplots, convoluted sci-fi back-stories and the other clichés Hollywood feels need to be tacked on to action flicks. Still, the finished product is little more than Arnie and flunkies in the jungle fighting a monster. It almost reminds me of Arnold's infamous first movie where he fights a bear in one of the most poorly shot action sequences ever. This treads dangerously close to being that bear fight with a massive budget. That's not to say anything in the movie is badly done, this is a very solid production, but there's really nothing in the movie other than the well-directed action scenes.All that really saves it are the fine performances by the actors (including Jesse Ventura of later political fame), its streamlined presentation, and the fantastic score, which seems to have been very influential on action film music up to this very day.If you want something fun, utterly void of anything to think about at all, this movie is alright, but I'd be just as happy with one of Arnie's sillier movies where you can enjoy yourself just poking fun at the absurdities.

It really doesn't matter. It's a movie about Scotland, and the ladies demand we wear kilts, it's only fitting.I accept the director's conflicted portrayal of Robert the Bruce, torn between loyalty to his diseased evil father and the dream of an independent Scotland, and I forgive him his introduction of the French Princess as a love interest, we have to give the lassies something to watch after all.Most amusing is his use of the diminuative Mel Gibson to play a man who was apparently tall for his generation. William Wallace may well have grown an inch each time his story was re-told, and started out a short man as well. Mel did his best on the accent, and I found it pleasing to the ear, Scottish with a bit'o Aussie, what's the harm?Did you know some believe Braveheart (William Wallace) may have been the inspiration for Robin Hood? Wallace was skilled in archery as were his men, they wore green camouflage, hid in the woods, and hit the English in commando style raids. Much of their spoils would have been passed on to the dirt-poor Scottish around them.Those rich Scots, who took English bribes in return for loyalty to the English crown, are the ones who got to write history, and of course they despise the commoner Wallace for his attempt to upset their applecart. They brand him to this day a villain.But to this commoner Scot, Mel portrayed my mythological hero accurately and true to heart.May Scotland be one day free of English dominance and re-assert it's true culture!

I think he was best filmmaker in the past decade, and if he continues making highly innovative,different,engrossing and intense films like memento,Batman Begins,TDK and now Inception, he's going to have a claim to be one of the greatest directors of all time. He's certainly on his way there. This film is by no means lacking in creativity, but when you look at Nolan's other works, this is no doubt the odd one out, there is genre subversion with the classic dark noir scenes replaced by omnipresent sunlight. The plot is good,but not great. What really draws you in is Al Pacino showing his greatness as an actor with a brilliant rendition of William Dommer,the title character .A cat-and-mouse game between hero-cop-with- skeletons-in-his-closet-suffering-from-insomnia-and-guilt and criminal- with-ace-up-his-sleeve is intriguing and engaging. But so,Robin William's appearance somehow hurts the movie, who,despite his talent,gives an unusually lackluster performance. The movie then loses its pace and intensity,and I found my attention wandering,something I thought impossible during a Nolan Movie. The 24-day concept is new and refreshing,Hillary Swank also gives a solid performance. The first 1 hour was very promising.Yet, somewhere in between, the movie loses its intensity, and already lacking Nolan's characteristic incredibly out-of-the-box-theme, it also loses its chance at greatness. Despite that,it's not a bad movie by any stretch. It's definitely worth a watch. Catch it for another stellar performance from one of Hollywood's stalwarts and Nolan's clever cinematography.

This film is by no means lacking in creativity, but when you look at Nolan's other works, this is no doubt the odd one out, there is genre subversion with the classic dark noir scenes replaced by omnipresent sunlight. The plot is good,but not great. What really draws you in is Al Pacino showing his greatness as an actor with a brilliant rendition of William Dommer,the title character .A cat-and-mouse game between hero-cop-with- skeletons-in-his-closet-suffering-from-insomnia-and-guilt and criminal- with-ace-up-his-sleeve is intriguing and engaging. But so,Robin William's appearance somehow hurts the movie, who,despite his talent,gives an unusually lackluster performance. The movie then loses its pace and intensity,and I found my attention wandering,something I thought impossible during a Nolan Movie. The 24-day concept is new and refreshing,Hillary Swank also gives a solid performance. The first 1 hour was very promising.Yet, somewhere in between, the movie loses its intensity, and already lacking Nolan's characteristic incredibly out-of-the-box-theme, it also loses its chance at greatness.

What the grateful Brits don't realise is that their mysterious informant is actually the boyfriend of said queen, resurrected ten years earlier by a hapless archaeological student who read out loud from a cursed scroll. 'He went for a little walk!' the poor chap cackles before being carted off to the lunatic asylum to die in a straitjacket.In a coincidence that happens only in Hollywood films of the 30s, the reincarnation of the princess just happens to be living around the corner and falls under the spell of the lugubrious Karloff, who intends to transplant his beloved's soul into the young lady's body.The best thing about The Mummy has to be Karloff's make-up which still looks highly impressive today. The story itself, although only 70 minutes long, is told without any real attempt at tension or horror, relying more on an atmosphere that simply refuses to materialise - other than in the film's one classic creepy scene in which the Mummy comes to life. Karloff's Ardath Bey is a semi-sympathetic character who just wants to hook up with his girlfriend, and you've got to admire the guy's persistence. Sadly, his girlfriend is reincarnated in the form of Broadway diva Zita Johann, owner of a pleasingly rounded belly and a healthy contempt for movie-making that shines through in far too many scenes. She and Freund apparently waged a war of attrition throughout the shoot, and such antagonism is probably always going to leak through to the final print.
