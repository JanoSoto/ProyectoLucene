And its visual effects are good.  For that, I rated it a 6.But the story is recycled and stale.  Federation vs. Klingons vs. Romulans... you only get so many possible combinations before you *have* to recycle.  And the two-dimensional characters that played so well in the late 60s -- Kirk's swagger and defiance of regulations, McCoy's crusty wisecracking past the graveyard, Sulu's cheerful and unquestioning loyalty, and the Klingons' I-double-dare-you truculence -- don't play in a world that's learned that characters have three dimensions.  Only Spock (Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the ending) and one of the Klingons (Kirk ... don't let it end like this) seem to have evolved at all.In its original incarnation, Star Trek's drama fit the times.  It was the Cold War era, and American culture -- especially its political culture -- saw good and evil as white and black.  In that context, Star Trek not only fit, it was progressive.  And Star Trek VI is a great chapter in that world which, for many, lives on.  But the real world has evolved while the future world of Kirk and the crew has stayed, paradoxically, in the past.

It was a joy to see the two greats on screen together.  They were absolutely magnificent and had incredible chemistry.  The way their personalities conflicted with one another was a riot.  Another noteworthy member in the cast is Joe Viterelli, who's also a riot as DeNiro's henchman Jelly.  Lisa Kudrow has some funny moments and Chazz Palminteri is...CHAZZ!!!  He's such a cool actor that his mere appearance can make a film worthwhile.  He only has a supporting role, but he's great as always.The film has some priceless gags.  Some of the best lines I've ever heard were from this movie.  One that really sticks out is when DeNiro consults Crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn't...get it up.  Yes, it's what you're thinking.  When Crystal advises him to take some sort of drugs to help his problem, DeNiro replies Drugs--I don't take drugs.  A hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not be gotten at all.  Crystal replies in a dry sarcastic tone, I think Mark Twain said that.  I also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time, in Crystal's office.  DeNiro asks the shrinkDo you know me?   Yes, he replies.   No you don't.   No, I don't.   Did you see my picture in the paper?   Yes. No you didn't! No, I didn't.And there's a great interaction in which Crystal explains a theory by Sigmund Freud about a child in Greece who killed his father because he wanted to marry his mother.  DeNiro quickly repliesAre you saying I wanna f**k my mother?  Have you seen my mother? Well, Freud said-- Well, Freud's a sick f**k!There's so many memorable moments, but I don't want to give them all away to those who haven't seen the movie.  Because these are some of the funniest gags in film history.

There were so many classics out that summer (Gremlins 2, RoboCop 2, BTTF 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Arachnophobia wasn't one of them but I was excited by the trailer (which used a weird, alternate version of the Gremlin Rag) and I was a fan of John Goodman and Julian Sands, having recently seen Raising Arizona and Warlock at the time. I didn't actually get to see the movie until the next summer when it was on in a bar in Gran Canaria though. On my way back to the hotel I ran up some steps, which made a tassel from my shorts flip up into my face. I thought it was a spider. I freaked.Many people are afraid of spiders, actually. Including you. There's probably a spider in your bed right now. That tickle on your arm a minute ago - that was probably a spider. You know that packet of grapes you've been munching on? I think maybe an exotic arachnid hitched a ride here from some far off land in it. I'd sleep with your mouth closed tonight if I were you.A fear of spiders has been in our blood since cave man days. It's a common sense in our DNA that won't go away. They have made easy villains in movies for many years, from the awful Tarantula to the awful Kingdom of the Spiders (which is still a very enjoyable film) and the overlooked Eight Legged Freaks. Frank Marshall tackled the er...eight-legged freaks before the advent of CGI, when creature effects were brought to life with puppetry and animatronics (done here by Chris Walas who seems to have retired now that his craft is obsolete) and it helps the movie feel real and tangible, but it's just not creepy or disgusting enough.Jeff Daniels plays an affable GP who moves to sleepy rural Canaima, California to escape the city life. The very day he arrives is the moment when a newly-discovered, highly aggressive species of spider arrives in a coffin from Venezuela. It mates with a local right under his nose and sets up a nest in his barn and basement. The locals begin to die of bites from their young and Daniels gradually figures it out as a spectacularly small amount of bodies piles up.Goodman (channeling Carl Spackler from Caddyshack, for some reason) and Sands come and go, the latter making some truly moronic decisions, while the spiders remain mostly off-screen. Much of the running time is devoted to all the boring bits in-between. Arachnophobia plays it safe when it really should have overwhelmed us.Even by 1990 PG-13 standards it could have set the bar pretty high for any spider-flicks that followed. Instead we get the occasional glimpse, a few deaths, and a couple of scenes of tension before the action-packed finale which, thankfully, saves it.Had David Cronenberg (who, strangely, went on to direct a movie called Spider) or John Carpenter tackled the story we might have had a classic, as it is Arachnophobia is merely mindless entertainment with the familiar Amblin touch.

That's for damn sure. This was the first film that David Fincher directed and it has that dark, smelly and grimy look that he is only capable of. After the highly exciting Aliens there is ZERO entertainment here and only one Alien. Very fake looking and largely unseen for most of the movie.Apparently the Alien Queen laid one last face hugger egg on the Marine ship (didn't she already detach herself from her birth tunnel thingy). The egg hatches and lays another Alien egg in Ripley, which just happens to be a queen. For a reason, which is unclear to us, the face hugger sprays acid on the ship, which catches fire and breaks off the cryo-tube section. This sends Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop crashing down onto a lice-infected prison planet called Furiona 161. Just for the hell of it (it seems) Newt, Hicks and Bishop are killed off because the film is deliberately miserable as it possibly can be. Weaver is the only female character in it and is very much indistinctive among the rest of the indistinctive cast as she is bald-headed (because of the Lice problem) with a bunch of bald-headed guys who all appear to be English and ugly. There is another face hugger (so the Queen laid 2 eggs before it died?) that the prisoners seem to miss as they rescue Ripley. It impregnates a dog and a new Alien is born in the form of a canine, giving us the impression that the beast mimics the form of the creature that became its host. We are supposed to observe this as it is never cleared up in dialogue.There are numerous scenes in which Ripley (or bald-headed prisoners&#133;I can't tell) run down damp corridors (or perhaps the same one over and over) being chased by the Alien. But for budget reasons we don't actually SEE the Alien, just its point of vision. Characters are killed with no care, passion or meaning to their deaths and how the hell anyone believed that an audience of any kind would enjoy this film is beyond my great understanding.It is so bad that Fincher didn't get work for 3 years after this until he was called upon to direct Se7en. The only reason he got to do that is because it is a depressing and ugly film, much like this. The extended version featured on the Special Edition DVD is a far superior version of the film, though not a director's cut or without faults, it's the best version of the film you're likely to see. Characters are fleshed out, sense-making scenes are restored and the creature is born out of a dead ox instead of a dog.

Has anyone apart from Cameron ever employed him?Most of today's sci-fi is junk and quickly forgettable (Forgotten, AvP) but this has stood the test of time and will do for a long time to come, regardless of the 80's feel to it. But Cameron made it in 1.851, which sucks a film of this size deserves scope, but I guess he only worked with what he had. The second film, while not an improvement, is up to the same standard. See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print.

He was very specific on precisely what he wanted to do with it, and his notes and instructions on it were massive. Then just before it was finished, he died of lung cancer (he was a heavy smoker) and the rest of his staff was left with the painful task of completing it without him. Fortunately, they had all his notes he had left behind and bent over backwards to be sure it was exactly as he had envisioned.Now I would very much love to say that the end result to all that talent, dedication and determination to stick to Walt's intentions was proved worth it in the resulting film, but I can't.The Jungle Book is the weakest and most odious of all of Walt's animated features. The plot is not exactly the best in the world (plot Bagheera is taking Mowgli back to human civilization, that's it). The film is basically a string of animated music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot, structurally making it the only animated movie in history to resemble Prince's Purple Rain. Many have complained that it is really Disney's animated Robin Hood that is the weaker film because it has virtually no plot at all--and that is true in terms of the story, but at least Robin Hood had genuinely catchy songs from start to finish, boasts truly inspired character design and has memorable, likeable characters with fully-developed personalities and emotions. Robin Hood is considered a staple on TV and in the hearts of Disney fans everywhere for those very reasons, not to mention far more memorable. In sharp contrast, none of the characters in this version of The Jungle Book appeal very much--although, of course, Baloo is a lot of fun (Phil Harris is perfect for this role), and Bill Peet's idea of putting in a song called Bear Necessities was a stroke of genius, especially since it basically could have been fit in a stricter version of the story. Maybe if Peet (who was also responsible for the wonderful animated version of 101 Dalmations) had stayed on with the staff instead of leaving after Walt's upsetting him one time too many there would have been more of such moments. The fact that all the other characters are so cardboard is completely inexcusable considering the richness of the source material.But the biggest and weirdest problem with this movie is how it thoroughly mangles the original classic and considers itself clever for doing so. It would normally be thought that the rest of the staff screwed things up after Walt's death, but no Walt originally INTENDED the final result to be like this! According to the original artists who worked on it, he brought in Kipling's book and said, Here's 'The Jungle Book'. The first thing I want you to do is to not read it.Bizarre errors of judgement are present all over this film, weird and odd errors which a younger Walt would never have allowed in, say, a masterpiece like Pinocchio or Fantasia or Peter Pan. Even the animated Sword in The Stone can be excused from this fact because the original T. H. White books, which Stone was based on, were every bit as goofy as Walt's version. Was it old age or nicotine frenzy?An excellent example of strange ideas inserted into the film getting more messed up than they originally were the puzzling vultures with moptops and Liverpudlian accents. Disney had decided for some strange reason that they would originally be charicatures of The Beatles and was going to invite The Beatles themselves to voice them and perform a song for them (now believe me, it isn't The Beatles themselves I object to here--I adore them!). But at the very last minute, Walt decided to have the vultures sing like a barbershop quarter instead because he decided that The Beatles were merely a flash in the pan and wouldn't remain very popular for another year or two (THIS is great genius??!). Now while it can be argued that this was all Walt's opinion and that he had the right to correct what he felt was a mistake, it nevertheless begs the question if Walt was so convinced that the old idea was a bad one in the first place, then WHY DID HE LEAVE IT IN AND MERELY EDIT IT INTO ONE THAT WORKED WORSE INSTEAD OF REMOVING THE WHOLE PORTION THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE IN THE PAST? The resulting scene, rather than being corrected, is instead even more confusing and bewildering than it might have been in the first place. Walt's instincts must have really been exhausted for some reason or other... did Mary Poppins take that much out of him?Judgement like this abounds all throughout The Jungle Book, and while its soundtrack boasts gorgeously hypnotic orchestration and three thoroughly wonderful songs (Bear Necessities, I Wan'Na Be Like You and especially My Own Home), the others are simply awful. (The most annoying one of all is the one from the previously-mentioned section, That's What Friends Are For.)The film as a whole moves on in a droning, sleepy pace, never once picking up its molasses-running speed. You keep hoping it will pick up, but it never does.All of these points I've mentioned, and many more, have all been pointed out over and over again since its release by not just paid critics, but also by animation fans and especially Kipling admirers, who rightfully feel that this movie is an appalling travesty and a dreadful mockery to the original stories, but none of this criticism has affected its performance at the box office and as a home video release--in this respect it has been a shocking success.I have no idea how pleasing this is in the long run, though The Jungle Book remains the only Disney animated film I ever saw as a child which, on all three occasions when I saw it at different ages while growing up, bored me to the point of nearly putting me to sleep.
