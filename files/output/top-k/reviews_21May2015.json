[{"date":"21 May 2015","score":"","review":" Rounders has some very good acting and well-written parts. It dramatizes professional or skilled poker playing in an unrealistic but still engaging way. Matt Damon is perfect as a law student who finds that his real calling is playing poker. Martin Landau mentors him beautifully by relating how he came to be a law professor, not a rabbi. John Turturro racks up another fine character performance as an unflashy poker player who grinds out his earnings. Edward Norton inhabits his character fully, a young man with conflicting compulsions that can be quite self-destructive. John Malkovich impressively sports a heavy Russian accent and beard as the poker player with underworld connections. Gretchen Mol plays Damon's staid law student amour who wants him to quit poker. The story focuses on Damon's loyalty to Norton that goes back to their childhood and on Damon's increasing attraction to poker with law school and Mol taking a back seat. It's all larded with poker confrontations done up in an entertaining way. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2015","score":"","review":" Rounders has some very good acting and well-written parts.
