It makes no sense whatsoever, and is probably the most stupidest sequence I have ever seen in a movie.  Again, everything seems to happen at just the right time, and then Yoda walks in and from this point on the movie just abandons logic.This is the worst movie in the series, and I really hope that George Lucas doesn't direct the next one, because at this rate, he is doing nothing whatsoever to show that he still is devoted to this series.

Don't listen to what many of the critics are saying about this film, after all what do they know? Critics don't know how to have a good time at the movies. I recommend anyone who is a fan of WOO, action films, war movies, Indian's, or Christian Slater to go and check out Windtalkers! I think I might even go and see it again today!

It's also realistic in the sense that not every shot an American soldier took killed a Somali, ya know? Also, everything that happens in the movie is true. Even the line Cliff Wolcott (Jeremy Piven) says as his Black Hawk is going down (Hey Bull you gonna pull the PCLs off line or what?) was what the real Cliff Wolcott said as the Black Hawk was going down. The real John Waddell was a bookworm and was always reading in the hanger, and in the movie we see Waddell (Ian Virgo) reading before they go out on the Mogadishu mission. The movie's just real accurate like that. And like every sentence or line that we know was said during the real battle (I know this from reading the true, fact book of Black Hawk Down) was in the movie. To me that's what makes the movie even better, the realism and the accuracy. You don't really get TOO attached to the characters, but that in no way ruins the movie. Also, the ending of the movie was done very well (Josh Hartnett talking to a fallen comrade).So all in all, I consider this to be the BEST war movie ever made and this is definately my favorite movie.

As for Richard Gere, I really dislike him because he seems to love himself way too much (don't tell me you don't envision him telling himself how sexy and irresistible he is while he poses in the mirror like a GQ model), but he honestly has an (annoying) appeal I can't quite put my finger on.. So, I love Ryder and I love\/hate Gere.Now, on to the movie..It's an original and unusual pairing of actors, I'll give it that; But, the romance angle just doesn't wash. Sweet, gentle, vulnerable Charlotte seems like a starry-eyed young woman with THE love crush of her life on an older man (which is understandable since she's at death's door)--While independent, in-your-face-womanizer-who-makes-women-weak-in-the-knees, power-hungry, go-getter Will looks rather sleazy for taking advantage of her in her mental and physical state. This isn't to say he doesn't care for her in a deep way, but it still comes off as selfish and a bit sick. To be clear, it isn't so much the AGE difference between the two that sours the movie, but the EMOTIONAL difference. And if they'd bonded on the intellectual-philosophical level, I may believe in their relationship even a little, but Will is too Gere to bond in any way other than cheap philosophy-plated pillow-talk.Will's and Charlotte's last scene didn't even lead me to believe it was their last scene and was barely noticeable. I REALLY wanted to care and felt sad that I couldn't, so I could only sympathize for the situation itself.Charlotte wasn't Will's daughter, but she easily COULD have been; And the scene with Will's grandson and daughter--who looks OLDER than Charlotte, mind you--further points out this fact, completely destroying any last ditch attempt by the viewer to forget Will's and Charlotte's creepy, near-incest-like relationship in favor of sweet, gut-wrenching sympathy for their doomed and tragic love. Who wants to end a movie viewing with nothing purely human to take from it? On the whole, it left me oscillating between feeling uncomfortable and sympathetic, never settling on either emotion.In my opinion, it would've done better to REALLY have Will as Charlotte's father (dropping the romance angle COMPLETELY, of course!). They still would've had a painfully limited amount of time to bond and eventually lose out to her death--a much less-used plot than the newly-connected-soulmates-working-against-time one. And even the 'Christmas tree on the balcony' scene would've made your heart wrench in sympathy--WITHOUT comparisons to incest popping up in your mind (Wouldn't we have enjoyed it more if it had been this way?). And, most of all, it would've given us a chance to see if Gere can do something other than older-guy-who's-finds-new-young-mistress, 'cause that shtick's gotten old.On a side note, I love the music in this movie (Anyone else notice the soundtrack portion with the chorus is very reminiscent of Gladiator?). Throughout the portion of the movie prior to the weak climax, the 'heart-string' music and the beautiful autumn scenery enveloped me in a bittersweet lovey-dovey atmosphere that sedated me like a cup of tea to make me temporarily forget about this romance mismatch and instead sympathize for the situation alone.Another mention..

So does Tom Cruise--this was actually the first Cruise film I ever saw and didn't even like him at first because his character was so selfish and dependent. Now back to Hoffman. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't believe that he was autistic.

When Raymond started to gripe that something wasn't working out, IT DROVE CHARLIE NUTS! One of the ways they show this is when Charlie yells SON OF A B***H! out in the middle of nowhere.I also like the part when Susanna tells Raymond that just because the hooker didn't want to meet him didn't mean that there weren't any other women who would like him, and then she kisses him. Most men would go wild if that happened--Susanna was so attractive and smart--but Raymond hardly understood what was going on (So how was that?

By the way, I am under 14, and I loved the story of Raymond and Charlie Babbitt.Like practically everyone else said, Dustin Hoffman soars. So does Tom Cruise--this was actually the first Cruise film I ever saw and didn't even like him at first because his character was so selfish and dependent. Now back to Hoffman. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't believe that he was autistic. I was on Raymond's side most of the time, but sometimes he got REALLY frustrating.One of the funniest things in this movie was that Raymond and Charlie were one of the most mismatched duos in screenwriting history. If everything wasn't exactly the way Charlie wanted it, he'd throw a fit. (Actually, that's one thing he and Raymond had in common!) He was the exact opposite of understanding. When Raymond started to gripe that something wasn't working out, IT DROVE CHARLIE NUTS!

I went with my girlfriend and spent over $20 expecting a good 2+ hours of entertainment, and what I got was ripped off!!!  If I had been at home watching this on dvd, I'd have turned it off and finished it sometime other than a Friday night, like say a Tuesday afternoon when there is nothing else to do. We had deliberated for a bit about whether to see Insomnia, Enough or The Bourne Identity, and about half way through the movie, I couldn't help but wonder how much more entertained I'd have been at any one of those than I currently was.  Not that I think there are many movies worth spending $14 on (not counting snacks) to see in a theater, but at least I wouldn't have been sitting there comparing Windtalkers to Saving Private Ryan and wondering why nobody else can make a war movie as compelling as Spielberg and Tom Hanks combined to do.When the movie first started, the camera spanned across the beautiful desert landscape in Arizona where the Navajo Indians lived, while the background music was reminiscent of that in the beginning of Saving Private Ryan in the cemetery scene. It was at this point that I took in the moment believing that what I was about to watch would be one of those rare movies that you never forget about as long as you live.  It opened by zooming in on Adam Beach, soon to be Private Ben Yahzee, holding his baby son just before joining a bus load of Navajo Indians who were all heading off to the Marines to learn the code based on the Navajo language.  On the bus, Roger Willie, soon to be Private Charles Whitehorse, was introduced as a friend of Yahzee's who you could tell right off the bat was only in the movie to play that proverbial good natured, wiser, older fellow who has a good sense of humor to give us some comedy relief. You know what I mean, that character that the audience is suppose to relate to and like, who almost always dies in the end in some weak attempt to make us shed a tear.  Not that he does die or not, but at this point in the movie that is what I was thinking....I wont give away any individual's destination here in case you still want to waste your money on this Hollywood piece of crap for some reason.In the next scene, we are introduced to Nicholas Cage's character, Joe Enders. It really catches the audience off guard the way the semi automatic rattles off a series of shots unexpectedly, startling everyone in the theater and getting some follow up chuckles afterwards from those who jumped out of their seats the highest.  I believe that this was the high point in the movie unfortunately, as never again did anything get a rise out of me or get my heart pounding like that did.Anyways, in this scene Cage plays a Marine (Enders) who fell into command for the first time ever after the former commander lost his life in the heat of the battle.  Enders refuses to retreat and continues to obey the order which is to hold a useless piece of swamp land at the end of nowhere with the Japanese closing in everywhere.  Even despite everyone begging him and pleading to retreat, seeing that they were all going to die if they stayed, he just orders them to hold their position thus everyone but Enders, somehow of course, ends up dead.  But not until a very cheesy one liner by a friend of his as he takes several bullets in the back while Enders was face to face with him trying to pull him up over a barrier to safety.  As Ender's friend is dying, he looks Enders in the eyes and calls him a son of a bitch.  Of course then, this ends up haunting Enders for the rest of the movie, as he later blames himself (original isn't it) for everyone dying, despite the fact he was just following orders.  At this point I think I knew that the movie was headed for mediocrity at best, and I was only 10 minutes into it. Sad.I could go on in more detail but what's the point, I think you see where this is going.  If you've seen even one preview for this movie then you already know that it is Sgt Ender's (Cage) job to protect the code at any cost, even if it means executing the Windtalker (Private Yahzee) if it looks like he is going to fall into enemy hands.  Do I even have to spell out how this movie ends?  In the beginning of the movie he lets his men die while being the lone survivor, and it haunts him forever.  Then in the end he has a decision to make about the lives of his men once again.  It doesn't take a Harvard graduate to see how it ends. Very predictable and boring, let me tell you.I didn't like at all how they made every piece of artillery be as accurate as you could possibly imagine.  Every time the camera zoomed in on some artillery as it was being fired, the target ALWAYS got hit, no matter what. And according to this movie, almost every Japanese soldier was too uncoordinated to shoot anyone before the Americans shot them first, even if the Japanese soldiers had a 5 second head start advantage.  If this is how it was in real life then I don't know what took so long to end the war. There is nothing like having a dozen Japanese soldiers with machine guns jumping out of everywhere on all sides of Nicholas Cage and every other co-star in the movie, only to have Cage or someone else pull out a pistol or a knife and kill all of the Japanese first.  Great job Hollywood.Just for the record, Nicholas Cage did NOT, I say did NOT, sell me on being a Marine in any way, shape or form. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any actor that would have been worse for that lead role.  He should stick to roles like he had in the Family Man.Actually, I don't care what actor you get to play Sgt Enders, the movie shouldn't have revolved around him and his haunting flashbacks where he got everyone killed in the beginning of the movie.  It was called Windtalkers, thus you'd think that the movie would have been centered around the Navajo Indians that served the United States as Marines.  Nicholas Cage's character was about as uncompelling as you could get, and I was shocked that the movie was centered so much around him.  It didn't help either that Cage acted like the guy he played in Leaving Las Vegas in between battles.  Even though it was called Windtalkers, it seemed as though the Navajo's who were the windtalkers were almost a sidenote to Sgt. Enders' plight to redeem himself in the war.  The movie should have been called Sgt. Enders, seriously.  They had a great concept with the Navajo language being used as a code that the Japanese couldn't crack, but they mucked it up with a predictable story line that didn't even really delve into the Navajo's importance in the war.One other thing, I was very bored with how outlandish Hollywood made every explosion seem.  They'd zoom in on the artillery that was firing on something, then cut away to the target, then we'd see the target explode in slow motion way too often as they were really trying to overdo every explosion.  Hey Hollywood, when are you going to stop trying to make up for a lack of a compelling story line and actors that can pull it off, with fiery, loud explosions and slow motion takes of people flailing through the air?  And they could have done away with all the symphonic background music behind every battle.  Did they not learn anything from Saving Private Ryan? It is better to just leave that background music out of the picture, cause I want to feel like I am a part of the picture like I did with Saving Private Ryan.  I don't think the soldiers who were there in real life were listening to an orchestra playing in the background, picking up momentum as they gained leverage on the enemy.  I hate that crap so bad.  Too much Hollywood for me.One final note - The acting in this movie was some of the worst I've ever seen, aside from Adam Beach who played Private Ben Yahzee, the main windtalker, and  Roger Willie who played the other windtalker.  They were the only actors who looked natural as everyone else just looked like they were just standing there waiting for the camera to scroll over to them so they could say their one liner when it was their turn.Very under achieving, very disappointing.  The idea of doing a movie about how the Navajo's contributed to winning the war by using their native language to encrypt the Americans' code was great.  Too bad the movie didn't actually revolve around that.

More like My Fair Lady with a few fanatical gun-wielding terrorists thrown into the mix.  It's at the point where you can spot a Bruckheimer. Hire two big-name stars, scour the music video scene for a lapdog\/director and throw a screenplay at 'em. Where did Michael Browning learn to write? The School of Contrived Plots?Rock, whose trademark is creativity, is reduced to barking out lame lines about whitey not liking rap. Usually actors demanding creative control means disaster, but in Rock's case, it should have been forced upon him, like a sled dog is forced to mush. The game of chess plays a significant role in Bad Company, but for all the wrong reasons. Bruckheimer would have you believe that it symbolizes strategy and the ongoing struggle between good and evil. But for me, it represented Hollywood's never-ending penchant to exploit the apparent rift between black people and white people, and the fact that Rock and Hopkins remain nothing more than pawns.This movie truly sucks. Jerry Bruckheimer is a goof and a loser.
