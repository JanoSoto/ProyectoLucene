Innocent and optimistic despite the fact that it touches on a series of serious issues (bullying - both in the school and home, drugs, coming out...).The story of two young school-friends and neighbours who gradually fall in love is beautifully told. Anyone who has ever fallen hopelessly for another will absolutely recognise the tensions and uncertainties of not knowing if, how and when to tell that person how you feel.You cannot help but like both leads;  Jamie (he's ever so nice) and Ste, who is so badly beaten by his father that he has an even weaker sense of identity than the other characters, who are all soul-searching in their own ways...Jamie seems to have some idea how he feels long before we join the action. It's just as he falls for friend Ste that he realises he is definitely gay and starts to take pride in knowing where he stands. Ste is then left to nervously craft out an idea of who - and what - he is, as Jamie gains the confidence to take the lead in the relationship...After repeated watching you start to notice that residents of the housing project (on which all the main characters live) seem to pop up everywhere. This makes for some lovely linking between situations helping to gel the film together, aided admirally by the fantastic Mama Cass soundtrack... The overall effect is a very well-rounded picture to support the central story of young love.Both Ste and Jamie are played fantastically. Both understated and very sincere enhancing this totally charming story. The actors *should* be stars and certainly shine through magnificently here....Sandra, Jamie's tough mother is feisty and wonderful and  just as confused in her own identity as her son, whom she loves and wants a better life for. Her part too is acted wonderfully, with the staggering pride that instantly shows us that she is a long-term struggler and strong survivor..Particularly good in the supporting stakes are Leah - as the out of control and attention-seeking Mama Cass addict, and Tony (who gets all of the funniest lines of the movie) as the hopeless but devoted boyfriend of Sandra.However the  film is peppered with star turns from all - even the extras!Hell! Even the hanging baskets are perfectly in character!This film withstands repeated viewing. It leaves you with a  warm glow and in unshakable romantic mind. This is the kind of film that disproves the they don't make 'em like they used to theory.They do make them like this...It's just that very few people know how anymore.... ...this film screams out both against the dull Hollywood Meg Ryan romances and against the kind of issue-led hate or anti-hate films that have been the staple of makers of gay films for too long.This film should be enjoyed by gay and straight people alike... It's an upbeat and joyous romance. No more. No less.Anyone who tells you the ending is unfeasibly upbeat is being a killjoy.

He listens to the radio, suspecting the odd, but the DJ's cover it up saying an airliner dropping parts.  Thinking nothing of it, Truman goes on, continuing his life in his little town, while the day, night, weather patterns, and even Truman's life is controlled by one man, Christoff (Harris) AKA, The Creator.  His pleasant life is disrupted, though, after odd things happen, his dead father comes back, a man Truman's never met before knows his name, an elevator has no back to it, etc.  He slowly catches on that his life is not what it seems to be.  With a fabulous Screenplay written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) this turns out to be one of those films where after you see it, you come out feeling good and thinking.  What if your world is like that?  Is your world like that?

He listens to the radio, suspecting the odd, but the DJ's cover it up saying an airliner dropping parts.  Thinking nothing of it, Truman goes on, continuing his life in his little town, while the day, night, weather patterns, and even Truman's life is controlled by one man, Christoff (Harris) AKA, The Creator.  His pleasant life is disrupted, though, after odd things happen, his dead father comes back, a man Truman's never met before knows his name, an elevator has no back to it, etc.  He slowly catches on that his life is not what it seems to be.  With a fabulous Screenplay written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) this turns out to be one of those films where after you see it, you come out feeling good and thinking.  What if your world is like that?  Is your world like that?  This movie is definitely Oscar bound, a sure fire nomination for Carrey in his second serious role, his first being in the fabulous made-for-TV-movie Doing Time on Maple Drive. The only snag is in the chance to see a talking butt give an acceptance speech is Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan.  But I still say, Free Truman!  A+We accept the reality with which we're presented.

On the one hand, I was excited, because you see, I am an English major and here was this movie based on the life of William Shakespeare. In the realm of Shakespeare rip-offs (i.e., Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, etc..)Shakespeare in Love clearly stood out. This is the first film I've seen based on the author, rather than his work. And it was a refreshing change from watching the pompous over-fed Hollywood egoes trying to pass themselves off as true actors. At the same time, however, the casting had me a bit nervous. I had not seen Joseph Fiennes work, but I had high hopes since his brother is, in my opinion, a brilliant actor. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow in Emma and Sliding Doors, but I was wary to see how she would pull this one off. And as for Ben Affleck.. well, I was truly afraid he would flop. I saw him in Armageddon and immediately racked him up on the list of other such forgettable actors as .. well never mind. The point is, I was afraid he would make a laughing-stock of this movie. As for the other actors,I did not recognize any one else except Judi Dench, and I figured hers was a bit role, nothing that could affect this movie much. I was wrong on almost all counts. Gwyneth Paltrow was so radiant in this movie, she fairly set the screen ablaze. I never knew she had such range. I had not expected such fire in her, I always thought she was a rather calm actress, incapable of such passions. Joseph Fiennes amazed me far more than his brother in that he knows how to balance wit and passion, joy and sorrow gracefully, even more so than Ralph. Together, these two actors did more than carry off the film; they raised it up to levels higher than any other actors I've seen in a very long time.  Judi Dench may have had a bit role, but she managed to make a lot out of it. She played Queen Elizabeth with more majesty and grace than any other Queen-playing actress I've seen. (I've yet to see Cate Blansett in the movie Elizabeth.)But the true darkhorse of this movie is Ben Affleck. My God, he has a sense of humor! I never imagined. Armageddon didn't give him much space to roam in, but in this film he was all over the place. Had he not been flanked by such worthy thespians, he just might have stolen the show. The actors could not have done such marvelous work had it not been, of course, for the writing. The play flows smoothly, with nary a glitch in sight. This is note-worthy, for it is well over 100 minutes. It is written in a style that is at once clever and grave, passionate and dry. Love is one of the most abused notions on the screen today. It is rare to see a movie portray Love with as much originality and truth as this film has accomplished. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay this movie I already did on Christmas night, when I went to go see this film. As the movie ended and the actors' names scrolled up on the screen, tears trickled down my cheeks. I must say it is not often a movie makes me cry. And don't underestimate me just because I am a girl and because I may be more sensitive because you see, my boyfriend left the theater with suspiciously bright eyes as well..

Don't get me wrong, I liked both films; I just feel they aren't even remotely comparable with Scream.  And, after seeing The Faculty advertised, I figured my intuition was correct.  I'm tired of the Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legend smart-ass college\/high school kids who save the day.  Maybe the teenage set get their kicks from watching this sort of thing, but I certainly don't.  I remember the old Michael Meyers (excluding the boring, trite H20 which had no murders after the opening scene until the climax), Freddy, Jason days where the kids got killed, and the adults saved the day.  I long for them again...but wait. I'm beginning to see a light at the end of this dark tunnel...because The Faculty actually entertained me! Maybe it was the entertainingly goofy script; but I believe I enjoyed this so much because it spoofs what Scream intended to startle us with.  As long as high school kids are going to save the day, adults should be the vilain.  Granted, there are exceptions, like I Know What You Did Last Summer; but even I Know Part 2 had a teenager behind the murders.  (Sorry if it seems like I'm giving away part of it's twist, so if you haven't seen it, don't worry; it stinks!)  Anyway, getting back to my point, I've always enjoyed films where kids outsmart the authority figure, Ferris Bueler, even the first Home Alone, and this one is no exception. Adults will like this because it's a reworking of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Puppet Masters (the latter being the more inferior film of the 3, remember there are 2 Invasion's).  The kids will enjoy its rich sense of humor and gore quotient; which isn't extreme, but enough to satisfy. Overall, the film contains Kevin Williamson's usual plot twists and maintains his sardonic sense of humor, (remember the ending of Scream? Are you going to tell my mom?) but also includes a less grim version of the goins on.  It may not be as clever or original, but its more satisfying. It's 140 minute running time helps as well, it's almost 25 minutes shorter and never drags.  The acting is adequate. Surprisingly, I liked Elijah Wood...but I hate that Josh (Harnett, or something like that) from H20; he's a boring mess of an actor.  Robert Patrick adds some fine supporting work as a football coach, he's worth the price of a ticket.  The Faculty delievers good time slasher fun. It should give this now dying genre a jump start. Just a word to the screen writers and studio execs., no more witty films with kids the star.  I'd like to see some adults in these things again. Blade and Vampires are good examples.  Both were succesful (Vampires, despite a $21 million gross opened at number one, and only cost $12 million) and I think the public would like to see more of these...except, of course, Scream 3.  I can't wait to see Neve finally get it!.Overall, The Faculty proves to be more fun than Scream, but with a more ludicrous script.

This is definitely not the movie to take seriously, it's just like From Dusk Till Dawn in the sense that it was just made to be fun.  However, like From Dusk Till Dawn, about half way through it feels like you are watching a completely different movie.The first hour of it is very much like anything Kevin Williamson has written before.  A lot of one liners, humor, and of course you have to guess who's behind everything that's going on.  Some of the dialogue and characters in it (especially Zeke) are definitely the best Williamson has ever written. Just like the original Scream you do care for some of the characters and another good aspect it shares with Scream is when you find out who the person(s) behind everything at the end are you aren't disappointed like you were in I Know What You Did Last Summer or especially Urban Legand.  Overall in the first hour it is very unpredictable (most of the shots you saw in the trailer are shown in the first 20 minutes of the film leaving you guessing what could happen next).The next 40 minutes or so are kind of disappointing.  In From Dusk Till Dawn the first half was like a real intense Pulp Fiction and then it turned into a hardcore vampire slayer movie.  In The Faculty, when the first hour feels similar to a science fiction version of Scream, the rest of it feels like The Relic only in a school and not a museum.  This dosen't mean it wasn't that entertaining, but some of the special effects went way to far (example Famke Jansen head crawling around).  So some of it feels a little chessy and some may feel it ruins the movie but some of the parts that happen in the last 40 minutes I loved (examples running to the car to get the drugs and the alien in the swimming pool).  In the last few parts of the movie some people in the theater were cheering and screaming while some others wanted to leave.The Faculty is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of Robert Rodreguez or Kevin Williamson there are things you will like about it.  The two best things about it were the soundtrack and the character Zeke (Robert Patrick was fun too).  But just keep in mind this is not a film you should be taking seriously, Kevin Williamson fans may not realize that but anyone who has seen Robert Rodreguez films knows that they are just fun, plain and simple.

A lot of one liners, humor, and of course you have to guess who's behind everything that's going on.  Some of the dialogue and characters in it (especially Zeke) are definitely the best Williamson has ever written. Just like the original Scream you do care for some of the characters and another good aspect it shares with Scream is when you find out who the person(s) behind everything at the end are you aren't disappointed like you were in I Know What You Did Last Summer or especially Urban Legand.  Overall in the first hour it is very unpredictable (most of the shots you saw in the trailer are shown in the first 20 minutes of the film leaving you guessing what could happen next).The next 40 minutes or so are kind of disappointing.  In From Dusk Till Dawn the first half was like a real intense Pulp Fiction and then it turned into a hardcore vampire slayer movie.  In The Faculty, when the first hour feels similar to a science fiction version of Scream, the rest of it feels like The Relic only in a school and not a museum.  This dosen't mean it wasn't that entertaining, but some of the special effects went way to far (example Famke Jansen head crawling around).  So some of it feels a little chessy and some may feel it ruins the movie but some of the parts that happen in the last 40 minutes I loved (examples running to the car to get the drugs and the alien in the swimming pool).  In the last few parts of the movie some people in the theater were cheering and screaming while some others wanted to leave.The Faculty is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of Robert Rodreguez or Kevin Williamson there are things you will like about it.  The two best things about it were the soundtrack and the character Zeke (Robert Patrick was fun too).  But just keep in mind this is not a film you should be taking seriously, Kevin Williamson fans may not realize that but anyone who has seen Robert Rodreguez films knows that they are just fun, plain and simple.

Its anti-parent, you-don't understand theme is dated.

He tries to save Plato, and you find yourself not caring about what happens to each character.I guess you have to say it is essential viewing, considering its status as an all-time classic and being one of only 3 films Dean made before his tragic death.
