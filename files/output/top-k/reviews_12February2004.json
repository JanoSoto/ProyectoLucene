Although some people might agree that this is not one of the very best Bond films ever made, it is certainly one of my favorites. Great cast too Izabella Scorupco is very well cast as Natalya Sean Bean makes an excellent Bond villain, Joe Don Baker, Famke Jassen, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Cumming are just some of the supporting cast, It is a shame that Robbie Coltrane isn't given more screen time as he gives a very good portrayal of ex-KGB agent Valantin Zukovsky. It was an interesting choice to choose Judi Dench as the new M, but it works very well in the film. Judi Dench plays M up until and including Die Another Day. Don't forget Desmond Llewelyn as Q, as we see inside his new workshop. (this is one of the more amusing scenes in the film) This film also contains one of my favorite action scenes, the tank chase in the streets of St. Petersburg. This action piece is well filmed and excellently directed by Martin Campbell. This film also contains a modern soundtrack by Eric Serra which work's well in thee film. In fact, I liked the soundtrack so much; I went out and bought a copy of it!Overall, in my opinion, this is a great Bond film and a great debut for Pierce Brosnan as 007, and defiantly one of the best James Bond films. I would rate this film 9 out of 10.

The planet that the aliens inhabit, LV426, is now the site of a large community of terra-formers who have set up an atmosphere processor on the lonely planet to get it ready for colonization. Little do they know who their neighbors are. When the company loses contact with the colony, they send Ripley in with a team of Colonial Space Marines to investigate. All out hell breaks loose.Possible spoilersAliens is without a doubt one of the best sequels ever made, and action movies period, which achieves it's success by taking the story in a different direction instead of remaking what's already been done before. James Cameron also adds his own additions to the story which make it even better. Cameron has proven over time that he is the only director worthy of being passed the torch of the Alien saga and that he is one of the very best directors for action films, if not the best. For many people including myself, this film is the conclusion of the Alien series, and I don't think I need to explain why.What we've got here is the same grotesque alien species we had in the first film, except there's a veritable army of the damn things led by an ultimately powerful Queen alien. We get to see how the aliens actually live, which is quite similar to an ant or termite colony, and find out how the facehuggers and eggs come about. Kudos to whoever designed the hive and the Queen. I know they were both inspired by Geiger, but I'm unsure if he was involved directly.I personally prefer the group of characters in this film as opposed to the previous one, but that may be because I think Michael Biehn's role as Corporal Hicks is such a standout. The guy was born to play a badass and does it with ease. Lance Henrickson as Bishop is also another noteworthy performance in which he portrays the dubious android. Paul Reiser is typically annoying in every sense, but that is his role here so it's not a bad point. Hudson (Paxton) and Vasquez are also enjoyable characters that get a few laughs going. Overall, a terrific cast.While Scott's Alien was more of a tension filled terror fest, meant to keep you on the edge of your seat with fear of the unknown and lurking danger, Aliens creates the same type and level of tension through incredible action sequences. I feel both are equal as far as entertainment goes, although they take entirely different approaches. Alien probably had more of an impact when it came out because nothing like it had ever been done before. However, I feel that Aliens does the same thing in the action department, and without being unrealistic like a lot of it's rivals in the same genre. Cameron's perfectionist style and attitude towards his work is all too realized here. The lighting is perfect, camera work is amazingly done, and the general mood and pace of the movie are controlled very well. There were some parts that were filmed in reverse to get a better effect, which is quite impressive in it's own right. He also succeeded in getting that spooky atmosphere just right as well that Scott had so carefully created.The story itself lets Ripley develop into a shade of a different character with the introduction of Newt, allowing her to develop some maternal instincts which she was devoid of in the first film. She once had a child, but hyper slept through her entire life and now has a second shot at being a mother again. This plays a huge part in her motivation and determination for becoming the badass with two guns, who delves almost fearlessly into the depths of the hive to save Newt. Weaver becomes the epitome of a movie heroine here, and I have yet to see her equal. This scene leads up to the face off of the two mothers and climax of the film. The classic and mother of all showdowns, coincidentally between two mothers. We have the alien mother, the Queen, fighting to save her eggs and brood against Ripley, who is fighting as a mother to save Newt's life. When Ripley torches most of the eggs, the Queen is now out for blood and vengeance. It all comes down to one of the coolest battles in movie history...Ripley in the power loader vs. the Queen alien. It will be hard for any action movie to ever compete with `Aliens', and it will be recognized as a landmark in cinema for some time for it's sheer brilliance, but not just for the action because this movie has more than that. There is only one other `action' movie in my mind that can stand close, which is Terminator 2, also from Cameron. If I had to pick, I'd chose `Aliens'. I can't see how anyone who likes sci-fi or action could not love this film. As good as it is and no matter how much I like it, this movie never would have become what it did had it not been for Ridley Scott's creation to build upon. I consider myself fairly discerning when it comes to action, but honestly I can't say anything bad about this film.With that said, this is easily in my Top 10 of all time.`Game over man, Game OVER!'

I really enjoyed this movie and thought this was a true quality film.  David Duchovny is in a nice departure from his X-Files days.  There is little if any actual violent content or gore in this film and the writing is next to impeccable in this original movie that is all around excellent.Duchovny's part is an animal specialist at a zoo in Chicago whose wife recently died.  Duchovny obviously feels horrible and is very reluctant to start dating again.  His wife donated his heart to a person after her death.  A woman takes her donated heart which saves her life.  Duchovny falls in love with the woman who has his wife's heart unbeknownst to both.Although the subject matter is pretty intense the movie is hardly what you call intense, offensive or heavy handed.  The movie is almost lighthearted, and really does not have a week moment. The entire cast does a remarkable job, and is quite a diverse cast, including David Alan Grier, Robert Loggia, Bonnie Hunt, and the grandmaster of television Carroll O'Connor.  Here, as the grandfather of Minnie Driver, who plays the woman with the donated heart.  As you might expect O'Connor steals the show as does Robert loggia, who plays one of O'Connor's buddies.The movie is so good because there are so many different sub-plots or different angles to the movie.  There is Bonnie Hunt's family who are goo friends with Driver's family, then there is David Alan Grier who provides excellent support, then there are what might be the funniest scenes in the movie as we see O'Connor and Loggia running a restaurant called O'Reilly's Italian restaurant, and we watch the two banter back and forth with their poker buddies.The movie has some funny moments, but it is not entirely a comedy, the movie has some sad moments, but it is not a movie that will make you cry, it is just a nicely put-together little film that will definitely entertain you.  I am sad that this movie did not get more exposure than it did. This was a very good film with a lot of great moments and an acting movie, no violence, the movie's strengths in the writing and the dialogue.

Duchovny obviously feels horrible and is very reluctant to start dating again.  His wife donated his heart to a person after her death.  A woman takes her donated heart which saves her life.  Duchovny falls in love with the woman who has his wife's heart unbeknownst to both.Although the subject matter is pretty intense the movie is hardly what you call intense, offensive or heavy handed.  The movie is almost lighthearted, and really does not have a week moment. The entire cast does a remarkable job, and is quite a diverse cast, including David Alan Grier, Robert Loggia, Bonnie Hunt, and the grandmaster of television Carroll O'Connor.  Here, as the grandfather of Minnie Driver, who plays the woman with the donated heart.  As you might expect O'Connor steals the show as does Robert loggia, who plays one of O'Connor's buddies.The movie is so good because there are so many different sub-plots or different angles to the movie.  There is Bonnie Hunt's family who are goo friends with Driver's family, then there is David Alan Grier who provides excellent support, then there are what might be the funniest scenes in the movie as we see O'Connor and Loggia running a restaurant called O'Reilly's Italian restaurant, and we watch the two banter back and forth with their poker buddies.The movie has some funny moments, but it is not entirely a comedy, the movie has some sad moments, but it is not a movie that will make you cry, it is just a nicely put-together little film that will definitely entertain you.  I am sad that this movie did not get more exposure than it did. This was a very good film with a lot of great moments and an acting movie, no violence, the movie's strengths in the writing and the dialogue.  Bonnie Hunt was the person mostly responsible for this movie and I think she did an excellent job as both director and writer.  I hope she does more work in film, if she makes more stuff like this I will almost watch any movie with her name on it.

We were 13, perfect age group for the film and we adored everything about this movie. It's years later and I bought the movie on DVD making me wonder if the movie did hold up as well as I remembered. Well, it doesn't hold the same magic as I saw when I was a kid, but Ever After still holds a certain charm that is absolutely irresistible. I think between the writing and the characters, this was a great update on a classic story. Every little girl has dreamed of being Cinderella, the girl who has been dumped on her whole life and then the man of your dreams comes to save you as you live happily ever after. Drew Barrymore takes lead through this charming fairy tale of a strong woman with the good faith that one day things will go as they should and she'd live in a utopia.Danielle de Barbarac is a young girl who lives in a manor with her widowed father whom she adores. When Danielle is eight, her father marries the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, who has two daughters about Danielle's age. Soon after, Auguste dies. Rodmilla is envious of Danielle, and treats her like a servant after Auguste's death. The Baroness has fallen into debt. Marguerite, her spoiled older daughter, has grown to be cruel, arrogant, and bad-tempered; while the younger, Jacqueline, is kindhearted, soft-spoken, and constantly overlooked. In the orchard one day, Danielle encounters a man attempting to steal her father's old horse. She pelts him with apples, knocking him to the ground, and is horrified to learn that the man is Henry, the Prince of France. Henry explains that his own horse was lamed in his attempt to escape stifling royal life. He forgives Danielle in exchange for her silence, and rewards her with money. Danielle resolves to use the money to rescue Maurice, an old family servant whom Rodmilla had sold. While her step-family is out of the house, Danielle dons a noblewoman's dress and goes to court. She finds Maurice about to be shipped to the Americas, and demands his release. Prince Henry sees this and is impressed with Danielle's intellect, strength of character, and beauty. Danielle refuses to tell Henry her name, though eventually she leaves him with the name of her mother, Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. Leading him to want to speak with her more only to fall in love with her not knowing that she is a true Cinderella.I still like this movie very much. Drew and the other actors may not have a great accent but they still all tried their best. Angelica Huston, what a great choice as the wicked step mother and I use that term lightly. There is this beautiful scene between her and Danielle, she starts to tell Danielle about her father and how Angelica barely knew him, you see a sense of humanity in her and then she starts to look at Danielle with love but realizes how hurt she still is that her father cared more for Danielle than his own wife. You understand how she could be angry and jealous, not justifying what she did to Danielle, but her motivation is understandable and I love the punishment she receives for what she did. There's still a scene that gets a great reaction from me, when Marguerite just spitefully tells Danielle how her mother is dead and Danielle just goes up to her and gives her one hell of a punch, I think that's when I fell in love with her! What strength was given to the character making the film more than just a happily ever after film, but a wonderful fairy tale with enjoyable characters, a wonderful romance, humor and most of all leaves you with a smile on your face.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2004","score":"27 out of 30 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember when this movie was released, I saw it so many times in the theater with my friends.

In my opinion, it should have a based on by line on it, it is that much like this work.Julie Harris is Nell. I remember her best as Reggie, the pipe-smoking medium from Stephen King's The Dark Half.

But I also highly enjoy the much despised remake, for all the beautiful CGI and other physical effects. EYE CANDY!But this one delivers some pretty fancy effects for 1963. Very nicely done. The dialog in Nell's mind was translated a bit over to Nell's character in the remake, but the atmosphere relied a lot on the effects there.

It's forgotten because it's not very good at all.John Badham is a very unpredictable director. He can turn out great films (Saturday Night Fever, The Hard Way) and very bad ones (Another Stakeout). The reason, I think, is because there is a very fine line between bad action films and good ones--if you try to explain the reasons that Speed works versus something such as Hard Rain (written by the same writer), it's hard to do. They both feature generally decent acting, generally original--and wholly unbelievable--ideas, and some good action scenes. So why is Speed so great and why is Hard Rain so bad?Some of Badham's films teeter on the brink of badness. With a few more action pieces and less funny moments of interaction between the two leads, The Hard Way could have suffered the fate of, say, Another Stakeout. But it turned out to be a genuinely funny and moving comedy with two likable stars doing the best they could to make the film a winner.Bird on a Wire has two likable leads but little else. The plot is all routine, and totally irrelevant. It's just a way to get Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn to run across America together and crack some bad jokes. It's a reason to see Goldie in a thong (again) and Mel's hairy butt (again). It's a reason to see them make out and to see some big explosions. It's a reason to see Mel Gibson do his gay barber impersonation and to see Goldie roll her eyes a lot at him. It's also a fine reason to see one of the only action showdowns set inside an artificial jungle at a zoo housing an assortment of wildlife creatures. Who thought this stuff up? Who in their right mind ever thought it would actually work?Does Bird on a Wire sound interesting to you?Well, it is, to a certain degree. It's generally a decent movie--something worth watching if nothing good is on TV some late Friday night. But this is not a good rental, and it's not even something I'd want to watch again--and I'm a pretty big Mel Gibson fan (Lethal Weapon all the way!).Mel is the relocated witness who testified against some drug lords (Bill Duke and John Carradine) who have just gotten out of prison and are now targeting him with the help of a corrupt FBI agent (Stephen Tobolowski, who played the pesky Ned in Groundhog Day, filmed three years later).Rick (Gibson) is going under the alias of a Louisiana redneck when his old girlfriend (Hawn) sees him working at a gas station and blows his cover. When she comes back later to check up on him, she foils the baddies' plans to kill Rick--and the two old love birds escape into the night, with Rick's real identity having been erased from the FBI records (is it as easy as just clicking a button? I hope not.).Essentially we get a lot of running and screaming and yelling and cheap wisecracks throughout the film, with an ending that stretches on too long before it just grows tiresome. It's like the climactic finale of The Third Man that takes place beneath the grimy sewers Vienna--except that Reed knew when to end that picture's climax, and Badham lets it go on too long.This movie could have been an exceptional road-buddy movie, but it's rather a disappointing blend of action and weak comedy that tries to take two of Hollywood's hottest leading stars (at the time) and place them together in some pointless situations. (Gibson is still one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood--what happened to Hawn?)I would only recommend something like Bird on a Wire if you happen to come across it late on night on television and you have nothing better to do with your time, or if you're a particularly big fan of either of the leading stars.

I hope not.).Essentially we get a lot of running and screaming and yelling and cheap wisecracks throughout the film, with an ending that stretches on too long before it just grows tiresome. It's like the climactic finale of The Third Man that takes place beneath the grimy sewers Vienna--except that Reed knew when to end that picture's climax, and Badham lets it go on too long.This movie could have been an exceptional road-buddy movie, but it's rather a disappointing blend of action and weak comedy that tries to take two of Hollywood's hottest leading stars (at the time) and place them together in some pointless situations. (Gibson is still one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood--what happened to Hawn?)I would only recommend something like Bird on a Wire if you happen to come across it late on night on television and you have nothing better to do with your time, or if you're a particularly big fan of either of the leading stars. Otherwise, just go watch Lethal Weapon or Just Like Old Times again--they're much better, and hey, they're actually funny.2.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":"Action, Comedy"},{"date":"12 February 2004","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Ever since I was a kid, I had watched The Neverending Story, which is an interesting title because the movie is only an hour and a half long. ) But I had always enjoyed the story and enchantment that the tale brought.

The movie starts out with a nightmare that Tommy Jarvis is having. You remember Tommy, played by Corey Feldman in Part 4, evidently he's grown up to a fabulous future as a mental patient. Thankfully, this was a dream, since it features two nutcases whooping and hollering as they dig Jason out of his grave, where he is buried under about 3-4 inches of soft dirt, and apparently buried wearing his hockey mask and with a stabbing weapon in each hand. Brilliant. Tommy awakens on the way to the mental hospital, around which most of the rest of the movies revolves.In the movie's defense, at least it wasn't yet another slopfest about a lot of teenagers going up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed just like we already knew they would. They are running out of inventive ways to cut up young people for that to drive yet another Friday the 13th installment. Unfortunately, they seem to have decided that since they added a few new gimmicks to the movies, like a mental hospital, a Jason impersonator, and some shockingly dirty rednecks, they didn't need to come up with any new death scenes. Not exactly the most intellectual necessity, but creative deaths are about 85% of what has always driven this series, and in this one we get more of the same boring killings - a machete pushed through the stomach (on two separate occasions in this movie, I think), slashes across the chest\/face, etc. In one scene, Jason plunges a pair on hedge-clippers through some poor girls eyes, but then they screwed it up because we get a shot upwards of his hands holding the clippers and roughly pushing them together, indicating that he had beheaded her. Then we see her and she was just stabbed through the eyes. Why include that shot if it's completely wrong as far as what he did to her?At any rate, the nutty people who inform the cast that they're all doomed are rather interesting as the above-mentioned dirty rednecks, except they run up to the cast when they're at the mental hospital surrounded by police (to find out why you have to watch the movie yourself), and they run up screaming threats, upset that there is a mental hospital filled with punk teenagers so close to their home. Pretty funny scene, except the woman threatens to kill the next person who comes near their house, then she expands her threat to include the police officers, then she informs the lot of them that she is currently strapped with dynamite and would blow them all to hell if they don't watch their step. Just so you know, if you threaten to even punch someone and there is a police officer within earshot, consider yourself arrested. A verbal threat is assault, and can land you in jail. This woman threatened to kill the kids, the police officer, and then to blow herself up, killing everyone in sight, and the cops just smile as she jumps on the motorcycle with her nutcase son and rides off with him, taking with her the dynamite and any respect I might have had for these cops.Later on, we see these rednecks at home as she is chopping up a chicken, screeching all the while, to feed to her idiot son, and they are approached by a man who knocks on the door, asking if they have any work he can do for some food (he hasn't eaten in two days), so she puts him to work cleaning out the chicken coop and then he can come back and get his stomach filled. Why was this guy in the movie at all? He literally serves absolutely no purpose other than to inform the audience that these people have a chicken coop that needs cleaning and so that he can be another person for Jason to kill. If they didn't think they had a large enough cast of teenagers for Jason to plow through, I would have suggested just adding a few more characters rather than adding in some wandering oddball in a wife-beater looking for a meal. Instead we have this guy with no part in the movie except that of a hungry victim.(spoilers) One of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film concerns her son, who gets beat up down at the mental hospital by Tommy, so he rides home on his motorcycle, screaming that those damn kids made him mad. Rather than going inside to express his anger to his mother, this ridiculous moron rides around the yard on his bike, spinning doughnuts and doing wheelies and screaming at the top of his lungs all the while, flying recklessly around the yard until he either slams into a tree, killing himself, or gets beheaded by a butcher knife that pops out of the bushes. We get the latter, but either would have been satisfying enough, as long as it shut that idiot up. The second of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film is the one where Demon, the older brother of one of the younger but more prominent characters in the movie, takes turns singing `Hey baby baby' over and over to his girlfriend on the other side of the craphouse wall. VERY romantic. On the other hand, what the hell else would you expect from someone with a name like Demon? I guess this was the only thing they could come up with I order to make Demon get concerned when his girlfriend stopped singing back to him. His death, however, was among the more interesting of all of the ones in the movie.Thus brings up a rather important plot point about this movie, that the killer in the hockey mask is not even Jason, but Jason being impersonated by someone, whose identity and motives are revealed at the end of the film after his pretty impressive death scene. Fans might be disappointed that it's not even Jason in this movie, since he was killed in Part 4, but that doesn't really matter for the most part, because even though it's really just some guy doing all the killing, he is still just as relentless, stolid, and basically impervious to damage as the original. He makes no sounds, doesn't run, and of course can't be killed until enough people have been killed to fulfill an hour and a half running time. This should have opened up a lot of possibilities for the movie, since the last time there was any element of mystery was in Part 1 when the real killer was not Jason Voorhees but his mother, seeking revenge against the kids who brought about the death of her son. But nope, the only mystery is that the killer is not really Jason, who the films makers decided to leave dead for this installment (viewers at the time of its release were probably expected to expect some sort of `Evil Never Dies' resurrection very soon to follow), but the ham-handed hints leave all but the most dense viewers very aware of the killer's real identity long before his mask ever comes off.This is surely one of the most hated of the Friday installments among the series' fans, most likely because the real Jason does not appear, but only in name, almost. For the entire film except for the scenes that hint at the killer's identity and the scene where his mask comes off at the end, he is the real Jason. He acts and moves exactly like him, so the basic attraction of the movie is there, I suppose, but it reminds me of the popular failure of Halloween III, the one which completely departed from the premise of the first two films, having absolutely nothing to do with Michael Meyers or Laurie Strode. They wisely returned to the original story in part IV, even going so far as to attach the subtitle `The Return of Michael Meyers' and put a big picture of his mask on the movie's poster. The next Friday film does exactly the same thing, adding on the subtitle `Jason lives,' as though to say, `Sorry about that last movie! He's alive in this one!' I love the subtlety of these movies.So this movie is probably considered by many people, such as myself, to be the worst installment in the series, but not only because it wasn't really Jason as the killer. That's probably only about 90% of the reason. The other 10% is things like the ones mentioned above. Logic is abandoned even more than in the other movies (Tommy, for example, is admitted to a mental hospital that not only exists in the exact location of the cause of his mental instability, but also allows him to keep such things as the horror movie masks that he made as a kid and, shockingly enough, a four-inch pocket-knife), a guy is introduced who has no part in the movie or the series other than to get killed, etc. But I think it remains a curiosity piece, in that it is so clearly an experiment by the filmmakers to try something a little different, have it fail miserably, and then promptly return to the general formula in the next movie.

The movie starts out with a nightmare that Tommy Jarvis is having. You remember Tommy, played by Corey Feldman in Part 4, evidently he's grown up to a fabulous future as a mental patient. Thankfully, this was a dream, since it features two nutcases whooping and hollering as they dig Jason out of his grave, where he is buried under about 3-4 inches of soft dirt, and apparently buried wearing his hockey mask and with a stabbing weapon in each hand. Brilliant. Tommy awakens on the way to the mental hospital, around which most of the rest of the movies revolves.In the movie's defense, at least it wasn't yet another slopfest about a lot of teenagers going up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed just like we already knew they would. They are running out of inventive ways to cut up young people for that to drive yet another Friday the 13th installment. Unfortunately, they seem to have decided that since they added a few new gimmicks to the movies, like a mental hospital, a Jason impersonator, and some shockingly dirty rednecks, they didn't need to come up with any new death scenes. Not exactly the most intellectual necessity, but creative deaths are about 85% of what has always driven this series, and in this one we get more of the same boring killings - a machete pushed through the stomach (on two separate occasions in this movie, I think), slashes across the chest\/face, etc. In one scene, Jason plunges a pair on hedge-clippers through some poor girls eyes, but then they screwed it up because we get a shot upwards of his hands holding the clippers and roughly pushing them together, indicating that he had beheaded her. Then we see her and she was just stabbed through the eyes. Why include that shot if it's completely wrong as far as what he did to her?At any rate, the nutty people who inform the cast that they're all doomed are rather interesting as the above-mentioned dirty rednecks, except they run up to the cast when they're at the mental hospital surrounded by police (to find out why you have to watch the movie yourself), and they run up screaming threats, upset that there is a mental hospital filled with punk teenagers so close to their home. Pretty funny scene, except the woman threatens to kill the next person who comes near their house, then she expands her threat to include the police officers, then she informs the lot of them that she is currently strapped with dynamite and would blow them all to hell if they don't watch their step. Just so you know, if you threaten to even punch someone and there is a police officer within earshot, consider yourself arrested. A verbal threat is assault, and can land you in jail. This woman threatened to kill the kids, the police officer, and then to blow herself up, killing everyone in sight, and the cops just smile as she jumps on the motorcycle with her nutcase son and rides off with him, taking with her the dynamite and any respect I might have had for these cops.Later on, we see these rednecks at home as she is chopping up a chicken, screeching all the while, to feed to her idiot son, and they are approached by a man who knocks on the door, asking if they have any work he can do for some food (he hasn't eaten in two days), so she puts him to work cleaning out the chicken coop and then he can come back and get his stomach filled.

How do Cuarón and his credit writer Mitch Glazer manage to retain such doubt in these spectators? After his escape the old gangster is caught and returned to the prison, where he is scheduled to be executed very soon. It is improbable that a convict with a death sentence could escape twice. Hence, the new version might include the radical innovation that the rich lady was indeed the benefactor. (I, for one, was never deceived). - - - The virtue to which I give the second place is Patrick Doyle's music. It is my honest conviction that we must go back to the 1960s and 1950s to find even one movie with music of a comparable beauty and congenial character. A few examples 'The lady with the dog', 'The cranes are flying', 'Last year in Marienbad', 'Muriel ou le temps d'un retour', 'Phaedra', 'Repulsion', 'A taste of honey', 'Asphalt Jungle', 'Miss Julie', 'Cybèle ou les dimanches de Ville d'Avray'. - - - I will not be able to rank all other virtues of the movie. But it is a fact that during the four months it was shown in the cinema in Stockholm I saw it 15 times. I may subsequently have seen it as many times on video, laser, or DVD. Probably I have not seen David Lean's version more than four times during 50 years. The local film reviewers of dailies had promised that Cuarón's movie had few positive qualities except beautiful pictures which may be more suitable for a commercial. Now, I have no great admiration of this profession, and I perceived genuine qualities almost from the beginning. But the first scene to overwhelm me as really great was the sequence when the children kiss each other. Cuarón applies a number of photographic and other devices, all of them adequate for achieving his purpose. During this sequence I felt However poor the rest of the movie may be, this scene alone will justify the inclusion of the entire film among significant movies. I never got the chance to test my thought because the subsequent movie was far from poor. - - - Other scenes or sequences that have spoken directly to my heart are, foremost, Estella's first visit in Finn's room; every detail of the long and heterogeneous sequence from the moment Estella tells Finn that Walter had asked her to marry him, and until Estella and Finn sleep with each other; and the scene when the rich lady tells Finn that Estella had just married Walter. - - - I imagine I have detected all physical errors of the movie (e.g., at the club Walter performs a quite different task without moving his lips, while his voice tells the story of the artist and the dog). But I do not think that they retract from the value of the movie. There is one more shortcoming I am also prepared to excuse. Alfonso Cuarón is evidently highly skilled in person directing. But if I may say so, Ethan Hawke has profited less than the others from Cuarón's skill. - - - A final word I know of no other instance in which so many works of art have been produced specifically for one certain movie.
