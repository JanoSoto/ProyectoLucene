It just was not what I expected it to be, a action movie. However the fact that the movie forces the viewer to question it, but the movie delivers when seeing it sometimes makes it better and more real, and this world is real. This movie's special effects still dazzle and while its not star wars(thank god)its not meant to dazzle, but still it dazzles! The scenery is just the best, in depicting a high tech but still a run down rathole LA, as we are raised to heaven at the tyrell corporations pyramid or run down abandoned buildings. Writing about scenery, this movie is a noir story with heavy drinking anti heroes and femme fatale(but no cardboard badguy since everyone is a hero in their sense)set in the future, but changing the time of place would still throw the whole thing of because of the movies theme. What does it mean to be human? And who is human? In terms of the matrix this has challenged me more because as a person i question myself and my role in society as to who i am, but i guess the matrix does that too to a point. Grade A acting, Harrison Ford does his best role, and his reasons for disliking this movie is entirely his own nothing with the movie itself, but the pain of the production of it.Scott is just a great director and as the reviewer before said he captures the mood perfectly, its a grim movie so it should be grim.

You were a big fan of the last two flicks, so you get a bunch of friends together and head for the theater, expecting another round of Michael Myers versus dumb teenagers action. But then the movie starts, and the famous theme music isn't playing. Michael is no where to be seen, and neither is Laurie Strode, the main heroine played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Wouldn't you be ticked off? See, that's why I understand how some people really hate Halloween III Season of the Witch. It has nothing to do with any of the other entries to the series, and is a pretty dumb B-movie. It's so poor in quality that another Halloween film wasn't made until 6 years later, the subtitle of which was The Return of Michael Myers. I guess the studio in charge wised up and went back to the formula. So what is this black sheep entry about? Well, it involves this company called Silver Shamrock, the head of which wants to kill millions of young trick-or-treaters with his popular line of seasonal masks. For some reason, at a certain time on Halloween night, all of the masks that he has sold will murder these kids and make bugs come out of their heads. Why? I don't know, it's never really explained. One kid who gets killed during a test has snakes and other rodents crawl out of his skull. Doesn't make a lick of sense, but I guess the filmmakers thought it would be a good gross-out moment. The main plot has to do with a doctor and the daughter of a man who was killed by the Shamrock company's men. They try and figure out what's going on behind closed doors and if they can stop the madman in charge of it all. We learn that the workers at Silver Shamrock are actually robots (???), and that the mass murder of children has to do with a sacrifice to the Druid gods. What??? I really don't understand the story here, since the whole sacrifice to the Druid thing is barely even discussed. The bad buy steals the Stonehenge rocks, brings them back to his headquarters, and plans to do...what exactly? I don't know, it's all very confusing and stupid. Two things really got to me during this movie First, the romance between the doctor and the woman felt extremely tacked on and pointless. The two barely know each other, and yet suddenly they're full on making love? Right. Plus the fact that they're romance is disgusting, since he's this greasy tub who can't be younger than 45 and she's this bony little girl who looks like she could still be in high school. In a word EEW. Secondly, I couldn't stand that commercial for Silver Shamrock. 8 more days 'til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween! 8 more days 'til Halloween, Silver Shamrock! Now imagine having to hear that about two dozen more times and you'll know where I'm coming from here. Oh, and the whole format of having a card saying, October 24, 25, etc. wasn't used to its full potential. They introduce the idea, then pretty much chuck it out the window. And it doesn't work right when whole days are shown in the span of literally one or two minutes. The suspense kind of goes downhill, ya know?

The reason possibly being this In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers and\/or directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!

The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

It might have been a bit shorter for what it had to say.I missed some minutes of the middle so I'm not sure how accurate my grasp of the plot was.  Basically it's an X-File script.  Incredible things happen to credible people.  Strange figures are glimpsed.  There are time lapses.  There is a consultation with an expert in historical legends who doesn't want to be involved but who explains to the hero that the Mothman is some sort of prognosticating archetype.  Telephone calls come out of nowhere predicting deaths.  (I think I'm getting signals myself right now, from The Omen.)  The ominous hints make sense, more or less, when they are drawn together at the end and a bridge over a river collapses amidst some well-done and convincing special effects.  I don't know why the hero (Gere), a reporter for the Washington Post, is drawn into the story or where he draws his resources from, such as the electronic analysis of the voices taped during a phone call that indicate the caller's voice was not made by a human being.  I don't know why the somewhat looney local resident (Will Patton) is given warnings about an earthquake somewhere in Equador, when he himself lives in some dinky town in West Virginia and can do nothing about it one way or the other.  I don't know why Patton's ear bleeds either.  Not even a glioblastoma would do that.  I'm not sure why Laura Linney was given a prophetic dream or why she considers it an unusual experience since it makes as much sense as any other dream, which is to say none at all.  In Laura Linney's case, I don't care.  She's about the least believable hometown hillbilly sheriff you can imagine but with her lustrous long blonde hair and plump cheeks and sculptured nose it doesn't matter.  Richard Gere, I'm happy to see, isn't the cocky energetic Macher that he was in so many of his earlier roles.  Here he gets to look amazed and, at times, shocked and frightened.  (When he's awed by something, he whispers.)  Gere was my supporting player in a flawless gem of a movie called No Mercy.  Will Patton was my supporting player in the superlative art-house cult classic, Everybody Wins.  Laura Linney, alas, was not my supporting player in anything.  Patton is an extremely interesting actor.  His speech is full of retroflex sibilants, so that when he says sickles, it sounds like Sssicklesss.  His Ss almost whistle like Jack Lemon's after he loses his capped tooth in The Out of Towners.  But he's more than just the sound of his voice.  Every gesture, every expression, is fascinating.

Everything about this film was perfect and I think that's why it received so many Oscar nods and wins, I mean, the costumes, the acting, the sets, the story was absolutely terrific and wonderful to watch. John Madden knew what he was doing and shot this film so beautifully. The cast also seemed to really enjoy doing this film and worked so well together. Gwyneth Paltrow won best actress for this film and she did a terrific job portraying Viola, she was so elegant and touching. The love story between her and William Shakespeare is truly a memorable one.Viola is a first class lady who is about to be married to Lord Wessex, a man who she does not love. Her heart belongs to poetry, mainly the poetry of William Shakespeare. William has lost all hope though when his heart is broken by his girlfriend and he is writing a comedy called Romeo and Ethyl, the pirate's daughter. Since the plays are only played by an all male cast, Viola dresses up as a man and auditions for his new play. She receives the part of Romeo; later that night at a big party her father is throwing, she meets Shakespeare and it is love at first sight. When William finds out the truth that she is the boy who loves his poetry, he doesn't care, they have a passionate affair and continue on with the play as if she were a boy. But the plot thickens and Viola knows that she must go back to her life of an unwanted love and marriage.Shakespeare in Love is without a doubt a fine film and should have a higher rating in my book.

It had a beautiful love story, it was funny, it was sad; there's nothing wrong with this film, but hey, everyone's a critic, right?

Aside from all the biased views and racial jargon this movie contained, it had something most generic westerns didn't.depth.  I was surprised to see so many twists and turns in a storyline from an early era of movie making; I was compelled to watch more.  The plot just kept thickening and by the end of the movie, I found myself nodding in approval.  This classic deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest westerns of all time due to its visual artistry it presents.The wonderful photography and cinematic `Doorway' shots brought life to the viewer's eyes.  It provided a visual feast with its colorful and scenic backgrounds contrasting with the pitch-black room in the same shot.  The eerie music playing in the background at times foreshadowed something was about to go awry.  John Wayne's character (Ethan Edwards) was more than enough for the audience to enjoy.  He was so complex and mysterious.  You could really see and feel the anger in his eyes when he saw a Comanche. His degrading comments against the Comanche often left you appalled and wondering if this racism is coming from Ethan Edwards or John Wayne.  But all in all, the believability was there.As far as the rest of the cast, the on screen chemistry between John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter was a perfect match.  The contrast between both of their characters kept a natural balance in the film.  As opposed to Ethan, Hunter's character (Martin Pawley) plays the protagonist of the duo.  He's the superego, if you will, of Ethan Edwards.  Even though he's a lot younger, he seems to be more mature since he can look past the skin color and race, unlike his Indian-hating counterpart.The story seemed to flow well.  Seeing all the bad hands that Ethan was dealt (His sister and older niece being murdered, Little Debbie being kidnapped, etc.) you couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor guy, which helped add more understanding of Ethan's character and why he hates the Comanche so much. It was completely preposterous in the screenwriter's part, for making not just Comanche, but all Indians look like uncivilized savages, but this is a Hollywood production and in order to have a good western, you've got to have a clear-cut bad guy.  One thing's for sure; this film had a great build all the way up to the end.  Here we have a guy, who hates Comanche so much, he would kill his own flesh and blood because she has been living with these people he despises, but at the very end, all that hate whither away because he realizes that she's not Comanche, she's his niece, she's family; and seeing the ending of the film where he's carrying Little Debbie home to safety instead of killing her is proof of that.  Bravo!Analyzing the film's storyline and comparing it to the ones that exist today, I'd say that The Searchers is just another cliché, set in the West. But you've got to remember that this was the 1950's, Days of Our Lives didn't exist.  This film has young and innocent women being kidnapped and murdered, a crazed uncle on a mission to kill his niece, and some love triangles here and there; this was practically a soap opera!  I've got to hand it to Ford, this film was complete, give or take a few convenient mishaps in the plot and some minor consistency errors. (Like when the time of the day kept changing from dusk to the afternoon to the dark evening during Edwards and the cavalry's charge against Scar's camp)But nonetheless, thousands of people can't be wrong.  This movie had everything you could ask for, drama, suspense, gun fights, comedy, believable acting, good script\/storyline and a little bit of romance. It's suitable to praise this film as one of the greatest westerns, if not movies, of all time.

The contrast between both of their characters kept a natural balance in the film.  As opposed to Ethan, Hunter's character (Martin Pawley) plays the protagonist of the duo.  He's the superego, if you will, of Ethan Edwards.  Even though he's a lot younger, he seems to be more mature since he can look past the skin color and race, unlike his Indian-hating counterpart.The story seemed to flow well.  Seeing all the bad hands that Ethan was dealt (His sister and older niece being murdered, Little Debbie being kidnapped, etc.) you couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor guy, which helped add more understanding of Ethan's character and why he hates the Comanche so much. It was completely preposterous in the screenwriter's part, for making not just Comanche, but all Indians look like uncivilized savages, but this is a Hollywood production and in order to have a good western, you've got to have a clear-cut bad guy.  One thing's for sure; this film had a great build all the way up to the end.  Here we have a guy, who hates Comanche so much, he would kill his own flesh and blood because she has been living with these people he despises, but at the very end, all that hate whither away because he realizes that she's not Comanche, she's his niece, she's family; and seeing the ending of the film where he's carrying Little Debbie home to safety instead of killing her is proof of that.  Bravo!Analyzing the film's storyline and comparing it to the ones that exist today, I'd say that The Searchers is just another cliché, set in the West. But you've got to remember that this was the 1950's, Days of Our Lives didn't exist.  This film has young and innocent women being kidnapped and murdered, a crazed uncle on a mission to kill his niece, and some love triangles here and there; this was practically a soap opera!  I've got to hand it to Ford, this film was complete, give or take a few convenient mishaps in the plot and some minor consistency errors. (Like when the time of the day kept changing from dusk to the afternoon to the dark evening during Edwards and the cavalry's charge against Scar's camp)But nonetheless, thousands of people can't be wrong.  This movie had everything you could ask for, drama, suspense, gun fights, comedy, believable acting, good script\/storyline and a little bit of romance. It's suitable to praise this film as one of the greatest westerns, if not movies, of all time.  ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"23 November 2003","score":"","review":"  Back when all the cowboys rode on nothing but horses and the Comanche `terrorized' the land, we have John Wayne as Ethan Edwards on a 5-year mission in Texas to find the bloodthirsty Comanche known as Scar (Henry Brandon) who has kidnapped his youngest niece Debbie (Natalie Wood) and murdered his sister and her family. Aside from all the biased views and racial jargon this movie contained, it had something most generic westerns didn't.depth.  I was surprised to see so many twists and turns in a storyline from an early era of movie making; I was compelled to watch more.  The plot just kept thickening and by the end of the movie, I found myself nodding in approval.  This classic deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest westerns of all time due to its visual artistry it presents.The wonderful photography and cinematic `Doorway' shots brought life to the viewer's eyes.  It provided a visual feast with its colorful and scenic backgrounds contrasting with the pitch-black room in the same shot.  The eerie music playing in the background at times foreshadowed something was about to go awry.  John Wayne's character (Ethan Edwards) was more than enough for the audience to enjoy.  He was so complex and mysterious.  You could really see and feel the anger in his eyes when he saw a Comanche.
