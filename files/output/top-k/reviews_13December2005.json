The ape actors could have been doing voice-overs for animatronics for all the make-up let them emote, which I hadn't felt in the original movie, and Roth's voice really got into the role (he'd turned down the Snapes role in the Harry Potter movie for this?).But sound was the best part of the movie, and it was really loud.

Over 20 years later it has stood the test of time. Of course the VFX are outdated but I'll take REAL LOCATIONS over CGI backgrounds any day. The acting is solid and the story is very well written. This is one of Liam Neesons first movies although he meets his demise in the Black Fortress. Wonderful sword and sorcery type stuff. When first released critics panned it saying it was a cheap rip-off of Star Wars. Being an avid Star Wars fan I never agreed with that comparison. KRULL is easily in the top 10 maybe top 5 all-time best Fantasy movies. An incredible cast is complimented with a beautiful soundtrack done by the famous James Horner. Peter Suschitsky, who was the DP for Empire Strikes Back, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Red Planet, is the Cinematographer and does a fantastic job of lighting and setting the mood for the film. The Slayers are some of the coolest bad guys ever. In my opinion better than Orcs and Goblins. The Beast is genuinely scary. The narrator eludes to possible sequels which I would still love to see, considering how popular the genre is right now. Who knows, maybe they will make a couple of sequels. I love this movie.

Jor-El, a member of the high counsel there, along with his wife, decide to send their son, Kal-El, to planet Earth so he may live. Once there Kal-El (Clark Kent) gets adopted by nice elderly folks who look after him. It's clear from day one that this is no ordinary boy for he's got superhuman strength. When his father dies Kent heads north and discovers his legacy in an ice palace built by a glacier in his possession.Fast forward a few years, Clark is working for the Daily Planet in Metropolis, falls head over heels in love with gutsy fellow reporter Lois Lane and in between assumes the role of Superman whenever he is needed. But keeping his alter ego as Clark Kent firmly intact.Director Richard Donner makes a truly spectacular film here. The story, written by Mario Puzo who also wrote The Godfather, takes it's sweet time to really get going, allowing the audience to fully get to know the background of Superman. It's a gutsy move really, modern audiences seem to find the film terribly slow moving, but I think this is what makes it all the better. In many ways, the hour plus before Superman even graces the screen is perhaps even better than what follows.Still, when our hero does finally show the film is non stop action and adventure. In it's digitally restored DVD edition, the film looks truly spectacular, amazing special effects considering the time of it's release and an overall joyful adventure in Saturday matin√©e fashion that's missing from today's Superhero movies.The script is very good and performances are terrific. Christopher Reeve quite simply IS Superman, this role made him and no one can do this role better than he did. Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor, Superman's nasty villain. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty are very amusing as Luthor's helpers. Margot Kidder is very likable as Lois Lane, Superman's love interest, but somehow I can't help thinking that a better actress could have been found.Superman is my personal favorite in the Superhero movies department, Batman and Spider-Man are simply inferior.

This is a repetitive statement, to be sure.

With these points of start, 'Soldiers' fails to be a gripping movie and even the story is completely full of outrageous flaws; for example, the people who lived in the abandoned planet, who are they? why are they there?.The movie is just a tiresome conflict between the old soldier (played by Russel) and the genetic crafted soldier (played by Jason Scott Lee). Maybe the movie wanted to tell a story about the eternal battle between the old values and new values, tradition and technology, and these are good issues to be told in a movie. But the result is a violent movie that loses completely its direction, a story without intensity and, most of all, intelligence.
