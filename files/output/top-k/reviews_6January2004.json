The screenwriter, Richard Curtis, is the deserved king of Brit romantic comedy (deserved based on his films' box office success), so when this came on tv the other night (Jan., 2004), I thought I would watch to see how the master does it.  I had remembered thinking when I first saw it that it was an excellent light entertainment that was so tightly and inventively written that it went beyond light into meaningful.  But, ten years later, it doesn't hold up so well.  Not that it's bad, it's just so slight.  I attribute this partly to the structure--it's hard to bring out much character in the three weddings and funeral that occur prior to the finale wedding\/denouemont--but mainly I attribute it's slightness to the fact that we don't know much about Andie MacDowell's character... other than she's a bit of a slut.  I realize she's written to be mysterious, at least I presume that's what it is, and she plays everything she is given, so my quarrel isn't with her performance, it's just that she goes directly into sex after barely even talking to Hugh Grant, and I mean barely.  Yes they meet at the first wedding, and have a few near misses there and one later at their hotel, but then she invites him up for a drinky and immediately they go boom boom.  Okay, fine, maybe she's not easy and just had a fling.  But then she does it again later, but this time she's engaged!  And she's engaged to a guy the movie has shown to be a shallow sot.  But we never see any other side of her than the sleep-around, marry-someone-wrong-for-her-side.   Other than being charming and lovely, she isn't given anything especially redeeming, or really anything at all, meaning her character isn't just slutty, but deeply shallow.  So why care if Hugh Grant ends up with her?  What's the big attraction other than her her looks (and her hat)?  She's probably very, very good in the sack, but that's not enough to keep us interested as an audience.  Overall, her character's lack of depth, at least as she is drawn, is a huge flaw in this movie and prevents it from being anything remotely close to a classic.  It's flawed fluff, with good patches of writing and good performances.

At that time its miniturisation and other special effects would have been amzing.The clean scientific lab, the miniturising of the submarine and lead characters, set the scene for a fanastic voyage.At that time I did not appreciate the talents of Raquel Welch, nor the requirement to have a resident bad character played by Donald Pleasance. The suspense was created by the time constraints and the growing bacteria.The scenes showing the scuba-diving in the blood, or lympathetic, system was very impressionable.Aged about mid 30's in mid 1990'sDuring the next twenty odd years I would have seen the film 4-5 times. As I better knew the storylines I tended to focus on the characters. Obviously Raquel Welch became the main point of interest wearing a skintight swimsuit. As an aside Angelina Jolie in the Lara Croft role would have a similar effect.Although nowadays there are more sophiscated special effects, it nonetheless remains a very good film, with suspense, drama played out by a great cast.It was very good technically in that it referred to the use of laser techology, something we now take for granted.RecommendationIf it comes up on TV suggest watch it, especially if you have not seen it for 15-20 years. If like me you first saw it as a young boy I am sure that your focus from that time would have changed.Good viewing ","genre":null},{"date":"6 January 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  First viewed-Aged 10-13 early 1970'sThe first time I saw this film it would probably have been the early 1970's when aged around 10-13.
