[{"date":"9 December 1998","score":"","review":"  Unfortunately the film depicts Elizabeth as someone to whom the crown descended as a surprise. Nothing in her characterization reveals the depth of her previous learning or that she was indeed schooled to become queen. She was not a country lass frolicking on the hillside. Likewise, William Cecil, Lord Burghley is depicted as little more than an errand boy to Elizabeth, whereas in reality he was a very powerful shaper and mover of events, with constant interaction between himself and other powerful lords.. Sir Francis Walsingham is at least revealed as the cunning, determined and decisive man that he was (as the originator of the British secret intelligence service); but his motives in promoting Elizabeth never appear. As a consequence of these hollownesses, the characters, clad in all the finery possible, remain shallow. On a more technical level, there are some cute and pointless camera tricks and blinding moments, such as when Elizabeth hears of her ascension or when she dances, that draw attention to themselves without advancing the story or the characters. The nice thing is that there will still be other opportunities to tell this story and do it better.

It possesses top-notch SFX, production values, and costuming. However, its storyline and acting (or overacting?) fall completely short. Kilmer is physically captivating and imposing as Batman, but his Bruce Wayne is flat and wooden.  Carrey is great as his version of the Riddler, but no where near as intriguing visually or emotionally as his comic book counterpart.  Jones is at his best as Two-Face, but unfortunately, he is underused and underwritten.  O'Donnell is fine as the post pubescent Robin, but a Boy Wonder he isn't.  Action packed and fast paced, Batman Forever is a good departure from the sickening darkness of its predecessor, Batman Returns, but still far from perfect.

If Verhoeven felt that this movie was necessary, a very poor decision, couldn't he have least given it a different title instead of making us think that we might see an adaptation worthy of the novel.  Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way that Verhoeven so badly misread the original text.  To be honest, I am not sure that he had ever seen the original text or he would have made a different, better movie.  I had high hopes for this movie since Starship Troopers is one of the few Heinlein novels amenable to an adaptation to the screen.  Unfortunately what I got was this puerile and juvenile piece of cinematic trash.  Even the special effects, which aren't as good as I had heard, do not make this movie worthwhile.  Avoid this one like the plague.
