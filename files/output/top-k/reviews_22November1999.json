I still liked `The Haunting' on the basis of its production value, which is top-notch.  One of the biggest problems with `The Haunting' was the script, which was a mess.  The story was all over the place, the dialogue was poorly written.  It did have a creepy mood to it, but the scares were few and far between and the ending was ridiculous.Now, about `The House on Haunted Hill,' it wasn't gargantually better than the aforementioned film, but it was scarier.  I got that impression from the opening scene, which was gory and somewhat frightening.  Geoffrey Rush shows a lot of range in his performances.  Here, he seems to play a role that has `James Woods' written all over it.  Also joining the cast is Famke Janssen of `GoldenEye.'  I am still trying to figure out how good of an actress she is, for she gives very good and very bad performances, depending on the quality of the script.  Once again, Taye Diggs is on board.  (This film opened one week after `The Best Man.'  This film was #1 at the box office and `The Best Man' was #2.  Very interesting.)  I must say that I truly despise Chris Kattan of `SNL' fame.  His last film, `A Night at the Roxbury,' is one of the worst films ever made and I am quite annoyed with his presence.  Here, he doesn't even come close to redeeming himself for that piece of cinematic trash but buries himself deeper.  Oh, well.  Anyway, because of its modest budget, we are deprived of the huge special effects that were so occupied with `The Haunting.'  There are a few nice special effects, although the effects in the ending aren't the highlight of the story and are almost as ludicrous and uneven as `The Haunting.'  I am recommending this because it has a few effective jump scenes, some nice twists, interesting characters and a couple moments of sheer suspense.

I truly don't understand some people's opinions though.  I gave it a 10.  I can understand that not everybody thinks it should get a 10, but some people actually gave it a 1 or 2, etc...  How someone can rate it that low completely puzzles me.Everything about this movie was great.  The scenery, sound effects, and music were great.  The acting was great, as was the humor, horror, and mystery.  I saw it on November 2'nd and had to see it again on November 19'th.  I even liked it better the second time.  It certainly seemed that everybody in the theater thought it was great.  There was a lot of crowd reaction.  The things I personally liked the most were the twisted plot and wonderful looking set.  The headless horseman's raw power was great too. It's a lot more interesting watching him ride after his victims than it is to watch a guy with a chainsaw or hook chasing someone.  It was like a mysterious world that everything happened in.  I loved the foggy, misty atmosphere and spooky music.The one thing that shows how great it is is that Roger Ebert gave it 3 and 1\/2 stars!

Tim Robbins plays a superb psychopath, so normal in so many ways, but still very creepy. Jeff Bridges is also excellent as the unwilling participant in Tim Robbins games. What is really great about this film, is that the setting is so normal, like an ordinary suburban neighborhood, but behind the normality there is something very sinister. The film plays with this, draws it out and slowly unravels the plot, piecing together the puzzle. Its not difficult to guess the plot as such, but the ending will definitely leave you breathless.

Visually stunning, representing just what the late 1700s looked like (if it were always dark and gloomy ;)). The acting was very good and Depp did a great job in playing between the boundries of the original Crane character in that, not really a bad guy but overall just a kindof cultured sissy-boy (that's NOT a generalisation) who is just as scared as you or I but knows he has to rise to the occasion eventually anyway. In the book, Crane was always a wimp for the most part.The only thing that bugged me was that the plot as it finally really developed in the end was a bit over-dramatic, maybe too fantastic, not to the point of making it bad, I just think it drew away from an otherwise dark, disturbing and even scarier than I'd presumed, movie would be when I first saw the trailer. I liked the movie, (8\/10) and then again I didn't like it for one sole reason.  If you take the movie as what it is, the movie in itself, in that, lets presume there was never the original story, then I liked it quite a lot. But me, I must admit, I'm too retentive to not be annoyed at the drastic changes between what Burton envisioned and the real story by Irving.  Outside of the character names, location and their being a horseman, this movie and the original story are quite quite different.  Not a big deal really as it doesn't make this a BAD movie, again, the movie in itself I enjoyed quite a bit, but I couldn't get over, and its just my pet peeve, the  differences.  Things like this always bug me so while I vent please bare with me that its just my opinion.

I still don't like it P, but I can understand it and I TRY not to let that ruin my enjoyment of the MOVIE.  I try to take them as two seperate entities.

Too, I'm a total Drew Barrymore fan, damned, let me die just for a smile of this goddess.

The script, even if it contains some good jokes, was often that embarrassing that I couldn't even watch the screen. Instead I looked to the ground. The final end was that unlogical, supercorny and bad, that I thought about running out of the cinema crying out loud, for I couldn't stand it anymore. In fact, thinking of leaving the cinema was one of my main occupations during this picture.But even more unbelieveable than the script was Drews acting.It was absolutely horrible!! I really was shocked!!Of course it looked very cute for she wore her sweet sugar smile during half of the movie. But that looked often like an excuse oh sorry I have no clue how I should act right now. And she really had none. When she should be a pedantic newspaper editor which can't accept even the tiniest kind of chaos around herself, she smiled instead. When she talked to her assistant which shows no respect to her at all, again she just smiled. And so on, during the whole movie.I had never thought of Drew as being such an acting giant like, for example, Sarah Polley, or Alison Eastwood, but she was never bad, instead she had been better than before in every film in the past. For example, in my last years absolute favorite movie, Wedding Singer, her acting was fantastic.But here I've no idea how the director even could accept some of these scenes this way. Was it because Drew was producer ? Or was he fallen in love to her and was therefore unable to criticize this beauty ?The acting of the rest of the crew was mixed, but in general good.

Another good thing about this movie where the clothes Drew weared throughout this picture, they where often very amusing.At the end of the movie, I saw that the script authors where two very young people (maybe teens ?).

Some scenes where not that bad, for example the one on the ferris wheel. But the script in general lacked something like dramatical realism, surprises, coolness, or other kinds of entertaining structures. It was too much like a bad teacher, too moral in a really uncool, unrealistic, boring, pedantic and finally simply embarrassing way.If you an absolute fan of Drew just like me, no warning could keep you from watching this, but everyone else should better, for example, kiss your beloved for two hours instead.

Then to the cruise liner where the four main characters are based. It is a story narrated and told by Oscar, played by Peter Coyote, who is wheelchair-bound, to Nigel, played by Hugh Grant, a man he meets on the cruise. Nigel is intrigued by an entwining and serpentine tale Oscar tells him, and so are we, and even though it starts to sound incredulous, he has to return to Oscar's quarters to hear more. The tale is so engrossing because it concerns Oscar's beautiful, sultry and seductive wife, Mimi, played mesmerisingly by Emmanuelle Seigner. Oscar is entranced at first with her and delves into all kinds of sexual games, then his passion for her begins to subside and he rejects her and leaves her alone on a plane. All the while Nigel's wife (Kristin Scott-Thomas) is becoming disillusioned with Nigel's fascination with Mimi and Oscar. I do not want to unveil anymore, just to implore you to watch this film and let it mesmerise you, like it did me.

It is a story narrated and told by Oscar, played by Peter Coyote, who is wheelchair-bound, to Nigel, played by Hugh Grant, a man he meets on the cruise. Nigel is intrigued by an entwining and serpentine tale Oscar tells him, and so are we, and even though it starts to sound incredulous, he has to return to Oscar's quarters to hear more. The tale is so engrossing because it concerns Oscar's beautiful, sultry and seductive wife, Mimi, played mesmerisingly by Emmanuelle Seigner. Oscar is entranced at first with her and delves into all kinds of sexual games, then his passion for her begins to subside and he rejects her and leaves her alone on a plane. All the while Nigel's wife (Kristin Scott-Thomas) is becoming disillusioned with Nigel's fascination with Mimi and Oscar. I do not want to unveil anymore, just to implore you to watch this film and let it mesmerise you, like it did me.

As most people should know by now, the Bond series has been around for so long that it's developed its own set of rules. Plot credibility can sometimes be thrown straight out the window during the action sequences. In short, the more suspenseful and over-the-top, the better. As long as the latest Bond flick plays by the rules and makes things interesting throughout its running time, it deserves a thumbs up, and this one certainly fits the bill. Because we can judge Bond movies by totally different standards, it doesn't matter that the ending makes absolutely no sense. In fact, the one most obvious flaw in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is the villian. Renard is pretty cool, but he suffers from lack of sufficient screen time, and he's simply not as memorable as Alec Trevelyan (Goldeneye) or Elliot Carver (Tomorrow Never Dies). Thus, I could almost feel myself asking for more in the climactic struggle, which falls short of the material that leads up to it.      But anyway, there are many good things that significantly outweigh that villian-related shortcoming. For one, the action is all top notch. We have a speedboat chase, a ski slope sequence with go-kart-like vehicles, a high-speed bomb defusing chase in an oil pipeline, and a very well executed sequence featuring Bond on the attack from helicopters with tremendously oversized buzzsaws. The energy level is consistently high throughout. Also, newcomer R was quite amusing, and M has her biggest role to date. Pierce Brosnan is excellent as usual, only this time, Bond seems more cold and ruthless than in the previous two outings. Both Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards are attractive and deliver solid performances (the former had some truly memorable scenes, I must admit). All in all, this latest Bond outing applies the traditional formula and delivers the basic goods that audiences crave, and thus I rate it a 7.5 out of 10. ) ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 1999","score":"","review":"  I just saw TWINE yesterday, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it.

After seeing the whole trilogy and the DEKALOG, I'm convinced at Kieslowski's great talent, and his very early death was a true blow to world cinema.  Much like Kubrick but with a less ironic nature, Kieslowski loves to make his characters and stories both humanely distant, realistic, and, at the same time, philosophically idealist and dense.  I enjoyed BLEU more than BLANC (which was an odd machismic entry in a trilogy mainly focusing on women) but not as much as ROUGE, which I feel is one of the finest, most beautiful, most well-done films I've ever seen.More specifically, BLEU's focus seems to be on the relationship of a woman's loss of the tactile manifestation of her husband's existance with the ligering notions of his life - especially his music, which pervades the entire film, interrupting at key moments with a blackout and short blast of the overture.  To watch Julie struggle with her husband's abandoned secrets (including a mistress Julie befriends) is shattering, frustrating, and perplexing.Unfortunately, life must move, and, due to that, I can't watch BLEU over and over.  However, I did glean from one viewing the complexity of this picture, and recognize its need to be watched over and over, until Kieslowski's last gasps can be properly understood, which is all we can hope to return to a man whose genius was tragically cut short, but still stands as a giant in my view of cinema.
