But those are other movies, yet to be review by me. In this case I chose one of the best horror movies of all times, The Shining. This review will be divided in three parts you will see below.PLOT The plot is very Kubrick like. The novel has been written by Stephen King, a master of terror. Jack Torrance moves with his family to an old hotel to the be keeper for the winter. Everything looks perfect, until the father ( Jack ) turns into something like an imaginative alcoholic. The booze brought problems in the past, he hurt Danny (the son) in his shoulder while being drunk. Danny is a very important part of the film, he has supernatural habilities, even an imaginary friend named Tony. That's why he starts seeing strange things in the hotel. Then it all develops in the most scary movie I've ever seen. As you can see, the plot promises to be really freaky. But how does the viewer get scared?. We all know the low budget ( and sometimes high budget films ) with the monster and all the makeup, that doesn't really scare no one. That's why The Shining makes an art of visual effects.VISUAL EFFECTS Can you get scared if you see nothing? Depends on the screenplay. In this case, every single sentence is superb, all together make this script into a masterpiece. The creepy monster doesn't appear and we feel the fear in the air. The sutil appearances of the visions and phantoms make this movie better that any othe that spent millons of dollars on make-up. It all seems very natural. Something you will not regret the pool of blood. That was probably one of teh high moments visual effects in this film. But how can we see the fear? It's in the faces, it's all in the faces.PERFORMANCES Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, psycho dad. Shelley Duvall as Winifred, Alias Wendy Torrance. And Danny Lloyd as the boy, the key to the whole drama. You can see in Nicholson's face he's really mad. The psycho part, really good. To express fear, we have Shelley Duvall. Later we would see her in The Portrait of a Lady. I can see in her face that she's really scared, and i trust her expression, because I really got scared. Danny is the mistery. He's boy in this case, and this is one of the few movies he made. But he acts very well. Danny, you have an A, and so does this movie. Peaz, out.

Well, you can bet it came home with me.  I wore out four copies of it before my son was born in the early nineties. Soon as he saw it, he too was hooked and five years later it is a staple.The story is pretty simple.  A man inherits a haunted house and must discover the secret of it before time runs out. But it is so much deeper. There is the wide eyed innocent, his son, the heroine in danger, his daughter. The support, his wife, and villains that have nothing at all to do with ghosts.  Plus Margaret Hamilton who is just the best at looking like she'd rather take a bite out of your face as look at you.You, a bowl of popcorn and 13 ghosts in a dark room and you too will see the brilliance of William Castle.

Well, you can bet it came home with me.  I wore out four copies of it before my son was born in the early nineties. Soon as he saw it, he too was hooked and five years later it is a staple.The story is pretty simple.  A man inherits a haunted house and must discover the secret of it before time runs out. But it is so much deeper. There is the wide eyed innocent, his son, the heroine in danger, his daughter. The support, his wife, and villains that have nothing at all to do with ghosts.  Plus Margaret Hamilton who is just the best at looking like she'd rather take a bite out of your face as look at you.You, a bowl of popcorn and 13 ghosts in a dark room and you too will see the brilliance of William Castle.  Even without the special glasses, this movie is cool.

And I probably wouldn't have gone if she wasn't, but I am so glad that I did. Aniston plays Justine, who works at a store called the Retail Rodeo which she described in an interview with Jay Leno as a store that is not quite a Wal-Mart not quite a Target. Justine is married to a plot smoking house painter named Phil, played by John C. Reilly. Her and Phil are trying to have a baby but can't cause one of them isn't fertile. She isn't happy with her life and ends up making a lot of bad choices, one of the bad choice for example is having an affair with a 22 year old who calls himself Holden (after his favorite book The Catcher In The Rye) who also works at the Retail Rodeo played by Jake Gyllenhaal. This movie was so great and Aniston was great in it steering clear of the whole Rachel persona. What I thought Jennifer brought to this film was her charm, you see your suppose to hate her, but you somehow love her. I would recommend this movie who anyone who wants to see a movie with a point and an outstanding cast. I can already here her acceptance speech at next years Oscars.
