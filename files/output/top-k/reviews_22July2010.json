It is filmed, or so it appears, purely for the entertainment value. That, in itself, is not bad, but because of the lack of true focus and insight on the part of the director, the film suffers tremendously. Here, Brad Pitt plays the part of Death...but, really, at this point of time in cinematic history, no one is afraid of him. Not really. And though Pitt is an excellent actor, he is not able to pull off an authoritative performance, one that demands fear from those he encounters because of Death's cold finality, and because of the ensuing questions as to the afterlife and what one's fate could possibly be in that afterlife. I would not expect the director to give us a shot-by-shot repeat of the original...as did some unfortunate director who gave us a needless play-by-play of Psycho some years back...but there were opportunities that were missed to make this a film above the cut. And any film with Anthony Hopkins has that possibility. Talent is wasted in this one, as are opportunities to make the picture rise above the fray by mere virtue of situational possibilities that could have gone in virtually any direction...but which failed to do so. First, I feel it was a mistake to make the main character one who has lived a fairly charmed and privileged life, who does not struggle with moral and philosophical issues on a 'hand to mouth' basis daily. Where is the redemptive value in inspecting the life of someone who flies into Manhattan in his own helicopter to a private helipad, to go to his office in the midst of Wall Street to a board meeting on the top floors of some corporate structure to a meeting with his board of directors? I don't see much --if any-- redemptive value there. Second, it seems that a role reversal might have served this movie well. Brad Pitt--at this time--did not have the authoritative presence that such a terrifying spectre as death should possess. People are very much afraid of death...the fear of the unknown. But clearly, the presence of death in non-threatening form is incredible waste, and its meaning is lost on both the performers and the audience if it fails to score and make its deadly presence known and felt. This was a true failing. Hopkins could have done this, and, indeed, he has done it before...Hannibal Lector is one of the classic movie villains, and Hopkins gave Lector that life and presence. One of the missed opportunities was witnessed in the boardroom when Drew--a very arrogant character--demanded to know just who Joe Black was and why he seemed to have a strangle-hold on Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish. The way the scene was handled, without giving away the identity and purpose of Joe Black was, at that critical moment, a big letdown...almost an act of cinematic cowardice on the part of the director. It really took the steam out of the sails. Plus...that character needed to be brought down a few notches, and Death would have been the ideal one to accomplish this...but it never really happened to my satisfaction. It was one of the most dis-appointing moments of the movie, a real low. This movie had the potential to be something far more than what it wound up being. Maybe someone might try it again, and there may be something of a more fluid flow of ideas...but the writers got stuck in the mud...the direction was wooden, stoic, not multi-directional and all encompassing. Because of this, the film implodes under the weight of its own imperfections. I really wanted to like this movie..and I expected more. I cannot recommend it very highly...and I would advise a watching of the Fredric March version to get a real feel of what is going on before you tread the murky waters of Meet Joe Black.

There's something about that mix of British accents, suit wearing and wine drinking combined with secret agent espionage, ass kicking and world saving that calls for a response in me. At the end of a Bond film, I always want to change my career to become a 00 Agent. I sit down and realistically brain storm as to how I can achieve this. I might start a military career, then join the FBI or CIA, and then sit down with some of the higher ups and say to them, look, I know you guys have a 00 Agent like position, and I would really like to try out for it, if I can't make it, well, then you can kill me, since this is my dream anyway. And then I snap out of it, of course, as the movie's charm fades away. But Bond films are always special to me, and when they get it right, everything just seems that much less silly.Goldeneye is one of the ones that got it right. It brought us both Martin Campbell's debut as a director for the Bond series, and Pierce Brosnan as Bond himself. Both are respectively great for the Bond films. Martin Campbell shows us that he knows how to direct a movie. Pierce Brosnan is who I think of when I think of James Bond. The character Bond, in my opinion, should be a tactful, yet wild fellow. A man who is soft spoken, but his actions weigh heavily on those around him. He is a man who gets the job done quietly, and when he speaks, he says a lot. Yeah, OK, maybe the guy (Bond) is kind of like my role model, but I think Brosnan did a great job in portraying him, and it's clear that he was a good choice.Bond films have always had a major problem with them They are essentially B movies. The villains are silly, the dialogue can be cheesy, the plot is usually goofy and over the top. Goldeneye has all of these problems, but also gives us a bit more. Goldeneye offers more in the departments of direction and cinematography than you would expect out of a Bond film. There are scenes in the movie, such as a character's face being obscured by shadows just before he steps out into the light, revealing his identity. And a close-up shot where a door opens, revealing Bond's face behind it which makes it seem like a scene transitioned from side to side. For all its problems, Goldeneye more than makes up for them. In the intro scene where Bond jumps off a dam while the film's signature music is playing, you will be convinced that this Bond film seems promising.After Goldeneye, Bond films became milked and were essentially all about what we look for in Bond films on a sub-intelligent level. Women used as pornography, luxurious cars, witty gadgets, and gunfire with explosions. Bond was transformed from a one man team to a one man army. What I love about Goldeneye is that it doesn't suffer from this. It's a Bond film where the filmmakers wanted to make a good film, not just a Bond film for the sake of being one. Goldeneye will satisfy you if you're a Bond fan, but also if you're a fan of good cinema as well.

Christopher Nolan, the greatest film maker alive, has done better films. It's a Nolan film that isn't like a Nolan film. But yet I was amazed by it. As he always seems to do with every one of his films. This one isn't a mind bender. It's a mind messer.Pacino plays Detective Will Dormer, a detective with a secret past. When he travels down to Alaska to investigate a teen's murder, he accidentally kills his partner. And frames the killer of the teen so then when they catch him he will be put on death row.When he meets Finch(played terrificly by Robin Williams, who had a villianish year that year), he finds out that he shares something in common with him.

It's Jim Carroll's story of how he grew up in high school among a love for basketball and heroin, and poetry when he could. He had talents, but the film's goal is to show that someone who is smart and bright and outgoing can destroy themselves, and when given the right dramatic heft and actor presence it can rise above possible After-School Special trappings. Basketball Diaries helped launch a couple of careers, and give a few good ones a little more room to work, and it doesn't spare characters who went into oblivion either by death or overdose or jail.I think what works for me seeing the film again- it had been years before and only in small chunks, remembering a song here (The Doors' Riders on the Storm in staggering slow-motion as the guys on downers fumble a game) or a performance there (Mark Wahlberg in his first serious dramatic performance as Jim's scuzzy friend Mickey)- is the attitude and the dedication to the artistry behind the message. It could be a self-serious portrait, or just too exploitive, but the filmmaker finds a good middle-ground to work with. We know early on what makes Jim so depressed and anxious, the death of a close friend (to cancer, played in a few really remarkable scenes by Michael Imperioli), and the only significant fault is to see how quickly Jim jumps from that death to drugs. The film, if anything, could be a little longer.But seeing how DiCaprio pulls off Carroll is one of the thrills of the picture. It's not always easy to get into the state of a drug-addled youth, and as Jim he gets deep into what makes him clever and resourceful and how his own worst enemy overtakes him. I'm reminded of The Panic in Needle Park, where we get to see a whole sort of degraded sub-culture that looks too low for the main characters, at first, and then becomes their entire world. Again, other New York actors get to shine in spots (Lorraine Bracco gets her spotlight as she kicks Jim out of her house, and Bruno Kirby gets a weird supporting role as the Coach on the team with something to hide), and the film gets in some rather dark humor in a few spots such as a hyped-up basketball game played at night in the rain and put to Carroll's own band's song (Die Die!). Yet I kept coming back to DiCaprio, his star power and magnetism, and how he commanded the film in both Jim's high points and deep dark lows.So, you can watch it for the message, which is fairly cut and dry and deep down isn't very deep, or you can watch it for its craft and its attempt to rise above itself to be about a place and state of mind, real people affected by addiction and betrayal and despair. Certainly it has one of the best coming off of junk scenes with a small part for Ernie Hudson.

Holly (Michelle Williams) is the intellectual one and Marina (Anna Friel) is the wild one. It follows their lives from being children in 1973 to grown women in 2001 and how their close friendship degenerates into disturbing co-dependency.The best things about this film are its smart observations of the rising and falling tides of life and how it lets the performers stretch themselves in the moment. The story recognizes that people flourish and languish at different times in their lives, that they aren't static or standing still. As a child, Holly is clearly the follower to Marina's leader but when they get to college, Marina is the directionless party girl while Holly is the one with her life in order. And as young adults, it is Holly who's stuck in a rut while Marina's life is moving forward. That also allows both actresses a chance to develop their characters into real people, establishing a core identity but also showing us how those people are both changed by time and circumstance, yet remain the same in fundamental good and bad ways. Without having to service a plot, the characters can develop an organic sense of realism.But the real life stylings of the story also hamper the film. It's all well and good to create complex and intriguing characters, but then you have to do something with them. That's where the plot comes in, giving a sense of purpose and direction that doesn't usually exist in real life. It connects all the action and behavior together as it moves from beginning to conclusion. Movies like Me Without You consciously avoid linear, propulsive storytelling&#x85;and they usually run into a problem as some point. In this movie, it comes as it shifts from Holly and Marina as college students to adults.The film is able to rely on the natural events of growth and development from childhood to young adulthood to give the story some structure. That sort of self-evident direction doesn't exist as grown-ups, though. There aren't that many definable moments that flow from one to another in a coherent pattern. In Me Without You, that results in the film having to introduce a bunch of really arbitrary elements to Holly and Marina's lives, things that don't naturally flow from what we've seen of the characters up until then.Another interesting thing about this film is how it demonstrates the difference between movie nudity in the American and British cinema. When someone gets naked in an American movie, there's almost always a purpose for it. It may be salacious and sleazy or it may have a genuine artistic point, but characters in American films get naked because someone wanted them to get naked at that point in the film. In British and European films, thought, nudity is often portrayed as though it were accidental or happenstance. The actors are naked just because they're in a situation where people would normally be naked and there's no effort made to cover up. They'll sit up in bed, the covers will slip down and&#x85;whoops, there's a nipple! Whether that's a more enlightened approach to movie nudity is up to each viewer to decide for themselves.Me Without You is one of those films that you'll enjoy if you buy into the characters and become invested in how their lives turn out. It asks for an emotional commitment from its audience. But if you just want to be entertained and not bothered by a movie, this probably isn't what you're looking for.

He keeps growing smaller and smaller every day, to the amazement of doctors and to the chagrin of his wife (Randy Stuart). Soon everyday things become grave dangers to him and he has to completely let go of his old way of comprehending his place in life.The over-sized props and the creative trick photography that is used to create the illusion of shrinking must have looked absolutely stunning in the 1950s when the film first came out, because they still look impressive when I'm typing this in 2010. Carey's struggles with unexpected sources of terror like a cat, a mousetrap or a spider haven't lost any of their charm over the decades they are still edge-of-your-seat suspense, and I'm not saying this as any kind of affirmative action in favour of old movies &#x96; I genuinely haven't been this thrilled by a movie in a long time! Besides the visual effects, the riveting music is also perfectly in tune with the thrilling style of the film.Even though the film can easily be enjoyed as a great sci-fi suspense film, there's also a deeper, more personal level to it.

He is aware of his frustration and changing moods and scolds himself for being rude to his wife and not being able to take the new challenges bravely head-on. The sense of loneliness, created excellently with beautiful black & white cinematography and camera angles, has been said to mirror the fearful atmosphere of the Cold War and the nuclear era. This is a valid interpretation, but it's also possible to see Carey's journey as a symbol of Man's existential despair and feelings of inadequacy in life that is seemingly normal and mundane. The grandiose finale provides a majestic ending for the tale of new-found self-esteem; all my worries about a predictably tacked-on happy ending were proved unnecessary.I wrote this review immediately after seeing the film for the first time. These words came out completely without effort and that is, to me, a sign of an honestly compelling cinematic experience.

The grandiose finale provides a majestic ending for the tale of new-found self-esteem; all my worries about a predictably tacked-on happy ending were proved unnecessary.I wrote this review immediately after seeing the film for the first time. These words came out completely without effort and that is, to me, a sign of an honestly compelling cinematic experience. The Incredible Shrinking Man is a delight to watch, not the least bit goofy or dated like some other old sci-fi films. I recommend it for every fan of the genre, admirers of imaginative special effects and anyone interested in existential character studies.

I was actually groaning aloud while witnessing the bad acting on display as soon as this movie opened. And things looked like they were about to get a hell of a lot worse with a sub-Showgirls moment of unerotic, sexual writhing. Then a werewolf appeared and some blood was thrown around . . . . and my interest was piqued once again.Moving on from that, Bad Moon introduces the viewer to Janet (Mariel Hemmingway), her son Brett (Mason Gamble aka the boy who was Dennis on screen) and their loyal dog, Thor. Into this small unit comes Janet's brother Ted (Michael Pare), the man involved in the opening unerotic, sexual writhing and werewolf carnage. Thor doesn't really like Ted and it's not too long until everyone, apart from those on screen, knows exactly where the animosity springs from.Director Eric Red is not a bad guy. He's provided those who saw it with the brilliance of Cohen & Tate and he also wrote The Hitcher, a long-time favourite of mine. But here, perhaps because he's adapting from the source novel named Thor by Wayne Smith, he feels a little boxed in and restrained. Seeing the title of the source material on screen certainly prepares the viewer for the focus of the movie as the brave family dog goes about the business of trying to keep loved ones safe. The film plays out like some Joe Dante-infused blend of Cat's Eye, Fluke and Silver Bullet which hinders it initially but then makes for a snappy, and highly enjoyable, second half.Acting aside, as it's frankly not worth mentioning anyway, we can judge this first and foremost as a creature feature. In that respect, does it deliver something worth seeing? I'd have to say that it does. Mixing practical make-up, camera trickery and some nice little tricks and cheats here and there, the main beastie is both handsome (in a beastly way) and ferocious. It may not be up there with the best that this particular subgenre has to offer but it's no pathetic piñata either.So, in summation, the movie overcomes many faults to be something enjoyable and worthy of inclusion in anyone's nostalgic list of movies they inexplicably enjoy.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"22 July 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets &#x96; voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience &#x96; and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot &#x96; we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence &#x96; no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top.

Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets &#x96; voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience &#x96; and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot &#x96; we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence &#x96; no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top.

We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday.

This controversial film has been accused of being anti-Turkish, while simultaneously serving as a potent warning to those who want to smuggle drugs across borders. The truth is, it is a mixture of the two.The most involving character in the film is the prison itself, which as a society seems to form a living organism in its own right. Isolated from the rest of the world, the prison develops its own economy and mores, in essence becoming a type of microcosm. Indeed, at times I found myself wishing the filmmakers would go into more detail on the functioning of this captive community.Although there is a great deal of brutality in the film, at times the Turkish prison comes across as more humane than its Western counterparts. Inmates are allowed to keep their own clothes, and do not appear to be put to hard labor. This does not excuse the brutality depicted, but does provide a counterpoint to accusations that the movie is uniformly anti-Turkish.Furthermore, contrary to statements by some reviewers, there are actually some sympathetic Turkish characters in the film. For instance, it is made clear that the judge only sentences Hayes to a long term because of the inflexibility of Turkish law. The accusations seem to stem from the fact that many of the villainous characters, such as the guard Hamid, are underdeveloped. We do not see their motivations for cruelty, so that they seem to be caricatures.One flaw of the film, a symptom of the time it was made, is its squeamish treatment of homosexuality within the prison. Although it is clear that prisoners resort to homosexuality, the film refuses to go into any detail, other than a rather clichéd implied romance between Hayes and another prisoner. Ultimately though, the film's main flaw, aside from those mentioned above, is the rather histrionic script from Oliver Stone. The bombast overwhelms the film at times. Nevertheless, it is still worth a view.
