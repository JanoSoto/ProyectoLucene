He manhandles Ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. Ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what he did in Paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet. I forgave you that! she says, as if it was big of her.For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his mistress before tying the knot for good.

Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight American morality, but can't really do much more with it than a jokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing.Lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see.

The transition is seamless though, not only because some of his Westerns contained military characters and war as their backdrop, or the opportunity it gives him for gripping bloody action, but perhaps most crucially because it enables him to explore his favourite themes in a new setting.As usual with Peckinpah, foremost among the themes of this film are men, their loyalty to one another, a team of hard-bitten old stagers fighting a losing battle buffeted by forces beyond their control, and sticking to your code in a brutal world. James Coburn is brilliant as Steiner, ably supported by a range of character actors as his comrades in the trenches, with a great international cast providing their support, including James Mason, David Warner and Maximilian Schell as Steiner's antagonist, the ambitious but devious Stransky.To Peckinpah's eternal credit though, while telling his story of rough men in a rougher world, he gives a superbly detailed account of the squalor, fear, brutality and futility of the war on the Russian front. Although not blessed with the budget and technical advances of later classics like Saving Private Ryan, it gets across the scale of the fighting, and also captures the atmosphere perfectly. The Peckinpah style is very suited to the subject, shooting at different speeds, not flinching from depicting bloody action and alternating between tension, explosive violence and the daily life of the men.This is a very hard-hitting account of the way with a number of scenes that are quite difficult to watch, and the overall tone is grim. However, the story is more than compelling enough to have you on the edge of your seat watching Steiner's platoon struggle, no longer for victory but just for survival.Unfortunately it was also beset by the problems which Peckinpah's films frequently encountered. The director's own alcohol and personal problems made filming difficult at times, the international co-production had financial difficulties and as usual, the producers disagreed with Peckinpah on final cut and the theatrical version is not exactly what Peckinpah intended to show. Having said that, having scoured the world (my latest DVD version is the South Korean release) for the complete version, it's pretty close to what Peckinpah wanted to put out, resulted in a tremendous film and did well enough to spawn a sequel. It still begs the question though why did those behind the scenes in films treat Peckinpah the way they did? Yes, he was difficult and didn't compromise, but every director's cut of his films was far superior to the producer\/executive's version, with the money and time he needed he always delivered, and I would go as far as to say he was never wrong about what should go in a film.Cross of Iron is perhaps the last film he made where in spite of any problems most of his vision made it to the screen, and the last where he was at the top of his game.

It's a movie within a movie, that focuses around some of the cast and crew from the original A Nightmare on Elm Street who are being haunted by the 'real' Freddy Krueger this time. It was fun seeing Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund and Wes Craven all playing themselves and talking about the Elm Street movies.It's a real refreshing movie that picks a totally different approach and story this time but also a different Freddy. This Freddy is more dark and killer like. The Robert Englund Krueger from the previous was more playful with his victims. The Freddy Krueger in this movie is still being played by Robert Englund though by the way.It's funny that all of the A Nightmare on Elm Street movies which Wes Craven had been directly involved with as a director or writer, or both, are also among the best out of the series. Craven returned for this movie as a director and it's also easily one of the better directed movies, when compared to the other sequels. The movie is greatly horror like with its approach and overall execution of things. It shows that Craven is a real expert, who's best years are perhaps long behind him but he still more than capable of directing a decent horror film, with also plenty of originality and passion for the genre to it.As an horror movie this is simply being a good one.

What I do want to describe, however, is the amazing artistic quality of this film that is now roughly fifteen years old at the time of me writing this review. The first feature length animated film, upon its release Toy Story didn't settle for this title; rather, it made its own legacy and is still now perhaps one of the greatest animated films ever made.In Toy Story, it seems that Pixar don't miss a trick; there are gags on gags in all manners, from visual jokes and easter eggs to the wit of the dialogue. These characters, these toys, really do feel human. The themes the film deals with, the most prominent being jealousy, are conveyed through the toys in Andy's room as if Toy Story were a live action drama. We all can relate to the core concept of the film; which of us didn't imagine our toys coming to life like this when we were younger?Watching Toy Story in 3D shows that despite this new technology where we can watch the latest releases in eye-popping 3D, a film will always be as enjoyable in the standard two dimensions if it as well made as Toy Story.
