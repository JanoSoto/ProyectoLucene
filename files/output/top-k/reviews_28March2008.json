It is so ingenious and creative in every aspect that it is a triumph. The invention by Allen of the fictitious Emmet Ray is truly a stroke of genius. Sean Penn's performance as Emmet Ray is also one of his best, coming just before one of his other best, in the next film which he made, 'Up at the Villa'. Penn is a brilliant actor who is probably tops when he is being 'low life'. But in this film he shows an unexpected talent for whimsical comedy as well. He also clearly plays the guitar for real. What a treat it all is. The film is thoroughly delightful from beginning to end. Samantha Morton is marvellous as the mute girl Hattie, heart-rending in her silent simplicity with her angelic smile. Uma Thurman does one of her magnificent wild impersonations, being one of those awful intellectual vamps who want to know what goes through a killer's mind when he pulls the trigger to 'rub somebody out' (no, that's not Sean Penn he merely shoots rats). Uma Thurman clearly had a lot of fun, and was allowed to go over the top sometimes, but then, why not? After all, this is a satire. But it is sad as well as funny, and poignant in its insights into a man who is psychologically stunted and emotionally handicapped, while being a musical genius. The ending is truly tragic. In this film, Allen's love of jazz, profound interest in human character, and effervescent humour and whimsy come to the boil all at the same time. He must have a charmed egg-timer or an enchanted stop-watch. Or maybe it's both? Let no one say he is uncoordinated ever again. He has everything working at once in perfect synch. Toscanini couldn't control that many things at once. Let's face it, Woody Allen, apart from all his other attributes, is one hell of a pro.

The characters that he chooses to put forward to the audience as protagonists are archetypes of social and political caricatures that we would find in that particular decade; but heightened to conform to the over-the-top opulence\/pestilence found central to the plot. His ability to craft characters and situations that resonate beyond the context of a particular scenario, coupled with his bitterness and unwillingness to conform is what sets him up as a satirist of serious note. He also elevates the film beyond the realms of mere art-house experimentation by fashioning a seriously funny script, which has ample opportunities for central character Albert Spica to prove himself the ultimate charismatic bully - part cockney hard man, part pantomime villain - who is never less than compulsively terrifying.The plot is a simple construct centred on the theme of revenge and the need for personal freedom. This is mixed in with the socio-political undertones as well as Greenaway's many references to art, theatre, film and literature. It is also elevated by the impeccable cinematic qualities that we hold synonymous with the director's work. Everything here is about pushing things beyond the reasonable limitations; so we have a stunningly intricate set that is both theatrically simplistic, but also as other-worldly as anything from the work of say Gilliam or Jeunet. The costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier scream over-the-top chic, whilst often mirroring the use of colour employed by the production designers. Greenaway even breaks continuity by having Helen Mirren's costumes change colour as she moves through each room of the restaurant, so that we have a green dress in the kitchen, a red dress in the dinning area (inspired by Hitchcock's vertigo no less) and a white dress in the lavatory. It's an audacious move, but one that pays off in the creation of a completely self-contained world; something that is further established by Sacha Vierny's sumptuous cinematography and the wonderfully bombastic music of the ever-excellent Michael Nyman.Some have clearly found the film's various abstractions problematic (yes, it is theatrical, yes it is occasionally shocking, and yes, it does evolve in a world of its own ostentatious creation). But it's also as artistic a film as you can get; a fact that some here have disputed. The reason that some define this as artistic refers to the use of colour, light and composition. The architecture of the sets too, and the way in which the production designers have chosen to dress them also adds to the artistic stylisation of the film. These factors are important to the narrative, as they are symbolic to what Greenaway is trying to convey, as well as what the characters are all about. Because of this, the design of the film becomes AS important as the framework, if not more so. But this film is more than a mere arty exploration; it's funny and intelligent and features a slew of great performances from a wonderfully eclectic cast. Michael Gambon as the thief Spica gives a grandstand performance to rival his own Phillip Marlow from The Singing Detective; hamming things up spectacularly but still retaining that much needed sense of humanity. The same can be said of the other principals too.Mirren as the wife exudes a quite and restrained sexuality in what must be her best performance, whist Richard Bohringer as the cook is in some represents the linchpin\/catalyst for the film. Elsewhere we find everyone from Tim Roth to Ian Dury popping up to give the film some added character and easily furthering the film's already cult appeal. This was a turning point for Greenaway; a move towards the more expressive, elaborate and self-contained style of film-making found in films like Prospero's Books and the Baby of Maçon and away from the more easy to digest classics like the Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers and A Zed and Two Noughts.

Small New England seaside town Amity is moving normally towards summer when, out of nowhere comes a killer shark. Not seen until halfway through the film, the shark is an ominous, almost omnipotent presence felt throughout the entire film, even from the beginning.An attractive young girl is swimming and gets taken in one of the great opening scenes in film history. She feels something bite her, drag her in all directions, then she disappears underwater. Her boyfriend reports her missing and her body is found by local police the next morning all chewed up and spit out along the shore. The Amity police chief is Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider in his greatest film role). When he and his deputy find the body, they immediately quarantine the beach and post signs to stay away, but the Mayor (played effectively by Murray Hamilton) will have none of that since local businesses will lose lots of money during the tourist season if the beaches are closed. The beaches stay open and a young boy is killed by the shark on the first day of tourist season.It appears as if some of the local fisherman have caught 'the shark' when a oceanographic expert on sharks named Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss in a totally winning and expert performance) shows up in Amity to assist Chief Brody in finding and catching the real shark. Hooper immediately does an autopsy of the girl eaten in the opening scene and verifies that a 'great white shark' did this. One of the many memorable great lines of this film come shooting out of his mouth 'This was not a boating accident!' The day Hooper arrives, while all the fisherman are patting themselves on the back and everyone is celebrating the shark 'capture', something unexpected happens. The mother of the boy that was killed, dressed in all black funeral garb, walks up to Chief Brody and slaps him for not closing the beaches even though he knew a man-eating shark was out there (of course we know this isn't all his fault). This one scene has always stuck out with me from the film. It is very realistic and shows how people can really take their grief and anger out on the wrong person, but this moment served as a kind of closure for the woman and as a wake-up call for Brody. From this moment on, Brody takes everything that Hooper says seriously and wants to be sure that the real shark is still not out there.Hooper does indeed verify to Brody that the shark is still out there by cutting open the captured shark and verifying no signs of human consumption. But the stubborn mayor still keeps the beaches open not believing them. As expected, the shark attacks again, this time almost killing Brody's son. NOW the Mayor has to pay attention. A town meeting is held and Brody and the Mayor tell them they need to hire professional shark hunters. Then another great moment occurs. An annoying, screeching sound is heard. It's a man scraping a blackboard with his fingernails to get everyone's attention. That man is Quint (played by Robert Shaw in a role that he should forever be remembered for). Quint is a local fisherman who is extremely knowledgeable about the sea and sharks (we'll find out why later) says he'll catch the shark for the right price. Eventually they agree and Brody, Hooper, and Quint (reluctantly) join forces to go after the great white.The adventure begins. The 3 men go after the great white in Quint's boat. An uneasy alliance forms amongst the 3 men, as they each argue with each other and get on each other's nerves early on. Quint is old school and thinks all of Hooper's technical equipment is hogwash, while Hooper thinks Quint is too rigid and primitive. Brody is like a 3rd wheel as he's not a seamen at all and he hates the water! At a totally unexpected moment, THE SHARK appears, then Brody in a frozen state slowly walks back towards Quint and says 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' (maybe the best line in film history). This is followed by one of my all time favorite film sequences as the 3 men scramble to do what each of them do best to kill the shark. They fail at first, but slowly bond during the trip. One night, while drunk, Quint and Hooper compare sea scars, then Quint tells the story of how he got this one scar while he was a sailor on the USS Indianapolis which got bombed and sank while he and his fellow survivors were stuck in shark-infested waters waiting for rescue. This dialogue is famous for being completely scripted by Robert Shaw himself and he delivers it perfectly.Needless to say, they get one final chance to catch the shark and in this long sequence that climaxes the film, the tension builds from moment to moment as they try everything to catch the shark and as the shark goes all out in trying to eat up the men and the boat itself. A great movie.This, for me, is Steven Spielberg's best directorial effort. I love his later work too, but JAWS is a perfect film. Not a weak moment in it. I love the Hitchcockian elements of building tension and suspense, the Kubrickian elements of overlapping dialogue and long scenes that are totally enthralling and not boring, the great background music, and quotable, memorable dialogue. Ironic that this perfect film inspired all the fake, unrealistic, over-the-top, unsuspenseful summer crap they make nowadays. JAWS should never be mistaken as one of these films.It was nominated for Best Picture in 1975 (should have won) and won the 3 other Oscars it was nominated for (Editing, Sound, and of course Score).

At a totally unexpected moment, THE SHARK appears, then Brody in a frozen state slowly walks back towards Quint and says 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' (maybe the best line in film history). This is followed by one of my all time favorite film sequences as the 3 men scramble to do what each of them do best to kill the shark. They fail at first, but slowly bond during the trip. One night, while drunk, Quint and Hooper compare sea scars, then Quint tells the story of how he got this one scar while he was a sailor on the USS Indianapolis which got bombed and sank while he and his fellow survivors were stuck in shark-infested waters waiting for rescue. This dialogue is famous for being completely scripted by Robert Shaw himself and he delivers it perfectly.Needless to say, they get one final chance to catch the shark and in this long sequence that climaxes the film, the tension builds from moment to moment as they try everything to catch the shark and as the shark goes all out in trying to eat up the men and the boat itself. A great movie.This, for me, is Steven Spielberg's best directorial effort. I love his later work too, but JAWS is a perfect film. Not a weak moment in it. I love the Hitchcockian elements of building tension and suspense, the Kubrickian elements of overlapping dialogue and long scenes that are totally enthralling and not boring, the great background music, and quotable, memorable dialogue. Ironic that this perfect film inspired all the fake, unrealistic, over-the-top, unsuspenseful summer crap they make nowadays. JAWS should never be mistaken as one of these films.It was nominated for Best Picture in 1975 (should have won) and won the 3 other Oscars it was nominated for (Editing, Sound, and of course Score). Spielberg was robbed by not even getting a Best Director nom.

I saw it simply because it's a cult classic, and everyone has to see it at sometime or another. Suffice it to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is the acting superb, but the storyline is brilliantly pieced together and the characters are equally well-developed. It is truly a beautiful journey.James Dean's brilliantly subtle portrayal of a troubled teen is perfect &#150; while some of the lines are a bit melodramatic and could be terrible if performed by the wrong actor, James Dean makes them not only believable, but extremely effective. He doesn't even have to speak to let you know what he's thinking. You can just feel it.One of the things I thought was great about this film is that James Dean's character, Jim Stark, is not your regular Hollywood bad-boy. He's not just going around looking for a good time, and he's certainly not looking for trouble, as the title seems to suggest. Like any of us teens, Jim has made big mistakes in his life, but unlike some of us, he genuinely wants to do the right thing. He's surprisingly sensitive and sincere; which, as Judy (Natalie Wood) states, is just the trouble.Weird as it may sound, I absolutely love Sal Mineo's character, Plato, and the way the film portrays him. One of the first things we hear Plato say is, No one can help me. He tries so hard to be accepted, and finally finds a friend in Jim. Even though lots of people say there are homosexual innuendos here, I don't believe there are. Plato's need for attention spawns from his neglectful parents &#150; which, as Jim points out, are who he tries to turn Jim and Judy into. He even says several times that he wishes Jim were his father. A truly tragic character, Plato will go to any length to get the affection he was always denied.Though mostly about the teens and their attempts at being accepted and loved, a huge part of the story follows the relationship between Jim and his parents. The way this family is portrayed is absolutely brilliant, as it shows that abusive and neglectful parents aren't the only ones who can mess up their child's life. Jim's parents love him, and he loves them &#150; but the way his domineering mother makes mush out of his submissive father is just tearing Jim apart. Every boy needs someone to look up to; but Jim finds it hard (and rightly so) to look up to a man who is even afraid to contradict his wife.The story takes place in just over one day. In some films this can be a bit choppy, but director Nicholas Ray did an excellent job in this one. One of the really cool things about it is that, though Jim is the main character, the story isn't told just from his point of view. In most every scene, Ray takes you into the head of each character. In some cases, it's a real trip.The only bone I have to pick with this movie is the oddly resolved conflict between Jim's parents at the end. When Jim's dad indicates to his wife to shut up, they merely smile at each other and walk away together. I mean, this is what we wanted through the whole movie &#150; but the smiles really do seem out of place in the moment.One of my favorite parts takes place at the field trip to the Planetarium, while watching the light show. While looking up at the stars, Jim leans back and says, Once you been up there, you know you've been some place. At that moment, you can feel his desire to do something great; his desire to really be some place worth being. Watching this film, you feel like you're there &#150; and it's definitely a place worth being.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 March 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It's not surprising that lots of people compare Bringing Out the Dead to Taxi Driver. Both are Martin Scorsese\/Paul Schrader collaborations, both deal with the seedy underbelly of night-time New York and both deal with strung out individuals driving, er, vehicles. But comparisons are unfair. One, because any film is going to have a hard time living up to Taxi Driver, and two, despite their surface similarities they're very different movies.Bringing Out the Dead centres around a paramedic named Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage). He can't sleep and he hasn't saved a person in months. And to make matters worse, he keeps on seeing the face of an eighteen-year-old girl who died in his arms. Needless to say, he isn't in the best state of mind.The start of the film is a little unconvincing. Yes Scorsese's camera-work is electrifying but the voice-over and its delivery feels clumsy. It feels like something out of a B-movie or a bad novel. But then once the film settles down, it steadily improves.The primary focus of the story is Frank's relationship with the daughter of a cardiac arrest patient he brought back from the dead. In her he perhaps sees a chance to redeem himself &#150; to make amends for the mistake he made with the homeless girl he couldn't save. But although he wants to help her through this difficult time, he may have unwittingly made things worse. The man he saved was dead for too long, and so now he's in limbo. As a consequence, the man's alive but not completely aware, and so therefore his new existence revolves around a routine of minor heart attacks and shocks to bring him back to life. This has a negative effect on his daughter Mary (Patricia Arquette), a reformed drug addict who falls off the wagon as she tries to hold her family together. And so all this misery has been inflicted because of Frank's desire to save lives.And in Frank you have a man who has been progressively worn down by his surroundings. We hear from him how great it is when you save lives, how the world seems to shine, but recently he's been unable to do any good. And so while Travis Bickle's problem was violent alienation, Frank's is impotent empathy. He wants to make life better, but when there's so much misery around him, he feels like he's swimming against the tide.It has to be said that Scorsese's direction is often better than Cage's acting at capturing this weariness. Cage's performance certainly isn't poor, but it is uneven. In one dire bit of acting, after having woken from a drug-fuelled dream, he just shouts incoherently like some B-movie monster. And the facial tics and jerky movements feel overly familiar. But then in other scenes he can be excellent.But like I said, Scorsese's directing is stronger than the star's acting. Through time-lapse photography he captures the fractured passage of time and the frenzied emotions of the characters. And through his use of lighting he captures a frightening vision of urban hell while shining a bright halo on the film's hero. After all, at one point, Frank likens saving someone's life to having god pass through you. And in a wonderful hallucinatory dream sequence we see Frank reach into the ground to bring the dead souls of the people who have died before him back to life. This is the kind of power he wishes he had. He wishes he could rescue those lost souls &#150; to drag them back from purgatory or hell and give them and him a second chance at living a normal life. Because this job makes Frank suffer &#150; his burden is almost religious. And at one point he literally begs to be fired. But in a great comic scene, his Captain won't have it. Because they're understaffed, his Captain refuses to terminate Frank's contract, even though that's exactly what Frank wants. So even though he's promised that he'll be fired in the future, Frank knows he has to keep carrying this burden on his shoulders.And in the film we see Frank work with three different paramedics (played by John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore respectively). Each one deals with his hellish situation in a different way. Goodman seeks solace in food, Rhames in god and Sizemore in violence. Frank is the only one who is tackling the awful situation head on and as a result he can barely take it. He even has to resort to booze and drugs to numb the pain.And at the end Frank even takes the life of Arquette's father. Every time he sees the man he hears him speaking in his head, asking to be put out of his misery. At that moment he's borderline psychotic, but it's still a mercy killing. He's just tired of seeing people suffer &#150; both the man and the man's daughter. So in a way we're kind of asked to see Frank as a modern saint, a man who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders so that others don't have to suffer as much as he does. He's the complete opposite of Travis Bickle, whose suffering was brought about by self-absorption.And although the end of the film sounds a little pat, with Frank finding the love of a good woman and finally getting some much needed rest, it doesn't feel contrived. This is what Frank needs &#150; he needs someone who can understand his burden and he needs someone he can share it with. Only then can he rest and return to some semblance of normality.

Well directed by none other than Francis Ford Coppola, The Rainmaker tells the story of a rookie attorney who goes up against a corrupt insurance company that sold policies to poor people that they never intended to honor. Damon, who plays Rudy Baylor, represents a family whose son is dying of leukemia because the insurance company refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant.This is a great story that has the usual Grisham touches the corrupt big law firm, the honest attorney, big stakes, David versus Goliath. The only problem with this film is that the company and the attorneys on the other side are almost cartoonishly evil, corrupt, and uncaring. Not that they don't exist, but perhaps if they were less obvious, the story might have been more believable. There's a subplot of Rudy's involvement with an abused wife (Danes), which gives a break from the main plot.The acting is excellent all around in this powerful story. Damon is totally natural as a quiet yet passionate young man in way over his head; DeVito plays his partner who has failed the bar five times - he's a riot; the over-plasticized Mickey Rourke brings glamor and likability to the part of The Bruiser, the attorney under FBI investigation that Rudy originally goes to work for because he can't find another job. Dean Stockwell plays a sick judge in tight with the insurance company's lead attorney (Voight) - between his coughing and pill-popping, Stockwell gives a highly entertaining performance. Mary Kay Place is a standout as the boy's mother, poor, dignified and devastated, and Red West is heart-wrenching as her gin-drinking husband whose grief has rendered him nearly speechless. Johnny Whitworth does a beautiful job as the son. There is top-notch work as well from Teresa Wright as Rudy's landlady and Virginia Madsen as an ex-employee and witness. Voight's good old boy slimeball attorney is great, but as mentioned earlier, the role is written to give him not one redeeming quality.The Rainmaker is well worth watching.

Well directed by none other than Francis Ford Coppola, The Rainmaker tells the story of a rookie attorney who goes up against a corrupt insurance company that sold policies to poor people that they never intended to honor. Damon, who plays Rudy Baylor, represents a family whose son is dying of leukemia because the insurance company refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant.This is a great story that has the usual Grisham touches the corrupt big law firm, the honest attorney, big stakes, David versus Goliath. The only problem with this film is that the company and the attorneys on the other side are almost cartoonishly evil, corrupt, and uncaring. Not that they don't exist, but perhaps if they were less obvious, the story might have been more believable. There's a subplot of Rudy's involvement with an abused wife (Danes), which gives a break from the main plot.The acting is excellent all around in this powerful story. Damon is totally natural as a quiet yet passionate young man in way over his head; DeVito plays his partner who has failed the bar five times - he's a riot; the over-plasticized Mickey Rourke brings glamor and likability to the part of The Bruiser, the attorney under FBI investigation that Rudy originally goes to work for because he can't find another job. Dean Stockwell plays a sick judge in tight with the insurance company's lead attorney (Voight) - between his coughing and pill-popping, Stockwell gives a highly entertaining performance. Mary Kay Place is a standout as the boy's mother, poor, dignified and devastated, and Red West is heart-wrenching as her gin-drinking husband whose grief has rendered him nearly speechless. Johnny Whitworth does a beautiful job as the son. There is top-notch work as well from Teresa Wright as Rudy's landlady and Virginia Madsen as an ex-employee and witness. Voight's good old boy slimeball attorney is great, but as mentioned earlier, the role is written to give him not one redeeming quality.The Rainmaker is well worth watching.

Their relationship runs aground when Imogen fears that she is pregnant. Later, they split up when Imogen has a one-night stand with another student that resembles late legendary musician Jim Morrison. A few years pass, and Imogen and Al rekindle the old flame or 'tingles' as they referred to them about their first love. The surprises are few and far between in this romance as the sparks.The major flaw in writer & director Kris Iascsson's directorial debut is that his characters lack vitality, and their story skirts conflict. Nothing unique happens in this breezy but thoroughly predictable boy-wins-girl, boy-loses-girl, and boy-wins-girl back plot. Essentially, Down To You qualifies as a lite, twentysomething's version of the Bruce Willis & Michelle Pfeiffer soaper The Story of Us without the sizzle. If comedy broadens character, drama sharpens it. The Story of Us dealt with the ups and downs of a relationship. Nothing that either Imogen or Al do in Down To You is calculated to make us feel either love or hate for them. Indeed, Prinze and Stiles are as cute but just as plastic as Barbie and Ken dolls. They go through the motions without ever showing any genuine emotions.You know a movie is in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than the protagonists. Henry Winkler of Fonz fame from Happy Days has a field day as Freddie's loony father, Chef Ray, and he steals every scene he has with his rambunctious wit. The best scene in Down To You concerns a father and son TV show that Chef Ray pitches to Al. Chef Ray wants to produce 'Cooks,' a gourmet parody of the gritty reality based Fox TV show Cops where Al and he invade homes with a platoon of cooks at random and conjure up meals from scratch for the surprised occupants.The second best scene occurs when Al dreams about being a guest on a macho male talk show segment where tough guys ridicule his sensitive man routine. This is the closest thing to genuine comedy that Iascsson comes up with here, especially when one of the guys warns Al to cross your legs because your panties are showing. Actually, Al lets Imogen wear the pants in their relationship. She steps out on Al, and he throws a tantrum when she tells himself about her infidelity. Things would have been hotter had Al caught Imogen in the sack with her lover, but then Down To You would have gotten pretty raunchy.Al and Imogen's friends provide some welcome relief with their comic antics. Al's pal Monk (Zak Orth of In & Out) a porno star & director and supplies the frat lectures to everybody about the necessity for hot, sweaty sex. Monk probably displays more character development than anybody else in Down To You. The next time that we see him, Monk has turned into an Orson Welles type auteur and is making Shakespeare movies. In a slight, throwaway role, Lucy Arnaz, the real-life daughter of Lucille Ball, plays Al's mother.Freshman writer & director Kris Iascsson does everything that he can to keep things light and effervescent without descending into harsh reality. He makes even more mistakes by telling Down To You in a series of flashbacks with both characters addressing the audience directly&#151;in other words, breaking the fourth wall&#151;as in either Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Annie Hall. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles appear to be stooping in Down To You after scoring respectively in winning comedies such as She's All That and 10 Things I Hate About You. Unless you've never seen a teenage romantic comedy, skip this weepie. Oh, yes, at least, the soundtrack is worth buying, even if the movie vanishes from your memory the next day.

Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) is celebrating the good life - great career as a psychiatrist, family, children, wealth, and most of all, his new book, Baby Steps. Everything is splendor until Leo meets his new patient, Bob Wiley (Murray). This is when sparks fly. Leo agrees to see Bob for a brief introductory visit and prescribe Baby Steps. Bob suffers from every type of mental illness in the book. He also craves attention, and suffers from hot sweats and cold sweats. The list goes on and on. Leo tells Bob to read Baby Steps and he will see him again in six weeks. Bob feels Leo is the only one on Earth who can cure him. He loves Leo so much, that he doesn't want to shake him - not for a second.Leo is ready to take his family on vacation, and Bob will try everything in the book to make sure he doesn't let Leo out of his site. Bob follows the family to their lake house retreat. Startled by Bob's persistence, Leo tells him to keep reading Baby Steps and all of his problems will be solved. This isn't enough for Bob, so he decides to take a break from his problems, too, and join Leo and family on their vacation. Leo's family LOVES Bob, however, Leo is losing his family because they think Bob is a better family man than Leo. This drives Leo to the brink of insanity and he tries almost anything he can imagine to get rid of Bob, even if it means murder.A classic.Score 10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"28 March 2008","score":"14 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" Leonardo DiCaprio is The Man in the Iron Mask and also King Louis XIV in this re-telling of the famous Dumas story. He is surrounded in a sumptuous production by a stellar cast that includes Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu and Jeremy Irons. The oft-filmed plot concerns the twin brother of the cruel, selfish Louis IV who is guarded loyally by D'Artagnan. Phillipe, the twin, was taken from his mother at birth and once found by the King, imprisoned and placed in an iron mask to hide his identity. When the poverty and the uprisings become too much, Aramis (Irons), who knows of Phillipe's existence, breaks him out of prison with the help of Porthos (Depardieu) and Athos (Malkovich) with the idea of having him replace Louis at an upcoming masquerade ball. It falls to Athos, who has just lost his son Raoul in war because of Louis' lust for Raoul's fiancée, to teach Philippe how to be king in a short time. Things do not go as planned.This tremendous cast and huge production make for absorbing viewing, different yet as entertaining as the Richard Chamberlain TV version and the Louis Hayward version in the 1930s. Here the emphasis is on the old Musketeers, which works well - Porthos who feels his age and misses the old lusts, the grieving Athos and Aramis, given an impossible job by Louis, which means that Louis must go; and, of course, D'Artagnan, fiercely loyal to his King and insisting that he can be molded into a great ruler, despite evidence to the contrary. The acting is fabulous - there really isn't a standout among the four men as they are all so good.Leonardo DiCaprio creates two completely different characters with Louis and Philippe and does an excellent job. Though he was trending toward matinée idol\/chick flick territory, he pulled himself out to take on weightier roles - though there's no doubt this film was meant to bring in the teenagers. And what's wrong with that - a classic story once in a while won't kill them.Entertaining viewing.

As the train speeds through the icy wastelands the Ape man comes to life possessed by an alien energy creature capable of jumping from body to body & sucking the thoughts, ideas & knowledge from it's victims minds. A hunt is mounted to discover which passenger is possessed with the evil alien...This Spanish British co-production was directed by Eugenio Martin & is an entertainingly absurd sci-fi period horror flick that is hard not to like. The script by Arnaud d'Usseau & Julian Zimet takes the basic premise from The Thing from Another World (1951) with it's story of a frozen alien found by unsuspecting explorers & adds a little bit of The Hidden (1987) in as well with it's body jumping alien & even manages to throw a tiny bit of The Night of the Living Dead (1968) into the mix with it's horde of zombies at the climax. One could also say Horror Express takes both it's setting & it's title from the action adventure Shangai Express (1932). The one thing that shines through about Horror Express is that it's very entertaining in it's silliness, a two million year old fossil coming to life, the sucking of people's minds dry, the idea that it's all down to a millions year old alien & the the scientifically unsound notion that images are somehow stored in eyeball fluid. It all works really well to create a unique horror film with a good story that continues to develop throughout it's duration, the character's are good & there's the expected religious reasoning as well which is disproved in favour of more scientific explanations. Overall Horror Express is a much better film than I had expect & as a film you can see that it has itself influenced quite a few other films that have been made since.Director Martin does a good job, there is indeed a sense that we are traveling on a train at the turn of the century. The period Hammer horror style production design & costumes are excellent. According to the IMDb the train interior sets & the model train used for the exterior shots were the same that the producer\/director had used for their previous film Pancho Villa (1972) although other sources state that producer Bernard Gordon brought the train model from the big budget Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) & decided to make a film around it with both sounding equally plausible in the world of low budget exploitation & horror film-making. Whichever is true (if either are) the makers certainly get a lot of use out of the train model since every two minutes they cut to a shot of it speeding along the track, seriously if you were to edit out all the train model shots then I think Horror Express would be a good twenty odd minutes shorter. There's not much gore, there's some blood, there's a dissected eyeball & a surprisingly graphic autopsy scene for the time where Cushing saws the top of a corpses head off to expose the brain.Technically the film is well made with that 70's period Hammer horror atmosphere which makes so much difference, the way it's shot & the way the sets are so detailed really help make Horror Express look higher budget than it was. The model train shots look a little fake at times though, the monster is wisely kept in the shadows most of the time & the cheesy red eye effect often feels out of place. There's a good cast here with English horror stalwarts Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing who both turn in fine performances as one would expect. The bald one himself Telly Savalas has a small cameo as a Russian cossack & camps it up superbly. The rest of the cast while not as well know put in decent performances.Horror Express is a highly enjoyable & likable sci-fi horror film in the best tradition of Hammer horror with a good cast & it has an adventurous story that tries to be different as it mixes religion, horror & sci-fi.

The model train shots look a little fake at times though, the monster is wisely kept in the shadows most of the time & the cheesy red eye effect often feels out of place. There's a good cast here with English horror stalwarts Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing who both turn in fine performances as one would expect. The bald one himself Telly Savalas has a small cameo as a Russian cossack & camps it up superbly. The rest of the cast while not as well know put in decent performances.Horror Express is a highly enjoyable & likable sci-fi horror film in the best tradition of Hammer horror with a good cast & it has an adventurous story that tries to be different as it mixes religion, horror & sci-fi. Much better than I had expected & well worth a watch.

Together with his unique specimen Professor Saxon boards the a train to Russia in Pekin, also boarding the train is Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing) a rival scientist. As the train speeds through the icy wastelands the Ape man comes to life possessed by an alien energy creature capable of jumping from body to body & sucking the thoughts, ideas & knowledge from it's victims minds. A hunt is mounted to discover which passenger is possessed with the evil alien...This Spanish British co-production was directed by Eugenio Martin & is an entertainingly absurd sci-fi period horror flick that is hard not to like. The script by Arnaud d'Usseau & Julian Zimet takes the basic premise from The Thing from Another World (1951) with it's story of a frozen alien found by unsuspecting explorers & adds a little bit of The Hidden (1987) in as well with it's body jumping alien & even manages to throw a tiny bit of The Night of the Living Dead (1968) into the mix with it's horde of zombies at the climax. One could also say Horror Express takes both it's setting & it's title from the action adventure Shangai Express (1932). The one thing that shines through about Horror Express is that it's very entertaining in it's silliness, a two million year old fossil coming to life, the sucking of people's minds dry, the idea that it's all down to a millions year old alien & the the scientifically unsound notion that images are somehow stored in eyeball fluid. It all works really well to create a unique horror film with a good story that continues to develop throughout it's duration, the character's are good & there's the expected religious reasoning as well which is disproved in favour of more scientific explanations. Overall Horror Express is a much better film than I had expect & as a film you can see that it has itself influenced quite a few other films that have been made since.Director Martin does a good job, there is indeed a sense that we are traveling on a train at the turn of the century. The period Hammer horror style production design & costumes are excellent. According to the IMDb the train interior sets & the model train used for the exterior shots were the same that the producer\/director had used for their previous film Pancho Villa (1972) although other sources state that producer Bernard Gordon brought the train model from the big budget Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) & decided to make a film around it with both sounding equally plausible in the world of low budget exploitation & horror film-making. Whichever is true (if either are) the makers certainly get a lot of use out of the train model since every two minutes they cut to a shot of it speeding along the track, seriously if you were to edit out all the train model shots then I think Horror Express would be a good twenty odd minutes shorter.

Beautifully directed by Cameron Crowe, the film tells the story of a hotshot sports agent who writes a piece about the ethics of being a sports agent, encouraging a smaller client list and more personal service. He then passes it out to the rest of the agents in the firm, SMI. It goes without saying that he's fired, but before he goes, he asks if there is anyone who wants to go with him as he sets out on his own. A single mother, Dorothy (Zellweger), inspired by his missive though partially blinded by the stars in her eyes, says yes. Jerry ends up minus his fiancée (Kelly Preston) and stuck with one client (Gooding) that no one is particularly interested in, a football player whose mantra is Show me the money! But no one is. As he struggles to make a lucrative deal for his client, Jerry has to also deal with his personal life - Dorothy and her love for him, which he can't really return, her mistrusting sister (Hunt) and Dorothy's son (Jonathan Lipnicki) whom he adores.This is a fast-moving film with wonderful performances and lots of warmth, humor and honesty. Jerry learns quickly that when it comes to money, he's friendless, that there's very little loyalty and lots of liars. Tom Cruise is excellent as a young man trying to find his way through a labyrinth of a client with a bad attitude, no money, a hasty marriage and staying with the principles in his manifesto. Zellweger, in her career-making performance, is sweet and touching as Dorothy. Gooding has the most flamboyant part and makes the most of it as an athlete who has to learn that in order to have someone show him the money, he has to show a little heart first.A great movie, highly regarded for a reason, with a soundtrack to match. Highly recommended.

I found none of them are satisfactory. It just doesn't make sense. The closest to a sensible explanation was the one about the guy confessing to horrible crimes just to protect his wife, allegedly suspected of having committed the crimes of which he is being accused. But there is no hint whatsoever that there is any such suspicion in the character's mind. Moreover, there is even less reason to believe, or the slightest hint about the police having any suspicion against her, which makes the confession absolutely pointless. The one about the guy confessing under the pressure of the interrogation makes really very little sense considering the kind of man the suspect is, and that he still has a lot to lose with such confession. One does not send oneself to prison for life or the electric chair (I ignore whether there is death penalty in Puerto Rico) for such a trifle as a long night of interrogation. People with a lot less resources than the character would not break down under much worse duress, an even torture.I gave the movie a 7 because of what many already said about the superb acting of Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, and just in case I really did miss something big in not understanding the ending, which I doubt, particularly after reading the other comments and possible explanations. Otherwise, it should be a 5.Entertaining, but disappointing.
