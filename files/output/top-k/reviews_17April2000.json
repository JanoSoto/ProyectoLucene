I was just a pup then, and it was the greatest thing I had ever seen.  What an epic adventure!  It captured all of my fantasies and is still my favorite movie.  I watch it whenever I feel depressed because it always perks me up.  Call me a geek. Then came the others Empire and Jedi.  They were pretty good also, right up until we were introduced to the Ewoks.  That's when my awe was tarnished. What's going on with these teddy bear creatures?  This is serious stuff, saving the universe from evil. 20 years later the re-release came out.  You remember those, the flicks where they dusted off the old footage and added some nifty kean-o computer effects.  I saw Star Wars again on the big screen. The extra effects and footage didn't add anything to it, and were somewhat annoying.  It felt like they'd colorized Citizen Kane.  I didn't bother to see Empire and Jedi again. I was pretty excited about seeing Menace.  It had been a long time coming, and George had spent a lot of time on it.  After all this time, we get to see the beginning of the saga. We had folks go down the day that the advance tickets went on sale and stand in line for 6 hours to get tickets.  I went down and held a spot in line for 3 hours.  I know this isn't much compared to the fans who waited for a month outside Mann's Chinese, or even camped out overnight in front of the lesser theaters, but this was big forme; I usually wait for a matinee after the crowds have died down. I had mixed feelings about seeing it.  I tried to avoid all the marketing hype - all the junk merchandise everywhere I turned.  I wanted to appreciate art for art's sake and not be burned out before I saw it.  I wanted this to be another meaningful experience, like in '77. So I and almost everyone from my company (lots of geeks) shuffled into the theatre for the 445pm showing on May 19, 1999.  The place was packed and the crowd was pumped.  We all roared when the opening titles started rolling. Nobody applauded at the end.  I think we were all shocked by the mediocrity. What a disappointment.  The characters weren't compelling.  The computer animation went way overboard.  The story was weak, the dialog was trite at best.  The forward references were sappy and condescending (Yes, George, we realize that these are the same two droids from the later episodes.  Thank you.  OK, that's enough now. You can stop.)  The flow of the story kept getting bogged down with pointless scenes.  Anakin was non-believable to the point of ludicrousy.  What was the point of the CG rasta guy (Jar-Jar? Jim-Jim?  Jum-Jum) aside from merchandising appeal?  Lame comic relief? This guy had less purpose than C3PO.  Darth Maul?  This guy is supposed to be interesting?  It's a tough sell with no dialog.  Why should we hate or fear him?  Tell me George doesn't think that face paint and horns make a compelling villain.  See?  This character is the bad guy.  You can tell because he looks like a demon. Maybe I'm just too old for this movie.  Maybe my memories of the original left my hopes too high.  I expected magic and got a cheap card trick. You should have left it alone, George.

However, all is not normal for Patrick, you see, beneath those high quality assests, there's a monster that lives deep in Patrick's soul.  That monster is vicious and evil, it's the evil side that controls Patrick when he's upset and angry.  And then all hell breaks loose, blood is shed, and Patrick continues with his daily life.      That is the premise behind the new Mary Harron film, AMERICAN PSYCHO. Patrick (Christian Bale) A everyday man, who is indeed successful, wealthy, and part of the elite society in the late 1980's.  But he releases his anger by taking care of his problems, which would include disembody a woman's head, chop a fellow co-worker into little pieces, and other horrific things.         PSYCHO is a intelligent satire of the late 1980's, where we were serious about the lifestyle, songs, and attitude that is protrayed in the film back in 1987.  Now we just laugh and are in disbelief on the way we acted and the music we listened to.  PSYCHO shows the strong conservative image that most Americans were living during Regan's power.  But it's the brilliant inside look at what one of these conservative's would be like if we took a look inside their life.       I was really looking forward to PSYCHO, I was hoping that it would be like a look inside the mind of a madman like Hannibal Lecter, or Travis Bickle.  But it's different, it doesn't really tell the viewer why Patrick kills.  Instead, it shows Patrick's daily life-style, which includes putting on tons of different beauty oils, excersising regularly, and tanning. But it shows that the psychos in our world are not the kind that live in the dark in urban American and have special kinds of moths with a skull on it.  No, it shows that the serial killer is not only the person that you know, but your best friend!      The acting by Christian Bale is outstanding, he did quite a job by dropping his Limey accent for a pure Yank accent.  I love his speeches on certain 80's music, including Hewey Lewis, Phill Collins, and Whitney Houston.  The support is also good, Willem Dafoe is also good as a investigator looking for a missing person that Patrick might have killed.  Chloe Sevigny is also very good as the Patrick's administrative assistant who has a crush on Patrick.  And Reese Witherspoon is a typical snobby and stuck-up socialite who cares more about what will the wedding look like than the actual marriage.      Mary Harron does a great job adapting the horrific novel (although I haven't read it yet), but with the story and pacing, it appears that she got the real reason to why we should watch this movie.  What I also enjoyed is the trickery that Harron uses in this film.  When the viewer thinks that they are seeing something, it's something totally different.  I always love it when a film director messes with the viewer's mind.      Overall, I really did enjoy AMERICAN PSYCHO, but it does have it's bad points.  At times the movie goes from a fast pace to a bit slower.  And some of the character's are not explained fully in detail.  But those are just the side dishes compare to the rest of the film.       But when you have a film where you have businessmen compare business card's to show their masculinity, it's sad but funny.  It's just a cruel way to show that while others care about their appearence, others are releasing their anger and taking out on others, with their blood.

It's just a cruel way to show that while others care about their appearence, others are releasing their anger and taking out on others, with their blood.  This film is not really for the faint of heart.  It's not that gross, but it does leave a lot to the imagination, which is more gross. **** (out of five) ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"17 April 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is one screwed up movie.But that definitely does not matter I thought this was still a very cool story.

(If you've never seen it, read this at your own risk of spoilers) As I was saying, this is a really cool movie!The storyline is great, it's amazing the way it's set up. These two people, each one with their own mission involving the bridge, each heading towards each other and the bridge, and when they meet it provides nothing short of edge-of-your seat tension as you wait to see what happens. Watching Nicholson, particularly, is enthralling. Usually you think of Hitchcock when it comes to stories featuring characters with an obsession (such as Rear Window and Vertigo), but director David Lean, with Bridge on the River Kwai, also shows how he can tell an obsession story. Nicholson becomes so determined to build the perfect bridge that his obsession blocks out any ethical questions he should have about building it. Throughout the film, though, you are unsure of this Nicholson character. At the beginning, he quickly becomes a character you admire when he demonstrates his will power by sweating it out all those days in that box. The Japanese commander finds that Nicholson's will cannot be broken, and so we admire Nicholson. But he's building this bridge which will ultimatley help his enemies in the war.....but then again, he's being forced to do it....but does he have to do it so *well*? Those are the questions you ask yourself (at least, the questions I asked myself.), all the way up and until the end, when the bridge is about to be blown up. Like I said, this part is real edge-of-your-seat stuff, because you're waiting to find out where Nicholson's loyalties are. Will he help the soldiers who are on his side, or will his obsession with the bridge overcome what he should do? The answer may surprise you.......this movie, I think, is excellent. I believe I like it even more than Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. Excellent direction, excellent shots of the jungle, and excellent acting, especially by the great Sir Alec Guinness as Col. Nicholson. I fear that some younger viewers (members of the high-speed, thrill-a-minute MTV generation) might find some scenes long and boring, particularly the jungle scenes, but I find them very cool, and are excellent shots.As with all David Lean's films, the screen is like a huge canvas, showing all sorts of wondrous and incredible images.

Luckily the all time macho cliche car was there in the shape of a now very elderly Sting Ray, red of course.

It is not looking good, maybe the theatre is empty for a reason.To talk about the rest of the film is just too damn up setting. The story line doesn't die just changes every 15 minutes and no mention is made to any earlier plot lines. Acting never really breaks out (Tim Robbins not acting now that is not an easy thing for a director to achieve)and the effects have the feeling that the money had to be spent before the end of the tax year.

The ending had the feeling that it was a choice between the given ending and 'then I woke up and realised it was all a dream', and they made the wrong choice.But the real insult was it wasn't bad enough to be cool and funny, just bad enough to be dull.

They are indeed free is a free world. They find each other. One of them has a camera and records the American beauty which is not what we think of at first, it is more common.

It would have been SO easy to make this into a slasher flick, or a standard horror flick, or to add some kind of commonplace intrigue, but Mary Harron didn't do that. She managed to maintain the single most powerful emotion of the entire piece -- despair.  The voiceovers delivered by Christian Bale are perfectly in sync with the book.  I was surprised to see Bale delivering a few of the monologues vocally, but you know, such an occurrence while transitioning from book to film isn't a surprise and Bale delivers them with a crazed precision and enthusiasm that I loved.One of the cornerstones of the book was the incredibly inhuman violence perpetrated by Patrick Bateman and a lot of this is skillfully rendered in the film just offscreen, or suggested in a way that was far more frightening and powerful than just-show-us could have been.  Here's an example. Bateman picks up a pretty blonde woman.  They talk briefly as they walk and the next scene is the next morning.  Bateman's in his office, absent-mindedly fondling a lock of blonde hair, which he quickly stuffs in a pocket as someone comes in.  Certainly Bateman is nuts, of that we are assured when he kills Paul Allen, but we only start to uncover just how totally disconnected he is as the film unfolds.  I refer you to a scene that I call Sherbet. Our first real glimpse at the creature beneath his skin.  But on the gross-o-meter, this would be maybe a three out of ten.  We've tolerated much, much worse and not been THAT offended.I liked it.  I especially liked that it's showing in the same theaters as American Beauty.  Oh, that just thrills me.

I know this is the final chapter but if there'd ever be a #4 how about making a (final) plot that is completely unexplainable? Like in the Agatha Christie novel 'Ten Little Niggers' in which the killer dies before his final victim dies... An ingenious plot like that was what I expected of 'Scream 3'. Without revealing 'who diddit' it was a bit too easy for me to simply add a new character (nothing revealed yet since the movie is full of 'em) that has a relation to Sidney that explains the entire trilogy... we could make sequels for eternity in that way.But I liked some of the little details (and maybe I was the only one who noticed that) like the scene in which Courtney Cox Arquette refers to Parker Posey having dated Brad Pitt (when in fact it is her Friends colleague Jennifer Anniston dating him... and Parker Posey's character is in fact called Jennifer). Or the scene in which the killer drags one of his\/her\/its victims and the victim's hand is dragged above her head; just like in 'Scream 1' when Drew Barrymore was dragged into the backyard holding her phone while her parents could hear her breathe (still one of the best scenes ever!).Anyway let's stick to basics. The Scream Trilogy (rules #4 never make a 4th one... unless... it's really good) has ended in a good way. Not completely satisfying.. but still rather good.Good acting... some very funny characters (Jenny McCarthy's scene in which she practices her lines with her director are amazingly funny. The way she plays this really lousy actress is very funny), good settings (use a Hollywood prop-house for extra fun).8 out of 10 points ('Scream 1' 9 out of 10 and 'Scream 2' 7 out of 10).

Dennis Quaid is back at the top of his game after real good turns in Any Given Sunday and Savior.  Jim Cavaziel of The Thin Red Line shows why he should be around for a while, and Andre Braugher of Homicide gives a solid supporting turn.  What irritates me is that this movie probably will be hailed by critics, because it is an enjoyable experience, but my guess is it will strike out at the turn stiles.  You know Box Office capabilities are not high when the movie can't sell out Sneak Previews.  This is the best movie I have seen in a Sneak Preview since There Is Something About Mary.  Frequency is truly enjoyable, a CAN'T MISS, and I give it a 10. ","genre":null},{"date":"17 April 2000","score":"","review":"  Frequency is a GREAT movie.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"17 April 2000","score":"","review":"  The creed of American yuppies in the 80s can be basically summed up as egoism -- the formalism of selfishness, an ethic whose only constraint is punishment.  In the absence of punishment anything goes, and, if you play your cards right, risking punishment can be just as innocuous as, say, risking your life each time you get into an automobile.  If all there is is the self, why should there be any constraint on action except punishment of the self?  A smart, careful business plan seeks to minimize risk, of course, but risk must be the price paid for getting what you want.  No pain, no gain, as we used to say in the 80s.It is a fact that the majority of murders go unsolved. It is compelling to imagine a yuppie egoist, therefore, on Wall St in the 80s, who accepts the risk of punishment as an acceptable price to pay for the reward of indulging in pleasure killings.  The logic of this decision is as compelling as the logic of laying off thousands to raise your stock price or trashing the environment so your comapny can be a 2 billion dollar company instead of just a billion dollar one.  Why let compassion get in the way of gettin' what you want?This script seems to miss this tantalizing allegorical angle in favor of becoming yet another Hitchcock-esque thriller. Patrick Bateman isn't a coldly calculating yuppie weekend murderer, he's an out-of-control psycho, who scrawls grotesque scenes of torture in his appointment book and who thinks the ATM machine is telling him to feed it cats.  This is a comforting view of serial killers, one that makes them so different from you and me that we can comfortably and conveniently avoid asking the hard questions about what turns a human being into a murderer.  Eh, they're just nuts! My, how illuminating.What if serial killers weren't just nuts?  What if they were rational, even, after a fashion, normal people who had intelligently rationalized themselves into turning off their consciences?   There are a lot of screen killers who approach this sort of character, but the film makers must usually find something in them which makes them seem weird or alien or otherwise deeply disturbed.  In American Psycho, I rather hoped that our killer would be a true mirror of ourselves, not just another psycho freak, easily dismissed as an aberration. A real villain is one who can smile while doing evil, someone who is almost likeable.  A ranting madman is just a ranting madman.
