Wong Kar-Wai's film is an aesthetic treat - it looks nice, sounds nice, I dare say it would even smell nice if it had a scent - but plainly and simply, Chungking Express lacks substance and it's 2D characters and muddled (not to mention slow) plotting with only leave you cold by the time the final credits (finally) role. The colour scheme and way that the camera moves is bound to please fans of the technical side of cinema - and it is for those reasons why I hesitate to put this down as a bad film, it's just the story side that lets it down. The film follows two separate stories, both about heartbroken policemen. They've both lost their loves and found new ones, and the film follows them through their tribulations. This wouldn't be so bad, if Wong Kar-Wai gave you any reason at all to care for them. The characters shown in this film have been given two of the most wooden profiles ever to befall a film character and although it's obvious which side of the film is most important to Kar-Wai; at the end of the day, if a film like this fails to impact you on an emotional level - it has failed.I thought that there would be some sort of limit for how many times a song could be played in a movie, but Wong Kar-Wai obviously disagrees with that notion. The first time that The Mamas and the Papas' California Dreaming lit up the screen, I was pleased. It's a very nice song...but after the twentieth time of hearing it, I thought that a change of track was due. The film only has three popular tracks in it, and all of them are overplayed. I've never liked Daniah Washinton's What a Difference a Day Makes, so hearing that didn't float my boat...but a Cantonese version of The Cranberries Dreams was a nice inclusion - but again, it's overplayed. That's the thing about this film, what it really lacks is ideas. We see characters talking to inanimate objects and dancing to California Dreaming and then, instead of seeing something else - we see the same thing again and again and again and it all gets very tiresome. Basically, this film is rated highly for two reasons Quentin Tarantino has a lot of fans (even though this movie has nothing to do with him really) and the fact that everything from Asia is at the height of fashion right now. This film is worth seeing if you like to see well photographed movies with nice camera-work; but it's an ultimately shallow experience, and people that like their movies with a bit of meat on them will be thoroughly disappointed.

First, the acting -- there was not a single strong performance. This is perhaps Richard Burton's weakest role (and I think Burton is great). Max Von Sydow was good; I wish his role had be larger. Mainly, each character was a cliché.Secondly, the story development. While many of the ideas in the script are interesting, they do not come together to form an interesting story. Nor are the ideas in themselves well presented, and much could have been made of many of these ideas the synchronized biofeedback technique, the priest's relationship with the demon, the boundaries of heresy.Thirdly, the production design. I notice from IMDb that Richard MacDonald designed some visually stunning movies (Jesus Christ Superstar, Altered States); in this film, every set looked like a set -- from the psychiatric center to the apartment, to the stone dwellings in Africa -- and even the house in Georgetown as it crumbles.Perhaps I am being too harsh.

As far as mainstream cinema is concerned, I think only Jaws The Revenge is a worse movie. Showgirls is a waste of every moment, every dollar, and every frame of film that was spent on it. Everyone whose name appears in the credits for this film should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.Showgirls is the story of a young woman who hitchhikes her way to Las Vegas with not a penny to her name, but eventually becomes the lead dancer in a topless show at a casino. The film is supposed to be a sexy insider's look at the business of putting on a dance show, but it is so poorly made that it comes off as being uninteresting camp. I can stand camp at certain levels, but this film really tries to take itself seriously. That is the biggest problem here, but the entire project is filled with problems.Joe Eszterhas has written some amazingly successful scripts in his day. Most of the films are awful, but ultimately profitable. Almost everything he has written has been watchable if nothing else. Showgirls isn't even watchable. Once the nudity has gotten old (and that is within the first half hour) there is nothing left to keep the viewer's interest at anything more than a curiosity level. You're left with nothing to do but see just how much worse the dialog will get, and just how pathetic people can act. The film is not entertaining in any stretch of the word. It just becomes a study in how not to make a movie.The acting is so bad you can only laugh at it. Elizabeth Berkley is every bit as awful as you've heard, but even she isn't as bad a some of the other main characters. Take for example Glenn Plummer. This guy is so terrible in his pointless role that the entire film grinds to a catastrophic halt every moment he's on the screen. Plummer was one of the worst actors to appear in mainstream films in the 1990s, and his lack of talent is really on display in this one. There are some characters who are interesting in a sense that you maybe want to know a little more about them, but there was not one good performance in the entire film. How is a viewer supposed to care about a film when they don't even care about a single character?The screenplay takes one ridiculous turn after the next. The sex scenes are not the least bet sexy, and this is surprising coming from an Eszterhas script. I don't think Basic Instinc or Sliver were great films, but at least there were some sexually charged scenes in those films. Not in this one. Not one. There is also a rape scene so badly choreographed and over the top that Michael Winner (the Death Wish series director) would have been embarrassed to use it. How about some of this dialog? You can f*ck me when you love me! She doesn't suck. She learned it all right. But whatever she learned, they don't teach it! ???????Overall Showgirls must be viewed by everyone at least once in their lives. To see how NOT to make a film, there is no better guide.

Everything about it is magnificent. The music goes perfect with the scenes and mood of the film, and the characters have personalities that go with the flow of the movie. Every event leads to another one and keeps you watching. I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out. The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more provincial life and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves himWhat really makes it the best is the voices too.

Most stories feature terrorists with a purpose, whether it's the theft of nuclear weapons or cold hard cash. They're nearly always foreign and the hero is considered by everyone else to be a weedy individual, about as likely to save the day as Robert Downey Jr is to stick with his rehab. But the hero is actually a mean, ass-kicking machine who promptly proceeds to kill the baddies, save the head baddie for last (and a suitably OTT demise) and comes good just in the nick of time. How many films have you seen like that? A prime example of how bad things have got touches down with Air Force One which is quite possibly the silliest action film I've seen.Harrison Ford plays all-American President James Marshall, who has been visiting his new buddies in Russia after a prominent Soviet dissident (Jürgen Prochnow) is jailed. Having wrapped up the diplomacy and announced to the world that his foreign policy is about to crack down on terrorism (now where have I heard that before?), he suffers the most extraordinary run of bad luck after Air Force One (the President's private jet) is hijacked by Russian terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). Holding his family hostage, Marshall can do the only thing he can - take the fight to the terrorists while his Vice-President (Glenn Close) co-ordinates the rescue from the White House.Air Force One puts you under no illusion whatsoever as to the nature of the film. At first, I felt sure that this was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie because all the signs were there - big actors in the main roles, suitably BIG action and explosions and the manly cheers when it all gets solved. But no, this stodgy mess belongs to Wolfgang The Day After Tomorrow Petersen and suddenly, it all makes sense. Petersen seems to delight in themes of American patriotism in the face of adversity and this film is as flag-waving, anthem-singing, school-shooting American as you could wish it to be. Think about this for a minute... the President of the United States of America running around with a machine gun, blowing away those pesky Communists who've hijacked his private jet which happens to have his family on board! Are they serious? The fact that it's left to the President to kill every single terrorist (not so difficult as he's a Vietnam vet, winner of blah-blah medals and etc) as the stupefyingly dumb Security Services do nothing but get shot is one that Petersen clearly thinks is credible. Not nearly as credible as Godzilla moving home (and oceans) to eat Manhattan instead of Tokyo but there you go.The story isn't helped by the actors. Ford and Oldman are astonishingly wooden (Oldman's accent could best be described as humourous) and bit-support from everybody else is pretty much filled with clichéd shots of concerned politicians, grizzled military brass demanding something violent be done with fighter jets and tearful weeping from the President's wife (Wendy Crewson) and daughter (Liesel Matthews). If you like action films then you might get a kick out of this but it won't blow you away. I think the only decent all-action film of the Nineties was Speed and that is so much more the better film, despite it's equally implausible plot. Speed had humour, exciting set-pieces, high production values and a premise so outlandish that even the characters seem to acknowledge the fact. Here, someone says that the President may be our only hope in this situation and nobody bats an eyelid. Air Force One is horribly dated, unoriginal and poorly made in places and it's sad to see Han Solo reduced to this.

Yes, they're far more dangerous when they flock. What really irks me is that this was directed by Roger Kumble, the man behind Cruel Intentions, a film I thoroughly enjoyed and found funny, entertaining and clever. This has none of those properties(possibly because he didn't write this one), and just falls flat in just about every category. It fails on every level. Really, with all the poor, often exaggerated humor, the out-of-place feel of everything in the film and the sheer pointlessness of the whole production, what you're left with is(uh, are) three attractive leading ladies. The plot is derivative and dull. The pacing is awful. The whole film drags by and when it's finally over, you're going to be either asleep or bored out of your mind. The acting is fine, but no one really 'shines'. The characters are clichéd and stereotypes.

Well, the answer is yes.John Klein (Richard Gere), a reporter for the Washington Post, and his wife Mary (Debra Messing) have found the house of their dreams. When returning home from their bargain, Mary has an accident when she nearly hits a strange creature that looked a bit like a giant moth or a big man with a cape. John is OK, but Mary has suffered a severe blow on the head. She is rushed to the hospital, but dies a few days later. Soon after her death, John finds some of her sketches of this Mothman. Two years later he suddenly ends up in a town called Point Pleasant. He never needed to be there and has no idea how he traveled those 400 miles in less than two hours, but he soon learns that in this town, more people have seen a strange giant creature that looked like a moth. Of course his interest is sparked, believing that here an explanation can be found for the cause of his wife's death. He starts an investigation and soon learns more and more about the creature, but also about the dangers that go together with these sightings...Of course the movie has its lesser moments, but overall this is a very enjoyable film.

Well, the answer is yes.John Klein (Richard Gere), a reporter for the Washington Post, and his wife Mary (Debra Messing) have found the house of their dreams. When returning home from their bargain, Mary has an accident when she nearly hits a strange creature that looked a bit like a giant moth or a big man with a cape. John is OK, but Mary has suffered a severe blow on the head. She is rushed to the hospital, but dies a few days later. Soon after her death, John finds some of her sketches of this Mothman. Two years later he suddenly ends up in a town called Point Pleasant. He never needed to be there and has no idea how he traveled those 400 miles in less than two hours, but he soon learns that in this town, more people have seen a strange giant creature that looked like a moth. Of course his interest is sparked, believing that here an explanation can be found for the cause of his wife's death. He starts an investigation and soon learns more and more about the creature, but also about the dangers that go together with these sightings...Of course the movie has its lesser moments, but overall this is a very enjoyable film. Although I had my doubts about it because Richard Gere was in it, I must admit that there are no reasons to question his performance in this movie. He really did a very good job, as did the other actors by the way. Sometimes you think you know an actor and than he surprises you by doing something completely different, well this is a good example of that.I guess that people like me, who like horror movies full of suspense, but (preferably) without gore will love this movie. Also people who like series like the X-Files, may be very interested in this film, because this is the same kind of story. I liked what I saw and that's why I give it a 7.5\/10, perhaps even an 8\/10.

Having just viewed the latest Criterion DVD release, I found myself so captivated that I could not help but give it my highest rating. I'd grown so accustomed to the washed out colours of older prints that I felt like I was watching a different movie altogether - that is until the final unmistakable 45 minutes, which were burned into my memory on the first viewing. As others have commented, the director's use of colour and light is simply stunning.Watching the film again also helped crystallize in my mind another pacing element director Kurosawa seems to have completely made his own the balance between dialogue heavy scenes that drive the characters and offer exposition for the story, and those scenes that are visually driven. In KAGEMUSHA in particular, I saw how these two scene styles are completely divided. There is almost no dialogue whatsoever in a visually driven scene (I would be tempted to call these action scenes); these are all about light, colour, movement, and (unlike modern convention and certain film executive's fears that all must be verbally explained) use little or no dialogue to communicate what we see so clearly played out. Both types tell the story with delicate pacing and great depth - perhaps too much for many moviegoers used to a faster pace and more shallow characters (that's not a slight - it's just what we're all used to these days, myself included).Ultimately it is this balance of dialogue and vision that gives the film such power. I'm probably in the minority, but I actually enjoy this film more than RAN, although both to me are similar in some ways, and yet unique in film as a whole. I was trying to think of weak points in the film, but I simply couldn't. To me it's 3 hours of near-perfect cinema.Director Kurosawa has made a few of my favorite films, including HIGH AND LOW (more correctly translated Heaven and Hell), RED BEARD, and IKIRU. KAGEMUSHA now joins that list, and should have long ago if not for my mistaking bad film prints for lack of visual quality - shame on me. I will also mention that fans of movies with dream sequences (is that a sub-genre?) should not miss the one here. Highly recommended.

I came to several realizations (some bad, some good) 1. Regarding Jar Jar...he wasn't all that bad. There was just too much of him. Lucas should have either had less of him at the beginning or had him be more serious at the end. Also, since Jar Jar became such an important character, he probably should have been a little more serious than he was. After all, not all the Gugans (sp?) were like him. There were a few that the audience were shown that had more seriousness to their characters.2. The actor who played Anakin...what the hell were they thinking hiring him? I remember hating that actor's performance the first time I saw it, and nothing has changed. The kid had no chemistry with anyone he was acting with. I know that kid actors aren't supposed to be incredibly good, but with a character as important as Anakin, they should have tried harder to get a kid who was at least halfway decent. This kid was awful. He couldn't even say, Yippee! without it sounding totally fake.3. The special effects...oy. They are awesome, however, it's hard to buy that this movie took place 30 years before Star Wars Episode IV. The technology they have looks much more advanced. They should have toned it down some, made it look more natural, and older than the technology from the previous trilogy.4. The other actors...they are awesome. They did as best they could, considering some of what they had to put up with. Their performances were enjoyable, and most of them interacted as well as they could. Unfortunately, every time they were in scenes with the kid who played Anakin, their scenes ended up being uneven, because that kid could not act.5. Yoda...I'm glad they still had the puppet Yoda in this one. I don't like the CGI Yoda in Attack of the Clones (except for during the fight scene with Dooku). I think the puppet looks more natural than the CGI.6. Plot...this movie actually has a good plot, when you get past all the flashiness, CGI, and bad acting.This movie is not a total loss, though when compared to the earlier movies, it just doesn't hold its own. Attack of the Clones was better, though there were problems with that one too. I am looking forward to Revenge of the Sith, tentatively willing to venture hope that Lucas might actually make a prequel that holds its own with the first trilogy.

I liked the acting and I didn't see anything stupid or out of place at all. Everything seemed very legit and totally plausible as to what could happen in real life. You really started to feel for the people at the end, though some of the angles could have had a bit more focus put on them.

The characters don't spell it out for the audience, they are made to think and that hurts this movie because most people don't want to have to think while watching a movie. Nevertheless this movie has many levels in it and many of the lines and happenings in the movie are very deep and not realized without very close attention and thought. Such questions as Did Eddie lose to Amos on purpose? or What does Vince mean when he says you used me? or Why does Eddie quit the tournament at the end? are often asked and this is because the characters never spell out the answers to the audience, they instead act real and simply do what they would really do and say what they would really say in that situation rather then dialoging to the audience so they keep up with the plot.Answers are there, The movie is entirely about Eddie, Vincent is simply a tool used by Eddie to get back onto the road and hustle, Vincent is a loud cocky decoy too keep the attention while the backer cleans up and makes a fortune on the side, this point is missed by most who watch the movie. Being a backer was NEVER Eddies intention, it was a guise to allow him to hustle as a money-man, no one expects the backer to be a pro and a former best player in the USA, years since Eddie showed his face in a pool hall only the very rare old timer will recognize him now and the young people are clueless marks. Amos snaps Eddies delusions of grandeur though on a night when Eddie himself is hustled and realizes that he is simply not good enough anymore to do what he did in his youth. He says it himself after loosing a fortune to Amos, in his youth he would have beaten Amos and turned the tables on the hustler, he fed off players like that. Eddie realizes he is no longer the hustler able to beat the top players, he is now the mark and prey for those top players. He cuts Vincent loose because the fact is Vincent is of no use as a decoy if Eddie cannot beat the people he planned to play. Vincent is simply now in the way of what Eddie needs to do, start again and be reborn into the game of pool, rise through the ranks and again take him place at the top.Seriously HIGHLY underrated movie that is largely misunderstood and considered by most to be far more shallow then it is because they take it at face value and notice Tom Cruise doing cue tricks and bank shots and miss what is happening with the characters and Eddie. Then again the audience gets hustled into watching the young cocky kid while the old hustler does exactly what he always planned to do so maybe it is a little ironic that the movie is poorly judged by people that were hustled by Eddie right along with the characters.

Only later in the movie does Vincent realize he was a pawn and Eddies match against Amos and a thousand other matches like that was the real reason he was taken on the road ","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"10 April 2005","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't get. Why do so many people like this movie? It plain bad, and that's it. It may be that the novel is better, I can't comment on that, I didn't read it. The film keeps being awful. It is called a romantic comedy but where are the jokes? It just an highly escapistik movie if you please recall the content. There is a drug addicted, not especially good looking woman in her mid-thirties as protagonist. She is clumsy and has no real abilities. But that is not stopping her in having a career as TV Journalist and two men who are both looking like models want to have her. Huh? That so makes no sense. Of course one could overlook this. But somehow I can't. In an Action movie or a fantasy film, i don't expect realism. Even in more grounded movies I can live without über-realism. But this movie claims to show the life of a woman in her mid-thirties. And this doesn't work for me in the portrayed way. I could ignore this if it were funny. But it isn't. And I will never understand how they got Salman Rushdie as participant. Sorry to the people who enjoyed it but I just wrote down my opinion.

One day in his life is what keeps us muddled as well..The other characters are unraveled one by one..whom do we trust? The subject of this film is not dealt with often..even the few futile attempts, have been pathetic to say the least..so this one has to be appreciated all the more.. I, for one, truly enjoyed this film and can only hope that more such gripping tales will be told..I was really impressed by the pace and the sudden change in scenes throughout the movie..from darkness to blurry outlines to daylight..Brilliant!! The lead character's turmoil at his inability to comprehend new situations and trying to piece together a plausible explanation is fantastically entertaining..all the more because the viewer himself has no clue!! So if you like movies that make you ask more questions than it answers and leave you in your seat even after the *(AMAZING)* ending has been revealed..look no further..10\/10 for the sheer surprise element at the end..

But some of them are certainly worth a watch and Ali is one of them. As you probably already know this movie is based on the life of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali. The name on itself already rings a bell of course and I guess this is a must see for everybody who loves boxing, but even when you are not a fan of this sport, I'm convinced it has several interesting things to offer. I'll give you a few examples why I think this movie is worth watching.First The fact that there can be no doubt that Ali was one of the greatest and most colorful boxers, even sportsmen, ever and that this movie really gives a good idea of what kind of a man he was, in the boxing ring as well as in his private life.Second The acting in this movie is of an outstanding quality. Will Smith must have studied Ali for quite some time, because he really resembles him in the way he talks, acts and moves.Third This isn't just a movie about boxing. Sure, the boxing is a part of it and it all looks very realistic (Ali's fights have been recreated in a very good way), but it also gives an historically correct idea of what the sixties were like in the USA (religion, politics, the Vietnam war,...) and Zaire, where he fought his famous fight against George Foreman, called 'the Rumble in the Jungle'.All in all this was a very interesting movie that I would recommend to everybody, not only to boxing fans. I'm not a big boxing fan either, but I sure loved this movie. I've always found Ali an intriguing man and that's why I watched this movie, not because of the boxing scenes. Anyway, I give it at least a 7.5\/10, maybe even an 8\/10.

Now I have bought the 20th anniversary DVD and this was the first time I watched the movie in its entirety (and with a developed brain). And I still like it. Not in the same way as when I was young, because now I understand the story (I didn't understand English back then and I couldn't read the subtitles) so it's different from what I imagined back then, and now I have seen a truckload of modern movies with CGI effects.However, even though the effects in this movie are somewhat 'dated', they are still unique. While listening to the audio commentary (which is a must if you wonder how they managed to make a movie like this in 1982), I heard someone stating my thoughts exactly the unique thing about this movie is that while modern movies use CGI in an attempt to simulate the real world, in Tron one tried to simulate a computer world with real world images. Because they did succeed in this, the movie will never become 'dated', while movies trying to use limited CGI effects will become dated as soon as CGI evolves. The limitations of computer graphics at that time forced the makers of the movie to be very creative. E.g. all camera motions in the CG scenes (including the swinging motions in the chase scenes) had to be calculated by hand, there simply was no software for it! Nowadays computer graphics are nearing perfection, and that's why a movie like this will never be made again.If you haven't seen this movie yet, to fully appreciate how groundbreaking it is, you must be willing to imagine that you're back in a time where the most complex computer animation to be seen were the moving blocks in video arcades or the 5 seconds of wire-frame models in Star Wars. You might expect that the resolution of the images will be very low and the pictures will be blocky, but this is totally untrue. The images were created at film resolution, often using methods which don't even involve the rasterization of images, so they look perfectly smooth. Some might say too smooth, due to the lack of texture mapping (which hardly existed at that time), but IMHO this is what gives the depicted 'digital world' its unique appearance.The story is not of great complexity, but it's original and entertaining enough. Of course it's a Disney movie, so there aren't many 'sharp edges' to it (a scene with a mildly erotic undertone was even removed), but don't expect 'Bambi' sweetness either. Grown-ups will probably be more amazed by the kind of effects they managed to pull off in 1982, while children will be enchanted by the strange world shown in this movie. If you want to entertain young kids during a hour and a half, this movie will be perfect. They will like every bit (pun intended) of it!
