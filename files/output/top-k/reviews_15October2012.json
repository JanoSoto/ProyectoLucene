Fortunately for the F1 administration, they declined to go ahead with the project, a project which has now uncategorically become the worst automotive racing film in history; both in present and in the foreseeable future. Even in millennia from now, when humans have developed extreme degrees of empathy towards failures of past generations, this film will be nothing but a scorched memory on our great civilisation.This film will, undoubtedly, cause you to lose that last finite ounce of faith that you had in Hollywood's ability to convey a true motor-racing film onto the big screen. Dashed will be your optimism and hope, washed away in a bath of tremendous pain, anger and loss. For you shall never be able to enjoy another F1 or Indycar style movie with the disconcerting knowledge that it has been horrendously attempted before in mind-bloggling array of painful acting, shameful dialogue and epilepsy inducing cinematography.This film should not be approached at any time, any close contact with both its cover, disc or start menu may cause a debilitating and horrible emotion that, up to the release of Driven in 2001, was unbeknown to mankind.Please for the love of god ban this film in all UN and non-UN recognised nations, territories, isles, treaties, ice-shelves and water-borne land masses both natural and man-made.

My grandma, though, would probably like this film. But young people (people under 35) of the Star Wars generation will probably not like this film very much. I recommend this film to those that love 1930's and 1940's flicks, such as Casablanca (which also did not impress me).

Despite it being a four hour film. there were many parts of the book which ended up on the cutting room. Victor Fleming is credited with directing the movie and for the most part it has become a masterpiece. The book and the movie tells the story of a headstrong young girl named Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) who's secret love; nay, obsession is with a handsome young man named Ashley (Leslie Howard) who is in love with Melenie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) his cousin. Driven passionately towards her single goal, Scarlett will let few obstacles stand in her way until she is married to Ashley. While she pines after her goal, Scarlett allows Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) to chase after her and even the great Civil War becomes but a backdrop to her story. With a number of talented actors and actresses like Thomas Mitchell, Butterfly McQueen and Victor Jory, the cast creates a wonderful adaption of the novel, with the result being a True Classic for any film collection. This movie is easily recommended to all audiences. **** ","genre":null},{"date":"15 October 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Margaret Mitchell wrote the novel upon which this movie is taken from.
