[{"date":"17 January 2000","score":"","review":"  Election defies the trend of recent high school adolescent movies by treating different subject matters than the traditional teen themes of popularity, horror, sex, and relationships.  Alexander Payne's film focuses on a variety of topics, such as ethics and morals, ambition, and maturity. However, despite Election's examination of these more profound motifs, the movie lacks a center to combine these themes.  The film's story revolves around a school election that affects all of the film's characters in different ways and that ultimately dramatically influences their lives. While this election is the movie's main plotline, the film tends to wander off into the lives of the main characters outside of the election, especially Matthew Broderick, who plays a teacher in the school who has a somewhat peculiar interest in influencing the outcome of the election. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, is a student who is the leading candidate to be elected school council president.  Witherspoon gives a very convincing performance as a workaholic, fiercely determined student whose ambitions dominate her life.  Broderick's character is perplexing, as his actions concerning the election and his behavior in his personal life often lack rationality.  There are a few witty and politically satiric moments in the movie, but on the whole, the script is not very comedic or intelligent. Election is probably the best teen flick to come out in recent memory, but it could have been much more funny and interesting.  Two stars out of four.
