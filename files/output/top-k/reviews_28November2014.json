Be thankful that you don't have to travel cross country like the characters of this film has to go through. Directed by John Hughes, Planes, Trains and Automobiles is about high-strung marketing executive, Neil Page (Steve Martin), who unfortunately, has every mode of transportation somehow fails him. Worst yet, he is stuck with eternally optimistic, overly talkative, and clumsy shower curtain ring salesman, Del Griffith (John Candy) who seem to have Murphy Law follow him everywhere. Through delayed planes, broken down trains and burned-out automobiles, both share a three-day odyssey of misadventures as both of them try to get home to Chicago from New York City in time for Thanksgiving dinner with their families. I love the tagline for the film, 'he really wanted was to spend Thanksgiving with his family. What he got was three days with the turkey'. The main premise of the story is Neal trying to get home for the Thanksgiving holiday, and that, no matter how dire things might seem, we all have something to be thankful for. It's delivered in such a way that even non-Americans can appreciate. It really fit the mood of the film. The movie is supposedly based on a real life event, where it took John Hughes five days to get from New York City to Chicago because of a plane delay that left him in Wichita, Kansas. Since no transportation company wanted to appear inept or deficient in any way, the production for this film became really stressful. They had to construct a set that looked like airline terminal, design a rent-a-car company logo and uniforms, rent twenty miles of train track and refurbish old railroad cars, wait for the weather to clear up or not clear up and rent 250 cars for the infamous Rent-a-Car sequence. The film is probably best known for the sole scene responsible for its R rating; in which Neal goes on a tirade. Honestly, the movie could had been PG-13, but the whole f-word gag was too good to pass off on. To avoid being pigeonholed as a maker of teen comedies, John Hughes really work hard on this film, shooting and editing it. Supposedly, there is an uncut three-hour version of the film that some people like to see, one day. In my opinion, I'm alright with this version. I do kinda don't mind the delete scene with the airline food. The movie is very creative. I love how the title of the film zooms horizontally across the screen in screen-high letters to the earsplitting sound of an airplane taking off, then a train and finally a car. Some people might not like this film due to its odd choice of music score that sound like weird early rap beats and hair metal, but I kinda dig it. It had that 1980s' vibe to it. I love the fact that the movie could be all in the same universe, as his other films like 1984's Sixteen Candles, 1985's The Breakfast Club, 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and others. I love the cameos from actors like Ben Stein & Edie McClurg. I also like how Neal's family home is actually in the same neighborhood as the house in 1990's Home Alone. According to Hughes, Del lived two houses away from character, John Bender (Judd Nelson) from the Breakfast Club. The movie also has a very strong connection to the film, 1988's 'She's having a Baby' with many of that movie, characters appearing in this film such as Jake Briggs (Kevin Bacon) & Russ Bainbridge (William Windom). Even the film 'She's Having a Baby was playing in the background on TV when Mrs. Page (Laila Robins) was trying to go to sleep. The acting is very good for the most part from the two men. A lot of people might hate this film, due to the overused odd couple shtick, but I think this film is one of the better, strange bedfellow films. Steve Martin was great as the straight man. You really feel for him as he only wants to go home. John Candy is good as well. There were some gross out humor that wasn't needed, but it didn't hurt the film. The slapstick humor was alright in the most part. I was laughing my head off, during the driving parts. John Candy had just enough charm to make him, not that annoying. Both Martin and Candy work really well together. Films like 2010's Due Date & 1991's Dutch, wish they could had pull something like this film chemistry off. I love how John Candy was in most of John Hughes's films. This film was the inspiration for his cameo appearance as Gus Polinski, the Polka King of the Midwest, in Home Alone. The movie has a really good twist bittersweet ending that makes the film have a lot of heart. Lots of good foreshadowing unto them. Without spoiling it, just take a close look at the stickers on Del's luggage. Overall It's a very funny heart-warming film that is great to watch, during the holidays. A must watch. This film is good turkey to cut into. ","genre":null},{"date":"28 November 2014","score":"","review":" Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

Steve Martin and John Candy are a riot as two guys with totally different personalities who, by chance, just happen to run into each other after Martin's character, Neal Page, is trying to get home to Chicago after being in New York on a business trip, when suddenly, Candy's character, Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman in disguise, who later confesses to Martin's character that he is homeless, steals his cab. The Kevin Bacon cameo is also a classic part of this film as well. In any case, after a flight delay, they finally take off and are then bumped to Wichita, KS due to a bad snow storm in Chicago. Throughout the film, the two guys literally wind up going half across the country just to make it back to Chicago. Overall, it is a very enjoyable film that, despite its age, will remain relevant for years to come considering the fact that I'm sure other people in this world have gone through a similar situation. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone!For those who have never seen the non-TV version, though, the R rating is due to a hilarious F-bomb tirade that Steve Martin has with a Marathon Car Rental agent, played by the hilarious Edie McClurg. Neal rightfully shows his discontent after being given keys to a rental car that was not in the designated parking space. After discovering this error, however, it is too late, for the bus driver that drove him from the airport to the rental lot has already driven off. This results in Neal violently throwing his stuff down on the ground, walking and falling down a slope leading to the highway, and walking across the highway and airport runway just so he can make his way back to the rental agency.

I found many scenes to serve no other purpose but that. The atmosphere is important to the film and it is created well, but the movie may lose your attention a few times in the process. There is not much symbolism or story or tension inserted into all those extra scenes; not much for the mind to chew on.The film is about the life of several people from a blue-collar immigrant community before during and after the Vietnam war.It is a fairly heavy and gloomy film. Even when the characters are laughing and having fun, you feel the sobering weight of their lives. The soundtrack blasts Russian choir in the mountains. There are a lot of twilight and night scenes.The film has one of the better performances from Christopher Walken and John Savage. The latter is a bit boring in the beginning but really stops you in your tracks later in the movie. Robert De Niro shines in the lead role as usual, but that is not a surprise. On the other hand, I think Meryl Streep is much better than given credit to. She has a very natural delivery. Robert de Niro is good but he is still acting. Meryl is like a real human being filmed with a home camera.Deer Hunter has good actors, good acoustic soundtrack, good atmosphere and some strong story moments, but it also has too many empty scenes. It is a bit like really good jam spread too thinly over the bread. If the makers just really wanted for the film to be 3 hours long, they could have concentrated a bit more on the life of those characters left behind in the US during the war, who instead get completely forgotten while the 3 main characters are off at war.Nevertheless, this epic feels solid enough and is worth your time. I personally do not even mind the window dressing because the film still works. It is more of an issue from a technical point of view that could have been avoided.

It never occurred to me that the story was in fact trying to answer one. For Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), life is an imponderable existence, trapped as he is in a fatherless family with a mentally challenged younger brother (Leonardo DiCaprio), an obese mother (Darlene Cates) whose dimensions threaten the very foundation of their home, and a pair of sisters (Laura Harrington, Mary Kate Schellhardt) who find it difficult to maintain some semblance of normality in a community that considers the family a spectator attraction. But if you think about it, they might not have been the oddest characters living in Endora. The town also features a harmless joke mortician (Crispin Glover), a sad and lonely woman trapped in a loveless marriage (Mary Steenburgen), and a family friend (John C. Reilly) who insists that the soon to arrive Burger Barn is nothing short of cutting edge in the fast food industry. Into this mix arrives a free spirit angel (Juliette Lewis) who tries to help Gilbert realize his self proclaimed goal of being a good person. The film has it's absurd moments along with the bittersweet, and it was for that reason I found the marching band's choice of song to greet the Burger Barn as truly ironic - 'This Magic Moment'. By the time the picture is over, one realizes that even if our hero Gilbert has 'got nowhere to go', he's always been exactly where he needed to be.

Therefore he must invite archaeologists to test and approve his new park. But everything gets out of hand when the dinosaurs escape.Jurassic Park is a very special movie to me. I saw it at a very young age, but also at the right age, where I could respect the film. I watched it every day when I was growing up and that isn't over saturated. Watching it today, at a some what more adult age. I respect it even more than I ever did before. The directing by master director Spielberg is great. All the main characters are well fleshed out and the performances given by the actors are also fantastic. The practical effects blended with the cgi effects is purely genius. A very smart move from Spielberg. But my absolute favorite part of the film, is the score. John Williams is a genius. Every time I re listen the main theme, I get goosebumps. Which is something that rarely happens to me.I seriously can't find a flaw in this film, except for some of the CGI that it isn't on par anymore with today's standards. But everything else is perfect. Intriguing characters and plot points, amazing visual effects and marvelous directing by one of the greatest directors working today.

James Caan's best performance, and Al Pacino steals the show. Al Pacino's performance is not as good as the one from Dog Day Afternoon, but still up there as his second best performance. Arguably Robert Duval's best performance ever. Off course we must mention Al Pacino's dear friend (also from Dog Day Afternoon), who plays his older brother Fredo, John Cazale; an amazing performance, that he will top in Godfather II. I also need to mention that Johnny Fontane, played by Al Martino, is most likely based on, or at least inspired by, Frank Sinatra... An we need to mention the iconic music, the only score that ever came close to Ennio Moricone's music. In fact the maestro, Ennio Morricone, performed that tune more then once. Some people call this movie the bible... That might be a bit cynical, but it simply is the most quoted movie ever. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
