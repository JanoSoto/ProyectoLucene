Wishes it was art, but is really just poorly done crap. the characters are a bunch of self centered a*holes who aren't as interesting as they think they are. After finishing a copy of Dracula (that he borrowed from the hospital!) Gary is so deeply moved he pulls a Dominique Francon and throws the book out a window. Hey, someone else might have wanted to read that copy of Dracula, Gary! Did you really need to throw it out the window when you were done with it? They act bizarrely and randomly spout philosophical dialog like Things will never be like they used to be! or Be dumb enough to fall in love and smart enough to know better. Vincent D'Onofrio is a characterless shell of a loser with really bad looking braided hair that everyone is inexplicably in love with. Thomas Jane camps it up and alternately leaps like a ballerina (check him out after the taxi crash!) or flies into rages. Selma Hayek is a constant irritant that you just wish somebody would punch. Ethan Hawke comes out the best, probably because he has the least amount of screen time. The only one I had any emotion for was the dog.A complete and total waste of time that is nowhere near as deep as it thinks it is.

The songs are pretty catchy,but with awful lyrics(Think pink?Really?) and most importantly(and I may be wrong but..)..there's very little dancing and wasn't that why we were all watching the movie in the first place?All in all,this is not a very good movie for me(I would put up with the cheesy story,the silly music and little dancing if it wouldn't be for Audrey whose acting is cringe-worthy) and I ONLY recommend it for people who idolize Audrey Hepburn and\/or Fred Astaire.
