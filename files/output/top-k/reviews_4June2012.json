[{"date":"4 June 2012","score":"","review":" Elizabeth &#x96; CATCH IT (A-) After watching King Henry VIII's chronicles in magnificent The Tudors (1-4) back to back. I wanted to give Tudor Dynasty the perfect ending with watching Elizabeth & Elizabeth; The Golden Age. Watching Elizabeth after finishing The Tudors was a perfect idea as it takes you back into whom exactly Elizabeth was and what exactly happened with her mother & father's life. Cate Blanchett did a fantastic job as Queen Elizabeth she was young, vibrant and the Virgin Queen. All the supporting cast did their part with utmost perfection. But the credit for the movie defiantly goes to Shekar Kapur and Cate Blanchett who made us believe in the Queen.
