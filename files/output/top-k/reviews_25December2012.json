[{"date":"25 December 2012","score":"","review":" There is a sequence in the Wes Anderson-directed Rushmore where a student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) dreams of solving a maths problem which no one in the world has the brains to solve. Watch the sequence carefully for two reasons  It's way too real and that's the funniest sequence in this comedy-drama. Rushmore is an offbeat comedy that has the power to make your day if you enjoy the genre but can leave you feeling disappointed if you don't.15-year-old Max Fischer is the most famous student of Rushmore, a private school in which he is largely involved in almost all of the extracurricular activities and flunks in most of the subjects when it comes to academics. When he's put on academic probation because of his poor grades, he finds a reason to return to Rushmore when he develops a massive crush on a teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Oblivious to him, his friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman, is also in love with her. The film follows the story of how Max tries to resolve the situation after he learns of Blume's feelings while trying to win Cross' heart.The film has a bit of an odd setting because you can't figure out why Anderson has so many characters in the movie if he just wanted to focus on the love triangle. I found myself questioning the need of so many characters if the plot follows the story of just three of them. You don't know where Anderson's getting at with the plot and by the time you almost stop caring, the sub-plot kicks in and the film escalates into a romance.But Rushmore has got those few moments of genuine humor that you can't help but fall for its charm. The characters, though many, are superbly etched out. The innovative screenplay, jointly written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, is supremely funny in parts. There are these moments where I allowed myself a hearty laugh, like the one where Max tries to get Rosemary Cross fired when he learns that she too has feelings for Blume only to find out that she has already resigned and his plan has backfired.Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams, in their respective roles, are top-notch. The character of Max is oddly likable although you can't shake off the feeling that he was someone you didn't expect to like or wasn't someone who was supposed to turn out the way he has. Schwartzman portrays Max as a stubborn, flimsy human-being and does it with aplomb. I'm not quite sure I understood how the characters of Max and Herman Blume develop a firm friendship. Bill Murray, one of the best actors of his generation, sleepwalks through his role. His performance is controlled, expressive and easy to relate to.All in all, Rushmore is greatly flawed but it has got its heart in the right place. There are a few scenes in the film which look as if they've been pulled straight out of your life. The plot skims through many genres but ultimately settles for a deeply-felt drama from a talented director. Watch it, if not for anything else, for those quirky moments which make you feel as if you have been in these situations with people like these saying stuff like that.

Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say You're my number one customer!.

You just got Saint John the Baptist's head.We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness.That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line.Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more.

Proyas determination to make a horror thriller is what makes the movie dark, but the horror intention of Proyas is missed, as the movie is more thrilling than it is horror. The writing of the movie was done by Proyas, Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer, Goyer who wrote the sequel to Proyas 1994 cult movie The Crow.

Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. Look into your heart! Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings.Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed.

The next time the two played together in a Scorsese film, De Niro was the star and Keitel was barely recognizable as a villainous pimp, and the rest is history. And yet, surprisingly, after a decade of marginalization, Keitel enjoyed a brief renaissance in the mainstream, with memorable lead roles in 'Reservoir Dogs', 'The Piano' and 'Smoke'. Stuck somewhere in between those three was 'Bad Lieutenant' - a hateful, despicable, practically insufferable film, in which Keitel pulled a performance that may be as good as anything De Niro made in his long and celebrated career.'Bad Lieutenant' is not, by any measure, a great film. Like most Abel Ferrara films it's pretentious and self-indulgent in pornographic levels. However, the script and story are sparse enough, and Keitel's performance is powerful enough, to make it an impressive experience nevertheless. Keitel proves just how much of a character actor he is in a performance so powerfully painful that it brings up memories of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now; Keitel's Lieutenant is a portrait of a man in a mental breakdown, and it's so breathtakingly convincing and pained that it's nearly impossible to watch. If you're entertaining any notions that 'Bad Lieutenant' is a crime drama in the vein of 'Reservoir Dogs' or Martin Scorsese's works, or even the more recent remake starring Nicolas Cage, leave those notions behind.

The trap is to convince the British to come to Istanbul and steal a decoding device, and then have one of his assassins take it on the way back to England.This film is much more of a spy, intrigue film that was Dr No, which seemed to play out like a detective novel.

It never gets too intense while remaining somewhat imaginative and offbeat. It's written by Ethan Wiley, based on a story by Fred Dekker (Night of the Creeps, The Monster Squad), and produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham and Steve Miner respectively, the first two directors in the Friday the 13th franchise. William Katt ('The Greatest American Hero', Carrie) stars as Roger Cobb, a horror novelist who's going through a bunch of problems his son has vanished, his wife has divorced him, he's suffering from haunting Vietnam flashbacks, and his dotty old Aunt Elizabeth (Susan French) has recently hung herself. Seeking some all-important solitude, he moves into Elizabeths' Victorian home and is soon harassed by various demons. That off the wall sensibility helps to keep this movie from being purely predictable, and there are various rubber monsters that Roger will have to deal with - a closet monster which he tries to photograph, a cackling witch, and two little imps. The special effects are quite engaging in their low-tech simplicity (it's cool to see a monster that's rather reminiscent of the Deadites in Sam Raimis' Evil Dead series), and that really is one hell of a nice house to serve as the main location in this thing. It's shot from a number of angles, and there's even a pool in the back. The production design and cinematography are by the late professionals Gregg Fonseca and Mac Ahlberg, and Harry Manfredini supplies a score that occasionally sounds familiar to Friday the 13th series fans but which overall is good. The cast is fun to watch, with Katt making for a relatable hero, as he tries to come to grips with what he's seeing. The stunt casting of sitcom stars George Wendt (as the solicitous neighbour) and Richard Moll (as Rogers' flamboyant Vietnam comrade) works wonders and both actors are very amusing. There's also luscious eye candy in the form of Kay Lenz, as Rogers' concerned ex-wife, and Mary Stavin, as another neighbour, with a number of familiar faces in the character roles - Michael Ensign, Alan Autry, Steven Williams, Mindy Sterling, Steve Susskind, Dwier Brown, Stephen Nichols, and Ronn Carroll. They all help to make House pleasant if not great viewing. It might not have all viewers necessarily laughing out loud, but it's sure to make people smile. Followed by three sequels. Seven out of 10.

Leave it to the team at Halloween Town to make jingle bells sound dead and horrific. Based on a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a musical fantasy horror stop motion animation, which features the Stop Motion director Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach and Coraline 2009).Disney first decided to make this movie as a short 30 minutes TV movie, but later decided to go ahead and make a full length animation but released it under their Touchstone Pictures Distribution name and not under their Walt Disney name because they feared, since it was a dark horror animation it will not be well received.

Sounds clichéd? Ayer's film moves like magic. He captures the tone and tempo of sleazy pulp fiction, revels in the genre's trashiness, writes in a baroque, pulp-prose style and volleys dialogue back and forth like Howard Hawks on cocaine.Ayer, who started out as a screenwriter, also has an ear for snappy noir dialogue. His characters don't talk, so much as they play ping-pong with words, prose hurtling along with staccato intensity; like drumbeats. It's trashy, but it knows it's trashy; 1950s B movie sleaze filtered through a modern prism.The film's all hand held cameras and snappy cuts, pausing now and then only to capture noir infused, sun drenched shots of California. We get convenience store shootouts, foot-chases through LA's Latino quarter, ominous nighttime skylines and the bloody haze of downtown ghettos. In Ayer's films, California's a war zone.The message here is also less problematic than that of Ayer's other work. Here Keanu plays your typical loose cannon of a cop. He's a modern Dirty Harry, a fascist with a badge, a ruthless authoritarian who breaks the law and shoots up punks, all in the guise of doing the greater good. To eliminate evil, Keanu believes, you have to employ risqué tactics, perhaps even the mendaciously immoral and outright illegal. The ends justify the means. Deal with it.Only they don't. Keanu eventually realises he's a messed up dirt-bag who's been used as a violent blunt object by both the good guys and the bad. Ticked off, this little pawn visits his king, a chubby Police Chief who's house, in a nice bit of symbolism, literally has money, drugs and blackmail tapes leaking out of its walls; the up-scale veneer can barely hold back the corruption.Ayer also wrote the screenplay for Training Day. Another cop thriller, it stars Denzel Washington as a vicious LAPD narcotics officer who takes an ambitious rookie (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Washington's a criminal and crooked cop. Ethan, in contrast, is our great white hope, representative of Good, white American values, family and strong morals. Faced with the multi-ethnic criminality of both LA and Washington, Ethan opts firstly to simply walk away. Let the animals kill themselves. But Washington won't allow it. He attempts to corrupt Ethan &#x96; first with marijuana and later with harder vices - before provoking him into righteous violence. Even then Ethan refuses to deliver the kill blow; its up to the people of the slums &#x96; Latinos, Russians and blacks &#x96; to finish off their own kind. Ethan's hands remain clean. Whilst the film's first hour is thrilling, it becomes increasingly racist and stereotypical as it progresses.Racism and stereotypes are precisely what gush forth from Ayer's End of Watch. The film finds actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena playing a pair of LAPD cops. They're young, macho cowboys, high on testosterone and hungry for action. Much of the film juxtaposes the goodness of our virtuous heroes, their family lives and desire for peace, family and domesticity, with the wild savagery of LA's underclass, who actively hunt our heroes and violently intrude upon their private lives. It's your typically racist Cowboys vs Indians story. Our cops are a fraternity of hazing, backslapping, well-meaning frat-boys (they shoot and kill only in legitimate self-defence; yeah right), who hold the line against the savage chaos that is the Other. It's a jungle out there, which Ayer fetishizes and salivates over, his cops finding black kids tied up in cupboards and butchered limbs hidden in basements. You can find similar scenes in early films which demonized those pesky Native American Indians; monster's gonna getcha.As this is a millennial police drama, two generations removed from Rodney King and a bevy of other scandals, Ayer's cops are more thankless grunts than boys in blue. They're soldiers. The film, with its pseudo documentarian shaky cam aesthetic (which, bizarrely, makes the film feel manufactured and fake rather than authentic), as a whole mirrors Saving Private Ryan, the poster boy of modern cinematic fascism, which likewise masked bigotry, blood-lust and hatred behind patriotism and seemingly wholesome values. Black Hawk Down for cops, the film's a love-letter to the thin blue line, a blood-and-guts glorification of those who keep the savages at bay, which is to say, it's total propaganda and trades in bogus mythology.Crime films routinely demonstrate no social understanding, and routinely ignore the systemic causes of the appalling, violent conditions underprivileged minorities find themselves in. Others focus on corrupt policemen and rotten apples, which itself misses the larger point that all law enforcement is systemically corrupt. The police\/polis has a repressive function, its goal is to make politics disappear, for as long as there is no politics, a hierarchal distribution of power remains intact. The police, including disciplinary institutions and their various ideological components, are there to uphold the status quo and make sure that equality doesn't interfere with the hierarchal distribution of power; these social institutions are inherently inegalitarian. Today people have no problem accepting that the thin red line, the armed forces, does not act in the interest of You or Other, but it's the same with the thin blue line. Indeed, the dollar value of crime stopped by police infinitely out-weights that caused by the same. Borne of the desire of the wealthy to restructure society, to manage the urban poor and potential workforces, the law doesn't exist to prevent injustice acting upwards (the old notion that police protect the happy middle classes from the crazy, lazy lower classes), but largely to promote injustices acting downwards.7.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 December 2012","score":"","review":" This is a review of Street Kings, Training Day and End of Watch, three films by David Ayer.Ayer's best film since Harsh Times, Street Kings stars Keanu Reeves as Detective Tom Ludlow, a burnt out cop who spends his days dodging bullets, taking down bad guys and dealing with a corrupt law enforcement system rife with scumbags in uniform.

Dr No pretty much sets the scene for the rest of the franchise, and for a film to spawn another 24 sequels, that, I must say, is an impressive feat.I guess the main thing we learn here is why Bond always carries his beloved Walther PPK, and that is because M gives it to him to replace the Beretta that jammed on the previous mission (we are never told what that previous mission is, but in the books it is From Russia with Love, which is the sequel to this film). We are also introduced to SPECTRE (the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion, to which Bond replies that the revenge department is right up his alley). SPECTRE never actually appears in the books, being an organisation that was created specifically for the films (and later a law suit meant that it could not be used anymore).Basically one of the British agents in Jamaica goes missing, so Bond is sent to find out what is going on (and we also discover that he is always willing to put off an important flight for half an hour to spend time with a beautiful woman). Anyway, in Jamaica he learns that American missiles are being toppled, that is having their gyroscopic systems interfered with so they go off course.
