In one aspect Robocop is superhero film for adults...a big R rating slapped on it. But it fits the genre. It shows the tragic event that creates the hero, it shows the hero busting random crime, and it shows the rise of a villain to face the hero. The cool thing about Robocop being a superhero film is that it was an original idea and not based on a comic book hero or already established story. Secondly Robocop is a prime example of the eighties action genre which is such an important genre that spawned Die Hard, Rambo, Terminator and every Schwarzenegger film made in his early career. Notoriously R Rated explode fests, blood soaked, four letter words ever and usually token nude scenes from big breasted ladies. Granted Robocop doesn't have any nude scenes remarkably but everything else it hits the mark on in a big way. But Robocop goes beyond both of these genres to really create something incredible that has kept the series going, bad or good in one way or another, for the last 2 decades. Creator and writer Edward Neumeier created this darkly comedic spoof on a future world complete with very tongue in cheek commercials and news reports that make you laugh and think at the same time. It doesn't take away from the film but yet gives the movie a certain edge.Despite seemingly being a last choice for the role Peter Weller turns in a very good performance. He carries the film just as well as any big name eighties actor could have done. Granted most of his acting is from inside the massive suit but that's even more of a challenge because he has to play droning and robotic but still have this emotional side that makes Robocop more than just an action flick and Weller definitely delivers in the role. Nancy Allen is terrific but I think very underused as Murphy's\/Robocop's partner. She has this laid back quality to her character and yet she is honest and a strong female partner to Robocop. Ronny Cox is also terrific as Dick Jones, the corrupted senior partner in OCP, the company determined to take over the city any means necessary. Cox is the perfect adversary to Robocop and is the quintessential eighties villain. Miguel Ferrer is also great in a small role as the slimy Bob Morton who created Robocop to undermine Jones' ideas to take over the city. Finally Kurtwood Smith (yep Red Forman himself) is the insanely evil and unbalanced Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker is one of my favorite movie villains because he's completely nuts and the perfect bad guy. I would have loved to have seen him come back in future sequels.In many ways, and maybe it's because the current state of CGI and special effects but Robocop can seem very cheesy and yet at the same time the special effects are incredible. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards in editing and sound. Even the dialog and one liners seem campy but you never really notice it because you become so involved in this futuristic, dark, gritty world with this strange hero that you will be fascinated with. Robocop is an ultimate eighties classic no matter what bad rap it got for continuing in a less than stellar fashion. Over the next month or so I'm going to watch and review every piece of live action Robocop (3 movies, TV Series, and the fourth made for TV installment.) All of this is because I am enamored with the original. It's action packed, great performances, and an all around amazing sci-fi, action hero, film.

I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible. The characters are either unlikable or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialog is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem.
