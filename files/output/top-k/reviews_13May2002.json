But let's be honest, do we really care?  All I ask for my hard-earned money is a competently made thrill ride that features big dinosaurs chasing after measly, little humans.  And on that level, JPIII is a pretty damn good success.  Certainly, this series is turning out better than the Jaws franchise.In this third-go-round, Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, the now-world famous paleontologist who's having trouble coming up with grant money thanks to the fact that everybody in the world knows real dinosaurs exist.  Thus, Grant is a bit easily goaded when a couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) offer to pay big bucks for him to give them a little tour guide of the dino island.  Reluctantly agreeing, Grant brings along his protege, Billy (Alessandro Nivola), and they all head off to Isla Sorna.Not all goes according to plan, once Grant finds out the couple is really searching for their son, who was stranded six weeks ago.  Then there's that slight complication when this really big dinosaur called the Spinosaurus rips apart the airplane the group arrived in.  Afterward, there are only five survivors, and they set out to look for the missing boy and a way off the island.Plot-wise, it would probably be easier to simply state that a bunch of people get stuck on an island with man-eating dinosaurs.  After all, thrills would be the only reason anybody would watch this kind of movie in the first place, yet I find it funny I keep hearing complaints about bad story-telling and little characterization.  Really, the general movie-going public has got to re-evaulate their expectations a little more if they don't know what to expect out of a movie called Jurassic Park III.  Things such as story-telling and character development mean little to a movie about dinosaurs, much less a third film about said dinosaurs in a series, but those elements are adequate enough for the thrill-ride experience to work.Directed by Joe Johnston, this movie still often has the look and feel of a Spielberg film.  There's a bit of sentimentality here and there (as opposed to almost zero in the The Lost World), particularly in the beginning, with the scenes between Neill and Laura Dern (these moments work quite well), and later on in the film, between the estranged couple, played by Macy and a very annoying Leoni, and their son (these moments don't work so well). It's these scenes that lead me to question how so many people can proclaim this one superior to the original because of no sentimentality when it clearly has some.  Really, what I learned from such statements is that some people out there are just desperate to come up with something to bad mouth Spielberg.Johnston is not quite as good an action director as Spielberg.  By that, I mean there's not as much build-up to the attack scenes, nor is there really that much suspense, especially when compared to the nail-biting finale in the original and the trailer park scene in the The Lost World.  Johnston gets to the action quickly, almost as if though he were afraid he'd lose our attention otherwise.  It feels a little sloppy at times, but at least it eventually builds into that thrill-ride experience.The excitement delivered in spades, thanks to moments such as a nice little drag-down knockout fight between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex.  The guy I was rooting for didn't win, but it was still a damn good fight.  The raptors are sorely underused here, and there were a lot of possibilities Johnston could have come up with, especially set inside that village.  But, unfortunately, he abandons the enclosed setting (which really could have led to a lot of great thrills) and sticks to the jungle.Mind you, the jungle is still set up for quite a bit of fun.  The Spinosaurus makes several more appearances, one of them telegraphed by an amusing riff off Jaws and Peter Pan.  The pteranadons are put to good use here, with a sequence set inside a cage that's fairly exciting.  Sure, that evil stare that one pteranadon gives is pretty unintentionally hilarious, but stuff like that is appreciated in a B-movie.Speaking of B-movie, this one's a little more obvious of its roots than its predecessors, which is a plus.  JPIII has a pretty good sense of humor, as shown during a laugh-out loud dream scene that mocks the series itself. William H. Macy also gets in quite a few good laughs, a lot of them at the expense of the character himself!Special effects are what we would expect, meaning they're mostly excellent, with the only real complaint being that some of the dinos seem a little too CGI and the Spinosaurus' animatronic origins are far too obvious.  Mild complaints, though, considering the effects are really very impressive.Acting's also decent, with Neill, Macy, and Nivola registering positively. Michael Jeter's actually pretty likeable as a mercenary and Trevor Morgan is a kid who doesn't save the day or act as comic relief, thank God. However, Tea Leoni's just annoying, as she just about always is.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is about her that irritates me so; perhaps it's her speech pattern, or maybe just her general lack of acting ability.Don Davis' score is noticeably John Williams-ish.  The jungle drums from The Lost World are replaced by a more traditional action\/adventure theme, which is effective enough if nothing spectacular.  The original movie's main theme is present, too, though for some odd reason, it felt oddly inappropriate to me.  I guess I was just hoping for more of the dark tone and atmosphere the second film gave us, and that musical theme from Williams (which is great, I'm not trying to knock it) sounds way too bright in tone and awe-inspiring to punch that feeling home.Where Jurassic Park III really stumbles is the ending, which is incredibly abrupt and lacking a bit in basic logic.  I'd go a little further, but I might spoil things somewhat, suffice to say that judging from what I saw, raptors don't really have very good auditory perception and we'll just leave it at that.Given that this is a third movie in a series known primarily for its action\/special effects, I'd say Jurassic Park III rates quite highly as an entertaining action\/horror excursion.  Perhaps not quite as intense as its predecessors, it still works considerably well, and it's story doesn't quite have as many idiocies as The Lost World, as it is known infamously for. JPIII was also probably the best sequel in a summer chock full of them. The Mummy Returns was a colossal disappointment, Rush Hour 2 pretty much repeated most of the same mistakes of Rush Hour, and American Pie 2 is...the sequel to the already dreaded American Pie.  Anyway, JPIII's good fun, and I guess it says something positive when I actually don't mind the prospect of another sequel.

The trailer gag, of course, is one of the many gags that was played and played and replayed in the film's trailer(s) and is therefore completely without effect when seen in the theaters. The barrage of teen sex films\/thrillers of the last decade or so are plagued with trailer gags, and some of those movies (Sorority Boys) contain little else. Here, we see Jim's (the unbearable Jason Biggs) father walk in as he and his girlfriend (if she could be called that, since they evidently have not even had `friendly hello sex') are having sex. This intrusion is followed by that of Jim's mother, who has the obligatory fit, and then, mysteriously, both of Natalie's (Jim's `girlfriend') parents. So within the first minutes of the film, we are given a stolidly unamusing scene involving the exact same sexual awkwardness that was present in every scene that Eugene Levy (Jim's father) and Jim shared in the first movie, and we're left wondering why Natalie's parents walked into the room at all.The rest of the movie is more of the same. In the movie's defense, however, I must say that Seann William Scott was just as hilarious in every scene that he was in as he was in the first movie. The characters in both movies are hugely stereotypical caricatures of what, according to Hollywood producers, the typical college kid looks and acts like, and Stifler is the only one in either film that turns out even slightly amusing. It's no secret that films of this type tend to feed relentlessly off their original films in order to provide most of the laughs (Austin Powers 2), or lack thereof (Scary Movie 2), but it can at least be said that that was done at a minimum in the case of American Pie 2. There is, thankfully, no `pie,' for example. On the other hand, the film does manage to feed off of other successful comedies. We see, for example, the introduction of Stifler's Mini-Me, as Stifler's younger brother enters the film, and is literally a miniature version of Stifler.For the entire film that doesn't contain Stifler, however, just about every single comedic scene falls completely flat, as was also the case with several of the scenes that Stifler WAS in (anything involving urine or, theoretically, lesbians, for example). Jim is once again cruelly thrown into every kind of awkward and embarrassing situation imaginable, leaving the audience not laughing, but also feeling awkward and embarrassed. There is, for example, the completely tasteless scene in which he is mistaken for a retarded trombone player - did NOBODY at that damn band camp know what this Petey looked like?! And the statement that Jim utters at the abrupt end of his performance (branding him by far the most moronic character in the film for the rest of the movie), will have your jaw on the floor in disgusted shock before you can say, `Oh my good God, you're KIDDING.'And all of the characters are back, too. Oz is back with his sickeningly sweet relationship with his insufferable girlfriend Heather, Finch is back in one of the more amusing roles in the film, having become so obsessed with his reunion with Stifler's mom that he meditates almost constantly, and Kevin is back again, having long since broken up with Vicky (Tara Reid). There is a curious interaction between Kevin and Vicky throughout the film. It's obvious that there's a lot of sexual tension and weirdness between them, but it's impossible to care whether they get back together or not. There's a scene early in the film in which they almost kiss, and Vicky is put off, reminding him that they're just friends in what I hope to no end is the worst scene that Tara Reid has ever acted. If it gets worse that THAT.There is an interesting paradox that comes with movies like the American Pies and the Scary Movies and Road Trip and Sorority Boys that, logically, should reduce the films to complete failure almost immediately upon release. They are clearly jam-packed with the kind of humor that amuses 4th grade children (and even THEM for no other reason than because they know their parents would hate it), yet they appear to be aimed at a late high school or (gulp) early college age audience. I was going to say that films like this can be watched just for a little fun, but then I wondered how much fun it is to watch a film in which a girl like Nadia falls completely in love with idiot after idiot, and I began to wonder what it is that made the film's producers and writers develop such an abysmally low opinion of their audience. Is it because we made their first film such a huge success? Could it be that they are sending a message with this movie? If they are, it's probably something like this, `You LIKED that garbage?! Well, take THIS!!'There is a clear lesson to be learned here, people, and I hope that everyone has been taking note of it. If we all keep paying to see this trash that is constantly cranked out by Hollywood, then we are only asking for more trash to be put on the menu. I think I said in my review of Scary Movie 2 that it's a lot of fun even to watch films that are so bad that they are virtually un-enjoyable, if only to tear them down later in my review. I won't say that American Pie delves to the unspeakably awful level that the Scary Movies both sunk to, but even writing reviews of the best bad movies gets old. A second sequel in this series is something that I would be more than happy to never see.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"13 May 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  American Pie 2 starts off its rehash of the first film with the ever-present trailer gag. The trailer gag, of course, is one of the many gags that was played and played and replayed in the film's trailer(s) and is therefore completely without effect when seen in the theaters. The barrage of teen sex films\/thrillers of the last decade or so are plagued with trailer gags, and some of those movies (Sorority Boys) contain little else. Here, we see Jim's (the unbearable Jason Biggs) father walk in as he and his girlfriend (if she could be called that, since they evidently have not even had `friendly hello sex') are having sex. This intrusion is followed by that of Jim's mother, who has the obligatory fit, and then, mysteriously, both of Natalie's (Jim's `girlfriend') parents. So within the first minutes of the film, we are given a stolidly unamusing scene involving the exact same sexual awkwardness that was present in every scene that Eugene Levy (Jim's father) and Jim shared in the first movie, and we're left wondering why Natalie's parents walked into the room at all.The rest of the movie is more of the same. In the movie's defense, however, I must say that Seann William Scott was just as hilarious in every scene that he was in as he was in the first movie. The characters in both movies are hugely stereotypical caricatures of what, according to Hollywood producers, the typical college kid looks and acts like, and Stifler is the only one in either film that turns out even slightly amusing. It's no secret that films of this type tend to feed relentlessly off their original films in order to provide most of the laughs (Austin Powers 2), or lack thereof (Scary Movie 2), but it can at least be said that that was done at a minimum in the case of American Pie 2. There is, thankfully, no `pie,' for example. On the other hand, the film does manage to feed off of other successful comedies. We see, for example, the introduction of Stifler's Mini-Me, as Stifler's younger brother enters the film, and is literally a miniature version of Stifler.For the entire film that doesn't contain Stifler, however, just about every single comedic scene falls completely flat, as was also the case with several of the scenes that Stifler WAS in (anything involving urine or, theoretically, lesbians, for example). Jim is once again cruelly thrown into every kind of awkward and embarrassing situation imaginable, leaving the audience not laughing, but also feeling awkward and embarrassed. There is, for example, the completely tasteless scene in which he is mistaken for a retarded trombone player - did NOBODY at that damn band camp know what this Petey looked like?! And the statement that Jim utters at the abrupt end of his performance (branding him by far the most moronic character in the film for the rest of the movie), will have your jaw on the floor in disgusted shock before you can say, `Oh my good God, you're KIDDING.'And all of the characters are back, too. Oz is back with his sickeningly sweet relationship with his insufferable girlfriend Heather, Finch is back in one of the more amusing roles in the film, having become so obsessed with his reunion with Stifler's mom that he meditates almost constantly, and Kevin is back again, having long since broken up with Vicky (Tara Reid). There is a curious interaction between Kevin and Vicky throughout the film. It's obvious that there's a lot of sexual tension and weirdness between them, but it's impossible to care whether they get back together or not. There's a scene early in the film in which they almost kiss, and Vicky is put off, reminding him that they're just friends in what I hope to no end is the worst scene that Tara Reid has ever acted. If it gets worse that THAT.There is an interesting paradox that comes with movies like the American Pies and the Scary Movies and Road Trip and Sorority Boys that, logically, should reduce the films to complete failure almost immediately upon release.

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"13 May 2002","score":"","review":" There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character. In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn't anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches--like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other---but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all.But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama.Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker's status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film's conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones---but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film's final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering (MINOR SPOILER)  Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances?One other change worthy of note The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully--in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man's number one fan.The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning--a very artificial love story.With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals. The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe's face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point). Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman.

Overall, I thought the movie was better than The Phantom Menace, but still not as good as any of the first Trilogy. In the most basic structure, the plot is almost exactly the same as The Phantom Menace. The dialogue, while better, is still very stilted, especially in the romance scenes. Lucas conveys character development issues by dialogue rather than through actions or acting. The romance between Anakin and Amidala seems very forced, and makes no sense given what occurs in the film. It seems less of a romance and more of a stalking. It was not believable, and detracted from the later scenes.Hayden Christensen did as well as could be expected, given the dialogue, but he came off more whiny than charismatic. Unfortunately, he seems to be the thematic heir to Jake Lloyd from the previous movie. And again, his transformation to the Dark Side is overly telegraphed. It would have been more subtle if Lucas had written the dialogue on a piece of paper, taped that paper to a large brick, tied that brick to a sledgehammer, and then hit you across the face with it. There is no subtlety or interpretation to the character, and nothing is left up to the audience.Plot points are delivered in the same nonsensical fashion. I don't want to give away any details here, so let me instead use a made-up example to illustrate one of the more irritating aspects of the plot Let's say a secret agent breaks in to the villain's lair, discovers a piece of vital information, then sneaks out. Would you expect that secret agent to then sneak away so he can relay the information in secret? Or would you expect him to stand ten feet outside the doorway to the villain's lair and broadcast the information to his home base at the top of his lungs over a speakerphone? Unfortunately, you find characters essentially doing the latter at several points in this movie. Other characters make glaringly stupid and shortsighted decisions, all so you can moan and groan about how their plans are being played against them. I would much rather see intelligent, well-written characters who struggle, than see poorly-written characters forced to make bad decisions, just to move the plot along.Now, on to the good points! The action in this movie is fantastic, and the effects are mostly seamless. There are a few examples of gee, look what we can do with computer graphics!, but for the most part, everything fits together well. Amazingly well. The final battle is worth the price of admission alone, and is head and shoulders above anything in The Phantom Menace. The sheer computing horsepower on display is astounding. The battles and scenery are done well, the characters look great, and the design is good, with a few minor exceptions. And as others have written, the Jedi battles are first-rate. If only they were wrapped around a better story.... And one more note on the battles There is one part near the end that is something everyone has always wanted to see (if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about), but it came off kind of campy. Maybe others liked it (and I did too, in a way), but it just seemed a bit much. But honestly, I don't know what they could have done to improve it.I have seen a lot of comments about this movie saying things like Lucas has redeemed himself, or This is the Star Wars fans have been waiting for! I think these people are overcompensating for the disappointment of The Phantom Menace. I honestly don't see how you can praise Anakin's character development, or the complexity of the plot. The plot is a rehash of the first movie, and the character development is for the most part portrayed by the dialogue. And frankly, I don't buy the emotional development of Amidala's character at all. I can't say more without giving away plot details, but I honestly can't see how the romance could possibly bloom, especially given how Anakin's character develops.

Also sorely missing is a cynical Han Solo-type character that the audience, particularly the uninitiated, can relate to.The first half hour was terrible- it seemed as if Lucas was shoving in as many locations as possible and didn't allow the story to leisurely unfold like it did in the earlier three.

I know that Lucas put him in because he wanted to appeal to younger viewers, as I'm sure was the reason for that woeful sequence in which Anakin flies around in space, shooting the bad guys (for some reason this sequence reminded me of a frenetic toy ad- I half expected a voiceover to announce now you too can fight the Empire with this tie-in computer game, only £29.99- Ugh..). However, George, what about those who were around when the original came out in '77? They're not kids anymore, do you really want to alienate them? (I however must admit that I myself wasn't around in '77- though I was around for 'Jedi') I mean George, did you ever wonder why the darkest episode ('Empire') was also the most popular? Take the hint and get rid of that bloody floppy eared mutant Charlie Chaplin wannabe!!The acting was, for the most part, terribly wooden. I mean I've seen better acting on 'Fair City' (Irish readers will know what I'm talking about). People say 'Take it easy on Jake Lloyd, he's only a child,'- well I have three words for them Haley Joel Osment. Lucas is notorious for casting people based on whether they look the part or not, let's hope he hasn't made the same mistake with Hayden Christensen. Portman was incredibly boring as the Queen, making us yearn for Fisher's feisty princess. In fact, most of the characters spent so much time pompously trying to look important and recite their lines with a straight face, that they didn't seem to be able to get much acting in. Also sorely missing is a cynical Han Solo-type character that the audience, particularly the uninitiated, can relate to.The first half hour was terrible- it seemed as if Lucas was shoving in as many locations as possible and didn't allow the story to leisurely unfold like it did in the earlier three. I mean George, you've got a great imagination, but bring back Irvin Kershner as director.PLEASE!Back to the effects. The podrace WAS breathtaking I'll admit, and Greg Proops was a nice touch. But the battle between the Gungans and the droids just looked like a scene from a computer game. Bring back people dressed up in rubber\/plastic\/furry suits, even if it means that the scenery has to be sacrificed!- Organic, please!!All in all, there were a couple of redeeming features in the film The score (spot-on Williams); the banter between and initial meeting of R2D2 and C-3P0; Ian McDiarmaid as the Senator\/ Emperor (nice bit o continuity there); Boss Nass (Kudos to Brian Blessed); the lightsaber duels which were excellent; Darth Maul, who unfortunately leaves us too soon; Liam Neeson and Pernilla August who tried to infuse the film with some humanity (sorry, Ewan mate, you were just too boring!); and last but not least, the expansion of our view of Tatooine.Naturally, no matter what they read, no Star Wars fan is going to boycott this film. Let's just hope that 'Clones' a better film will be..PS Great to see Bronagh Gallagher snagging a role, Go on the Irish!

Anywhere Woody Allen is being discussed, you've got to have some skeptical idiot commenting on how Woody doesn't make classic films anymore like he used to and that he should retire. Never in my life have I heard such a selfish amount of crap. I love Woody Allen, and I always have. And I also understand that the just-turned-forty Woody Allen is gone! GET OVER IT! The man makes movies because he loves his job, but also, he does it for us, his loving audience. A movie from him is a gift, and I always take it thankfully. And I don't know about you, but I'm not going to turn my back on one of the greatest comical geniuses of all time just because (and I say this mocking all of you here who complain about this) He doesn't make me think anymore! Wahahaha!I am the first to agree that Hollywood Ending isn't anything like Hannah and Her Sisters (my favorite Woody movie), Manhattan or Bananas, but it is still really entertaining and I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it because when I walked in the theater, my expectations weren't of those who always think Woody Allen is at the mercy of the audience, and that we, the audience, are the judges of his career. Allen is 66 years old and he's still making movies! He has a right to decline in his old age. And I always look forward to all upcoming Woody Allen flicks because I know what he'll deliver. A nice, gentle, and hilarious comedy about what trouble he's now gotten himself into.Hollywood Ending is just that. Woody Allen plays Val Waxman, an academy-award winning has-been director who, after years of directing simple and fast-forgotten commercials, gets the chance to direct an almost-major motion picture that might put him back on the map. Just as filming is about to start, a mysterious and thought-to-be-temporary blindness takes over Val, and he can't see a thing. He can hear, talk, but he can't see. So now he has to make a choice. Will he say that he can't direct the film because he's blind and go back to his prosaic life? Or will he find a way to direct a movie blind without anyone except few people whom he can trust know? Well, the movie is 1 hour 52 minutes long, and normally movies as long as that don't feature a person saying, No, guys, I can't direct this film. and then end...This movie, as I see it, never goes dull. Always you will be glued to your chair wondering what is going to happen next. And believe me, it's a ride. As far as Woody Allen one liners go, there are several true hilarious ones in the first half of the film. Sadly, however, towards the end of the other half, the movie digresses more into a... gagless comedy, if you will. However, it doesn't take your eyes off the screen at all.This movie is definitely worth the 8 bucks and then some. Woody might not have the ironic and wise flare that he had before, but if there is one torch that will never die in Woody it is that of entertainment. Watch this movie. Laugh. Don't be disappointed just because Annie Hall was better. Those days are gone, and very doubtfully will Woody relive them. This is the Woody that lives now.

One of the most-talked-about movies at last year's Sundance Film Festival, this modern-day fantasy combines suburban drama with dark comedy and gives it a little sci-fi twist for a film that is unlike any other. What makes the film so one-of-a-kind is that it takes you into the mind of this unique teenager, Donnie Darko, as he sets off on what star Jake Gyllenhaal describes as a fantastic journey through dreams, sadness, comedy, and madness in order to discover who he truly is, learning more and more as time passes by that every little thing he does counts on a cosmic scale.1For writer\/director Richard Kelly, Donnie is an intelligent, but delusional young man whom, he claims, has a lot of big problems and a lot of big ideas. Some of his problems include sleepwalking in the middle of the night and seeing hallucinations of things that are not really there all the time. One of these hallucinations is a monstrously eerie bunny rabbit named Frank. He appears to Donnie one night, standing outside his house, and tells him that the end of the world will come just in 28 days. The next morning, Donnie comes home to find his family standing outside their house, with everyone in the neighborhood watching as a large crane lifts out a jet engine that had crashed into Donnie's bedroom just a few short moments after his departure. Without any clue where this thing had come from, we see later that fate had something other in mind for Donnie. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie Darko, says that its through this incredible experience that he comes to truly understand who he really is and the effect he has on other people.From then on, Donnie begins to look at both his life and the world around him from a dark and terrifyingly apocalyptic perspective. After he credits Frank the bunny with having saved his life, Donnie feels that he is obligated to listen to whatever Frank has to say to him and do whatever it is he tells him to do without question. Frank allows Donnie to see that, under the veneer of society, lies something not at all right with the world. He helps Donnie try to understand all the secrets and lies surrounding him1, and convinces him that he has the ability to adjust them by simply changing the course of history.Unlike other movies that urge people to find their place in the world, Donnie Darko challenges them to question their existence, about who they are and what is their purpose in life. It shows us that we have to determine for ourselves what we believe in and that everyone should learn to follow his or her own dreams. Nancy Juvonen, one of the film's executive producers, says that one of the many things she thought was inspiring about Donnie was the fact that he really believes anything is possible and that he can make a difference by making his own decisions and doing things the way he sees them. And that's what makes you follow him, adds co-star Drew Barrymore, who also served as an executive producer. Even though he goes into alternate worlds and questions the rules of the universe, Donnie Darko's experiences at school, with his girlfriend, with his family and in his dreams seem incredibly true to life.So, the question remains, who is Donnie Darko - a hero, a rebel, a genius, a prophet, a schizoid, a messenger, or a menace to a society? The concept of who this boy is &#150; it is all very strange. Even his name makes you wonder about him. Its really unique, says Gyllenhaal, saying that you have to discover what it means for yourself. The producers of Donnie Darko say that through repeated viewings, you begin to develop a deeper understanding of the film. Being that I have seen this movie about a dozen times already, I couldn't agree more. I found that the more times I watched it, the more I understood how Donnie is a little bit of all these things.

No true relationship is built up between her and Jamal, and if you examine the dynamics of the film, I think you, too, will notice that she was rather... expendable. But, set aside a few flaws and blemishes, Finding Forrester was an all-around good movie, an exploration of writing and the frustrations society can bring you, and on a lesser scale, an exploitation of the corrupt school system. And let us not forget Sean Connery's excellent performance; he truly immerses himself into William Forrester's character, going all-out in a role that should have won him an Oscar nomination (call me crazy for saying that, but I truly believe he was that good).

Anyway, the brother of Haim never knows what is going on, but Haim does.  Haim teams up with Feldman and Joe Pesci as they try to take down the vampire army led by Sutherland and Stephen Dorff.  There is one great scene where they are all playing volleyball in a pool and Ben Stiller spikes the ball and it hits this girl in the nose and she starts bleeding.  Robert DeNiro gets mad, then he says that he doesn't like ice cream or cookies.  In Blade, Chris Rock, who plays the lead vampire, can go out during the day unlike most vampires who die upon exposure to sunlight.  Rock holds a big umbrella that blocks out the sun, he also wears spf 35 which is a very strong sunblock.  He is also black so he doesn't burn easily.  I really liked this movie.  There is this one scene where Haim's brother thinks he is eating Chinease food, then he looks down and it's worms, but the whole time it's really just lo mein.  Also, there is this scene with Tony Danza and he yells up the stairs for Samantha and jonathan to come down, then he beats up jonathan and vampires come and they eat everyone.  That scene was cool.

I watched them as a child and saw them again when they were re-released on video. Part 4 was cool, 5 even better, and 6 I found a little annoying to be honest, but still they were over all satisfying. `Star Wars Episode 1' on the other hand proved to be a so-so introduction to this franchise, with an alright storyline and further more beautiful special-effects, it kept me watching and somewhat interested the whole way through. I admire the complex universe George Lucas has created, and can completely understand how it has captured the imagination of it's legions of fans, after all it goes without saying this film franchise was a milestone for modern cinema. I hope you have an idea of where I'm coming from. Having said that, I can't say this installment offered much aside from more effects, more battles, and another half-assed script.I will have some spoilers in this review, nothing crazy but I know `Star Wars' fanatics will want to stay pure until their first viewing. Here goes, it's been 10 years since `Episode 1' and we find out that someone is attempting to kill, Amidala (Portman), now a senator. Enter Obi Wan (McGregor) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen), whom are ordered to keep the Senator safe. Upon re-introduction after such a long period of time Amidala is taken back by how `grown up' Anakin looks, and he, now having gone through puberty, can appreciate the beautiful woman Amidala has always been. Shortly afterwards an intruder's plans to again assonate the senator are foiled by the Jedi's, leading to their decision to split up to better protect her.From that point on I found it useless to even try and make sense of all their political discussions but I did keep up, even if it did drag on for what seemed to be more than half the film. Now supposedly in that time Anakin and Amidala manage to fall in love, proving this film just doesn't have any strength other than its effect montages. Dumb-ing down the script with lines such as `I can't breath' when Anakin describes his affections, or when he says `I wish I could wish away my feelings' in response to his love denied, is something that occurs throughout the film and in fact gets worse. I find it funny that even in such a vast and unknown universe filled with such varied and amazing creatures and characters, people still manage to speak so pretentiously. Obviously these are Lucas' words, not the characters. In the later parts of the film it is almost non-stop action ranging from a not so spectacular Gladiator-Style spectacle, to a full fledged civil war, and a fight scene between the Big Bad Villain and&#133; Yoda?? This guy had been limping the whole movie, it seemed like a joke he would suddenly whip out into action (expect this scene to be parodied in a 4th installment of `Austin Powers').Did I mention how bad the dialogue was? Man was it bad!! Here are a few more lines from the film. `I truly, deeply love you' says the Amidala to Anakin in the midst of hectic battles, and with that he finally realizes it. Great! What does Mace Windu (Jackson) say when he comes to save the imprisoned Obi Wan, Anakin and Amidala&#133; `This party's over!' Are you laughing yet? I surely was, and definitely was not alone. Now do I think that this dialogue will ruin your experience while watching this film? I highly doubt that, seeing as we've become accustomed to such crap by now, most of you will easily let it slide and let the hype of finally seeing the movie take over. I want everyone to watch it again in a year and then tell me what you all really think.Now for the cast, comprised of fine actors, does a very good job with this sloppy material. Hayden Christensen is great as Anakin and shows us his inner pain incredibly well, definitely not given enough to do here, but expect to see far better work from this guy in the future. Natalie Portman lit up the screen and is cute as ever, hopefully she uses this exposure to get herself into better pictures. Sam Jackson is slick and cool but doesn't do much else, and Ewan McGregor has some nice action sequences but that aside he is just giving Anakin advice the whole movie.This story just never came together for me, and I found myself laughing about it once it was over. Will Star Wars fans be satisfied just because they get to see a continuation in this franchise? This film needed more work where films like this always do, in the script!! The visuals will surely blow you away; though some scenes are so full of CGI I began to get sick of them. Still I will go back to see this film with my friends and see what their reaction is to this movie. It definitely kept me entertained, but mostly for all the wrong reasons.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"13 May 2002","score":"","review":"  I openly admit it I have never been wild about the `Star War' films. I watched them as a child and saw them again when they were re-released on video. Part 4 was cool, 5 even better, and 6 I found a little annoying to be honest, but still they were over all satisfying. `Star Wars Episode 1' on the other hand proved to be a so-so introduction to this franchise, with an alright storyline and further more beautiful special-effects, it kept me watching and somewhat interested the whole way through. I admire the complex universe George Lucas has created, and can completely understand how it has captured the imagination of it's legions of fans, after all it goes without saying this film franchise was a milestone for modern cinema. I hope you have an idea of where I'm coming from. Having said that, I can't say this installment offered much aside from more effects, more battles, and another half-assed script.I will have some spoilers in this review, nothing crazy but I know `Star Wars' fanatics will want to stay pure until their first viewing. Here goes, it's been 10 years since `Episode 1' and we find out that someone is attempting to kill, Amidala (Portman), now a senator. Enter Obi Wan (McGregor) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen), whom are ordered to keep the Senator safe. Upon re-introduction after such a long period of time Amidala is taken back by how `grown up' Anakin looks, and he, now having gone through puberty, can appreciate the beautiful woman Amidala has always been. Shortly afterwards an intruder's plans to again assonate the senator are foiled by the Jedi's, leading to their decision to split up to better protect her.From that point on I found it useless to even try and make sense of all their political discussions but I did keep up, even if it did drag on for what seemed to be more than half the film. Now supposedly in that time Anakin and Amidala manage to fall in love, proving this film just doesn't have any strength other than its effect montages. Dumb-ing down the script with lines such as `I can't breath' when Anakin describes his affections, or when he says `I wish I could wish away my feelings' in response to his love denied, is something that occurs throughout the film and in fact gets worse. I find it funny that even in such a vast and unknown universe filled with such varied and amazing creatures and characters, people still manage to speak so pretentiously. Obviously these are Lucas' words, not the characters. In the later parts of the film it is almost non-stop action ranging from a not so spectacular Gladiator-Style spectacle, to a full fledged civil war, and a fight scene between the Big Bad Villain and&#133; Yoda?? This guy had been limping the whole movie, it seemed like a joke he would suddenly whip out into action (expect this scene to be parodied in a 4th installment of `Austin Powers').Did I mention how bad the dialogue was? Man was it bad!! Here are a few more lines from the film. `I truly, deeply love you' says the Amidala to Anakin in the midst of hectic battles, and with that he finally realizes it. Great! What does Mace Windu (Jackson) say when he comes to save the imprisoned Obi Wan, Anakin and Amidala&#133; `This party's over!' Are you laughing yet? I surely was, and definitely was not alone. Now do I think that this dialogue will ruin your experience while watching this film? I highly doubt that, seeing as we've become accustomed to such crap by now, most of you will easily let it slide and let the hype of finally seeing the movie take over. I want everyone to watch it again in a year and then tell me what you all really think.Now for the cast, comprised of fine actors, does a very good job with this sloppy material. Hayden Christensen is great as Anakin and shows us his inner pain incredibly well, definitely not given enough to do here, but expect to see far better work from this guy in the future. Natalie Portman lit up the screen and is cute as ever, hopefully she uses this exposure to get herself into better pictures. Sam Jackson is slick and cool but doesn't do much else, and Ewan McGregor has some nice action sequences but that aside he is just giving Anakin advice the whole movie.This story just never came together for me, and I found myself laughing about it once it was over. Will Star Wars fans be satisfied just because they get to see a continuation in this franchise? This film needed more work where films like this always do, in the script!! The visuals will surely blow you away; though some scenes are so full of CGI I began to get sick of them. Still I will go back to see this film with my friends and see what their reaction is to this movie. It definitely kept me entertained, but mostly for all the wrong reasons.
