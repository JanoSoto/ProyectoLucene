Back then, I was a lot less adventurous in my movie tastes! But after the fact, my dad came out of the theater babbling! Trying in vain to explain to us what he'd just experienced! I'd never seen him so in awe of a film at that point! He'd even said he'd be willing to watch it again just so WE could view it (and my poor dad was NOT a movie buff, by any stretch). So, we went. The opening flash from dark to light in the Mexican Sonoran desert caught my attention! A simple trick, no matte work, no star-ships, but it had me! Then the rest un-spooled; I saw very ordinary people, like my family and I, who were witnessing these extraordinary sights. These were NOT just flying saucers of '50s invasion flicks; these were flying sculptures of light! And the hero, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfus), was a working-class man (with a loud, obnoxious family), just like my poor dad! No wonder he related to this more than STAR WARS or STAR TREK! At the age I was then (10 or so), I was not as sympathetic to the on-screen adult-domestic strife, but when the characters beheld the UFOs, it was cinematic transcendence! As much as STAR WARS awakened my adrenal glands, this one awakened my first stirrings and feelings that I lived in a universe that was far grander and more vast than ANYTHING I could comprehend. Spielberg has said in interviews that a youthful experience of seeing a meteor shower inspired him to make this movie; for me it was the reverse. This film (along with other sci-fi epics like ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS and a few others) inspired my love affair with astronomy (which is still very much alive, incidentally). Seeing the film more recently, I was amazed at how much power it retains; the image of Devil's Tower against a dusky sky, the visions of the mother-ship arrival. You can really FEEL its mass and energy. And for those who deride the musical light-show sequence, it's meant to represent universal themes and music is the language of the soul. While communicating in mathematical or binary coding of some kind might have been more realistic, ala CONTACT, music is more cinematic. And at the end of the day, it is entertainment. While an incredible film, CE3K is not without issues of questionable morality, however. The aliens, while seemingly friendly, think nothing of violent child abduction or disruption of our primitive lives (much as we don't mind taking a kitten from it's mother to have as a pet, I suppose). Or Roy leaving his wife and family to follow a vision. OK, his brood were not exactly the Brady Bunch (no family is), but he seems to show NO feeling of loss or remorse over this (Spielberg has said that this film reflected his relative immaturity at the time; fair enough). Those (and other, lesser) nagging points aside, there are still so many terrific bits to enjoy in this film (and not just the eye candy of the gorgeous UFOs); Carey Guffey (3 or 4 at the time) is totally natural as the abducted child, Barry. Melinda Dillon is very real and earthy as his mother, Gillian. Francois Truffaut brings an honesty and openness to what could've been a one-note role as UFO-logist Claude LeCombe. Some of the best scenes involve no special effects at all; the early air-traffic controller scene is so eerie because of what is NOT shown. Also, the looks on the faces of the returning Flight 19 WW2-era pilots speak volumes. They're not merely shell-shocked; they've seen things that have transformed them forever (I always thought their re-assimilation into the world would've made a fascinating sequel). The aliens themselves are well-executed, especially the older alien that shares hand signal communication with LeCombe. But ultimately, they are beside the point. CE3K is not ABOUT aliens and spaceships; it's about humanity forcibly realizing, as I did sitting in that theater 30 yrs ago, that the universe is a much larger place than my 10(or now 40)year old brain could possibly imagine. CE3K, while indirectly inspiring X-FILES, or even MEN IN BLACK (especially in CE3K's government conspiracy scenes) has one ingredient NONE of its progeny have; a real sense of wonder and scale about the universe. A feeling that didn't really return to cinema until the aforementioned CONTACT, another film of this type. But CE3K still inspires us to watch the skies.

This was nothing more than a below average movie. It might have deserved a rating a little higher than 2 stars, but the ending definitely ruined whatever good was seen in the movie beforehand. I found the script was too simplistic, and the acting nothing more than average (even though I am a huge Meg Ryan fan).

Merryl Streep and William Hurt? Just think about it... The general public on IMDb had much more sense and gave it a lower average score than the critics).This is a film with no real emotions in my opinion. We never really get the feel of the relationship between Ryan and Garcia in the beginning. We never really get to sympathize or feel for the characters as the movie moves along. None of it ever seems real... and everything seems too obvious. In order to compensate for this, the movie resolves itself in the typically Hollywoodian feel-good manner. The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation. Furthermore, building on this concept, the film shows how it is OK to be weak, positive to be a loser, but if you are strong, have values and principles, live according to a set of rules, you are out, almost as if you where sick, you have to be 'healed' so that you too can become a loser...

It's racial bigotry this time put in the old west with Old Man McCandeles as the heavy (literally since it's Barrymore playing the role) - an old time settler who hates Indians. So cue the cute Indian - remarkably poorly played by Jennifer Jones wearing heavy 'egyptian' makeup for most of the movie to darken her up some. OK, she's a 'half breed' Indian, but that's good enough for Barrymore's son, incredibly poorly performed by Peck, to fall in love with her. Peck tries to play a cross between Brando and James Dean failing miserably in the only role I've ever seen him fail at. Well, when he falls, he falls with a huge thud.Then you have Joe Cotton who is the unfavored but 'good' son, Lillian Gish as the weepy ineffective mommie and a whole cast of Hollywood highlights none of who can save this plodder.The problem isn't with the theme of racial tension. It's with the execution. Jones' entire role seems to consist if illogical behaviors punctuated by falling on her face and throwing a tantrum. Count on this one maybe once every 3 minutes. She needs to choose between bad boy Peck and good boy Cotton. Of course she gets it wrong which works out wonderfully for Old Joe who moves on with his life finding himself a much more reasonable fiancé.Much of the outside the bedroom twists around the coming of the railroad. A huge cattle baron like Barrymore should welcome it but he doesn't. This leads to a range war lead up which fizzles. Around then, whatever cohesion the picture had unravels in one illogical move after another interspersed with over heated crying jags - usually by Jones but with Gish having her silly cry and even Barrymore trying for the Crusty Guy's Cry.In the end, one guy (remember this is the Old West) gets shot in the intestinal area but recovers - thus making medical history or a miracle.

It's racial bigotry this time put in the old west with Old Man McCandeles as the heavy (literally since it's Barrymore playing the role) - an old time settler who hates Indians. So cue the cute Indian - remarkably poorly played by Jennifer Jones wearing heavy 'egyptian' makeup for most of the movie to darken her up some. OK, she's a 'half breed' Indian, but that's good enough for Barrymore's son, incredibly poorly performed by Peck, to fall in love with her. Peck tries to play a cross between Brando and James Dean failing miserably in the only role I've ever seen him fail at. Well, when he falls, he falls with a huge thud.Then you have Joe Cotton who is the unfavored but 'good' son, Lillian Gish as the weepy ineffective mommie and a whole cast of Hollywood highlights none of who can save this plodder.The problem isn't with the theme of racial tension. It's with the execution. Jones' entire role seems to consist if illogical behaviors punctuated by falling on her face and throwing a tantrum. Count on this one maybe once every 3 minutes. She needs to choose between bad boy Peck and good boy Cotton. Of course she gets it wrong which works out wonderfully for Old Joe who moves on with his life finding himself a much more reasonable fiancé.Much of the outside the bedroom twists around the coming of the railroad. A huge cattle baron like Barrymore should welcome it but he doesn't. This leads to a range war lead up which fizzles. Around then, whatever cohesion the picture had unravels in one illogical move after another interspersed with over heated crying jags - usually by Jones but with Gish having her silly cry and even Barrymore trying for the Crusty Guy's Cry.In the end, one guy (remember this is the Old West) gets shot in the intestinal area but recovers - thus making medical history or a miracle.
