With Connery continuing his suave but violent role, he manages to make this film fun yet plausible at the same time with the villain being not so insane as seen before. I felt that this film was solidly a Kind of good film film, and here below is why I felt so.The story is good fun and the adventure although maybe not scraping every part of the world, still manages to get a lot of out of only one real location it is set in. It has some good action and good scenes that are quintessential to any Bond fans, with big weapons and an underwater scene that is one of the resounding images of this film, it is just all good stuff, and with a plot that isn't afraid to be both light and dark.Connery comes back with maybe a film that wouldn't be his proudest Bond, but still manages to entertain and do a job that many think, no one can do better. Largo the villain is a good villain, maybe slightly stereotypically Bond but is still a bad one, which turns out good. I felt Adolfo Celi who plays him is very good and stands out for me as one of those villains who is evil when you least expect it, a cunning man indeed.The stunts are good fun and some of the things involved go a long way to entertain you, I especially liked that this film didn't have to rely on car chases for fun, it has more thrilling chases and a lot of boats are involved too. It is written OK and the script doesn't really go anywhere to help the film although Connery uses it well to his advantage, overall it is Connery who helps this film to it's rating.The only thing I could really find wrong with this film is that at times it can be slow and maybe just a bit boring, I feel this was only because the film has one setting for the majority of the film and although it is an interesting plot, maybe the over use of location effects it. It could also be said that the film lacks enough humour needed for early Bonds but that it is really up to you if you decide to watch it.Bond fans should enjoy this and although I don't think this will be there favourite one, it will still serve to entertain. Those who like Bonds with a much more spy like feel will enjoy this as he seems to get into some hiding places and stake outs to root out his enemy. One more thing to say is that this film has some great characters throughout and who is good and who is bad is always hard to predict, good fun.Overall I give this a 7\/10, Solidly a kind of Good film, with this you have to just enjoy this and see exactly what Sean can do in a Bond film, I will mention the underwater scenes again because Connery executes them very well and it is one thing that sticks in your mind when you think about the film. Just see what you think with this and ignore all other ratings including mine, you might just love this.

The blind old man he meets acts much like an adoptive father, taking him in and caring for him, the monster also being much needed company for the old man.

The accent, the body language, the kidnapping of the protagonist wife to blackmail him into doing his bidding, its all there and oh boy is it fun to watch.

F.W. Murnau played a key role in the German Expressionist movement and Nosferatu is one of its greatest examples. This movement went on to influence other great directors such as Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock especially in the way they played with shadows and lighting to express the emotions of their characters and enhance the mood of their films. This silent film might have scared audiences in the 20's, but it is really outdated and I struggled to maintain my interest in the story. I have to give it credit for shaping modern horror films today and also influencing the film noir genre, but no matter how much I appreciate it, Nosferatu was far from entertaining for me. One of my favorite things about this film was Count Orlok's makeup which was really creepy, along with how Murnau used the lighting and played with shadows to build the suspense. Those moments were great, but the story really didn't lead up to much and Orlok got very little screen time. I'd personally recommend watching those brief scenes instead of sitting through the entire film. The film uses a lot of title cards and they leave them on screen for so long you could practically read everything twice. There is no denying this was a masterpiece, but I had a hard time sticking with it.The screenplay was written by Henrik Galeen, heavily stealing from its source material, Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. In Nosferatu we are first introduced to a real estate agent named Knock (Alexander Granach) who is sending his associate, Hutter (Gustav von Wagenheim) to Count Orlak's (Max Schreck) castle in Transylvania. Orlak is looking to buy a house in Wisbourg, and Knock is considering selling him the home next to Hutter's. Hutter realizes this is a great opportunity to make some money so he leaves his wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder), with some friends while he embarks on the long journey. Along the way several people warn him about the strange events that occur at night near Orlak's castle, but he continues on. Once he reaches the castle, he has an awkward conversation with Orlak and when he accidentally cuts his finger he realizes that Orlak is in fact a Nosferatu (vampire). When Orlak sees a picture of Ellen he quickly decides to buy the new home and is shipped to Wisbourg in a coffin. On the way back several crew members of the ship mysteriously die and some sort of plague seems to have reached the city. Hutter and Ellen know what's really going on, but the question is whether or not they can stop this evil creature.Nosferatu is all about the eerie atmosphere that Murnau managed to create with a very low budget. It turned away from the standard action-adventure and comedy films of the silent era by creating something unique and exploring such emotions as fear and suspense. Most contemporary horror films probably have to credit Murnau for being a landmark film and setting the stage for them. Nosferatu is a Gothic stylized film that has influenced the way we view cinema today so we owe Murnau a lot of gratitude for his work. Unfortunately films are subjective and despite my appreciation for this film I did not enjoy it as much as other film lovers. I did like the cast and the editing however, but the pacing of the film was what I had issues with.

Similarly, I wasn't that interested on the 2013 re-imagining of the novel (which is NOT a remake of the 1976 film, as so many people wrongly think) for the same reason didn't think it would be better than what I had already seen. Oh boy was I wrong!!! The main reason why the 2013 version is SO much better is because it follows the novel much closer it's mainly a drama with horror, unlike the '76 version, which didn't care about what the poor Carrie White went through and just wanted to scare the audience about a poor innocent and bullied girl, which I find disgusting. The re-imagining, right from the start, gets you into Carrie's shoes, and you FEEL her pain, from being bullied every day, unlike the previous version where you never cared that much about her, since the screenplay didn't bother with that. The 2013 version is ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING while the '76 one is just your average teen slasher, with the main character using telekinesis to kill others instead of knives as the main difference.As well, the acting is BEYOND THIS WORLD on the re-imagining Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore are both phenomenal and should have won Oscars, with the rest of the cast (specially Judy Greer, Portia Doubleday and Ansel Elgort) being also fantastic. Compare this with the '76 version, where the acting was so over the top that both Amy Irving and Piper Laurie thought their characters were comic (and you can read this in the trivia of this film right here on IMDb) the first one thought that her character was for comic relief as she spent most of the time in the film bickering like an idiot with her boyfriend (unlike the novel, where all their conversations are deadly serious) while Piper Laurie admits herself that she overacted so much that she thought the film had to be a comedy. No more comments are required about the acting, as it's clear, other than even though Sissy Spacek was quite good, Chloe Grace Moretz was not only much better, and had the right age for the character (which in the book is a teenager and not someone approaching her thirties, like Sissy Spacek was when filming) but looks much more like her as well (as Carrie is described in the book itself) as well as acting far more similar to her, by, for example, being far more vocal and less naive than the '76 character (again, just like in the novel).Some of you may think 'but King himself liked the '76 version a lot'. Well, even though I'm his biggest fan, I have to admit(and everybody knows really) that he is no expert at films, as shown by his direction and screenplay in the terrible 'Maximum Overdrive' (1986), on his multiple horrible screenplays, such as for the terrible 1994 TV adaptation of his fantastic novel 'The Stand' (and several others) and on choosing the not so good director Mick Garris to direct several of his book adaptations, such as 'Riding The Bullet' (2004), 'Desperation' (2006) 'Sleepwalkers' (1992) and others. Somehow in all the aforementioned adaptations the story always changes from being extremely dark in the books(as typical in King's books) to something far lighter which even approaches soap operas in theme.Everything else is also much better in the 2013 version phenomenal and heartfelt direction by Kimberly Peirce ('Boys Don't Cry'), vastly improved screenplay written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, beautiful and haunting music by Marco Beltrami (unlike the Psycho rip-off of the '76 film) and far better special effects, to name just a few aspects vastly improved from De Palma's film.Do yourself a favour and forget about this film and instead watch the 2013 version HONESTLY that is, not just to criticise it but to discover what a fabulous film it is, and using your own mind to decide whether you like it or not, not what others have said.

If someone asked you to give them a detailed plot of Frankenstein, you could do it. Every scene is crafted with such careful plotting and detail that you cant help but be sucked in by how well Director James Whale creates such a memorable film.Boris Karloff, do I need to introduce this man, do I?. He is a man who could be captivating spouting lines about life and death (ala The Man They Could Not Hang), but also when saying nothing at all, like when he plays the monster himself, yes the monster, not Frankenstein, the monster. Karloff gives the monster a sad humanity, the fact he just wants to be accepted is such a relatable feeling that we start to feel sympathy for this supposed monster. He isn't evil, he's misunderstood, even the killing of the young child wasn't done in cold blood, it was an accident, when he finds out he panics and runs away, like a young child who never intended to do anything wrong. Karloff is rightly remembered for his role as the monster, one of the greatest silent portrayals of a man who just wants peace, and to be left alone most of all.Colin Clive portrays Dr. Henry Frankenstein, a man who is infatuated with life, obsessed with wanting to create life from parts of the dead. Clives performance is no doubt where the mad scientist trope came from, he is very intense in everything he does, going slightly mad from trying to do something that no man has ever dreamed. He is however a very sympathetic character. His intentions are noble, trying to find the secret of eternal life, to help mankind. Of course he also wants to be respected in his field but unlike others who create monsters, he never intended to use his creation for evil. Once he sees what trying to create life has done, the monster he created and how it has affected him and his relationship with his wife, he repents from ever trying to toy with the natural order of life and death again. Clive really does rival Karloff for best performance of the film.Dwight Fry as Fritz is another performance that could rival Clive and Karloff. He's such a strange character, a character thats motives are never really clear, maybe thats why I like him so much. Dwight Fry never did get the recognition he deserved, his roles in subsequent films were whittled down to cameos, and by the time he died in 1943 I don't believe anyone really remembered him. Shame, he was easily alongside the best when it came to horror films.Overall, Frankenstein is captivating cinema.

Its director (Terrence Malick) took almost two years to get it edited. You can tell. However, please don't let that diminish your opinion of it. As a connoisseur of many types of films, I am confident when I say that Days of Heaven is one that touches greatness. It's a movie's movie and is filmmaking in its most purest, not to mention most exposed form. Almost every image on screen is indelible. Pretty much every character is realized. Every nuance of nature has its own still frame and to be honest, film as art has never been more important than it was when this masterpiece got released in the fall of 1978. It notably launched the acting careers of Richard Gere and Sam Shepard. And it pulls off something very special. Let's be honest, how many other movies do you know that have a short running time of 90 plus minutes, manage to be this massively epic in scope? Yup, I couldn't agree more.Part vagabond adventure, part love triangle, and part early 1900's parable, Days of Heaven tells the story of Bill (Gere), a laborer out of Chicago who commits an accidental murder (kills his boss) and then flees the state with his lover Abby (Brooke Adams) and his sister (narrator Linda Manz). The three of them end up somewhere in the plains of Texas (Alberta, Canada was the actual location), find jobs on a wheat farm and become involved with the rich landowner (Sam Sheppard in first true role) who owns it. The storytelling in this film, although choppy, eventually finds its focus and it releases itself like a sledgehammer in the final act. When it comes to the musical score, there is a sort of haunting eerie beauty to it. However, it also resonates a feeling of radiant hope. The story or plot along with the music however, sort of takes a back seat to the visual splendor. Make no mistake about it; this is probably one of the most beautiful films you will ever see. Its cinematography won a well deserved Academy Award and with this being Malick's second major release, he pretty much announced himself to the world as a prominent visual auteur. Every scene is filled to the brim with little nooks and crannies. You get beautiful waterfalls, close-ups of locusts in their natural habitat, sped up windmills (even wind is a star in this flick), and incredibly lush sky imagery. I read somewhere that a critic said you can take any image from Days of Heaven and frame it as a painting. Darn, that's what's I wanted to say! Anyway, if you are a budding filmmaker, an aspiring movie critic, or just a radical screen buff, this is the ultimate foray into one's film education. Days of Heaven is a sort of cinematic translator. It will make you understand the power of cinema and its never ending possibilities. Don't hesitate to check it out. Remember heaven can't wait.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 May 2014","score":"","review":" Days of Heaven will forever remain one of my all time favorite films. Its director (Terrence Malick) took almost two years to get it edited. You can tell. However, please don't let that diminish your opinion of it. As a connoisseur of many types of films, I am confident when I say that Days of Heaven is one that touches greatness. It's a movie's movie and is filmmaking in its most purest, not to mention most exposed form. Almost every image on screen is indelible. Pretty much every character is realized. Every nuance of nature has its own still frame and to be honest, film as art has never been more important than it was when this masterpiece got released in the fall of 1978. It notably launched the acting careers of Richard Gere and Sam Shepard. And it pulls off something very special. Let's be honest, how many other movies do you know that have a short running time of 90 plus minutes, manage to be this massively epic in scope? Yup, I couldn't agree more.Part vagabond adventure, part love triangle, and part early 1900's parable, Days of Heaven tells the story of Bill (Gere), a laborer out of Chicago who commits an accidental murder (kills his boss) and then flees the state with his lover Abby (Brooke Adams) and his sister (narrator Linda Manz). The three of them end up somewhere in the plains of Texas (Alberta, Canada was the actual location), find jobs on a wheat farm and become involved with the rich landowner (Sam Sheppard in first true role) who owns it. The storytelling in this film, although choppy, eventually finds its focus and it releases itself like a sledgehammer in the final act. When it comes to the musical score, there is a sort of haunting eerie beauty to it. However, it also resonates a feeling of radiant hope. The story or plot along with the music however, sort of takes a back seat to the visual splendor. Make no mistake about it; this is probably one of the most beautiful films you will ever see. Its cinematography won a well deserved Academy Award and with this being Malick's second major release, he pretty much announced himself to the world as a prominent visual auteur. Every scene is filled to the brim with little nooks and crannies. You get beautiful waterfalls, close-ups of locusts in their natural habitat, sped up windmills (even wind is a star in this flick), and incredibly lush sky imagery. I read somewhere that a critic said you can take any image from Days of Heaven and frame it as a painting. Darn, that's what's I wanted to say!

It captures the all American spirit of the time and harnesses that glorious 30's feel with every frame. Johnston really did superbly well with this film and capturing the very essence of that classic early comicbook\/serial type hero and integrating it with that all American WWII wartime effort vibe.Just seeing the old movie poster shows you how much care and attention to detail went into this film. The poster has a fantastic art deco design (from the era) of our heroic lead character, its simple and minimal but does the job a thousand times over, I love it, one of the best posters created. Even the font for the text is absolutely perfect looking.Although the character was created in 82 its an obvious homage to pulp comicbooks and matinée\/serial hero characters of the 30's\/40's, the idea is simple but it works so so well. The whole film has that Indy feel to it and completes a trilogy of classic pulp comicbook superheroes alongside 'The Shadow' and 'The Phantom'...in my opinion. All characters of the era and all similar in design, typical manly and dashing in smart outfits, saving poor damsels in distress for breakfast.The film is nothing but fun and doesn't pretend to be serious or shy away from the ham n cheese. Dalton is the dastardly caddish villain who is clearly suppose to be Errol Flynn, Connelly is the soppy damsel in distress, Sorvino is the classic American gangster in a tubby Al Capone style ('Eddie Valentine'? perfect American mobster name methinks), O'Quinn plays Howard Hughes amazingly well and Tiny Ron is a character straight out of 'Dick Tracy'. New boy Campbell also does really well as the lead character giving the role a fresh feel and no ego problems which tend to come with big names.The film looks great and has some terrific design work, the rocket pack looks cool and practical with more nice art deco touches...as does the helmet with its rudder fin on the top. Effects were considered very good at the time with lots of high flying thrills and aerial stunts, bluescreen heavily used of course. Nowadays the effects do look rather iffy and obvious but that tends to add to the charm really, it doesn't detract from the excitement in any way. The plot is straight forward but it does get a bit beyond itself towards the finale, like how on earth does a huge Nazi Zeppelin fly into the US undetected? I guess its suppose to be the 30's so who knows, radar not at its best back then huh (well it was in its early days I believe). I must also mention the brilliant animated black n white short in the middle of the flick which shows the Nazi's intentions with the rocket pack. Truly awesome animation that is sharp as a knife to this day, it could easily have been a separate film (or series) in itself.I really can't fault this film in any way, sure its silly but its well worked escapism and an affectionate tribute to the era, anyone of any age would have fun watching this. Without taking anything away from the creators you could almost say its like an adventure from a young Indiana Jones, an early tale from his younger years, a prequel even. I love how they didn't shy away from using the Nazi's as the bad guys despite it being a family film, an important requirement. The Indiana Jones of the skies, fighting the dastardly Nazi's and their incredible machines of war, hell this is really what 'Captain America' should have been like.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 May 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Its a real shame this film bombed so much at the box office, I really can't understand why it did so badly as its one of the best comicbook adaptations around.

The monster by the end of Bride was a fully formed character, we knew who he was as a character and was fully relatable. Son decides to toss that out the window and basically reboot the monster. In fact, Son actually ignores Bride almost completely, it doesn't mention anything of Dr. Pretorius, what happened to the Bride etc. I realise this takes place about 40 years after Bride because Baron is Henry Frankensteins son, and at the end of Bride he didn't have a son, but ... I don't care, you can throw all the excuses you want as to why everything makes perfect sense from Bride to Son but to me it doesn't feel as connected as it should.Karloff isn't the heavyweight he was in the original and Bride. He puts in a good performance but after Bride you expected more from the character, and because the character has reset, Karloff really can't do much with him, so I blame the writing, not Karloff himself.But lets get into why I love this film. Bela Lugosi and Basil Rathbone as Ygor and Baron Wolf Von Frankenstein. Lugosi as Ygor rivals Dracula as his best performance. The weird, raspy voiced man with a broken neck completely upstages Karloff in every scene, a character that was probably as much fun to play for Lugosi as it was to watch for me. Baron is a fantastic character, having to deal with being in the dark shadows of his fathers actions he slowly becomes a nervous wreck as the film progresses leading to a great scene with Lionel Atwill while playing darts.Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh is a blast as well, great dramatic performance as a man whose armed was ripped from its roots by the monster when he was a young boy.Overall, Son Of Frankenstein is a fantastic film.

If you think along the lines of 'Dick Tracy' and 'The Rocketeer' then you will get an idea of the vibe going on here. Even though the budget for 'The Phantom' was actually bigger than this film, director Mulcahy's film certainly looks the slicker and more realistic.The character of The Shadow isn't anything really special to be honest, its just a guy in a cloak with a fedora type hat on and he carries two guns. He always did seem like a poor man's Batman in all honesty, not too distant from the Phantom or Darkman actually. The main difference with this guy is the fact he does actually have some special super powers. He can cloud men's minds (what about women?) with a kind of spiritual hypnosis that blinds people to his presence...accept for his shadow oddly enough, hence his name. Oh and he's pretty snazzy with the two guns also. This character fits his dark little world perfectly in both his crime fighting form and his alias as a rich good looking 'Bruce Wayne' type. His lair has a neat little secret entrance just like Wayne Manor to the Batcave and he lurks around in the shadows quite nicely.The plot is an odd one, Baldwin starts off as a bad guy in Tibet after succumbing to his darker side not long after WWI (dunno why). He is then kidnapped by some wise holy man who for some reason will train Baldwin to be a good guy, unsure why really, but in the end he goes back to New York and begins his Batman-esque lifestyle.

So basically he is Batman but with less cash to have hi-tech...and minus Robin for a couple of wild animals he trained.Of course it is suppose to be almost a pantomime type flick with lots of silly lines and caddish villains, but it is a touch too childish for me in places, where as other pulp comicbook character adaptations like 'The Shadow' are a bit more serious. The Phantom's world is a pretty looking universe I must say, the jungle lair, 30's New York and the museum set where one of the skulls is kept, are all really well created. They have that lovely thick structured wooden stylish design with that nice dark noirish colour range (much like 'The Shadow').The story of this character is just as cheesy as his attire. A boy (400 years in the past) witnesses the murder of his father by some pirates who attack their ship. The boy is washed ashore and gets looked after by some tribes folk. They give him the Skull Ring for some reason and because of this he decides to dedicate his life to stopping naughty people...by becoming the masked avenger The Phantom. This role is passed down from father to son over generations (along with the Skull Ring) and leads to the rumour that the Phantom is an immortal crime fighter (everyone thinks all these Phantoms over the hundreds of years are the same one person). So its all a bit Batman-ish really (but Batman came first!), the rest of the plot mainly involves the Phantom searching for skulls that have great power of destruction and stopping bad guys from getting their hands on them (in the present day of 1938). Simple clichéd stuff really.Effects are dated now of course and the fights do look rather gentle, hell even back when the film was released it wasn't that great effects and stunts wise. I almost expected Kapow! to flash across the screen when Zane punched one of the cookie cutter henchmen baddies.

The fact he has a wolf and horse as his loyal sidekicks is also kinda odd really, odd combination wouldn't you think, plus he does look a bit daft on that horse in his purple catsuit. Didn't really think much of the pirates that make up the bad guys either, especially at the end which really turns into Schumacher-esque type affair. I must say I think Treat Williams was miscast as the main villain, I'm sure they could have found someone more caddish looking. But overall its all taken from the original source material (three stories) so that's good I suppose, its just the original stories and ideas are predictably very out of time now.I love how no one recognises 'Kit Walker' when he dons his Phantom black mask, just like Robin its so stupid that no one see right through it...figuratively speaking.

When it comes down to it, everyone involved realizes how much more difficult of a situation it is than they originally anticipated. What's important about this film is that it takes even the most liberal of individuals and explores just how accepting of different ideas they truly are.While the film is very conversational, the subject material of the movie makes it both engaging and interesting to watch.
