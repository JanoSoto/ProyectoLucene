They laugh, they fight, they learn, and by the end of the flick, things have changed, but their fire has remained.You might recognize three stars of The Breakfast Club -- Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estevez -- who have magically turned into college grads, and alongside Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe and Mare Winningham, round out the solid cast of St. Elmo's Fire. A good decade before bringing a perfectly good Batman franchise to its knees, writer\/director Joel Schumacher did what few films could do with the Brat Pack in tow. That is, he created a film that dared to be over-dramatic and dared to touch upon the ugliness of growing up long after the security of school and family has faded. While some characters and their stories are questionable (Emilio Estevez, I'm looking at you), the little stories that make up their day-to-day life are, for the most part, stuff that everyone goes through, and none of the actors seem ashamed to look ridiculous in portraying the selfish, the immature and the inexperienced. For the most part, the characters feel real, and that's why the film works as well as it does.Perhaps it's a little too over-dramatic and self-indulgent for its own good, but maybe that's the point. All seven characters are colorful, albeit, horribly flawed human beings, and it shows in the most awkward and endearing moments of the film. You may not understand their decisions or why they choose to bring so much drama down on themselves, but you'll at least relate to it in one way or another. How you interpret and appreciate the film rests both in your position in life and whether or not you can recognize the biggest flaws in yourself. It's a film that will speak volumes to anyone fresh out of college, in their 20's or with the hindsight to realize how silly and self-made much of the drama in their life has been.

So in that, this isn't much of a review as such, because I would simply urge people to give it a go. Why you ask?, well because it's one of those films that can brighten your day when things have gone dark, you got The Duke and The Marv slugging each other at regular intervals, not in the normal way associated with these guys, but jocular-with this biff bang machismo comes laughs a plenty. We have Romero and his beard on prime slime mode, Allen as delicious as she is prim and proper and the Kaua'i location work gorgeously realised by William H. Clothier's photography. It's not just a comedy either.

What is different about their relationship in this compared to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is that Hooker has no experience and is therefore low on knowledge about how to do a long con compared to Newman's Character Gondorff who has more experience at them. Gondorff is Hooker's mentor who shows him the ropes. Hooker starts off cocky, not believing there is anything Gondorff can show him but gains respect for him the more he is around him. Robert Shaw brilliantly plays Lonnegan and the rest of the cast make the film a success- Robert Earl Jones (Luther), Eileen Brennan (Billie), Charles Durning (Snyder), Dana Elcar (FBI Agent Polk), Ray Walston (J.J. Singleton) and Harold Gould (Kid Twist).I think all the elements come together so well- the music, the costumes, the story and look of the movie. There has been a lot of complaints that the music is wrong to use because it wasn't around at the time of the film and yes, it wasn't around at that time but you can't deny it works so well with the action and compliments it so well. It is very interesting to see the type of cons played in those days to how they are played today which are showed in TV series like Hustle.The film is another hit for Newman and Redford which worked so well because as I have said all the strands came together so well thanks not only to the cast but the people behind the camera such as George Roy Hill (Director), David S. Ward (Writer), Edith Head (Costumes), Scott Joplin's music and Robert Surtees (Cinematography).

There is a good degree of tension throughout this movie as the conspiracy unfolds, and this is almost palpable toward the two climaxes, first at the concert hall, and again at the embassy. There are several comedic moments too, such as the bloke trying to save his swordfish in the taxidermist's workroom! Also, Caroline Jones pops up from time-to-time looking quite uncomfortable with her hair dyed blonde.A couple of interesting points in this film Que Sera Sera is billed as What will be in the credits; and I've never seen Jimmy Stewart do comedy before, though he often does drop some quite witty lines in his movies, (with a bit of a smile), but the restaurant scene when his knees are up around his neck is a real crack-up, and he does it so easily that it is funny without being slapstick.Doris Day and Jimmy Stewart are brilliant together, and they take you on a ride through all the emotions, and of course, Doris gets to sing a couple of songs as well, (it wouldn't be a Doris Day film otherwise, would it?). This is an excellent pairing of these two Hollywood icons, and I find it a pity that they didn't do more work together.

At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was\/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much.

I am finding Amanda's stuff to mostly end in a way that I can find to be scary and I was wondering how to find a way to more fully love that when I found that I had a vocation to have another look at Scary Movie I and 2. I got that vocation by finding disks of the last two features in this series. * Used to be I found Scary Movie the first to have lots of high comedy but lots of putridity too. I was coming at this from a background of long term religious fundamentalism so the queasiness should be no surprise. Those who hoped to do things by the book in the 90's risked getting heavily mangled and distorted. Scary Movie 2 turned the pressure up on that, the exorcist scene was too strong. The servant is too difficult too, as an ex religious fundamentalist I do know that everyone should feel a duty to give one's neighbour a big helping hand? June 2009 I was looking at all of the Scary Movie features and yet this one I did not bother. Scary Movie 3, difficult. Me having a love for The Ring, this seemed, at first, to be the special one. Except have you noticed how the transgendered are portrayed? Even the clergy fare better. I have watched 3 a few times but it really is not my choice of viewing. Except Cindy is so cute, this role maturing through the four features. The feel of the humour is often so different in 3 and such as the 8 Mile battle, vomit excepting, took a while to accept as having anything to do with humour. As if 3 has big chunks of the fun humour of the first, but mixed with a sort of emptiness and alienation, given my own particular taste. Sympathies to Clinton, the only US president who, from a distance, seemed to be a real person. Scary Movie 4, following in the footsteps of 3. The difficulties that I had in 3 are there in 4. The transgendered one is portrayed as in Natasha Lyonne's Trickbaby, an impressive feature but the transgendered one is definitely a baddie. Religious fundamentalists get a roasting here too, though there is a gem of a toilet joke. The positive aspects that I could experience in 4 were mostly because of Cindy, Anna Faris in that particular role. I have noticed that some others have also noted that in their user comments re the series. Rachel stands out for me too, she is the girl who has a role similar to the girl in 3, just Rachel is heavily influenced by Jodelle Ferland of Tideland (2005)?

This takes some modern target classes and vomits on us. So, the rest of the characters are diseased too. There is a nice bit of kiddie humour re the Hamish in M.K&A's witness protection feature Our Lips Are Sealed but I should be shocked that they get the treatment that they do in Scary Movie 4. So now I have seen all of this series a few times, each. I can enjoy chunks of most of them if I only watch them rarely. There really is some magnificent humour here. Just there is that other side. I also, so far, mostly like it that favourite movies are quoted. I can definitely like it that Cindy and Buffy G quote two Rose Byrne movies, Frank and Wicker. The enigma of Amanda Bynes.

It is, in fact, based on a play by Patrick Hamilton and save for the opening first few minutes, looks very like it was in fact entirely shot for a live audience. More than ninety percent of the movie takes place in a small apartment room. The performances by the cast are very Laurence Olivier-like in their style&#x97;very dramatic, out there, theater quality. And the dialogue itself is very much like one would expect from a stage production. Obviously, the film stayed faithful to its original source. Rope seems like it was shot in a theater on a stage and this may seem like a detractor for some audience members, but to them, I say that this marvelous murder story is just proof that a stage production can be just as exhilarating as a feature film. Yes, it is a film shot with cameras and on a set with a controlling director, but it still has the authentic and wonderful feeling of a well-realized stage drama.In the film, two prep school graduates played by John Dall and Farley Granger turn upon one of their fellow students (Dick Hogan) right away shortly after the film begins and murder them as a sort of experiment to test themselves and the perfection of their plan. They hide the body of their strangled colleague inside an old trunk in their apartment and what's more, arrange a party to take place later in the evening. As one of the cons begins to lose his composure and his grip on reality, their former mentor (James Stewart) becomes increasingly wary about their behavior and the true whereabouts of the missing guest.As I mentioned earlier, save for the opening credits shot, all of the movie takes place inside the apartment and what's more, the movie also is shot in very long, stretched-out takes. Hitchcock was obviously trying to recapture the feeling of the stage story and probably would have shot the movie with a single camera if technology would have allowed him to. The film was shot in exactly ten takes (a single camera reel lasts about ten minutes) and begins to assume the abilities of an invisible guest in the apartment, wandering freely about the room, focusing on certain individuals, and keeping a wary eye on the trunk where the corpse lies within. This is the ultimate genius of Hitchcock's direction and the cinematography. That while the actors are playing as though this were a stage, the camera keeps on the move so that we stay interested. There is one annoying little detail. Since the camera cannot go on forever, when the reel was close to an end and the take can to stop, the camera zooms in on an actor's back or a dark object in the room. And there is no real psychological explanation as to why the camera would do this and you can only know if you've read up on the production of the film, but again, this is only happens a handful of times and therefore doesn't become too distracting.Rope is also a very well-acted motion picture, especially in regards to John Dall as the experimenting murderer whose only motivation for the killing was to test himself and his limits as a human being. This was also the first of four films that James Stewart collaborated on with Alfred Hitchcock; unfortunately, Stewart felt much less happy with this as the other three. Stewart felt he was badly miscast in this movie and when you look at his performance, yes, he doesn't present the true range of colors and audience-friendly qualities that he gave us in Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and previous films like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Perhaps he was not quintessentially cast like he was the other three films I mentioned, but I have to say that it was a welcome sight to see Stewart in a murder mystery and it's comforting to remark that if it hadn't been for this film, Stewart and Hitchcock may have not later collaborated on their truly famous and wonderful projects in the 50s.But all in all, more than sixty years since it was first released, Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is a very good film. No, it's not on the same level as some of his other projects. This seems a little more like a warm-up for him and his later murder mysteries, but remember, this is Alfred Hitchcock, whose 'warm-ups' were marvelous.

Since the camera cannot go on forever, when the reel was close to an end and the take can to stop, the camera zooms in on an actor's back or a dark object in the room. And there is no real psychological explanation as to why the camera would do this and you can only know if you've read up on the production of the film, but again, this is only happens a handful of times and therefore doesn't become too distracting.Rope is also a very well-acted motion picture, especially in regards to John Dall as the experimenting murderer whose only motivation for the killing was to test himself and his limits as a human being. This was also the first of four films that James Stewart collaborated on with Alfred Hitchcock; unfortunately, Stewart felt much less happy with this as the other three. Stewart felt he was badly miscast in this movie and when you look at his performance, yes, he doesn't present the true range of colors and audience-friendly qualities that he gave us in Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and previous films like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Perhaps he was not quintessentially cast like he was the other three films I mentioned, but I have to say that it was a welcome sight to see Stewart in a murder mystery and it's comforting to remark that if it hadn't been for this film, Stewart and Hitchcock may have not later collaborated on their truly famous and wonderful projects in the 50s.But all in all, more than sixty years since it was first released, Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is a very good film. No, it's not on the same level as some of his other projects. This seems a little more like a warm-up for him and his later murder mysteries, but remember, this is Alfred Hitchcock, whose 'warm-ups' were marvelous.

Rather than make a brash statement on anything global or political, Easy Rider narrows things down and quietly observes what's going on within a nation and how a generation are acting and reacting to what's expected of them. The film is easy to relate to in both a generational and approach-like sense; that is to say, two people; on motorcycles; cruising the country and essentially discovering as much about themselves as they are the nation and the should-be manner in which to exist in this time and place.The film opens with its two chief protagonists named Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) meeting up with some shady men under the flight path of some low flying aircrafts. We eventually discover that they have just sold some drugs and, with the money earned from this, they are to travel across America to New Orleans. The opening feels like some sort of sordid silent movie, with distorted and deafening aircraft noises acting as harsh sound effects for a relatively simple scene while a series of expressions and reactions are revealed that get across the bulk of how these people feel and react to the situation. It feels cramped, loud and quite disorientating, particularly given it is the very opening of the film. Hopper then offers us some relief; a cut to a true opening shot of the deserts of somewhere as two bikes head down a road. Hopper juxtaposes shot choice and atmosphere brilliantly; it feels more upbeat as the new situation is they've inherited all this money, no longer have monkeys on their backs and are off on a road trip together. But this 'proper' opening is again turned on its head when we realise later on just what has transpired. It is a false and purposefully pleasant opening to a journey that will be anything but.You might say that one of maybe a few sub-themes in Easy Rider is dreams. Wyatt talks a lot early on about the American Dream and how he is perhaps slightly envious of the people living the typical American Dream, in the sense they might own a farm; be their own bosses and live off the land. Hopper's attention mise-en-scene is equally impressive. His alluding as to where the money earned by way of selling these drugs is situated for the duration of the trip is interesting, as are the clothes his two leads wear. Bathed in the American flag, Wyatt wears the symbol of the very nation he is both exploring and wants to subscribe to in terms of its ideation. Additionally, it is Wyatt's chopper that houses the, some might say, ill gained money and it is a petrol tank covered in a print of the American flag that houses the very contents which is allowing these two to seek and fund their fortunes.Along the way, the film will seductively begin to apply greater ideas to the overall notion of both the American Dream, the pros and cons of that ideation and the rather interesting study of individualism. The delivery is pretty clear cut in the sense Wyatt and Billy's interactions with a rancher and his family during a large dinner gathering offer one side of the ideation working whereas a, more larger, group of people are not able to subscribe to one of Wyatt's earlier fantasies of growing one's own crops and living freely, as these people cut off from the dominant social groups and beliefs. One might argue that this 'group' of whom cannot quite achieve this are of a more spiritual and religious kind, but rather than act as an entirely frank demonisation of any particular sects, we must remember they additionally subscribe to casual drug use and 'free love' which, depending on how you want to look at the text, might act as a distinct study of how not to live even though your initial priorities of not going with the norm are in place.Another interesting element to the text is Jack Nicholson's character of George Hanson, a voice of reason and a man who we might assume to have already subscribed to some kind of American Dream plan when we realise he is a lawyer. Nicholson portrays Hanson as an observant but slightly eccentric individual, someone who isn't afraid to voice opinions. It's interesting for the film to spend so much time with the two leads we're given and then introduce Hanson, who is more intelligent and who is someone that formally identifies Billy as an archetype of individualism and freedom through his hair, clothing and actions. On this level, you might assume Hanson to represent a sort of voice for the picture; as a person that comes just as easy as he goes and re-enforces the ideas of individualism just as efficiently as he points them out. A sort of 'I have no idea who you are but I sort of know what beliefs you subscribe to, and that's fine with me' way of thinking.Some might argue that the film needs to unfold in the deep south to get across the opinion, which one of the characters themselves exclaim, when it appears the nation is falling apart in order to demonise that region of the country. Others might say it is representative of the whole nation as a collective group of people forever shunning those on the outskirts, in minorities, doing their own thing. What might easily have been a series of daft scenes and occurrences compiled together to form a meandering at times road trip actually turns out to be an interesting and quite powerful odyssey for the-then free spirit.

I was simply blown away by J.J. Abrams' new STAR TREK reboot that my inner admiration for the 10-film big screen STAR TREK series is somehow reawakened. I'm not exactly a an avid fan of Gene Roddenberry's 43 year-old franchise, which began as a TV series and proceeded into a movie series and continued with more TV shows. But to be honest, I have grown a sort of affection for the big-screen series, which I find interesting and enduring as stand-alone films. But after seeing the new reboot (and loving it), I guess it's time to pay a visit to those classic original crew movies. And what better place to start than one of the best in the series STAR TREK II THE WRATH OF KHAN? While I loved the new STAR TREK for the typical summer-movie dosage of action, humor and thrills, I also liked how it had time to introduce (or is that reintroduce?) the characters and work on some intriguing plot lines. STAR TREK THE WRATH OF KHAN may not be big on spectacular explosions and more elaborate space battles, but its an absolutely rousing space opera with an interesting plot, some intriguing ideas and strong character development. STAR TREK wasn't really about space dogfights and Death Stars, and I guess it's probably for the best. The last thing people expect back then was another sci-fi sensation trying to be as big as STAR WARS was. Instead, WRATH OF KHAN geared itself with much more interesting ideas, including a far more intriguing villain. Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan, probably the most popular villain ever in the STAR TREK universe (though there wouldn't much of a competition), is truly unforgettable, especially with much deeper motives. He has ceased control of a Federation Starship and has also stolen the Genesis missile, possibly one of the most lethal doomsday device in the universe (ironically, it was supposed to be used as means to create life on a barren planet!), and yet, his real motive is vengeance. Vengeance has poisoned his mind, and has driven him completely mad. Guess they just don't make villains this good anymore! Captain (now Admiral) Kirk (William Shatner) has his own issues. He was captain of the USS Enterprise for many a year and age has surely caught up with him. Being Admiral puts those gung-ho days behind him, but he still longs to boldly go where no one has gone before. Can't science fiction movies be this thoughtful with their characters? Add to that, there's the familiarity and camaraderie between the popular crew that I have grown to love about these movies. They may just beat STAR WARS when it comes with the power of the team! But perhaps one of the best things about WRATH OF KHAN is that, despite a few minor details, is a purely stand-alone movie. Sure one of its prime directives is to reunite its fans after the alienation the much-maligned STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE did. But whether or not you know who Khan or anyone else is, WRATH OF KHAN is not grounded in its fanbase. There's about something for everyone here, just as long as you know what to expect. Anyone expecting a special effects overdrive are missing the point. Since STAR TREK was more of a thinking person sci-fi movie, WRATH OF KHAN is more space opera than it is a sci-fi action movie. Still, there are some dazzling special effects and thrills here and there. The tightly-staged space battles are not exactly on par with STAR WARS', but they're just as enjoyable thanks to some well-crafted special effects and a rousing score by James Horner. The performances aren't exactly Oscar-worthy, but this familiar cast portraying these familiar characters? Could it be done any other way? I think not!

I just can't say enough about it. I literally find myself transported back to the early 1900's to that ranch in Montana. There has never been a movie that has taken my breath away like this one. When I watch it I have to set the mod and sit alone quietly in a dark room with only the image on my TV screen. I will not be interrupted or disturbed. I absolutely fell in love with Julia Ormond and have a little boy crush on her. She is so beautiful and has so much class, and for a British actress she hides her accents well. I am an avid fan of all James Horners movie soundtracks and this is the best.When I first bought this movie it was on VHS tape, I later bought another copy on DVD.Others can have Casablanca, Citizen Kane or Gone With The Wind, all fine films on my favorites list ... but I'll take Legends of the Fall as the most touching , emotionally moving film of all time for Me. Can't wait to view it again and transport my mind back 100 years to a peaceful place. I feel that the movie was real, and really happened. Loved it T. B.

However, this did not hold him back from giving his daughter a distinctive Greek first name Toula, from Photoula the enlightened one (like Phot- in Photo). His house is a copy of the Parthenon temple, the garden is decorated by rebuilt antique statues, and on the house there is the Greek state flag, besides the Stars and Stripes. Mr. Portokalos never adjusted to his guest land. He speaks the American language, but with the characteristic Greek interferences, like this name is come from .... Strangely enough, his restaurant's name is called Dancing Zorba's, which is mistaken insofar as the name of the Greek national hero is Alexis Zorbas (Tsormpás) and not Zorba.For Kosta, there are two groups of people the Greeks and the ones who would like to be Greeks. According to his very personal etymology, all words derive from Greek, and since Greece is (for him) the cradle of civilization, even the Japanese word Kimono does not make an exception. The only astonishing fact is that he speaks in his house English, apart from cursing. He has also conserved his patriarch ideas about women. It is out of question for him that his daughter marries a Greek and not a Xeno(s) (foreigner). When she meets the average American elementary school teacher Ian Miller, the hell breaks loose. And at last at this point, the movie shows that it is much more than very good entertainment. Ian cannot understand why Toula's family is so different. For him, there are only different backgrounds. As a citizen of a state where there is practically the same American culture between Long Island and Los Angeles, between Montana and Mississippi, her talking makes no sense. He says that everybody has weird families, and with that idea his horizon ends. On the other side, Kosta is sitting sleepless crying on his sofa because he interprets Toula's acquaintance as a personal attack. For Ian, speaking a foreign language is more or less a sign of non-adaption to a guest land (as even having an accent is), for Kosta his whole individuality depends on the different language Greek is who speaks Greek. Ian cannot understand that in Europe you have to change the language when you just travel for 30 minutes by airplane, that another culture, people with other behavior and with quite different expectations await you when you leave your plane. America is widely homogeneous, Europe isn't. That being different is a reason for being proud and that this pride can sometimes manifest as particularism, is unknown to him - and if we see his parents and how he grew up, we are not astonished.This movie, taken seriously and not only as a nice comedy, could have gigantic implications for example that American school kinds should be forced to learn at least one foreign language and that European history (and not only history of World War II) should be thought in schools like American history is taught in the schools of many European states. Perhaps this would help people like Kosta-Gus to integrate, if they would sense that there is at least a basic understanding of their differentness. As long as this has not changed, Gus' universal use of Windex stays as a symbol for his relations to his guest-land.

If this gets into the wrong hands, like Rodman's then disaster will be the only outcome. Through into the mix a few younglings and a mate for Kocher and we have a typical disaster epic.
