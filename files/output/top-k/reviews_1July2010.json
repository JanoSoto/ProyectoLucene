Point Break has the former, but not the latter. As a result, the film's countless action sequences raise the pulse, but only a little.Ex-football star Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) has been transferred to the FBI bank robbery division in Los Angeles. He's coming right in the middle of a string of bank robberies by a group who calls themselves The Ex-Presidents, after the masks of former presidents that the robbers wear to protect their identities. Utah's partner, Pappas (Gary Busey) thinks that the robbers may be surfers, so he sends Utah to the beaches to learn how to surf and infiltrate their ranks.The problem with the film is that we are not given a single person to care about in this film. There isn't just very little character development, there is NO character development. One could argue that action movies like this don't need it, and to add it would only slow the film down. In many cases this is true, but as Jan de Bont proved three years later, it is indeed possible to create adequately developed characters while still keeping the pace high.It's such a shame that this movie forgot a key element to creating a good action movie. The performances are all solid, even clichéd development probably would have done the trick. And director Kathryn Bigalow knows a thing or two about pacing an action movie.Still, it's worth at least a rental. The action sequences are inventive enough to keep a decent level of interest, and the film is a cult favorite so you may end up appreciating it more than I did.My rating PG-13 for violence and language.

I will say that the two movies share a great deal of jokes, plot devices, and even some dialog. For all I know Flying Machines could have stolen them from The Great Race. In any event, the jokes are funnier in Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. The Great Race is about two rival daredevils, The Amazing Leslie (Tony Curtis) and Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon), who engage in an auto race from New York to Paris. Allegedly, this movie suffered huge delays and budget over-runs due to heavy partying by the cast and crew. Judging from the condition which Tony Curtis is in throughout most of the movie, I can believe it. He often stares blearily at the camera in a pose meant to be dashing, but which instead comes off as vaguely hung-over, and he reads his lines with all the verve and skill of a third-grader reciting from a history text-book.Natalie Wood stated that she was not pleased with her performance in this movie, and I'd say she was justified. Her character is grating, and too frenetic.Jack Lemmon is actually pretty good as Professor Fate, the villain of the piece. He portrays a stereotypically cartoony bad-guy, but he does it well, and you can tell that he is having fun with the part. The only problem is that the rest of the movie is so flat and lifeless, he never gets any situations to react to that are as fun as his character.Another movie that The Great Race borrows heavily from is Around the World in Eighty Days, using the automobile race as an excuse to show a variety of exotic locations (filmed in glorious Panavision), and trot out special guest stars. The trouble is, Blake Edwards, as director, fails to capture anything special in the exotic locales, and the guest stars also fall well short of the mark. To put things in perspective, one of the guest stars in Larry Storch. When one of your big guns in Agarn, from F-Troop, your production is in trouble.Its not really a bad movie, its just a poorly acted movie that isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is. Its definitely a distant second to Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. Hanna-Barbera based their short-lived cartoon Wacky Races on this movie. The cartoon was more enjoyable.

His themes are often subtle and can take more than one viewing to fully understand or appreciate. Something which, understandably, can put off many.But whether you adore his style or think it to be moronic, no-one can deny that he is and always will be an inspired writer and director. A director who has influenced many and will continue to do so, I am sure, for years to come. Now I fall into the category of adoration and I believe 'Trust' to be his finest work.'Trust' focuses on the coming together of two characters. Maria Coughlin, a pregnant high-school dropout who has just been the cause of her fathers fatal heart attack, and Matthew Slaughter, an intellectual loner who still lives with his sadistic father. Sound like a standard, if a bit over the top, romance? You couldn't be more wrong.What makes Hartley's films so special, and 'Trust' is no exception, are the characters he manages to create. Though the situations they get into and the characters around them are nothing short of surreal, the way the react to each situation and deal with very serious issues could not be more realistic.A huge reason for this is his dialogue. Reminiscent of early Richard Linklater or Godard, his flowing, straight to the point script has you hooked from the word go. Fantastically direct delivery from both Shelley and Donovan allow this dialogue to shine and have you believe you these characters are friends you have known for years.In 'Trust' I believe Hartley has created one of the most earnest romances ever to be filmed.

In particular, one somehow knows that Quentin Tarantino is the single most important genius behind this work. His touch is everywhere. The dialogue stays with one long after initial viewing.

The IMDb rating is very accurate, though, as this movie is actually above average, if not quite an all-time classic even of its genre of comedy whodunits.The movie is of course based on the board game Clue (Cluedo in non-US markets). The very prospect of being a board game adaptation likely contributes to few people took this movie very seriously, but once you get over the silliness of that it is actually a decent adaptation. The basics of the game - the absurd character names and the basic concept of trying to figure out which character killed who, where, and with what deadly weapon is translated to film more accurately than I would have ever imagined possible without just filming people playing the actual game.The familiar characters, Colonial Mustard et al., are given goof-ball back-stories appropriate to the 1950s setting, the era when the board game first became popular, giving the movie a nostalgic feel that works well enough. They are all drawn to the signature mansion (an excellent matte art job) and learn from the Butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry in a great performance) that they are there to meet their mutual blackmailer, Mr. Boddy.As you would expect from his name and the basic premise of the movie, the murders start shortly after Mr. Boddy arrives. The movie is then a zany group investigation of who killed Mr. Boddy and the other supporting characters, who all are quickly knocked off by an unseen killer or killers. Much of the charm of the entire movie comes from Curry's amazing performance as he dashes around the house with all of the other characters in tow, energetically trying to determine who is behind all the murders (or perhaps draw attention away from himself?) This is definitely a high-energy whodunit, but unlike in _Sleuth_, a classic of the genre, it is run like a sprint with no interruptions. _Sleuth_ alternated between fast and slow sections, and I think the pacing contributed to its success. It's hard to imagine how _Clue_ could slow down, though, as the audience would have to think about how insane and unbelievable the characters and the overall plot are._Clue_ relies a lot on cheap gags and occasionally even on crude humor, which is amusing at times but sometimes falls flat. Its tendency toward groaner jokes is a real weakness, but there are some genuinely funny parts of the movie. The plot is, as I mentioned, completely unbelievable, but I think it's fun enough that you don't have to get too concerned with its lack of realism.In the end, the strong performances and the enjoyable, if silly, overall vibe of the movie make this one worth watching. It deserves a better reputation than it currently has!

And Lynn Redgrave tries to steal the show with her hammy, mannered portrayal of Whale's maid, Hanna.About as subtle as a sledgehammer, Gods And Monsters depicts Whale and his world in an all-or-nothing manner, as if the film were aimed at a mass audience that needs everything spelled out in black and white. Maybe that was the intent.

It's no wonder that BOTH Geena Davis (Thelma) and Susan Sarandon (Louise) got nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Though it's unfortunate that both lose, in this special case, that's completely acceptable for two solid reasons Jodie Foster, who won her second Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs rightfully won for the role of her life and that it would enormously hard to decide between the two ladies of Thelma & Louise &#x96; they were both EXCELLENT.I want to make something clear from before this is NOT a chick-flick. And this is NOT Bonnie & Clyde. This is a movie of two going nowhere ladies who finally put their hair down for a weekend away &#x96; but run into an enormous series of unfortunate events. It's a story of justice, injustice, survival, redemption, saviors, trust, love, bonding and non-sexual life partners. In reference to the Bonnie & Clyde remarks I've heard attached to this movie, I have two words Phooey! B&C planned things out..our T&L heroes reacted to their environment to survive, rarely (until the final quarter) were their bad deeds intentional or maliciously.Oh, and I've heard that this movie is a man-hating film filled with vengeful, dare I?, bitches. For that, I have four words Go to hell. These girls were mistreated, viciously at times, by males, yes, but they did not seek out revenge on them &#x96; they wanted to be free of them. Free of pain, solitude, abandonment, rudeness and abuse &#x96; mentally, physically and sexually. They had NOTHING against all men, but if you put such redneck, back wooded, narrow\/simple minded fellas in front of them&#x85;be somewhere else.Louise is neat and straight-laced. She's a waitress, which might seem dead-end, but she's thoroughly content. Thelma is high-strung, a child in a woman's body and trapped (settled) herself in a loveless and abusive marriage. Louise's plan is to get away for the weekend and take her BFF to a cabin to have some wild nights. Thelma, of course wants to go, but is worried about controlling husband Darryl (McDonald) saying no. Taking a chance &#x96; one that will change everyone's life, soon &#x96; she agrees and slips away while he's at work.Justifiably antsy &#x96; she practically forces prudish (with reason; sit back to watch the layers unravel and discover why) Louise to stop at a honky tonk. Unable to contain herself, even for seconds, Thelma overindulges in alcohol and becomes victim to a regular's, Harlan (Carhart), unwanted advances. In comes Louise to the rescue while stripping one layer on her current way of life.And that's all I'm revealing and that all takes place in the first, say 20 minutes with another 110 to go. Discover the magic all on your own. See the incredible depth of both Sarandon and Davis. I couldn't even begin to describe how well they preformed. Though I loved (for once &#x96; meaning, I have liked her a lot in the past, but here it was genuine love) Davis's performance, it was Sarandon that shot to the top of my favorite actresses at the time. If you could not feel her angst, if you could not see Louise was alive and aware and weary of the future and her mental breakdown of the walls she put up &#x96; you&#x85;are&#x85;blind.Each time I watch this movie, I pick up on something new. Perhaps, I did see it before &#x96; but it's always fun to experience such greatness for the first time, more than once &#x96; but in this viewing, there's a beautiful and dramatic scene of Louise standing alone in the dark desert surrounded by complete silence. The sun is rising. I have a feeling she wanted to see the sun rise for the final time as she felt she was tired, so tired. Not just of running, but maintaining the wall she built. Maybe she wanted to experience God's gift, but I'm going with my first theory.Did I mention beyond the wonderful depth of the characters &#x96; ones that will be etched in my mind with warm memories until I die &#x96; there was an excellent soundtrack (one I have listened to literally hundreds of times, and I really don't favor country at all) and a beautifully mournful score, suburb cinematography &#x96; even though I hate the desert, they made it magical, and it had a PERFECT blend of comedic tones mixed with serious moments. These types of moments, I've experienced myself. I've been through some extreme times in my life, and instead of blankly crying about it, which was hard to hold back, I had to make some loud joke and laugh until I did finally cry. There's a beautiful scene, where you think its set up for Thelma to joke\/crack up and she laughs her ass off and mimics the gun sound (BANG!) that came from the weapon Louise used to kill a man, not so long prior. Louise doesn't find this funny one bit, in which Thelma agrees. It isn't. But what are you going to do? How are you going to handle it? These are scenes, some small and subtle, some larger, that are real life. Director Scott and the leads captured this with nothing less than perfection.Despite its minor and I mean very, very few, flaws, such as how quick the Keitel character both tracked them but kept up with them (believable in 2010, but I don't think so in 1991) and some over-the-top clichéd characters floating around &#x96; making it easy for our heroes to hate and disseminate, the greatness in this movie pushes it straight to the top of my rating board and directly into my top ten of all time films.Watch it. Experience it. Love it. Learn something about how films should be shot, how acting should be taught and perhaps, about yourself.
