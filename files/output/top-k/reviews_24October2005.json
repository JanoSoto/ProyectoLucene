The Batman films over the years have been plagued by one and only one thing...no, not Joel Schumacher...they are called Studio Heads. But enough of that. The fact is, this movie was not advertised, nor made to be a fan friendly or even kid friendly movie. After the success of Batman, a sequel was inevitable. In order to lure Burton back into directing, the Powers that Be told Burton that it could be an all Burton film. This is very rare for a director to get in these money grabbing days. With all the politics and misunderstandings of the finished product aside, the film Batman Returns provides a dark, intense, and very exciting interpretation of Batman on screen. Returns shows us three characters, which all have dual identities. One is a creature of the night, stopping ruthless and petty criminals in every alley way and rooftop, and is also a tortured billionaire industrialist with the guilt of is parents death haunting him. There is also a purrr-fect enemy, draped in skin tight vinyl and carries a whip, with vengeance on the mind, and was once a push over secretary who was obviously pushed over one too many times. Finally there is the Penguin, a freakish and vile figure who was abandoned by his parents and now wishes for the respect that has avoided him all his life, and as Oswald Cobblepot, he gains the respect of the city in order to become its mayor. With these three characters, all you can get is an epic Tim Burton masterpiece, and that is what it became.After discovering their first born as a freakishly deformed monster, the Cobblepots decide to rid themselves of this black sheep. Almost thirty years later, the lost Cobblepot son has become the Penguin man in the sewer, who has become just as much a myth in Gotham City as the legend of Big Foot. After the Tree lighting ceremony in Gotham only weeks before Christmas, all hell breaks loose. Within one night, the evil industrialist Max Schrek (Christopher Walken) is kidnapped by the Penguin (Danny DeVito), and blackmailed into helping him re-emerge into Gotham society to finally earn the respect that he so thirsts after. Following this, Shreck drops his nobody assistant, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), out of his department store window after she discovers his Power Plant operation is just a scheme to suck what's left of power out of the city. Little does Shreck know, this nobody assistant survived, and is going to turn the tables on him ten fold as Catwoman, donning the skin tight vinyl black outfit and cracking a dangerously long whip. As Shreck helps the Penguin become Gotham's new golden boy, Oswald Cobblepot, he also uses Oswald to challenge the Mayor (Michael Murphy) into a recall election. If this happens, Shrek's Power Plant is secured. Now it is up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop these three super-villains from carrying out there plans. It is just a question now to whether Bruce will be able to balance his love for Selina and his duty as Batman to bring her, Oswald, and Shreck to justice.The movie's performances, special effects, costumes, amazing sets, and of course make-up design make this movie great. Michael Keaton returns (Forgive the pun) as the dark knight. Keaton gave us a dark complexity to the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne in Batman 1, and he carries that into this film, but in a much different way. His complexity in this film has more to do with his lack of a real life. In the first time we see him in the movie, he is sitting down in his study, doing absolutely nothing, until the Bat signal shines through his home, in which he then, through his eyes and body movement, comes to life. Through his attraction to Selina, he is naturally hoping for he and his equal to possibly have more of a happy ending to their story. Michelle Pfeiffer is actually, in my opinion, more unrecognizable than Danny DeVito. I say this only because in the beginning, we are introduced to this bumbling and oblivious secretary, and then she becomes a determined, sexy, and very aggressive creature of the night. Pfeiffer's brilliance in her dual roles, her body language, her change in voice, and overall sex appeal make this Catwoman probably the best ever seen projected from the comic book legend. The scene where Bruce and Selina are the only ones not wearing costumes at the costume ball, with the haunting song Face to Face echoing in the background, is truly brilliant. Now for Danny DeVito. This is probably my absolute favorite Danny DeVito performance. While his make-up says enough, its DeVito chewing through the make-up, the scenery, and most of the other actors to get his portrayal of the tortured, deformed, vile, and ingenious villain that is the Penguin, off. In many ways, he can make you feel sorry for him, and in other ways, he can make you loathe and detest his very existence. A true comic-book\/movie villain through and through. Finally for the great Christopher Walken. Walken was cast as a character that does not appear in the Batman comic-book universe. He is described as a rich, handsome, but diabolical businessman, who will suck the life out of anything he touches (much like a vampire, in which the actor Max Schreck in real life portrayed the vampire in the famous film Nosferatu). Shreck in many ways is the personification of Gotham City, as he says I' am the light of this city. And I' am its mean, twisted soul. Walken, in a sense, is more horrific than the Penguin. Shreck on the outside is a wealthy and respectable man, while on the inside, is more a horrific beast than the Penguin could ever be. An amazing and operatic Tim Burton masterpiece all the way though.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2005","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Who in Hollywood is more misunderstood than Tim Burton?

The film released in 1996, and the abomination to the entire genre! Yes, a real attention getter and a real creep of a film! Full of suspense and stupidity! The absolute definition of wretched impact on society, with good characters to follow in a homage for obsessive freaks! Screenwriter Kevin Williamson almost had a terrific idea about a gruesome killer stalking the teens of a sleepy California town. Wes Craven is a genius of this certain genre, and to have him direct this film was a lucky break for the fledging writer. The concept was fine. Teens in a small town are being offed one by one in some of the most gory turn-outs. Soon, the police are baffled, and the teens are doing nothing but relating the vicious natured killings to pop-culture horror films. When situations grow from bad to worse-a town curfew is set, and a party is held. It is during this final party that all is revealed.First, we shall go over the concept. It has a strong presence, very strong, and very predictable. How many people do you know, actually saw the film, and could not see the next part coming? Yes, as scary as it might be, it is just as predictable as well. Williamson tries to put forth new ideas and interesting killings, but alas, it does not work, especially when the apparently innovative death scenes are more like puns. It does, however, have many good moments in which dialog is spoken, or imagery is shown that will send chills up your skin. The film seems to try too hard at getting a scare, as though it is afraid to be original, so it relies on the success of other films for reference scares. The concept is overblown by unrealistic scenes of shock value and character analysis details that need not apply. Over all, it was good, but it was also bad.The acting and character placement was fair and easy. Neve Campbell was very popular on the FOX drama Party Of Five, and furthermore, she had completed The Craft just months before. Therefor, she definitely had the victim act down after playing the villain. Rose McGowan, Jaime Kennedy, and Matthew Lillard all had good shots at success as newer faces in the crowd. They in turn, had nothing to worry about. All three gave credible performances. Courtney Cox and David Arquette have certainly won the award for most spirited cast members to this day, just look at their position now. Skeet Ulrich is so irritating, he actually comes off well in his part. The rest of the cast features good supporting performances and cameos all around.Now, about the writing, Kevin Williamson is either smug and obviously desperate, or rather way too obsessed with the genre that his extreme passion clouds the writing and brings out the hackneyed atmosphere that films of this type should have been trying to ride themselves of. Even more annoying, is that obvious way Williamson is trying to give every single teen a sort of modern lingo about the werewolf movie with ET's mom in it, or 'Wes Carpenter', or even Tits Lagites thing. Worst of all, the rather convenient way the everyone is an expert on horror films. Randy must be shooting for Leonard Maltin or Rex Reed status. The film has a little too many crinkles in it. Still, those flaws will fade when the moments of madness take tole.The directing is...well, Wes Craven did the deed, need I say more? All in all, the film was a nice little piece of scare fare, but it ruined the genre by giving away movie secrets and supposed methods that make the film formulas work. Nice try Williamson, but no horror film has been very enjoyable since your little stab film was released. Stop trying so hard, it's pathetic.

Woody felt bad that he didn't go with his owner.Sometime later when he saved a toy from being sold at a yard sale, he's been spotted by a Toy Collector, Al who is interested in him. Andy Mom refused to sell him Woody, so Al managed to steal Woody when Andy's mom is distracted by an accident he caused, and took off with Woody.Now Buzz Lightyear and the Other Toy must hunt down and find Woody before Andy gets back from cowboy camp.This movie is great and never gets boring. I enjoyed a little more than Toy Story 1, but I still like the original, just this one has more funny parts to it. It even introduces some new toys, and bigger locations.Those who liked the original will like this one also. If you heard bad reviews about this movie, ignore them cause this is one of those rare sequels that are good for a change.

He's turned out some very good films and some very bad ones. Sometimes his satire just falls short (Death to Smoochy, for example); however, War of the Roses is his strongest directorial effort to date.It's got everything - a clever script, great interaction between its two stars, exciting thrills, funny gags (without ever resorting to unnecessary crudity), and to top it all off, the direction is very effective - DeVito is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and that is very clear in the final sequence, which is reminiscent of Vertigo and Rear Window. Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Rose couple - two once-happily-married people who are now, after many years together, bitter and at the end of their frustration. Deciding upon a divorce, they begin to split apart; however, negotiations regarding belongings begin to go awry as Oliver Rose (Douglas) demands more from his wife, claiming it's his money that purchased their enormous house and all objects inside.DeVito turns in a performance as the narrator, and Oliver's lawyer, who tells us at the start we are about to watch a sad tale about divorce. By the time the film has ended we've seen events spiral totally out of control - beginning with absolute believability and ending in absolute absurdity.That's the crucial part of all this. Black comedy relies on whether the dramatic arc of the content - the leap from reality to lunacy - can be believable. Many times in DeVito's film, it isn't. Smoochy, for example, was clever satire at first, and fairly reminiscent of real-life people and events; then it turned into an over-the-top revenge rampage.War of the Roses is more careful, and the arc is subtler. It's believable because the characters are given such room to grow and their conflict blossoms throughout the picture.I'd classify War of the Roses as one of the funniest, cleverest and most underrated black comedies of the 1980s - it's one of my personal favorite movies and never fails to crack me up. A cult film? Maybe; but I think many more people would enjoy it if they gave it a chance.

For starters, It's a goddamn Andy Warhol production. In addition, most of the actors and actresses are pretty hammy (for example it has a Italian family where the dad has what sounds like an Italian accent, the mother sounds British, two of the daughters sound German, and the gardener is obviously from Jersey).Udo Kier continues to yuck it up as the title character after playing Baron Frankenstein in Flesh for Frankenstein this film's sister picture. Udo is obviously enjoying playing a complete and total ham and vomits up blood as well as any I've seen. Is he the glue that holds the picture together???? Not really. The whole thing is basically a vehicle for shameless (and I stress shameless) sex and violence, some of which good old Udo takes part in. The flick also has some pretty cheesy dialog. One of my favorites is when Joe Dallesandro tells two of the daughters (after having sex with them) that he'd like to rape the hell out of their 14 year old sister. After this, he says he'd love her right and treat her good. What the hell? In my book, raping the hell out of and then loving up right are two totally different things.However, this little flick does have its shining moments in spite of itself. There are some funny moments in the film and I think that they weren't really taking it that seriously, so it has that campy feel. In the end I think that it's good points and bad points strike even, so I recommend watching when you're feeling in that I want to watch something so bad, it could actually be kind of good mood.Film fans should also look for the Roman Polanski cameo. He plays a game against Count Dracula's aide in the restaurant scene.

Main character Alex gets a vision of the plane he's in, and that's about to airlift him and his classmates to Paris, exploding. He panics, and together with some of his friends gets kicked off. Of course, the plane then explodes as foreseen. Alex has cheated Death. But as he finds out, this simply means that the survivors are still listed to die, and to be sure, soon enough one after the other gets killed in the gruesome and unlikely ways befitting, I suppose, of this genre. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's rules, and to thwart his plan. That's where things become silly. It is the usual problem in horror movies with supernatural forces the supernatural world behaves so utterly banal and childish that it stops being scary. Why on earth would Death play a game like this? Logic is obviously thrown overboard entirely. Why would a girl who knows she's next in line to die, go outside in a raging thunderstorm where broken, live power lines are lashing about, to rescue her dog? How do Alex and his chums know so exactly where and how they can get into the morgue at night? Why does Alex repeatedly almost die when sheltering in a wood cabin, and why does the strange wind that presages a death blow through the cabin, even though Alex figures out a minute later that it isn't actually his turn yet? How come the three survivors eventually go on for six months without trouble, even though it turns out they are still scheduled to die? Did Death need a break?? I don't even care to wonder about the psychology of the characters, who are able to deal with one friend's gruesome death after another without shedding a single tear.

Case in point Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy. The film was obviously a studio back-lot effort; but what is surprising about the film is not that it was a low-budget effort made for fun, verbal, physical and other sorts, but how well everything else in the film was done. For instance, the movie begins with the world's best apache troop at work, the Mazzone-Abbott dancers, as Abbot and Costello enter a nightclub in Cairo. There is also later a fine nightclub scene where Peggy King sings a knockout version of You've Come a Long Way From St. Louie, and another fine troupe, the Chandra Kaly dancers. In between musical numbers, the film boasts Richard Deacon as an Egyptology student, lovely Marie Windsor as a serviceable Mata Hari-type femme fatale, Michael Ansara as her evil cohort, and such fine talents as Veola Vonn, Mel Welles, Kurt Katch and Jan Arvan in the supporting cast. The ramshackle but clearly-made narrative has the leads getting involved with an attempt to find a lost treasure, the tomb of an ancient princess. Of course she was loved by a now-rampant mummy, and Costello becomes involved when he swallows the medallion that presents directions to the long-dead lady's tomb. Deacon wants the mummy, Klaris, honored; Windsor and her group use him to get directions to the tomb--but he cuts himself in on the proceedings for his own reasons. This film is filled with clever verbal humor, low-grade and not, based on misunderstandings of words, commands and the like; Windsor is quite good at parodying the bad-girl roles she was usually allowed to play and Deacon is surprisingly good in what is almost a straight role. Those who complain that this film lacks imagination need to remember that this is not just an Abbot and Costello vehicle movie; it is an intelligent potboiler, using the talents of the two master comics rather nicely. Moreover, it was made just after the great color Universal Grecianized Near-Easterns such as Veils of Bagdad and The Golden Blade, etc.; and just after the late 1940s-early 1950s B\/W classics such as Lost in a Harem and Babes in Bagdad. Moreover, the film introduced the Mummy to a new generation, centered its tale around a large nightclub (a feature of many later Egypt-based) movies, and also spotlighted a lethal lady, a professor translating hieroglyphics, archaeologists searching for a lost tomb, criminals after a potential treasure, nameless dangerous henchmen in alleyways, the murder of a man who knows too much, etc., etc. The dance numbers are first-rate in this film, and John Grant's script is full of hilarious comedy dialogue and gags. My favorite occurs at the film's ending, when a way is found to satisfy the viewers and participants alike. A running gag in the film has had Costello playing a flute and a snake appearing behind him. As a joke, to get even with Abbott (who is being mean to him as usual) Costello challenges him to play the flute; he does and from a large urn rises a gorgeous blonde, who kisses him. Costello tries the same flute on another urn--and you'll have to see the film to find out what happens. Director Charles Lamont keeps the narrative's action moving; Lee Loeb supplied the serviceable storyline. Art Directors Alexander Golitzen and Bill Newberry and costumer Rosemary Odell deserve credit for their first-rate contributions to a simple B studio effort. This un-epic comedy probably needed more camels, and more scenes such as the one where the team, dressed in unconvincing burnooses, are pursued by two large policemen. But I enjoy this film for what it is; and I believe the film pointed the way to the Martin and Lewis efforts of a later era, as well as to many another Egyptian, North African and comedic effort made with more money than this was but with a great deal less good humor and genial entertainment value.

However, avid Shakespeareans may be upset with the ending of the play (this is the spoiler) instead of having Juliet wake up at least a couple minutes after Romeo has drunk the poisoned vial and died, Luhrmann decides to have Juliet and Romeo see each other right before his death--but unfortunately, they do not see each other in time to stop this horrible outcome.

Eschewing the clichés of the Smokey and the Bandit and Dukes of Hazzards stereotypes, he cast many 'locals' in the film, and attempted to recreate, as realistically as possible, the world Loretta Webb\/Lynn knew so well.Second, the film boasts not one or two, but three powerhouse supporting performances. Tommy Lee Jones, who Apted picked over Harrison Ford, is a revelation as Doolittle 'Mooney' Lynn. With only a handful of credits when the film was released, he demonstrated the dazzling combination of humor and sensitivity that would eventually win him a place as one of our finest actors. Levon Helm, making his dramatic debut as Loretta's father, Ted, is even more impressive. Low-key, but irresistible, he offers so much love and power in his portrayal that it's easy to see why he would remain influential to his superstar daughter, long after his passing.

Contrary to popular opinion, she had to learn Lynn's Southern accent, and spent grueling weeks learning how to sing her signature tunes (including a week with Loretta, herself).

The songs fit right along with the story line and enhanced it. From the comments I had read so far, not everyone has the sense of humor needed for a movie like this. I have seen the movie about 5 times since and still enjoy it. Not everyone I have shown this movie to enjoyed it as much. But then Mad Magazine was one of my favorites growing up. Loved it!

Also there are lots of very illogical stuff (I'm not talking about the reactions of people in panic situations)like for instance Where did Michael learned to drive ?? only God knows, and don't tell me they explain it in the next movies, that's a bad excuse for poor storytelling. You don't let your viewers guessing on things like that. But the most illogical and cheap NONSENSE in the whole movie is that Mr. Meyers simply refuses to die. And guess what ? nobody explains in the film why. Seems to me like a cheap resource to force you to see the next, and the next, and the next, to find (maybe) an answer.

Paul Gardener, (Jared Leto) a journalism student, hears the legend being told by fellow student Parker Riley (Michael Rosembaum) about a teacher who massacres his students, but no one else in the group, Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) and Brenda Bates, (Rebecca Gayheart) believe the story. During a demonstration by Professor Wexler, (Robert Englund) they both hear the story about a woman murdered on campus. Even though Natalie swears she didn't know her, the murdered woman was an old friend of friends, which Damon Brooks (Joshua Jackson) picks up on and asks her to talk about it. While talking, she finds out the true nature of Damon's advances and kicks him out, only to see him killed by a mysterious figure in a black hooded jacket. When she gets back, no one believes her, since he also has a convenient alibi for being away. As more people disappear around campus, Natalie and Paul find out that the killer is basing their crimes on urban legends, and that anyone can be behind the hooded mask.The Good News Back when this movie came out, the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car was an expected one, and one that you can see coming from a mile away, but several others are quite original. The sex\/strangulation misidentification death is really cool, and the backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on. That sex\/strangulation death is my favorite, mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true are so astronomical in their probability that it simply becomes a nice surprise. To have the back-story needed to make sure Natalie couldn't see anything, the killer gaining access to the room without violent means, and the actual sounds of the incident are all mixed together and it makes a marvelous scene. The hanging car death is also masterfully excised to create some wonderful suspense scenes, as the killer is revealed in the early part of the movie, and does away with a likable character, Damon, right away. Their ensuing chase of Natalie adds extra juice as they try repeatedly to break into the car, setting off the events that lead to Damon's death. Only one non-death scene was really effective for me to prove an old urban legend, two woman stand in front of a building and say Bloody Mary five times. From inside the building are the ghostly screams of supposed dead souls from an old massacre twenty-five years past. Gasping in shock, they back away, only to bump into someone. A cheap gag, but the effect worked because it comes from the unexpected source. It isn't the screaming ghosts, but the bump afterward that gets the scare. Also of note is the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept is some great writing. The way there are so many different red herrings involved, and all of them given good alibis to clear them, so by gaining more clues to their identity, it broadens the suspense by making a extra clue for the people to solve. One great scene, where Natalie watches someone in the killers know attire stalk one of her friends in a swimming pool, while she is helplessly trying to get her attention. A great little suspense scene that mainly works because we know what the killer is dressed like, but its effective.The Bad News The main problem with this film is that it was aimed for the masses to consume, so it has a lot of toned-down gore. Many of these killings should've been a gorier, and it will probably disappoint the many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those post-Scream films, where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare you, and here is one example that people can point to as having a ton of cheap scares that aren't frightening. What makes it worse is that many of the jokes aren't funny, so it is a bit flat in some places. Also, two of the murders aren't based on urban legends being dragged by a car onto the tire spikes in several buildings, and being chopped up by an ax. Not real urban legends, so it has a false title. One last thing this scene is so stupid I have to comment on it. After surviving a vicious car crash, Natalie rolls down the car's window and opens the locked door to get out. The window was already down; you didn't need to open the door! That's just letting the killer catch up to you.The Final Verdict While certainly not for everyone, this is a far better flick than its reputation would have it. It has some fresh kills, a couple nice suspense scenes, and a new gimmick at the time. Slasher fans will want to give it an open-minded look, but post-Scream horror film haters will think a little harder than others will.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, some alcohol use, a scene with a dog drinking and a brief mild sex scene ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Urban Legends is one of the most underrated films of the post-Scream slasher films.**SPOILERS**Pendelton University is home to a group of friends like many other campuses do, but they've got a twist an urban legend around campus that's true but no one knows.

Many of these killings should've been a gorier, and it will probably disappoint the many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those post-Scream films, where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare you, and here is one example that people can point to as having a ton of cheap scares that aren't frightening.

Also, two of the murders aren't based on urban legends being dragged by a car onto the tire spikes in several buildings, and being chopped up by an ax. Not real urban legends, so it has a false title. One last thing this scene is so stupid I have to comment on it. After surviving a vicious car crash, Natalie rolls down the car's window and opens the locked door to get out. The window was already down; you didn't need to open the door! That's just letting the killer catch up to you.The Final Verdict While certainly not for everyone, this is a far better flick than its reputation would have it. It has some fresh kills, a couple nice suspense scenes, and a new gimmick at the time.

Paul Gardener, (Jared Leto) a journalism student, hears the legend being told by fellow student Parker Riley (Michael Rosembaum) about a teacher who massacres his students, but no one else in the group, Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) and Brenda Bates, (Rebecca Gayheart) believe the story. During a demonstration by Professor Wexler, (Robert Englund) they both hear the story about a woman murdered on campus. Even though Natalie swears she didn't know her, the murdered woman was an old friend of friends, which Damon Brooks (Joshua Jackson) picks up on and asks her to talk about it. While talking, she finds out the true nature of Damon's advances and kicks him out, only to see him killed by a mysterious figure in a black hooded jacket. When she gets back, no one believes her, since he also has a convenient alibi for being away. As more people disappear around campus, Natalie and Paul find out that the killer is basing their crimes on urban legends, and that anyone can be behind the hooded mask.The Good News Back when this movie came out, the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car was an expected one, and one that you can see coming from a mile away, but several others are quite original. The sex\/strangulation misidentification death is really cool, and the backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on. That sex\/strangulation death is my favorite, mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true are so astronomical in their probability that it simply becomes a nice surprise. To have the back-story needed to make sure Natalie couldn't see anything, the killer gaining access to the room without violent means, and the actual sounds of the incident are all mixed together and it makes a marvelous scene. The hanging car death is also masterfully excised to create some wonderful suspense scenes, as the killer is revealed in the early part of the movie, and does away with a likable character, Damon, right away. Their ensuing chase of Natalie adds extra juice as they try repeatedly to break into the car, setting off the events that lead to Damon's death. Only one non-death scene was really effective for me to prove an old urban legend, two woman stand in front of a building and say Bloody Mary five times. From inside the building are the ghostly screams of supposed dead souls from an old massacre twenty-five years past. Gasping in shock, they back away, only to bump into someone. A cheap gag, but the effect worked because it comes from the unexpected source. It isn't the screaming ghosts, but the bump afterward that gets the scare. Also of note is the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept is some great writing. The way there are so many different red herrings involved, and all of them given good alibis to clear them, so by gaining more clues to their identity, it broadens the suspense by making a extra clue for the people to solve.

Unusual in itself, since I was in 10th grade and cannot remember EVER attending another film with Mom. Neither of us had any idea what we were in for.The audience was seated (as contractually required by Hitchcock) before the lights went down. The theatre was pitch black except for the small Exit lights. So effective was Hitchcock's pre-publicity for Psycho that everybody was already nervous all we knew was that Psycho was going to be shocking. Suddenly, out of the darkness, Bernard Herrmann's immediately nerve-jangling score attacked and the massive curtains slowly opened in front of the screen. Uh-oh, I recall thinking. No one had ever heard a score like this.Once the title and credits ended and the quiet pan across Phoenix's skyline began, I relaxed -- but only briefly. For here we were peering into a hotel window where the magnificently endowed Janet Leigh (in a bra and half slip) and a shirtless John Gavin were concluding their lunchtime tryst. Not the scene I would have chosen to be sitting next to my Mother for.By the time the shower sequence stunned everybody, I can still remember my Mother squirming audibly and uncomfortably next to me with every stab.Happily, she and I had a healthy relationship. Walking out after the lights came up, we were as silent as everybody else until we hit the sidewalk and daylight. She shook her head What did you think of THAT? Damndest thing I ever saw! She agreed.It would be 13 years later, after I'd moved to Los Angeles and was writing for films and television, before I attended another opening that had an equally jolting impact on the public The Exorcist. I can't add anything to the comments already made about Psycho's technique and brilliance -- except perhaps to point out its film-making economy, still endlessly studied in film schools around the world.Try this shut off the sound. Psycho STILL plays, coherently, as a maniacal SILENT FILM study of a psychopath.One shot in particular still haunts me for its storytelling simplicity. It's certainly not the most spectacular sequence in Psycho, yet its meticulous planning and perfect placement say perhaps as much about Hitchcock's command of film as anything else in his long career.After Marion Crane's brutal murder, and the camera pulls back from her lifeless eye, the camera moves out of the brightly lit bathroom over the sound of still-running water, across her empty motel room, past the rolled-up newspaper (containing the $40,000) on the nightstand, to the open window and the Bates house on the hill, where Norman is heard shrieking, Mother! Oh, God! Blood! Blood! After the assaultive flash-cuts of butchery (and the screeching violins of Herrmann's score, and the stabbing sounds) we've just witnessed . . . we're given a chance to catch our breaths over the near-silent sound of the shower. What on earth can happen NEXT? The lead character is dead.In this brief, quiet coda to one of the most electrifying sequences in film history, Hitchcock lets us recover . . . sort of. In fact, the camera's simple movement re-establishes the entire story arc of Psycho's first third, backwards from the murder to the reminder that Marion's stolen cash has led us here and lies in plain sight, waiting to be discovered, then forward in time again to the unknown horror on the hill. (The seemingly simple shot of the house through the window is actually a rather elaborate process shot that itself involves several elements, including that menacing sky.)Equally remarkable, Bernard Herrmann's disturbing score. If you can find it and listen to it apart from the picture, you'll appreciate its demented insect-like constantly unnerving, web-spinning, unsettling, biting, frightening power.Shockingly, Herrmann's score occupies barely thirty-minutes of the total screen time. Yet it's unforgettable.Here is a film, and a director, that is as effective and appreciated over 45 years later as it was the day of its release. Costing under a million dollars, it will retain its position as one of the finest, most visceral suspense films ever made . . . long after Spielberg's (another fine director) heartless, emotionless, expensive special-effects extravaganza, War of the Worlds, has been forgotten (if it's not already).
