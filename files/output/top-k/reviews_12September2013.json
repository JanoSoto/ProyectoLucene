It was, and still is, a powerful movie. The different characters were wonderfully written and played very well by the different actors.If you have never seen this movie I suggest doing so.I liked the whole movie. The story line was phenomenal. It's about a military school called Bunker Hill Military Academy and it's students. At the beginning of the movie it is the end of the school term and the start of summer vacation. Some of the students are staying for the summer, including Cadet Major Brian Moreland (Timothy Hutton), Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer (Sean Penn), and Cadet Captain David Shawn (Tom Cruise). The school's superintendent is General Harlan Bache (George C. Scott).Moreland is newly promoted to Cadet Major at the beginning of the movie. He is friends with Dwyer and Shawn, and he tries to emulate General Bache. At the commencement ceremony for the out going senior class General Bache reveals that the board of trustees have decided to close the school at the end of the next school year. They want to make way for a condominium complex.One very powerful scene is when the remaining cadets are having a dance. Some local teens are harassing arriving guests and the cadets. Moreland politely asked the teens to move along. One of the teens walked up to Moreland and threw a punch. As Moreland and the other cadets are defending themselves one cadet runs and gets General Bache. As soon as Bache attempts to stop the melee one of the teens jumps on his back and grabs for his sidearm. The teen gets the handgun loose from the holster and pulls the trigger. Bache didn't know that there was a live round in the chamber. The teen who first attacked Moreland was shot in the chest and died instantly. The police are called and Bache is taken into custody.The following day the board members come to the academy to do inventory of the weapons located there. Moreland realizes what is going on and before the sheriff comes to confiscate the arsenal, Moreland takes them. Moreland wants the academy to stay open. He and the remaining student body take control of the academy and refuse to surrender. At one point, Moreland's father comes to negotiate the surrender, it does not go well.Even though Moreland is friends with both Dwyer and Shawn, the animosity between Dwyer and Shawn is very evident. In one scene it is revealed to Moreland that Shawn has given orders to shoot anyone coming over, around or under the walls by the sentries. Moreland barely blinks, saying that those were the proper orders to give. The tension on Moreland gets to be too much when twice several students leave, when asked, rather than stay to defend their school. As time goes on, one student is burned in an accident after the power was turned off and another student was shot because the National Guard unit that arrived thought he was firing at them (he wasn't).After Moreland finds out that Bache passed away from a heart attack Moreland begins to question whether he and the other cadets are doing the right thing. Dwyer attempts and succeeds in talking Moreland into surrendering. Shawn has other plans. The power really goes to his head and he starts firing on the National Guard. The National Guard returns fire and eventually kills Shawn. Moreland attempts to save Shawn but is killed also. Dwyer carries his friends body from the barracks followed by Colonel Kerby (Ronnie Cox).This is a adrenaline filled movie that ends very tragically. It's about teenagers, who are sent to a military school for one reason or another, taught to be soldiers and defend their rights. But they misread what they are taught, and end up in a world of hurt. The movie ends with the cadets surrendering and Dwyer carrying Moreland out the front gate.I like movies like these. I like how it actually has a plot that goes from A to Z. The acting in this movie is pretty good. I give this 10 stars out of 10. Even though it is a dated movie, and some of the sentimentality is different between the time it was made and today, it's still pretty good.

I read his authorized biography from Virgin Books and was amazed at his extraordinary practices to absorb industrial amounts of alcohol at no costs to his health. I myself can not afford this habit any more though sometime we used to drink and party a lot. I also brood on the fact how people change with age and their zeal for life also.By calling Oliver Reed generational actor I mean the following. These actors appear on the big screen as stars once in a decade, usually in tuples, brought as product by great nations or at least big enough to form a pool. Thus France gave to the cinema in the 60s and 70s Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Unscathingly, here in this movie Reed is paired with Richard Harris - in the role of Emperor Marcus Aurelius - who also happens to be manifesto actor that together with the titular and couple of more fellows created the image of British adventure cinema for 20 years. At least thus appears to me as compared British to American born film stars. So we are talking here about weightlifters to be more precise.Now I want to link the persona of Oliver Reed to a former Bulgarian buff called Kliment Denchev (d. 2009) - an immigrant to Canada from the 1980s. I remember that corpulent man for several reasons not the least that he had physical resemblance to Oliver which I put two-and-two together recently. That Kliment Denchev left Bulgaria for political reasons few people in that former communist country would remember or are willing to. What I recently read about his case was that he deliberately got shunned by the State Security organs and forced to live abroad with his wife as fugitive. I remember this giant of a man from his performances in the 1970s when he was leading in the children's nightly at 19.45 PM two times a week. He also participated in many Bulgarian cult films before he left for overseas.Returning back to Oliver Reed. I shouldn't indulge anyone reading my preferences for him; he had enough fame and many critics. Women also loved him and I want to give a separate estimate for three of his films where he treated the opposite sex in his particular way1. Trap (1966) - Rita Tushingham, whom I took mistakenly for Geraldine Chaplin, plays a mute that is bought by fur trapper to attend. But they are stalked by Indians in the remote cabin and Oliver loses his leg in a wolf-trap by accident. The young girl finally understands what hard life means and returns to his lame master;2. Hunting Party (1971) - Candice Bergen, a rancher's wife and schoolteacher, makes threesome with Oliver when he and his gang kidnap her for ransom. At first she is very resistant to the abductors but afterwards Oliver feeds her with peaches and she agrees to teach him lessons in gramercy. Subsequently they fall in love but unfortunately the rancher (Gene Hackman) organize a posse that exterminate the whole gang with long range rifle. At the end the three of them die in the desert;3. Castaway (1986) - Amanda Donohoe, who actually became a celebrity with this movie, plays an unemployed secretary that agrees to become female companion for one year on uninhabited island in the Pacific. The film contains limited amount of nudity for which received complaints from the critics. However, Oliver takes care of business and they survive amidst the wilderness until end of time.

I am a huge fan of Spiderman and it was the #1 comic I collected for ten years in my youth.

Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more.

As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story.My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic.

If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.Good Will Hunting (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down. For one, Will Hunting is not a good person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, What the f*** do you want? Could anyone be that stupid? How about, Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir? I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film. In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived. I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama. Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows. The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested. Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, Good Will Hunting is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsgård is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.GRADE C+ ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film.

When I took that film down from the shelf I saw on the front cover a pair of blue eyes looking down on a large building with the title Child's playwritten across the top, I certainly was intrigued so I turned to look at the back. There, in the top right corner, just above the description was a picture of a ginger doll wearing dungarees and a stripey, colorful top. He was standing in the rain waving at me. I have to say, as a child I was pretty shaken, well, I was rather petrified if I'm honest, however this made me want to buy it right there and then. But of course, no parent, never mind grandparent, is going to buy a seven year old a horror film all about a killer doll that becomes conscious, especially when my grandmother herself had a collection of dolls all around her house. So finally, about five years later I caught it on the TV and watched it, and it certainly did live up to my expectations, so much so that I was overjoyed to find out that each of the sequels would be played each week at the same time. I think there are so many factors that contribute to my overgrown love for this franchise and this very film, but I think the biggest factor is Brad Dourif himself. Acting as Charles Lee Ray at the start of the film and voicing the supernaturally possessed doll throughout, Brad Dourif gives an intense, unforgettable performance. His eerie voice delivers the full character, he can go from a playful Chucky that's toying around with a cop to a rather enraged one that's effing and blinding his heart out, no matter what the line is, Brad Dourif can deliver it. Who would I say is the second best cast member? If I'm honest, Alex Vincent, hands down. Despite him being under ten years old when this was being filmed he's still to me the best child actor to star in a horror film to merely be chased by the antagonist. Why do I think this? Because he was a child, who could get into the shoes of another child, and not ruin it along the way. He was believable and you instantly feel some sort of sympathy for him, and no, it isn't because he's being chased by a doll that's been possessed by a murderer, it's because he genuinely gives an emotional performance. About thirty five minutes into the film I found myself frustrated for him when no one believes him that Chucky is real, this is because you can see it in his eyes. You can see that deep down he doesn't want to be in trouble and that he's being tricked, for a child actor to do this is simply astonishing. I've discussed how Chucky as a character is thanks to the voice talents of Brad Dourif, but what about the other 40% of the film before you actually hear Chucky speak and can confirm he is actually alive? How do they keep you on the edge of your seat? Very simple, with two things; simple yet exceptional camera work and top notch animatronics that's very surprising to have been around in 1988. Firstly, I'll discuss just what it is that the camera itself does for you as a viewer. There's a scene around twenty minutes into the film where 'Aunt Maggie' becomes the first character on Chucky's kill list, however, the audience hasn't seen Chucky in full attack mode yet and Don Mancini certainly wanted to keep them waiting. So with a little bit of back and forth from Chucky's eyesight and the eyesight of Aunt Maggie, you see it all without seeing anything at all. The audience is placed into first person view of the doll itself, running around the corners of the room taunting Maggie, however when you think you're safe and inside the monster's mind itself, you switch back to Maggie's viewpoint on it all. With a few jump-scares here and there and the eerie background score completely stopped, you see a Good Guy hammer hit Maggie's head, sending her tripping out of the window to her expected death. This all done with beautifully handled close up angles and first person views. I think this film could have been quite the disaster if a few decisions were to be pointed in a different direction at the time, what I mean by this is imagine if Chucky was created by CGI? We all know judging by films such as Jaws 3 that CGI wasn't exactly the smoothest thing around during the eighties and early nineties, so imagine how disastrous it could have been? But luckily for us, they decided to go fully animatronic (well, excluding a few scenes where you can clearly see a little person was put in a costume). The idea for an animatronic Chucky came from Don Mancini's total shock of how successful it turned out in Gremlins which came out a few years before. To me, the animatronic Chucky was the best way to go, I feel as if I appreciate it more that they put so much time and effort into making it work. In the end I suppose it all comes down to opinion and your taste in movies, some may say this is a total cheese-fest, others may say it's an 80's horror masterpiece, but I suppose I can just say, I'm certainly glad that Pokemon video was missing and this was there in its place, if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't be writing this now.

Despite him being under ten years old when this was being filmed he's still to me the best child actor to star in a horror film to merely be chased by the antagonist. Why do I think this? Because he was a child, who could get into the shoes of another child, and not ruin it along the way. He was believable and you instantly feel some sort of sympathy for him, and no, it isn't because he's being chased by a doll that's been possessed by a murderer, it's because he genuinely gives an emotional performance. About thirty five minutes into the film I found myself frustrated for him when no one believes him that Chucky is real, this is because you can see it in his eyes. You can see that deep down he doesn't want to be in trouble and that he's being tricked, for a child actor to do this is simply astonishing. I've discussed how Chucky as a character is thanks to the voice talents of Brad Dourif, but what about the other 40% of the film before you actually hear Chucky speak and can confirm he is actually alive? How do they keep you on the edge of your seat? Very simple, with two things; simple yet exceptional camera work and top notch animatronics that's very surprising to have been around in 1988. Firstly, I'll discuss just what it is that the camera itself does for you as a viewer. There's a scene around twenty minutes into the film where 'Aunt Maggie' becomes the first character on Chucky's kill list, however, the audience hasn't seen Chucky in full attack mode yet and Don Mancini certainly wanted to keep them waiting. So with a little bit of back and forth from Chucky's eyesight and the eyesight of Aunt Maggie, you see it all without seeing anything at all. The audience is placed into first person view of the doll itself, running around the corners of the room taunting Maggie, however when you think you're safe and inside the monster's mind itself, you switch back to Maggie's viewpoint on it all. With a few jump-scares here and there and the eerie background score completely stopped, you see a Good Guy hammer hit Maggie's head, sending her tripping out of the window to her expected death. This all done with beautifully handled close up angles and first person views. I think this film could have been quite the disaster if a few decisions were to be pointed in a different direction at the time, what I mean by this is imagine if Chucky was created by CGI? We all know judging by films such as Jaws 3 that CGI wasn't exactly the smoothest thing around during the eighties and early nineties, so imagine how disastrous it could have been? But luckily for us, they decided to go fully animatronic (well, excluding a few scenes where you can clearly see a little person was put in a costume). The idea for an animatronic Chucky came from Don Mancini's total shock of how successful it turned out in Gremlins which came out a few years before. To me, the animatronic Chucky was the best way to go, I feel as if I appreciate it more that they put so much time and effort into making it work. In the end I suppose it all comes down to opinion and your taste in movies, some may say this is a total cheese-fest, others may say it's an 80's horror masterpiece, but I suppose I can just say, I'm certainly glad that Pokemon video was missing and this was there in its place, if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't be writing this now. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"12 September 2013","score":"","review":" I remember when I was about seven and I was in a charity shop, I was looking at the Pokemon video cassettes and where one video was missing, a completely different type of film took its place. When I took that film down from the shelf I saw on the front cover a pair of blue eyes looking down on a large building with the title Child's playwritten across the top, I certainly was intrigued so I turned to look at the back. There, in the top right corner, just above the description was a picture of a ginger doll wearing dungarees and a stripey, colorful top. He was standing in the rain waving at me. I have to say, as a child I was pretty shaken, well, I was rather petrified if I'm honest, however this made me want to buy it right there and then. But of course, no parent, never mind grandparent, is going to buy a seven year old a horror film all about a killer doll that becomes conscious, especially when my grandmother herself had a collection of dolls all around her house. So finally, about five years later I caught it on the TV and watched it, and it certainly did live up to my expectations, so much so that I was overjoyed to find out that each of the sequels would be played each week at the same time. I think there are so many factors that contribute to my overgrown love for this franchise and this very film, but I think the biggest factor is Brad Dourif himself. Acting as Charles Lee Ray at the start of the film and voicing the supernaturally possessed doll throughout, Brad Dourif gives an intense, unforgettable performance. His eerie voice delivers the full character, he can go from a playful Chucky that's toying around with a cop to a rather enraged one that's effing and blinding his heart out, no matter what the line is, Brad Dourif can deliver it.

Basically Philip Marlowe (Elliott Gould), the chain- smoking, wisecracking private investigator is visited late on night by his close friend Terry Lennox (Jim Bouton) who wants to get a lift from Los Angeles to the California&#x96;Mexico border at Tijuana. After doing this Marlowe is greeted by two cops who tell him that Lennox is accused of murdering his wealthy wife Sylvia, and he is arrested when he refuses to give them any information, but he is released three days when Lennox is found in Mexico to have committed suicide. The case seems pretty open and shut, but Marlowe suspects more is going on, but in the meantime platinum-blonde Eileen Wade (Nina van Pallandt), wife of alcoholic and writers' block suffering novelist Roger Wade (Sterling Hayden), has hired him to find her husband who has gone missing, he has binged on alcohol and disappeared before, but never longer than a day or two. While investigating, visiting private rich detoxification alcoholics and drug addiction clinics, Marlowe finds out the Wades knew the Lennoxes, so he believes there was something else to the murder of Sylvia and the suicide of Terry. He also crosses paths with Marty Augustine (Mark Rydell), the ruthless gangster who Lennox took money from which he wants back, he does manage to recover the money and travels back to Mexico, and there Marlowe finally uncovers the truth and solves the case. Also starring Henry Gibson as Dr. Verringer, David Arkin as Harry, Warren Berlinger as Morgan, Jo Ann Brody as Jo Ann Eggenweiler, Stephen 'Steve' Coit as Detective Farmer and Jack Knight as Mabel. Elliott is odd casting but certainly likable with his alternative approach to the character played previously by the likes of Dick Powell and Humphrey Bogart, I can see why it might be considered semi-spoof because of the amusing nature about it, I confess I was confused most of the time, but I could just about follow the investigative stuff, and it worked alright as a thriller-esque story, so its a worthwhile detective drama.

Many had commented that they didn't care for it. I found the actors and actresses to be very believable in their parts and accents. I must agree that this is one of Tom Cruise's best roles. I was very moved by the various positions the leading man and lady were placed in. I felt every blow that Joseph received, I wanted to slap Shannon for her sharp tongue. I wanted to cry at scenes, I laughed at many. I found the music to speak volumes and was pleasantly surprised that John Williams was the composer. There were a few Schindler's List notes, but not enough to subtract or distract in the least from the film. The sweeping shots of both Ireland and Oklahoma with their openness contrasted by the closed closeness of the city made you feel closed in and dead-ended. You can even nearly smell the rank stench of men, the filth of the streets and the sweat of the oppressed. Very seldom do I find a movie that actually 'speaks' to each of my senses as this film does. Go ahead, pop it in and step back in time. Perhaps, you would also care to bring some modern tissues with you...

Credit has to go to production designer John Jay Moore and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin for giving it just the right slightly futuristic look, and it's got some gorgeous rural vistas to take in. It's a little episodic, but it's also got some energy, and some nifty moments.Melanie Griffith offers a delightful performance as female tracker E. Johnson (the E stands for Edith), hired by lonely man Sam Treadwell (a fairly stiff David Andrews) to take him to a dangerous area where he can find a replacement for his robot wife Cherry (Pamela Gidley). On their journey they run into colourful characters played by such wonderful acting veterans as Ben Johnson, who's endearing as Six Fingered Jake, and Harry Carey Jr., as Snappy Tom.You know you'll be in for a good time when you look over that supporting cast Marshall Bell, Laurence Fishburne, Michael C. Gwynne, Brion James, Jack Thibeau, and Robert Z'Dar. The always welcome Tim Thomerson has a particularly amusing role as an unconventional desert dwelling despot, whose followers have it in for people such as Edith. Overall the movie isn't overly flashy, but it's pretty exciting at times, especially the entire sequence with the crane and the water pipe. The soaring score composed by Basil Poledouris (Conan the Barbarian, RoboCop, etc.) is fine accompaniment.Although Thomerson as Lester shows himself to be a serious psycho, this never gets too, too unpleasant, with director Steve De Jarnatt keeping the action moving and having fun with the offbeat little details provided by screenwriter Michael Almereyda (story credit goes to executive producer Lloyd Fonvielle). Cherry 2000 does know how to send you away with a smile on your face. It may have gotten a limited release in theatres in the 1980s, but 26 years later it proves enjoyable enough to deserve a rediscovery.Seven out of 10.

Basically, set in 1960's Nottingham, young factory machinist Arthur Seaton (BAFTA winning and nominated Albert Finney) is hardworking and only gets paid modest wages, he is angry at many things in his life, including his parents, and he does not to stay living in drudgery like all around him. The wages he earns he spends at weekends on drinking and having fun, he is having an affair with the wife of an older co-worker, Brenda (BAFTA winning Rachel Roberts), and he also starts a relationship with single and nearer his age Doreen Gretton (Shirley Anne Field). Arthur's personal life takes a drastic turn on Saturday night when Brenda tells him she is pregnant with his child, Arthur asks for advice from Aunt Ada (Hylda Baker) about an abortion, but this does work out and Brenda decides to keep the child and face the consequences. Brenda's husband finds out about the affair with Arthur and being pregnant with his child, and following this he gets his brother and a fellow soldier to try and catch him and give him a severe beating, they chase him through a town carnival. After these Brenda returns to her normal life with her husband and the children, Arthur recovers and returns to working at the factory, but he knows he cannot see his mistress or to be born child again, and in the end Arthur and Doreen discuss their future, i.e. possible marriage and a new home together. Also starring Norman Rossington as Bert, Bryan Pringle as Jack, Robert Cawdron as Robboe, Edna Morris as Mrs. Bull, Elsie Wagstaff as Mrs. Seaton and Frank Pettitt as Mr. Seaton. Finney gives a great performance as the young man struggling against authority and responsibility, Roberts is terrific as the older woman who causes a big dilemma, and Field is good as the young woman unaware about his disregard. You have to keep in mind that pregnancy between a young and older person was controversial in the 1960's, and of course abortions were illegal, so there are engaging issues to keep you watching, a powerful and most interesting classic drama. It won the BAFTA for Best British Film, and it was nominated for Best British Screenplay and Best Film from any Source. Albert Finney was number 33 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 22 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 49 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!
