First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere.

I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of My Heart Goes On.Problems.

This is not surprising considering that it is an Australian Film, but the thing is is that the characters are genuine. It is as if the makers followed some around and took down all of their mannerisms and speech patterns. I was seriously convinced that Mick and Kev were genuine.This movie was a comedy, and I really did not find it that funny. The funniest scene was when they were being chased down the street by a guy in a koala suit after stealing his money bucket. Other than that, there was not much that I found really funny about the movie. Yet as an Australian film, I think that it continues to set the standard. We don't go for fancy effects, but rather real characters, and the characters in Idiot Box are real.The movie is based around two unemployed bums, Mick and Kev. They think they know everything, but really don't. Mick fancies himself a poet and Kev fancies himself important. Mick at least has a go at being a poet, Kev is simply a looser, and very much like some Australians that I know. He is an idiot that thinks that he can think when he really cannot. He is the one that gets everybody around him into trouble, and then blames them for stuffing up. He can never do any wrong, yet he himself just can't stay out of trouble.Mick and Kev want to rob a bank. They think they can do it, but as the film progresses they seriously do not know what they are getting into. The police aren't onto them, but rather trying to stop a group that has been successfully robbing a lot of banks. Kev and Mick just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.What I liked about this was that I could not predict the ending. I knew that they could not pull off the robbery because they simply do not know what they are doing. In fact they seem to make more enemies than friends. Their self centred attitudes, especially Kev's, seems to alienate them. Kev is the leader of the two, and the cover shows that because Kev is running ahead of Mick with a serious look on his face, while Mick is laughing.Idiot Box also gives us an idea of what it is like on the dole, but they are not seriously looking for a job, rather they just bludge around home and the pub. Mick and Kev are dole bludgers and as such we do not feel any sympathy for them. If anybody, we feel more sympathy for Mick because he actually seems like a nice guy. Kev is simply just shallow because he refuses to let his emotions out. When Mick meets up with a young lady, we begin to see another side of him, a side that is sensitive and loving, and we feel that he is being dragged into something by Kev.What is also interesting is that they are not made heroes at the end of the movie, and as such I feel that this raises the movie about the typical Hollywood garbage. The characters in this movie are in way over their heads, and are so fortunate that they are given a second chance.

It is as if the makers followed some around and took down all of their mannerisms and speech patterns. I was seriously convinced that Mick and Kev were genuine.This movie was a comedy, and I really did not find it that funny. The funniest scene was when they were being chased down the street by a guy in a koala suit after stealing his money bucket. Other than that, there was not much that I found really funny about the movie. Yet as an Australian film, I think that it continues to set the standard. We don't go for fancy effects, but rather real characters, and the characters in Idiot Box are real.The movie is based around two unemployed bums, Mick and Kev. They think they know everything, but really don't. Mick fancies himself a poet and Kev fancies himself important. Mick at least has a go at being a poet, Kev is simply a looser, and very much like some Australians that I know. He is an idiot that thinks that he can think when he really cannot. He is the one that gets everybody around him into trouble, and then blames them for stuffing up. He can never do any wrong, yet he himself just can't stay out of trouble.Mick and Kev want to rob a bank. They think they can do it, but as the film progresses they seriously do not know what they are getting into. The police aren't onto them, but rather trying to stop a group that has been successfully robbing a lot of banks. Kev and Mick just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.What I liked about this was that I could not predict the ending. I knew that they could not pull off the robbery because they simply do not know what they are doing. In fact they seem to make more enemies than friends. Their self centred attitudes, especially Kev's, seems to alienate them. Kev is the leader of the two, and the cover shows that because Kev is running ahead of Mick with a serious look on his face, while Mick is laughing.Idiot Box also gives us an idea of what it is like on the dole, but they are not seriously looking for a job, rather they just bludge around home and the pub. Mick and Kev are dole bludgers and as such we do not feel any sympathy for them. If anybody, we feel more sympathy for Mick because he actually seems like a nice guy. Kev is simply just shallow because he refuses to let his emotions out. When Mick meets up with a young lady, we begin to see another side of him, a side that is sensitive and loving, and we feel that he is being dragged into something by Kev.What is also interesting is that they are not made heroes at the end of the movie, and as such I feel that this raises the movie about the typical Hollywood garbage. The characters in this movie are in way over their heads, and are so fortunate that they are given a second chance.

The actor that played Cyrano did such a great job. The enthusiasm and power that he put into the role was amazing. I love how Cyrano was so prideful. He had his own path and he did not care who he angered. I also enjoyed how the ending was not a happy ending. I feel the way they ended it was more believable than the way an American would of ended it, with the guy getting the girl and living happily ever after. The directer is Jean-Paul Rappeneau. He is a french film director, screenwriter, and actor. Rappeneau is known for creating the most elaborate film version of Cyrano De Bergerac. The film was one of the most expensive French films ever produced. A great idea is the idea about how people think very superficial about themselves. This idea is seen throughout the whole film. In the beginning Cyrano freaks out at a man in the theater and ends up in a sword and word battle with the guy because he makes fun of his nose. Also Cyrano feels no woman would want him just because of his nose. Even in the end when he is told that Roxanne loved whoever wrote the letters and did not care if the person was ugly, Cyrano still waited until his death was eminent to let her know he wrote the letters. Another good idea is that a man should stand up for what he believes in. Cyrano shows this constantly throughout the movie. First when he is in the bathhouse and Comte De Guiche comes to ask him a question. Cyrano could get one of his plays put on stage but he would have to join Comte De Guiche. Cyrano basically spits in his face and does not respect the man. The largest thing that stood out to me that made this movie French was the fact that it did not have a happy ending. If this were an American film Cyrano would of ended with Roxanne and Christian would not of died. But with having Christian die and Cyrano not tell Roxanne he loves her we get this interesting ending where no one ends up happy. It has a very dark Shakespearian feel to it.

Yet a number of films have been based on his works, some of them very successful, dating back to The Lost Moment (based on The Aspern Papers) and The Heiress (based on Washington Square) in the late forties. The Merchant-Ivory team made three film adaptations of his novels, The Europeans, The Bostonians and The Golden Bowl. Like many of James's novels, The Portrait of a Lady is set among American expatriates in Europe. The central character, Isabel Archer, is a young American woman who becomes financially independent after she inherits a large amount of money from her English uncle Mr Touchett. While travelling on the Continent she meets another American expatriate, Gilbert Osmond, in Florence. The two marry, but the marriage is not a happy one, and Isabel comes to suspect that Osmond is a fortune-hunter whose only interest in her is financial. The film is made in the heritage cinema style, popular in the eighties and nineties, and is reminiscent of the work of Merchant-Ivory and of certain other films of the period, such as Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence and Terence Davies's The House of Mirth. Films in this style are generally set in the nineteenth or early twentieth century among the well-to-do classes, are generally based upon a literary source and are characterised by a detailed recreation of the look of the period and by an emphasis on dialogue and character development rather than physical action. Nicole Kidman's acting career got off to a promising start with films like Dead Calm and Flirting, but over the next ten years or so she seemed to get stuck in something of a rut, appearing in far too many dull or second-rate films like Far and Away, Batman Forever, Practical Magic and the dreadful Moulin Rouge. The Portrait of a Lady is considerably better than any of those films, but Kidman's performance is not her best, and her accent is not always reliable. It has become commonplace to describe American actors unsuccessfully attempting a British accent (or vice-versa) as being stuck in mid- Atlantic. Kidman's Aussie-tinged American accent is probably the first example of a major stat being linguistically stuck in mid-Pacific. John Malkovich is a lot better; like his Valmont in another period drama, Dangerous Liaisons his Osmond is the sort of character he excels at playing, able to combine an icy reptilian coldness with a certain smooth and plausible charm. There are also good contributions from Barbara Hershey as Osmond's friend and co-conspirator Madame Merle and from John Gielgud in a cameo as the elderly Touchett. (Gielgud was 92 at the time, and this was far from being his last film; he was to continue working up until his death in 2000 at the age of 96). Although Henry James was a dramatist as well as a novelist, and adapted several of his books for the stage, he considered The Portrait of a Lady to be unsuitable for dramatic presentation and dissuaded a friend who wanted to turn it into a play. That, however, did not dissuade Jane Campion from attempting to film the novel. Having recently watched the film for the first time since seeing it in the cinema in 1996, I can say that, in my view, James was probably right. It is, like many examples of heritage cinema, visually attractive, but it is also rather emotionally cold and too slow-moving. There is nothing much about it which remains in the mind for long afterwards. It does not really compare with the greatest heritage movies like The Age of Innocence, The House of Mirth or the best examples of Merchant-Ivory's work such as Howard's End.

John Malkovich is a lot better; like his Valmont in another period drama, Dangerous Liaisons his Osmond is the sort of character he excels at playing, able to combine an icy reptilian coldness with a certain smooth and plausible charm. There are also good contributions from Barbara Hershey as Osmond's friend and co-conspirator Madame Merle and from John Gielgud in a cameo as the elderly Touchett. (Gielgud was 92 at the time, and this was far from being his last film; he was to continue working up until his death in 2000 at the age of 96). Although Henry James was a dramatist as well as a novelist, and adapted several of his books for the stage, he considered The Portrait of a Lady to be unsuitable for dramatic presentation and dissuaded a friend who wanted to turn it into a play. That, however, did not dissuade Jane Campion from attempting to film the novel. Having recently watched the film for the first time since seeing it in the cinema in 1996, I can say that, in my view, James was probably right. It is, like many examples of heritage cinema, visually attractive, but it is also rather emotionally cold and too slow-moving. There is nothing much about it which remains in the mind for long afterwards. It does not really compare with the greatest heritage movies like The Age of Innocence, The House of Mirth or the best examples of Merchant-Ivory's work such as Howard's End. Or, for that matter, with Jane Campion's own earlier, more dramatic and passionate period drama, The Piano. 6\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 December 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression.

The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials.The mechanics of the sting is quite simple Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he broadcasts the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those gamblers as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan.That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them.The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing.

This film is directed by Bryan Singer and the main characters such as Stephen Baldwin (Michael McManus), Gabriel Byrne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), Kevin Spacey (Roger Verbal Kint), Chazz Palminteri (Agent Dave Kujan) and Pete Postlethwaite (Kobayashi the henchman). The film begins on a ship were an unidentified character seems to have shot Keaton (Byrne) and then sets the ship on fire. The police arrive on the scene to investigate; the police officer reveals there are only two witnesses, a cripple and a hospitalized Hungarian. As cripple survivor Kint (Spacey) is waiting to post bail agent Kujan (Palminteri) wants to hear the story from the beginning. Flash back to six weeks earlier, in a police line-up of five criminals who are hauled in and put together into a holding cell because they are the usual suspects. While in the holding cell they all decide to do one last job together to get some kind of sweet revenge. The heist is only a stepping stone to another job which soon turns into a lot of twist and turns, only to find out they are working for a lawyer name Kobayashi (Postlethwaite). The five criminals are roped in because at one time or another they betrayed the mysterious Keyser Soze and does he get his revenge on them. The main theme is trying to reveal who is Keyser Soze, do we the audience unravel the puzzle of who this mysterious Keyser Soze really is and do the police unmasked him. I feel as if the director matched the perfect actors to there characters. If you like mystery, puzzles, twist and turn, this is a movie for you.

Copolla presents Caul as a character who is ridden by a sense of guilt that he can't seem to get rid of. The guild is brought about by a surveillance assignment he did years ago that led to the death of several people. Caul tries to get rid of this guilt by convincing himself that he is not responsible for why someone asks for surveillance recordings or what is done as a result of those recordings. He tells himself that his only concern is getting good surveillance recordings for whomever hired him. Anything beyond that is not is concern or his responsibility. He tells his partner, Stan, in the opening scene of the movie, I don't care what their talking about, all I want is a nice fat recording. However, he cannot get rid of the guilt that ways him down. He is constantly paranoid of people knowing too much about him. He tries to live a secret life and remain withdrawn from all other people. Caul faces a moral dilemma when he starts to believe that his latest recording will again lead to several people's death. He is disturbed by the knowledge of someone's impending doom and he can;t get away from the feeling that he is responsible to do something. The viewer watches as Caul struggles with a sense of moral responsibility. He tries to justify not doing something by reminded himself that he bears no liability for what is done as a result of his recordings, but he can't purge the deep notion that he must do something to prevent the foreseeable crime. Copolla presents Caul's moral dilemma without judging whether he should take action or not. Does Caul have a moral responsibility to prevent a crime from happening, even if he is not legally responsible? Is Caul allowed to separate his work from how people use it? These are judgments that Copolla allows the viewer to make. But before the viewer can answer these questions, he or she must answer the question of why Caul can't rid himself of a moral responsibility for how his surveillance is used. Is it business ethics, or societal pressure? (Caul will not lose his job or be legally prosecuted if he doesn't do anything). Or is it that Caul has some deep-seeded sense that calls him to prevent murder? If this is the case, who or what has given Caul this sense? Caul is responsible to something higher than society or humanity. He is haunted by this fact, and he tries desperately to escape it. But try as he might, Caul cannot escape this moral sense throughout the movie.Copolla's gripping drama should force the viewer to ask these questions about him or herself and humanity and general.
