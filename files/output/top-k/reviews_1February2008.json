Probably not. But who did get closest to that? I think Quentin Tarantino. This movie is easily getting in my top 5 best movies ever made. It has everything. Great dialogs (monologs, hehe bible quote), very charismatic characters, interesting story, great soundtrack and it's full of anthology scenes. In fact, I think every scene can be taken as one of the best in film history. This is definitely Tarantino's top film he made. The acting crew is also perfect. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta had roles of their life here. There's no way you won't like them and you just gotta listen to their dialogs. They are just so damn cool. And I have to add... This movie has one of the best opening scenes. Restaurant robbery and misirlou music, oh boy... After watching this movie I was very impressed. Actually I can't find words to describe it. Till this day I don't know how many times I watched it and I'm sure I will watch it again and again and again and... Well, you got the point! haha...

All through the movie, White nationalism is made to look irrational while black racism is made to look cool and even humorous.Derek (Edward Norton) becomes a White nationalist after his father is killed. Then with the aid of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), Derek starts a gang in his neighborhood to take it back from the nonwhites who have run it into the ground. Derek and his gang then attack a store, trashing it and brutalizing the employees (something blacks are much more known for in real life than White nationalists).The plot takes a twist when three blacks whom Derek beats in a basketball game show up to break into his car and house. Derek is alerted by his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), and Derek rushes downstairs and kills two of the burglars, stomping one's head into the street curb. Derek is then convicted of manslaughter and sent to prison. Again, the goal here of the producers was to make Derek, a White nationalist, look violent and out of control.Danny then feels guilty and wishes he would have never alerted Derek that night. This is one of the many instances in this movie where the guilt is shifted from the black criminals to the Whites.When Derek is in prison, he is forced to work with Lamont (Guy Torry), a black inmate, who consistently refers to Whites as pecker-woods and refers to his fellow blacks as brothers. This brand of black racism, which is so prevalent in other movies, is made to look humorous and cool, unlike White nationalism, which again is made to look irrational.Derek then sees the light after being educated by a black teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and decides he's no longer going to be a White nationalist. The premise here was to make the White nationalist look stupid and mislead and make the black man look intelligent and dignified.Meanwhile on the outside, Danny starts to head down the same path his brother Derek went, joining the White nationalists. When Derek is released from prison, he decides to help Danny also see the light and leave the White nationalists.I didn't want to spoil the ending if you haven't seen the movie, but I am forced to. So if you have not seen the movie and you don't want to know the ending, skip the next paragraph.The movie ends with Danny being shot and killed in school by a black kid whom he had had a run-in with previously. Derek then rushes into the school to find Danny's bloody corpse in the bathroom. Derek then blames himself for his brother's murder. The idea here was to make Derek look guilty for taking his brother down the path of White nationalism, and shifting the guilt from the black who pulled the trigger.Throughout the movie, issues that affect White Americans, including illegal immigration and affirmative action, are discussed with the deliberate intention to make the White point of view on these subjects look hateful and irrational, while making the opposite point of view seem intellectual.One particular scene is when the family, with Derek's mother's new Jewish boyfriend, Murray (Elliot Gould), is over for dinner. A discussion about Rodney King erupts into a fight after Derek expresses his point of view on the matter.The interesting part of this scene is when Murray says the Jews have been persecuted for 5,000 years. He is then met with silence by Derek when an appropriate response in real life would be to point out the many atrocities carried out by Jews against other peoples, including the Palestinians, the Russians, and the Germans. But you'll never see any criticism of Jews in movies, and we all know why. So if you're White, I think you now understand the premise of this movie Whites are bad and violent and nonwhites are smart, funny, and cool.Save your money.

Why is that, you ask, when there has been a purchased VHS copy of the film in my possession since around the time it was first released? The simple fact is that here in Denmark, we dub... anything that's made for children, or is considered family entertainment(which is really just a word used to mask that something is made for kids, enough so that the teenagers and possibly some of the adults won't make a run for it the moment the suggestion of viewing it is said out loud before the family members). I'm not really in favor of it, I prefer the originals(sub, don't dub... the voice is one of the tools that an actor has, the sound a major part of a film, and through that, the director's work, and the actors and crew, for that matter), but hey, at least we're not France or Germany(good luck watching *anything* on German television that isn't in German, regardless of whether they made it or not). For that reason, the voices were some of what I noticed the most, along with the original dialog and lyrics to songs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't bad at all. Broderick does good, though were it not for the animated form of his character, I'm not sure he would come across as strong as he does when he needs to... seriously, who could ever be scared of him? Of course, it could be the roles he seems to play often. Marin, Goldberg and Cummings make good hyenas. Irons is great. Guillaume(try spelling *that* three times fast) is marvelous. I didn't personally care much for Atkinson, but hey, I've always preferred his Blackadder(in particular after the first season\/show) to his Mr. Bean(a character I don't find funny), and this is clearly done after the latter, not the former. Fans of Bean may very well enjoy the character(much like how Robin Williams fans might enjoy at least his part in Aladdin), and he's not the only one(not only for this Disney film, either) who bears strong similarities to their character, to the point where in many cases, it would seem(and sometimes they even say so) that the animators and such based the look and mannerisms on the actual actor\/performer. I saved what may very well be the best for last... James Earl Jones. What can I say? The man almost invariably(in anything he appears in) has an undeniably commanding presence, and that is arguably mainly due to his voice, so casting him was a smart choice, and it pays off. The plot is well-written. The animation is quite good, with a bright, varied, colorful palette, and lively movements both in the camera and in the players. I didn't find this as energetic or funny as Aladdin, but it was still enjoyable. The music is magnificent, Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a fantastic song, and it's not the only one in the feature(to which that adverb can be applied). The DVD has some marvelous material, including music videos, a few deleted bits, some games(one of which isn't half bad), a Virtual Safari and featurettes regarding... just about everything you could imagine, regarding the film, including the stage production based off it, the music in it, even the animals.

The simple fact is that here in Denmark, we dub... anything that's made for children, or is considered family entertainment(which is really just a word used to mask that something is made for kids, enough so that the teenagers and possibly some of the adults won't make a run for it the moment the suggestion of viewing it is said out loud before the family members). I'm not really in favor of it, I prefer the originals(sub, don't dub... the voice is one of the tools that an actor has, the sound a major part of a film, and through that, the director's work, and the actors and crew, for that matter), but hey, at least we're not France or Germany(good luck watching *anything* on German television that isn't in German, regardless of whether they made it or not). For that reason, the voices were some of what I noticed the most, along with the original dialog and lyrics to songs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't bad at all. Broderick does good, though were it not for the animated form of his character, I'm not sure he would come across as strong as he does when he needs to... seriously, who could ever be scared of him? Of course, it could be the roles he seems to play often. Marin, Goldberg and Cummings make good hyenas. Irons is great. Guillaume(try spelling *that* three times fast) is marvelous. I didn't personally care much for Atkinson, but hey, I've always preferred his Blackadder(in particular after the first season\/show) to his Mr. Bean(a character I don't find funny), and this is clearly done after the latter, not the former. Fans of Bean may very well enjoy the character(much like how Robin Williams fans might enjoy at least his part in Aladdin), and he's not the only one(not only for this Disney film, either) who bears strong similarities to their character, to the point where in many cases, it would seem(and sometimes they even say so) that the animators and such based the look and mannerisms on the actual actor\/performer. I saved what may very well be the best for last... James Earl Jones. What can I say? The man almost invariably(in anything he appears in) has an undeniably commanding presence, and that is arguably mainly due to his voice, so casting him was a smart choice, and it pays off. The plot is well-written. The animation is quite good, with a bright, varied, colorful palette, and lively movements both in the camera and in the players. I didn't find this as energetic or funny as Aladdin, but it was still enjoyable. The music is magnificent, Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a fantastic song, and it's not the only one in the feature(to which that adverb can be applied). The DVD has some marvelous material, including music videos, a few deleted bits, some games(one of which isn't half bad), a Virtual Safari and featurettes regarding... just about everything you could imagine, regarding the film, including the stage production based off it, the music in it, even the animals. I recommend this, and its DVD release, to fans of the Disney animated musicals, and\/or of any or more of the actors. 8\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"1 February 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I am such a fan of the first Neverending Story film, it's a film that I grew up with and have always loved, it was one of my first fairy tale films that had cool effects and a wonderful story. Even today, there is still something special about the film, when I saw the double feature of Neverending Story and Neverending Story 2 The Next Chapter, it was was ten dollars, so I figured to go ahead and get the DVD. One guaranteed good movie with a possibility of another good one, even if the title is a little contradicting, lol. So I watched the film finally today and I have to say that while this isn't certainly the worst film, it isn't the best and was pretty insulting to the first film, the story? Nice cover up on how if you read it twice, the story is a different one.Bastian's life really doesn't seem all that different since he finished the Neverendng Story, his life is still lonely with his busy work-aholic father and he has been rejected from the swim team, things are not looking up for him. He goes back to the antique book store and gets Neverending Story again. He finds out that the empress is in trouble and he needs to restore Fantasia once again and with the help of Atreyu, Falkor, and his rock buddy(who somehow has a kid, how do rocks have kids?), he hopes to pull it off. But that'll be difficult when the emptiness is taking over and all Bastain's wishes are causing him to loose his memory of his father and late mother.The Neverending Story Part 2 isn't a bad family film, but it's really cheesy. I was hoping they would've given them more money, because these costumes were really horrible, the bird? God, could it have been any more cheesy? Not to mention the effects, the fact they changed ALL the actors from the first film, it was just a little over the top and wasn't anything special.

The two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership. The cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of D-Day, legendary. Rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiers.Here is wear Ryan succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of World War II battle in history. The characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they don't fight, they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs, not like super soldiers with the exception of Barry Pepper's character, but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the war.The themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence. The universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you don't understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find Private Ryan and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do.

Naturally, the four spindly 14-15 year olds are guided by four of the most appealing older girls in memory. Its colorful, jerky. Full of life, a real, embodied life that by its appearance makes all the rest of the thing seem incredibly sad in its artificiality.Someone knew what they were doing when they put this together. Someone deep and true and of the kind we need more of if we are to make it through. Or do I hang my life on commercially available narrative too?Heh.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

I loved the original Star Wars trilogy, and was hugely anticipating the new trilogy. To my immense delight, I thought that The Phantom Menace was a brilliant film.In some respects, I can see why people dislike The Phantom Menace. Yes, there are some wooden performances (eyes on you, Natalie Portman). Yes, the dialogue is clunky. But I don't really think that Oscar-worthy performances and exceptional writing are what the Star Wars saga is about. In my opinion, it is more about grand and epic storytelling, which this film accomplishes extremely well.The visuals are the film's best asset. George Lucas creates brand new worlds for us to gasp in awe at, with such detail and creativity put into creating the environments that it is hard to believe that you can't reach out and feel them. The crew deserve tremendous applause for such an incredibly creative accomplishment. Each world has its own individual character. Whereas Coruscant is a sprawling, busy capital, Tatooine is unfriendly and barren. The visual effects are terrific, and you find yourself indulging on almost every detail.However, it wouldn't be a great Star Wars movie without action, and Phantom Menace delivers two scorching set pieces. The first is a frenetically furious pod race, in which the racers shoot through dangerous terrain, all the time trying to avoid dirty tricks from their competitors and unfriendly fire from unhappy campers. The race is brilliantly gripping, keeping you on the edge of your seat from the heart-stopping beginning to the cheer-worthy ending. As with almost every scene in the movie, the race is also jam-packed with clever details, drawing you in closer to the action.The second is a pulse-raising three-way lightsaber fight between Qui-Gon Jinn (the excellent Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Darth Maul (athlete Ray Park). This lightsaber duel conquers all of the previous duels in the series, and is absolutely terrific. It is fantastically exciting to finally see such a fast-paced, brutal and energetic lightsaber fight, where the combatants seem perfectly fluent and are fighting with every ounce of their strength. This sequence is a classic sword fight, which will always be in my mind when anyone mentions Star Wars.In addition to the fantastic action, there is another phenomenal score from John Williams. He provides several breath-taking new tunes (the highlight is Duel of The Fates, which is played during the lightsaber fight), yet also offers foreshadowing of future events in the saga by using tunes from the original films. Despite the fact that the performers are hindered by undoubtedly clunky dialogue, quite a few of them manage to turn in decent performances. Neeson gives a noble and powerful performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, fully emphasising the perfect image of a Jedi master. Ewan McGregor provides a few moments of brilliant emotional clarity, whilst Jake Lloyd gives a passable portrayal of future Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. But the best performance comes from Pernilla August, who gives a performance of great grace and vulnerability as Anakin's mother.George Lucas handles all of the proceedings with consummate skill. He has made some mistakes in the screenplay, but he has ensured to the best of his ability that he is able to grant us a compelling and engaging vision of the Star Wars galaxy. He has had some low points in his career, but on a creative scale, this certainly isn't one of them. He directs the film passionately and without remorse, which earns him my deepest respect.This is a brilliant fantasy movie. It may not be as dark as the fans were hoping for, but it is still successful in terms of its creativity, its visual effects and its action.

So I watched Blue Crush last night and I have to say that when I remembered seeing the trailer for Blue Crush when it first came out and it looked like the most lame thing ever, I was 17 years old at the time, so watching this now, it was better than what I expected. But still, it was nothing special, it was like one of those movies that you see once, and you're happy with seeing it that one time. It has fun sports, hot actors(that really can't act), and a decent story that's worth a look, even if it is a little too much of a chick flick at times.Anne Marie is a young girl in Hawaii who lives with two other friends and her little sister. Her mother ran away and left her with all the responsibilities of being an adult. Anne Marie is also a competitive surfer and kicks butt on the waves, so much so, that her room mate, Eden, wants her to compete in the pipe line contest, which is extremely dangerous and Anne Marie has a fear off since she almost died from a wipe out when she was a little girl. A hot tourist, Matt, distracts her and has a steamy affair with him, she forgets who she is and has to get back on track in order for her dreams to come true.Blue Crush is a cute movie and has an uplifting and positive message to go the distance and make your dreams come true. Sounds cheesy, but I think young girls need more movies like Blue Crush, it's cool for the tween crowd. As an adult, like I said, it's average, but it was a decent film.

I realized that it was a very good film because I am NOT a big sports fan yet I found myself unable to stop watching. That's because the focus on the film wasn't strictly on his exploits on the field. Sure he could hit a ton of home runs, RBIs and had a high batting average, but the real story was about his being Jewish during an era when people were very open and ugly with their antisemitism. However, instead of painting him as a victim, the film excels because it discusses not only how he was soon accepted but helped show the way America changed from the time of Greenberg to that of the first Black big leaguer, Jackie Robinson. This logical progression help make this a much more interesting film than simply stating statistics and talking about home run titles or MVP awards.The film itself was constructed using archival interviews with Greenberg (who'd died over a decade before the film was made) as well as interviews with people who knew or played with him. Most of the interviews were pretty interesting though some of the incidental music they used was distracting as often they kept repeating the same songs again and again (Hold That Tiger and several other songs were so overplayed that I now hate them). This was not a huge problem, but did make the production seem a bit less polished. Overall, this is a lovely historical documentary that may not impress people who hate sports but even then, there should be enough to even interest them.By the way, when the credits roll, don't stop watching. A few more interviews appear later--and the first one where you hear the two elderly ball players talking about modern ball players was really funny and poignant.

This was watchable and is probably better to see with a bunch of mates after you've all come back from a night on the lash but in the cold light of day, there are too few good gags and scenes to recommend this.

I can't recommend this movie enough for a good laugh and a great time. I know it's not Citizen Kane or anything like that but it is something that I grew up on and therefore, I love it a lot.Adam Sandler is hilarious as Madison, the man who decides to go back to every grade of school so that he can get his dad's hotel company handed down to him. All the other actors are funny as well and the jokes are fantastic. You'll probably find yourself quoting this one long after you've seen it.Anyone who wants to laugh like a crazy person for a good 90 minutes should see this one. I kid you not.

To us fans, to have that cast together again was just what the doctor ordered.The story, a great story on top of having a great cast and one of my favorite directors Kath Bigelow, make this movie a must have for me.I won't go any further as I don't want to spoil any moment o fthis film for the uninitiated. I remember when I first moved to Los Angeles and wondered if I'd ever meet one of my favorite actresses Jeanette Goldstein and had just rented Near Dark and the next day I'm in the post office and who is standing right there at the counter? Jeanette Goldstein! So for people who love a good horror movie, with suspense, wry humor, and great, great characters, this movie is for you.The twist that makes this movie unique is that it shows the relationship of the vampires to one another like a family brought together by horrific circumstances. You don't hate the vampires but you sympathize with them which really caught me by surprise as the cast pulled it off magnificently.Again, a must have good film about parental love, relationships, courage, history and good ol' fashioned monsters.

That is of course, if you like the idea of a man shooting criminals for being involved with murdering and raping his girlfriend. I'm not going to write a very lengthy review, but I'm just going to say this.. this movie's exciting.At first, it may seem that this movie just features a man smiling killing people and laughing every time he gets a wound and it heals, but this movie packs in a lot of humor, action, gore, and more. It doesn't feature any plot twists. In fact, the whole movie is about the man taking his revenge on others, but that's alright with me.Overall, I recommend you to buy this movie. No, not rent. Buy.

It's so real to me, the way the two characters, meet, talk, and fell in love with each other. It's very simply and sincere. It's like watching some special moments in time in the life of two people, who may or may not going to meet each other again. Some people say that a movie shouldn't base on dialog, but I think this one is an exception. The realistic dialog and acting really grips my attention and pull me in. I felt like I was watching two people falling in love.I know that people can view this differently. Some may say that it's impossible that such a thing can happen and two people are talking this way. But what I want to say is, this thing can happen and two people can talk this way.The film even reminds of some experience that I had in my real life.For me, the timing of this film is just perfect. The music used is just right and fit in with the mood of the film. The cinematography captures the romantic atmosphere of Vienna. I've got my favorite scenes and I can watch this movie over and over again. It will surely stay in my heart.Thanks to the director for creating such a unique and magnificent piece of work.
