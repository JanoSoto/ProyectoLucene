[{"date":"21 December 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wonder Boys is a movie I watch every Christmastime, because it has the ambiance of that festive, snowy, steely cold holiday season. Don't picture a modern-day It's A Wonderful Life, just picture a funny, against-formula, nonviolent character piece set in the uplifting and cozy atmosphere of Christmas. Granted, it's not set at Christmas, but my point explains itself at around the middle of the film when Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire find themselves alone in a snug and pleasant house, and Douglas says, It's the kind of house I like to wake up in on Christmas morning.The film also understands writers more than most films about writers. Perhaps because it's based on the novel by Michael Chabon, an award-winning contemporary writer, the story taps into the less-spoken-of frustrations of writing. Everyone knows about writer's block or bad luck with finding publication. Hardly anyone knows about the tribulations Michael Douglas's Grady Tripp character goes through. Grady Tripp is so wrapped up in the complicated, overworked, messy world of the novel he cannot stop writing that he hardly knows where he wants to go in his life anymore. He, as a writer, has failed to make any decisions, and he wanders stressfully and unassuredly through the story with envy for every successful writer in his life, like the self-centered and perhaps less talented Q, the Rip Torn character, and is afraid of the potential of the students in his class like elusive and disturbed James Leer, the Tobey Maguire character. This is maybe the most realistic struggle any writer has ever gone through in any movie I've ever seen.Wonder Boys is a wonder, with a terrific cast including Douglas in one of his deeper and more well-drawn roles, Maguire delivering a fantastic and deeply felt performance (even if his character shoots an attacking dog, which did not make me happy), Frances McDormand in one of her earthier roles, playing more of an everywoman than Marge Gunderson or Billy Bob Thornton's adulterous wife, and Robert Downey, Jr. once again playing in essence himself but being absolutely wonderful and charming doing it.

I'm old enough to remember the silence that came from the White House as gay men were dying of AIDS while family and friends were grieving. Still, silence from President Ronald Reagan. We know that if this had been any OTHER group that was afflicted with a communicative ailment, he would have been on that TV pronto. Can you imagine President Bill Clinton NOT making several nationally televised speeches about this epidemic? I lost many friends, who couldn't believe that there could be a disease that could only affect gay people...they knew that THEY were people too, no different than their hetero counterparts. Where was the leadership from the White House? I won't talk about the film, it speaks for itself. The last scene on the beach at Fire Island gives us hope that we will see our friends again. It broke my heart and made me wonder what we'd say if something like that was possible. Unashamedly, I cry every time I see this scene, for I remember people who died needlessly in an atmosphere in which Washington, D.C. showed it's ignorance and bias against a PARTICULAR group of American-born, taxpaying citizens.

It's on target and shows just how bizarre the world was at that time. I've read many who have said it was at times boring, but for my generation, it was anything but. Imagine being 12, being at home after school, and watching cartoons....instead of watching commercials on Wonder bread, we were watching commercials on how to ...in an event of a nuclear strike...to run to the nearest shelter and continue to wipe off the nuclear fallout.In '62, during the Cuban missle crisis, my dad was busy building a bomb shelter in our backyard. It's still there though he made it into a workshop after the crisis was over. Someone else has since bought the house and workshop but I doubt they know the origins of the workshop, even though there is still a pipe for water in the middle of the structure. I still can't imagine 5 people living in a shelter roughly the size of 12feet by 12 feet for 30 some odd years. In retrospect, I think death by radiation would have been easier.As I've said...it was a bizarre world then. .
