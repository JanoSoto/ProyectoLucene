How could someone be poisoned by wearing a dress? Why did they show cheap editing of Blanchet looking in the mirror and talking to herself? I don't want to bore you with all the detail, because otherwise I'll give the movie away, but aside from all the colorful costumes, campy performances and severed heads, this movie had nothing to offer, except a good performance by Kate Blanchet portraying Elizabeth I.Luckily this only got mixed reviews, compared to hype on other over-produced period dramas.

I'm way too old to be a Spice Girls fan; my husband and I saw this on cable, and my main reason for scanning it was to see Roger Moore.Let's get the obligatory bashing out of the way  the Spice Girls can't act very well, they sing a little better, they've got a good media machine hyping them, a good arranger for their tunes, and I liked the 2 Become 1 video on MTV.The script for this movie, however flawed, was a little gem.  And in regard to all the other posters decrying Roger Moore's involvement in the movie, I recommend that you catch the flick on cable or rent the tape and watch Mr. Moore's scenes again, carefully.  He's always in Chief's minimalist office\/sitting room, there's no one there but the animals (and behind the cameraman are the lighting guys and the animal wrangler), and Mr. Moore works wonders with jaw-breakingly nonsensical dialogue.  Not only all that, but he ended up with probably the most sophisticated and opulent wardrobe of anyone in the movie!Oh, and for those folks who think Mr. Moore may have been desperate for money to do this movie--Do you remember that little programme on the telly back in the 60s?  The Saint?  Five series (seasons) in black and white and two series in colour?  Mr. Moore was co-producer of the two color seasons and gets his bit whenever a videotape is sold or the package is aired, which is quite often on both counts.  It's kinda like having an American 401(k) retirement plan, but with better music and clothes.Love & Lasers!
