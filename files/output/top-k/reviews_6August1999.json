[{"date":"6 August 1999","score":"","review":"  RUSHMORE. Some critics are proclaiming Wes Anderson's Rushmore, from a script by Anderson and Owen Wilson, a genuine comic masterpiece. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is an activity jock who resides on a scholarship at the prestigious Rushmore Academy. Max enlists in the help of lonely millionaire Herman Blume (played wonderfully by Bill Murray) to build an aquarium in honor of the school teacher (Olivia Williams) they both have their eyes on. I think the film is enjoyable, it's quirky and funny, but it's just TOO strange in spots and saddled with an ending that is COMPLETELY out of place with the film. Still, I recommend this picture because Murray gives one of the best supporting performances of the year; don't underrate this guy, there's definitely something underneath the shabby stand-up comedian persona. Rated R. 93 minutes. *** (out of ****) ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 1999","score":"","review":"  RUSHMORE.

I found myself in a state of general disbelief in several parts of the film (namely the opening scene and the now infamous pie scene which both featured humor at Jason Biggs' expense). Yeah, this movie is Porky's with better writing and more heart - but hey, so what? Who didn't love the Teenage Sex Comedy genre when it was on top years ago? Alright, movies like Meatballs Three sunk that ship (and rightfully so) but now the genre (as they all seem to do) has returned with a bang.Looking back on those movies from the eighties, the realization occurs that they just weren't all that funny. American Pie is very funny. There were points while watching Pie when I couldn't hear most of the follow up jokes to the big gags because the audience was laughing so loud. The characters (both male and female) are certainly likable enough even though it's not clear whether there is a future star amongst the young actors (though Biggs deserves something for his self-deprecation). However, proper accolades must go to veteran comedic actor Eugene Levy who is simply brilliant as Jim's straight-laced dad. It is their hilarious and at times very touching relationship that really shone through for me. Call me crazy but if there is any justice at the Oscars this year Levy will get a supporting actor nomination. But, alas, we all know that comic actors seldom get the nods they deserve from the academy (Murray got wrongfully slighted for Rushmore last year in my opinion).Overall, American Pie is perhaps the best Teenage Sex Comedy of all time.
