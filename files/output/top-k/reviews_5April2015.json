However, I don't quite understand why people hate it so much. Is it a great (even good) film? Not really, but Kevin Costner really shot for the moon with this one and even though he missed by quite a lot, you have to admire something with such ambition. The story is set in the post-apocalyptic America of...2013. Having been ravaged by a massive war, civilization has been reduced back to small settlements in a sort-of feudal system run by a renegade army that is led by a general (Will Patton) who plunders from every town he visits. Kevin Costner plays a nameless drifter who, by circumstance, becomes an inspiration and symbol of hope for the restoration of society as they once knew it. What the film gets right, and there are a number of things, is its portrayal of a society in decay. Things aren't quite Mad Max bad, but the world which Costner created in the film was fairly believable. Another thing was the epic scope of the film. Even though THE POSTMAN is, at times, self-indulgent and a little too long, little was wasted in terms of visual spectacle. There were plenty of breathtaking shots which captured the American West as only Costner (and a few others) can. In terms of characters and acting, given the length of the film, adequate screen time was allotted to suitably develop the principal characters, and the performances given by all were quite good. Still, some of the dialogue they were saddled with (pardon my pun) was cliché at best, laughable at worst. In fact, most of the moments which were supposed to emotionally hit you came off as silly to me. Not only that, but they played it straight and so unironically that it came off that much more silly. Overall, THE POSTMAN aims high in terms of scope and themes, but only delivers satisfactorily on the technical side of things. As long as you don't mind silly, but earnest, post-apocalyptic fare this film isn't a bad way to pass three hours.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of things, wrong and unpleasant about this movie. The movie was often panned by many critics for its humorless jokes, adult content, racial insensitivity, ethnic stereotyping, cold-hearted characters, references to pedophilia and incomprehensible plot with an awful twist ending. I do agree with them, but I find myself, defending the movie, more, because it's told in the eyes of a trouble, often neglect, young child, North (Elijah Woods) who wish to have better parents. Without spoiling too much, I believe there seem to be more, to the film, that it's stating out. Based on the novel, North The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel, the movie started out with North having a panic attack, and begins to lose consciousness. Call it a depressing fan theory, but I really think, the whole movie secretly is about North's final thoughts. He either about to die, or in a coma-like dream, wondering if his parents honestly love him. It wasn't his parents in a coma, it was him. This would make sense, why his secret spot looks like self-made purgatory, and why his guardian angel (Bruce Willis) comes out, as the Easter Bunny. It's a hint to the idea of resurrection. North is stuck, there, until he can come to terms, if he wants to live with his parents or not. This would explain, why the rest of the story is told in a child-like view of the world. Everywhere that he visits, is shown like a cartoon, stereotype matter. It's ironic that North is his name, because everybody that follows a compass believes North is prime direction, but it wasn't until North step out his borders, that the film shows how little, he knows of the world, and how truly directionless, he is. There is a scene that explains, that North fails in geography that somewhat, proves this theory. Still, all these fan theories, doesn't excuse the movie for how stupid the movie is. There are scenes in the movie that are so obnoxious that it was a bit unbearable. The worst for me, has to be the musical number in Texas that I found annoying, ripping hard to rip away 1959's TV show Bonanza and 1978's show, Dallas. The whole journey of racist insensitivity was a bit rough. The most offensive, has to be the whole Eskimo 'flow' scene. At least, all the characters kinda stand out. It's so weird, seeing so many big names actors playing insulting characters. I really think actors like Kathy Bates, Reba McEntire, Dan Aykroyd, and others probably fired their agents after seeing their performance in this film. Other actors seem not to care too much for the film, and just wing it, like Bruce Willis, Richard Belzer & Alan Arkin. Then, there are those actors that play it as if they were just, doing another Seinfeld episode like Jason Alexander & Julia Louis Dreyfus. Some actors really did, put some work into their characters, such as John Ritter & Elijah Woods. It's also worth noting that the movie even has young Scarlett Johansson in a minor role. The movie took friendly jabs at film and televisions references, such as the squeaky clean 1950's family suburbia, 1954's Father Knows Best, 1957's Leave it to Beaver, and 1960's Andy Griffin Show. It downright, nearly parody them in the Nelson sequence. Other good things about the film, is how the movie was shot by cinematographer, Adam Greenberg. The opening with all the snow-globes, foreshadowing North's adventure was pretty cool to see. This movie is the film that got me, hook on collecting snow globes, so thank you for that. A lot of work, also went into the exotic sets. My favorite has to be the Eskimo village, where everything looks like it's made of ice. It remind me of the Flintstone, TV show, with its fantasy juxtaposition of modern everyday objects with that of ice world setting. That was pretty cool. The movie made great use of all the locations. It was breath-taking beautiful. One thing, I have to say, was amazing is the theme song from Marc Shaiman. It was so whimsical, but charming. Despite, the all-star cast, and a good director at the helm, North will probably be, most well-known as the film that got famous film critic Roger Ebert super-ass mad about. No doubt, about it, North will continue to receive aggressively negative reviews. Is the movie, the worst thing, out there? No. I have saw worst. Overall It's bad, but it can be 'so bad, it's good', somewhat watchable, if you turn off your brain. Check it out, if you want to, but I don't recommended, unless you want a headache.

specially near the climax but the whole movie is over the top i mean what were these guys thinking at that time bond was out of action in cinemas the last 007 film was license to kill 1989 of timothy Dalton there was a large gap and people thought bond is dead then came a lot of parodies and films that loved to ape bond.this movie true lies is a remake of a french film i have not seen that one but true lies is not a serious film at all if anyone is expecting it to be.there is no proper story or script for this i wonder why such a talented director like James Cameron decided to film this project off course it became a hit because the name Arnold was attached one of the reasons behind it was the terminator hype this came right after that both Cameron and Arnold worked together before on those films people though hey the dynamic duo is back they will give us one hell of a ride.there are few reasons why this film is like a parody and can not be considered a original spy flick for one i have to say true likes tries very hard to takes itself seriously and end up failing hard.let us look at the plota guy who is married and have a daughter lives a secret life as a government agent always sent on dangerous missions soon his lies gets exposed when his family and the country is at risk by the hands of terrorists.the plot sounded good it could have been a solid thriller of a film if only the comedy was not involved yes i am saying it comedy ruined this project the whole angle of his wife meeting a guy who cheats on women and wants to get laid with everyone women are attracted to him because he tells them that he is a super spy.plus not only this spy angle and comedy the editing was terrible here along with the score and music.the cast is good Anrold Schwarzenneger the iconic star himself looks good here but he should have made a bond film if he was so desperate just what was he doing here embarrassing himself,Jamie Lee Curtis role is awful she still did her best but one thing that got me hooked on this film is none other then Tia Carrere and i totally agree with people who say she reminds them of former bond girls Barbra Carrera & Talisa Soto because i am actually the biggest fan of these women myself what can i say i am a hardcore 007 fan waiting for Spectre 2015 with Daniel Craig.its hard not to laugh when watching this because at many points the jokes and situations are funny but good thing is the ending i mean really bride exploding the jet fighter plane Arnold unleashes on the villains is really well done for that time 1994.true lies 94 is just a terrible film but that does not mean it lacks some great aspects director James Cameron showcases his greatness here the film looks slick and stylish despite the awful script.one year later after this film in 1995 James Bond resurrected with a big bang as Pierce Brosnan emerged as agent 007 James bond in the number 1 film in the world Goldeneye and boy did it end not only true lies reign at box office but created havoc and media frenzy world wide surpassing everything.i would not go too far and say Skipp this film why because it is a lot better then most of the nonsense what we have today.Overall True Lies 1994 is a nice watchable film if you like some good direction but it is also the worst of James Cameron his best are Titanic 1997 & Avatar 2009 my rating is 3\/10.Below Average

there was a large gap and people thought bond is dead then came a lot of parodies and films that loved to ape bond.this movie true lies is a remake of a french film i have not seen that one but true lies is not a serious film at all if anyone is expecting it to be.there is no proper story or script for this i wonder why such a talented director like James Cameron decided to film this project off course it became a hit because the name Arnold was attached one of the reasons behind it was the terminator hype this came right after that both Cameron and Arnold worked together before on those films people though hey the dynamic duo is back they will give us one hell of a ride.there are few reasons why this film is like a parody and can not be considered a original spy flick for one i have to say true likes tries very hard to takes itself seriously and end up failing hard.let us look at the plota guy who is married and have a daughter lives a secret life as a government agent always sent on dangerous missions soon his lies gets exposed when his family and the country is at risk by the hands of terrorists.the plot sounded good it could have been a solid thriller of a film if only the comedy was not involved yes i am saying it comedy ruined this project the whole angle of his wife meeting a guy who cheats on women and wants to get laid with everyone women are attracted to him because he tells them that he is a super spy.plus not only this spy angle and comedy the editing was terrible here along with the score and music.the cast is good Anrold Schwarzenneger the iconic star himself looks good here but he should have made a bond film if he was so desperate just what was he doing here embarrassing himself,Jamie Lee Curtis role is awful she still did her best but one thing that got me hooked on this film is none other then Tia Carrere and i totally agree with people who say she reminds them of former bond girls Barbra Carrera & Talisa Soto because i am actually the biggest fan of these women myself what can i say i am a hardcore 007 fan waiting for Spectre 2015 with Daniel Craig.its hard not to laugh when watching this because at many points the jokes and situations are funny but good thing is the ending i mean really bride exploding the jet fighter plane Arnold unleashes on the villains is really well done for that time 1994.true lies 94 is just a terrible film but that does not mean it lacks some great aspects director James Cameron showcases his greatness here the film looks slick and stylish despite the awful script.one year later after this film in 1995 James Bond resurrected with a big bang as Pierce Brosnan emerged as agent 007 James bond in the number 1 film in the world Goldeneye and boy did it end not only true lies reign at box office but created havoc and media frenzy world wide surpassing everything.i would not go too far and say Skipp this film why because it is a lot better then most of the nonsense what we have today.Overall True Lies 1994 is a nice watchable film if you like some good direction but it is also the worst of James Cameron his best are Titanic 1997 & Avatar 2009 my rating is 3\/10.Below Average

the science fiction film genre as High Noon is\/was to the Western it's the one that you can watch even if (or particularly if) you don't particularly like movies of that genre. People have watched High Noon who don't usually go near Westerns, since it speaks to the times and has solid production values - it's slick, a cut above the rest, and totally efficient in the use of the time given. 'Day' is like that in its way, as Robert Wise gets in quickly, gets Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to come in and get (some) information, try and inform, get (sort of) shut down, and then leave with his warning of, simply, Live in Peace, or DIE! Context, as usual, is everything; just as Noon was about the blacklist, Day is about the threat of nuclear annihilation, how close the US and Russia (and other nations, though they were the two big ones at the time in 1950\/1951) were to destroying one another - and would be for years to come. Wise and company wanted to put forward a different message than most (if not practically all) other alien-invasion movies before and especially after. Klaatu and Gort the robot arrive on Earth, and of course brawn is first to respond over brain and Klaatu gets shot (but heals). Then he's taken in by a family - as Mr. Carpenter - and the boy shows him around the city (Billy Gray, who is mostly alright as an actor, if a bit one note).I found it interesting that one moment where Klaatu and the boy visit the Lincoln Memorial. It's one of those All-American Scenes In a Movie, maybe not unlike Capra, and with its own sort of commentary on the times. Characters in the film are trustworthy or not, though people can certainly be swayed easily by the media or attention of the sort (like the would-be father\/husband to Patricia Neal, who quickly gets to saying where Klaatu is soon as he gets a shot at it). But Wise's gift here, more than social commentary, is with montage, setting up reactions across the world to the alien coming to Earth, or people reacting to the sudden lack of electricity around the world.If I have criticisms of the film, it's that Wise doesn't give that much time at all for build-up to the ship coming to Earth. Maybe that will be a plus for some - don't waste any time, just get to it, and I understand that - but things just quickly HAPPEN in the film, and politicians and the military aren't at all characters really, if barely types. The only people of any consequence are Klaatu (an alien, but closer to that of, I dunno, Jesus Christ himself), and the Neal character and her family. Also, though Rennie is wonderful in his final speech to the planet about peace and understanding vs war and destruction, I found him by and large rather flat in his performance. Not so much by the design of it, I got that as well, just by a total lack of... personality. Which would be fine if the other actors added some extra heft. Only Neal is memorable in that regard, though also subdued.Yet there's much to recommend 'Day' for, like Bernard Herrmann's eerie and landmark score - the kind that would influence many science fiction films to come by how the music sounds like it's being beamed from space or something - and the moments where suspense does really pop out (Neal confronting Gort, and if those words really will stop him from going ape-s***). And most of all, to be sure, is that this is one of that are group of movies where an alien, albeit looking and seeming just like us (probably be design), is here for reasons not of destruction but understanding, of knowledge trumping brawn. It wants to go past how we usually see these INVADERS, and it's not just admirable, it's inspiring when one thinks about it.Ultimately, the reputation of this work really brings so much expectation that, for me, it just didn't reach up to. This may be more on me than for others who come to it; it's very good work cinematically, but it's not great, and if it is a classic it's mostly due, I think, to its iconic imagery, with the Gort robot certainly a memorable, scarily sleek representation that would be imitated for decades to come. I can't fault the direction that much, aside from a couple of potential missed moments of suspense, because it is made by people who are out to do more than schlock or cheap scares or effects. The work here lasts. I simply wish it connected more for me emotionally, aside from the intellectual experience.

Macaulay Culkin plays Richard Tyler, a nervous and awkward child who allows statistics to control his life, meaning he never does anything sporty or risky like other kids.

It is quite slow in places which even as a kid left me rather turned off to it. At the same time there are quite a few little holes in the story that do make you scratch your head in confusion. Another problem I found as a kid was the fact that it only dabbled in three genres of literature. What about Science Fiction, Non-Fiction, Action, Celebrity Autobiography? I realise they're trying to keep it simple, but it didn't have to be as simple as that! Also, it's simplistic nature does cause some issues when they come across literary legends as they're literally just glanced over! If it weren't for the fact that I'd heard of these icons of novels already, you wouldn't know who they were or what stories they were from as the movie never takes the time to explain them properly!But on the plus side, the animation is very good, with some lovely colours and an interesting art style.

Every character is freaking awesome and the dialogue is simply golden. The one character everyone knows, The Dude, is easily the highlight of this movie. He's a lazy, easygoing guy who just likes to sit back and let life happen. When he gets mixed up into a crazy, complex plot, the results are quite amusing. The second best character is Walter, a foul mouthed, angry, Vietnam veteran. He makes for some hilarious and memorable scenes. The plot to this movie is kind of all over the place.

I have to admit, this film got me in completely and I didn't see the tricks coming until they happened &#x96; I got my money's worth.Briefly, without giving too much away, the story is about Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), a psychologist and best-selling author who becomes involved with Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic gambler and con artist. Although she seems a fairly grounded person she becomes intrigued with his lifestyle. Before the surprise ending, as Mike says, she learned things about herself that she would rather not know. As Margaret takes a walk on the wild side, the landscape changes from the clean architecture of her very ordered, sophisticated and academic environment to the rain-slicked, neon-lit mean streets of Mike's world.The unusual rhythms of the dialogue, which often sound overly formal or precise, add to the off-centre feeling of the film. Now I realise that those speech patterns are a key part of Mamet's art and are even more pronounced in a film such as The Spanish Prisoner, but the first time you encounter it, you are struck by it's strangeness. If the dialogue reminds me of any non-Mamet film it is Clifford Odet's script for Sweet Smell of Success. On that film, when the director was worried that Odet's dialogue would sound stagy or exaggerated, Odets told him, 'Play it real fast. Play it on the run and it will work just fine'. I think the effectiveness of Mamet's dialogue is all in the playing as well. The theme of 'don't believe everything you see' popped up in other Mamet films following House of Games including the unsettling Homicide and the offbeat The Spanish Prisoner. However, by the time he got around to Heist, I think he had gone to the well once too often; the surprises there seemed a little too trite.But, House of Games is unique. It's as clever as The Sting, but with a harder edge. It's a film you can watch again and again and always find another aspect to enjoy.

Mary Poppins is one of Disney's most beloved classics blending a sugary lineup of unforgettable songs and irresistible charm. Then-newcomer Julie Andrews won the Best Actress Oscar for her stellar portrayal as the firm but kind Mary Poppins, and oh, my, did she deserve it. Set in 1910 England, the undisciplined children, Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice, late Matthew Garber), accidentally spark the resignation of their nanny after running away for the fourth time. Their parents, strict George Banks (David Tomlinson), and distracted suffragette Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns), collaborate on an advertisement for a strict nanny who will mold the children, so it's no surprise that when the children present their own ad for a loving & playful nanny, in song, Mr. Banks has it torn up and thrown into the fireplace. The next day, the east wind kicks in, leaf-blowering the line of ugly nannies away from the Banks' doorstep and gracefully introducing the firm but gentle magical nanny Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews, top-class). So begins the plot, a series of joyous events shared with Poppins, the children, and the humorous chimney-sweep one-man-band screever Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as Mary Poppins's true intentions of being the Banks nanny are discovered.Andrews lends a lovable wit and firmness to the mysterious nanny, thanks to a smart script by Bill Walsh & Don DaGradi. Van Dyke, often criticized for his Cockney accent, is committed to providing unstoppable energy and memorability for his all- over-the-place character. Tomlinson is in terrific form as the strict businessman\/father who believes discipline and rules must be the tools in life, but when his character undergoes a huge arc in the third act, the transformation sets him in stone as the greatest male performance in the film.What makes Mary Poppins a nostalgic and exciting journey for adults and children alike are the musical numbers, crafted by the Sherman brothers, and the colorful animated sequences. You can't not enjoy yourself watching Mary Poppins and Bert ride on carousel horses, dance with penguins, and sing about words to say when you don't know what to say (one in particular). Andrews has a God-given voice and uses it to full potential in the movie's best songs, including Spoonful of Sugar & Feed the Birds. Just singing the songs and in your head will induce chills all- around. Why, I'd be surprised if the entire film doesn't give chills. It's an absolute must for children's minds and DVD shelves.

You can put fantasy or horror in a futuristic setting, but that doesn't make it Science Fiction. The Postman is a true Sci Fi movie, loved by real Sci Fi fans, but not as much by anyone else. For the real future visionary, this is an excellent movie with wonderful acting. In particular, Will Patton plays a fantastic antagonist. The setting is well done and really makes you feel like you are there. It is one of my favorite movies.*** If you are wondering about the differences between Sci Fi, Fantasy and Horror, read on. Fantasy is generally about an overlooked character becoming a hero either by right-of-birth, accidentally gaining a special power, or just by being in the right place at the right time. It can be in a futuristic setting or quite often a medieval time. It usually involves some mystical power that can't be explained, but who cares, that's not what draws us to fantasy. Star Wars is a perfect example. Most people enjoy at least a little fantasy. Horror is a story geared to give you a rush by making you jump. Again, it can be set in the future, past or present. It generally doesn't have the vision which attracts most Sci Fi fans. If you prefer H.G. Wells and Alien to Jules Verne and Star Trek, then you are probably more of a horror fan than Sci Fi, although there are some people who like both. True Science Fiction is the telling of visionary stories giving us an idea of possible futures. Of course there is still a lot of fiction, there has to be in the unknown, but the idea is to make it as realistic as possible. If you are a fan of Jules Verne, Issac Asimov, Gene Roddenberry, David Brin, Greg Bear, Michael Crichton, J.J.

And quite red, for that matter. This is fairly typical low-budget 1950s sci-fi right here, complete with shoddy effects and no more than a passing knowledge of science, or even the laws of physics. It's about a manned mission to Mars in which stuff goes wrong, which is a theme that shows up even in today's movies; here, it's told mainly in flashback by one of the survivors.Rocketship MR-1 (you know, for Mars Rocket 1) blasts off with four crew members on board - Tom O'Bannion (Gerald Mohr), Iris Ryan (Naura Hayden), Theodore Gettell (Les Tremayne), and Sam Jacobs (Jack Kruschen). A couple of days later, they land on Mars. To put that in perspective, if the fastest spacecraft around today left while Mars and Earth were closest to each other, it would arrive at Mars in a little over a month. That's if it's an unmanned craft, as the human body can't take super-duper fast speeds. But, okay, this was 1959, so we'll just have to accept that the writers were spitballing some ideas and didn't care if they fudged some numbers.Contact is lost a couple of months after departure from Earth, and suddenly the MR-1 is detected in orbit around Earth (yeah, I know); immediately, the science types spring into action and return the rocket to terra firma by remote control. Which is totally a thing, at least in science fiction. Anyway, Iris staggers out of the ship and is essentially in shock, while one of her crew mates is rushed to an operating table with some green thing on his arm. It's up to amnesiac Iris to fill in the blanks for the doctors, who for some reason need her to explain just what in tarnation happened before they can do anything.This is where the flashback comes in, as Iris is hypnotized. We learn, in quick order, that the ship did land on Mars. Upon landing, the crew note only vegetation - no, as they said, life. Plants aren't life, people! And if someone from 2015 told this crew that plants are, indeed, life, the answer would be along the lines of well, not REAL life! Anyway, the plants are there, and they appear to be completely still. This unnerves everyone, particularly Iris, who as the lone female is prone to emotional outbursts, not like the manly and\/or thoughtful men on board.Much of the movie was shot in Cinemagic, a process that was supposed to simulate hand-drawn animation. It doesn't really work to that extent, but the scenes on Mars do have a very strong reddish hue to them. Seems appropriate. But here are a few other interesting bits that this laugher provided. 1) while the crew is on board their ship and looking out of the portholes, the sky changes from red to blue and back again between scenes. I'm not sure if the blue was supposed to mean daytime and the red was night, but even in 1959 people knew why the sky looks blue to us. 2) While on Mars, the crew encounters what they call a lake (although it's massive enough that ocean would have been the first thing to pop into my mind), so they come back later with a - wait for it - inflatable raft. Just the kind of thing you'd take onboard a spaceship that needs to be as lightweight as possible to escape Earth's gravitational pull. And then 3) about that gravity. The ship itself appears to have plenty of it, as no one's floating around. Understandable, since it would probably break the budget to turn on the antigravity in 1959. Mars also has plenty of it. In fact, it's the same gravity Earth has! Neat little coincidence.But sure, this was 1959, and the extent of outer-space exploration was...what, Yuri Gagarin? We can let them slide on a lot of this science stuff. Science is for nerds, right? Let's see this crew take on the aliens! Which they do, and spoiler alert, the aliens aren't at all pleased we're on Mars. After a while, you can kind of see their point.The Angry Red Planet is a relic of its era; it's light on facts, light on humor (other than the forced or stereotypical kinds), light on drama, and just plain light overall. Even the tone is light. I did get a kick out of the prehistoric Mission Control, which consisted of a bunch of people crowded around one terminal. Who knows how big the mountain was that housed the actual computer. Gerald Mohr, who plays the crew's commander, is sort of a poor man's Peter Graves and looks like a poor man's Humphery Bogart, which is why he was hired. Kruschen, who plays Sam the warrant officer (why?), is your garden variety comic relief. He's even from Brooklyn, which means he's got your back and just let him at those aliens! Tremayne, who had had a long, illustrious career in radio by this time, is the requisite thoughtful scientist on board; Iris is also a scientist, but everything she says is dismissed, because she's a woman.
