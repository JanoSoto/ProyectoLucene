Why else would I waste my time writing about it? My earlier entry pointed out what I thought was great about Titanic, as well as what was wrong with it. I have given it more thought, and will now suggest ways I believe it could have been the perfect movie, instead of just a very good one. 1. Keep the love triangle in, but reduce the three leads' screen time (they were not *that* interesting). Instead, develop some of the other characters, especially Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) and perhaps Bruce Ismay and Tommy Ryan (Jack's Irish friend who gets shot) as well. Movie would wind up with several interesting intertwined stories (including a couple of historic ones) and more on those characters who really *were* interesting. 2. The subplot involving the diamond was silly and unecessary--you could get the old Rose in without that unbelievable and contrived situation. She could just be there because she's the oldest surviving passenger, for instance. It would still work. The movie would even work without the bookends at all, and be a lot shorter, although I understand it's a convenient way to get the footage of the real wreck in the movie, which is extremely interesting and well done. 3. The Jack and Rose characters should be played by different actors. Winslet, though a good actress, is just a little unrefined and unbelievable as a first-class passenger. Claire Danes or Gwyneth Paltrow would have been better (though I understand Danes was actually considered but declined the role). Dicaprio is too young and frail looking. Since the role is not a difficult one, *any* decent actor could have played Jack. But he should at least have a little meat on his bones! 4. Make the Jack character a bit more interesting a\/o complicated. He was too perfect and therefore not very compelling. Give him a fault or two. Rose had plenty to spare! 5. Put some of the important events leading to the sinking back into the script, i.e., the Californian ignoring pleas for help, the wireless operator's role in the tragedy. Even if the movie were a *little* longer it would have made a big difference without being *too* long. (I understand that the latter was actually included in the original script but was left on the cutting room floor...why?) 6. Give the wonderful Victor Garber (Thomas Andrews) a LOT more to do. He was by far the most interesting character in the movie, seemed very deep and complex, and left me begging for more. Of all the actors, I think he was the best in the movie. 7. Don't portray *all* the first-class passengers as third-class people. This is just not the way it really happened. First of all, on the real ship, the third-class passengers were *not* locked behind--it simply took them longer to get to where the life-boats were. Also, many first-class passengers performed heroic deeds, i.e., Isador Straus and his wife (seen briefly during the band sequence as they lay on their first-class bed waiting to drown) refused to be saved, giving up their lifejackets and insisting on drowning together... People are people, and in such a tragic situation, you would see the entire range of heroism vs. cowardice in *all* the passengers, whether first, second, or third class. 8. On James Cameron's Titanic, the second class has mysteriously disappeared. Where were they? What were *their* circumstances like? (I presume they would be the middle class, as most of *us* are!) All in all, a very good movie, and perhaps I am nitpicking. But I liked it so much and have seen it so many times, I just cannot resist putting in my 2 cents.

I came into the film thinking that not liking this movie condemned me to be lumped into the group of people who only watch Adam Sandler movies. I left it thinking that it's the people who watch Adam Sandler movies who looked at this and saw a work of art.First of all, let me say this it's not that bad. It's a fairly well made movie. But it shouldn't be an Oscar-worthy film, it shouldn't be the 55th best movie of all time (according to IMDB voters) and it's not worth all the hype. Helen Hunt's and Nicholson's performances are overrated-in fact, if anyone deserved an Oscar for this film, in my mind it's Greg Kinnear.Let me defend my statement that Nicholson's performance is overrated. I have the feeling, and this was confirmed by others who told me about the movie, was that the idea of Melvin Udall was that as you gained insight on his condition, you were supposed to feel sorry for him, or at least root for him to get the girl. Nicholson supposedly opened the mind of someone inflicted with OCD so we could understand. Well, as much as I love Nicholson, I hated Melvin Udall. The longer the movie went on, the more I rooted for Helen Hunt's character to just move away and not leave a forwarding address. My read of Nicholson's character was not, first and foremost, a sick man it was a total b******.Now, I know the idea of his character was an anti-hero who finds redemption. But I couldn't root for him, so he wasn't an anti-hero; what's more, at the end he wasn't redeemed-in fact he was rewarded for bad behavior. (I'm sorry, but OCD patients are not required to be offensive. Some of the behavior, such as locking the door and bringing one's own silverware, are true to OCD people. But finding any offensive remark to make about another person has nothing to do with OCD and everything to do with just being a caustic person.) He was still the same jerk, he just found someone willing to put up with it. Hooray for him.What I'm basically trying to say is that the movie didn't work for me-I feel that it fell short of its goal.

Helen Hunt's and Nicholson's performances are overrated-in fact, if anyone deserved an Oscar for this film, in my mind it's Greg Kinnear.Let me defend my statement that Nicholson's performance is overrated. I have the feeling, and this was confirmed by others who told me about the movie, was that the idea of Melvin Udall was that as you gained insight on his condition, you were supposed to feel sorry for him, or at least root for him to get the girl. Nicholson supposedly opened the mind of someone inflicted with OCD so we could understand. Well, as much as I love Nicholson, I hated Melvin Udall. The longer the movie went on, the more I rooted for Helen Hunt's character to just move away and not leave a forwarding address. My read of Nicholson's character was not, first and foremost, a sick man it was a total b******.Now, I know the idea of his character was an anti-hero who finds redemption. But I couldn't root for him, so he wasn't an anti-hero; what's more, at the end he wasn't redeemed-in fact he was rewarded for bad behavior. (I'm sorry, but OCD patients are not required to be offensive. Some of the behavior, such as locking the door and bringing one's own silverware, are true to OCD people. But finding any offensive remark to make about another person has nothing to do with OCD and everything to do with just being a caustic person.) He was still the same jerk, he just found someone willing to put up with it. Hooray for him.What I'm basically trying to say is that the movie didn't work for me-I feel that it fell short of its goal.

When I watch this film I'm constantly trying to find faults, I've looked at the goofs and haven't noticed them.  How he was able to move the camera in and out of the Hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me.  This movie was shot in 70 mil. It's a shame that Columbia hasn't released a Widescreen version of this on VHS.  I own a DVD player, and I'd take this over Titanic any day.  So Columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched! And I don't know what happened at the Oscars.  This should have swept Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Direction, best cinematography.  What films were they watching?  I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he did a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen.  They should have been giving a tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.

Though, as Philip Berry mentions - you do need to see it more than once.  I have seen it only twice, and feel like more viewings would be very helpful.  Having seen french, and other european films before( Like The Three Crowns of the Sailor, and Western ), I knew what I was in for plot- and direction-wise, and so was able to enjoy the film unhindered...Overall this was a very breathtakingly enjoyable movie...

The audience is introduced to a whole new language that describes the game and also given insight to the psychology of it as well.  Mr. Damon had to have done some serious prepa ration to handle the language and mind set of professional poker player.  He continue s to light up the screen with his boy next door good looks and his brazen honesty even in a character of mixed morals.  I guess that's what makes his performances so appealing.  Mr. Norton was excellent as well and has shown great latitude in his recent performances as well.  The relation ship between the two is well developed and interesting and they complement each other well.  Strong and weak, straight forward and shady, and smart and well not too smart (failed cunning) makes for an intere sting pair which in this case beats a full house.  I learned never to sit down at a poker table where I don't know everyone, but I enjoyed sitting in the theater watching this film and everyone else seemed to as well.  Once again thank you to Mr. Damon and Mr. Norton for their excellent perform ances. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 November 1998","score":"","review":"  Rounders was a learning experience.
