Lists after lists are made to elect the best horror movie of all time and this film always manage to get to the Top of almost every single list. Not only that it's also an very complex dramatic film with a compelling story. A story of a devoted mother to save her teen daughter of a strange possession.After finishing the filming of a movie the actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) finds herself with an awkward situation after her adorable daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave differently. She is taken to all the best doctors but nothing is found and doctors suspicion is that the kid may have a brain tumor. But after all the medical treatment fails and when Regan's starts to move frantically Chris is told to get a bigger help a priest to exorcise what possessed her daughter. Father Karras (Jason Miller, incredible acting in his film debut) is called, but he himself is a tormented man, who has recently loss his elderly mother, almost faithless and with few skills to perform an exorcism. Even with all that he agrees to see the girl who has increasingly gone worst. She vomits, masturbates with a crucifix and says countless bad words and profanation. Karras's verdict she's possessed by Pazuzu, a mysterious and powerful demon. But this demon has a weakness and this weakness is Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow in a very aged makeup), or better saying The Exorcist. Father Merrin knows everything about exorcisms and demons and he knows how to fight it. Even with all this knowledge (as it is showed in the beginning of the movie when he's in Iraq investigating an occurrence) you can feel that he has some fears, (his hands shaking) but he'll do everything to kill the demon and save the poor girl. The last 40 minutes with Karras and Merrin together performing the exorcism in that freezing and haunting bedroom is priceless, scary and the best horror moment of the 1970's. I must salute director William Friedkin for his efforts on present us a movie greater in its genre different of everything seen before. He was mean with actors to create realism but he get what he wanted and the audience was terrified by those images (Ellen Burstyn's face when she was thrown to the floor; Jason Miller's face after the vomit comes right into his face which wasn't supposed to happen). On the technical side of The Exorcist an interesting thing must be noticed all the horror moments are shown without music. This works really great, it's not a manipulated movie where a soundtrack must be added to create tension. And without the music it was much more scarier and fun to watch, listening to all the strange sounds created by the sound group (Won Oscar). Makeup effects and visual effects are stunning and many of it it's not dated or old-fashioned. Impressive! About the screenplay William Peter Blatty writer of the original book and the film's writer created a whole new thing here. The drama, the horror and even some humor are perfect. Although I think that some scenes, characters and clues aren't well explained, there's too much mystery. For example, we heard that the film director (Jack McGowran) died on the long stairs. This scene isn't showed and if it was it would be too frightening and unforgettable. After that the movie lover detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb, very good and funny) starts a investigation about the event. Then he gets some clues about many things he didn't even saw. The public may wonder how did he get to that evidence or clue. Two moments I would like to see or questions to be answered Who puts the crucifix under Regan's bed? And what happened to Father Merrin in that bedroom after he leaves Karras and exorcise the girl alone? Not only the technical team worked well. All the actors have fantastic performances Burstyn, Cobb, Miller, Sydow, Blair, even not professional actor the Reverend William O'Malley has a great performance here, and at last Mercedes McCambridge who plays the devil's voice (one thing I hated in the Portuguese dubbing version is that her voice was made by a man). Even being the biggest blockbuster of 1973 it only won 2 Academy Awards (Adapted Screenplay and Sound), and it deserved the award of Best Picture cause it was greater than The Sting. And it must get a higher rating on IMDb's Top 250 list. This movie is awesome, one of the very few horror movies to still shock me, to not be dated or cheesy. If you haven't watched yet or didn't find time to watch it run and buy it if you can. The power of this film compels you to watch it now and over again. Must see film for horror fans and for movie lovers just like Lt.

What I remembered clearly were the Russian roulette scenes. These are big gut grabbers, but when I started to think about them in more detail, I began to question why they were in there beyond their being attention getters. The only reason I can see is their being a metaphor for the random violence and killing of war--but we already knew that. The scenes do not make a lot of sense. The games were surrounded by much chaos and heavy betting. As presented it appeared that a given game was played until one of the players lost his life and, if the betting was on who won, then it would be a fifty-fifty bet and hardly a cause for such hooting and hollering. If the betting was on how long a game would last, then the distribution of wins and losses would be complicated and require the skill of a Vegas croupier to resolve. In any case the betters are seen throwing wads of money down into a pile on a table and I don't see how the money could ever have been properly split up among the winners. Given how much money Nick sent back to Steven the winner was apparently amply rewarded, but how he was paid off was not clear. By the time Michael catches up with him Nick's mind is so shot he does not even recognize his old friend, so how is it that Nick had the wherewithal to send money to Steven? If so, how did he arrange for that? Where were the betters getting all that money? The odds of Nick's winning as many times as implied would be astronomical. The bottom line for me was to find the Russian roulette scenes quite unbelievable and that undercut my appreciation of the whole movie, since those scenes are pivotal. And is it to be believed that Michael could find Nick in the total chaos of the fall of Saigon?The hunting scenes struck me as odd. Nowhere near Pennsylvania are there mountains like the ones in those scenes. Perhaps those scenes were a warning to the audience that a good deal of the movie is to be symbolic rather than realistic, but I found the scenes precursors to a disjointed sequencing that persisted throughout the remainder of the film. Some of the symbolism is a bit too obvious. For example, during Steven's wedding the bride and groom are asked to drink chalices of wine and if they can do so without spilling any, they will have good luck. Then we see some small droplets of wine spilled on the bride's gown, symbolizing the bloodshed to come.One thing that is well executed is the discrepancy between the youthful (perhaps played by actors not quite youthful enough) naivety of the three protagonists pre-war and the difficult post-war fallout. The bonding of the circle of the male friends pre-war had all of the maturity of early teens. By the end of the movie Nick was dead, Steven had lost his legs and was suffering mental and physical readjustments, and Michael, the strongest, was having his own problems reentering society. In fact the often puzzling reactions Michael had to returning home were for me the most moving scenes in the movie.A good part of the first act of the movie is an exceptionally beautiful filming of Steven's wedding in a Russian orthodox church. That segment is almost worth the price of admission by itself.I can't quarrel with the acting--the fine cast turns in quality performances. The editing is sometimes quite effective. After the wedding sequences we are abruptly put into the middle of the fighting in Vietnam; this emphasizes how the three friends must have viewed the transition. For those who lived through the Vietnam era, this movie will most likely bring back a lot of painful memories.I find that most good movies improve on second viewing. This was an exception for me.

These are big gut grabbers, but when I started to think about them in more detail, I began to question why they were in there beyond their being attention getters. The only reason I can see is their being a metaphor for the random violence and killing of war--but we already knew that. The scenes do not make a lot of sense. The games were surrounded by much chaos and heavy betting. As presented it appeared that a given game was played until one of the players lost his life and, if the betting was on who won, then it would be a fifty-fifty bet and hardly a cause for such hooting and hollering. If the betting was on how long a game would last, then the distribution of wins and losses would be complicated and require the skill of a Vegas croupier to resolve. In any case the betters are seen throwing wads of money down into a pile on a table and I don't see how the money could ever have been properly split up among the winners. Given how much money Nick sent back to Steven the winner was apparently amply rewarded, but how he was paid off was not clear. By the time Michael catches up with him Nick's mind is so shot he does not even recognize his old friend, so how is it that Nick had the wherewithal to send money to Steven? If so, how did he arrange for that? Where were the betters getting all that money? The odds of Nick's winning as many times as implied would be astronomical. The bottom line for me was to find the Russian roulette scenes quite unbelievable and that undercut my appreciation of the whole movie, since those scenes are pivotal. And is it to be believed that Michael could find Nick in the total chaos of the fall of Saigon?The hunting scenes struck me as odd. Nowhere near Pennsylvania are there mountains like the ones in those scenes. Perhaps those scenes were a warning to the audience that a good deal of the movie is to be symbolic rather than realistic, but I found the scenes precursors to a disjointed sequencing that persisted throughout the remainder of the film. Some of the symbolism is a bit too obvious. For example, during Steven's wedding the bride and groom are asked to drink chalices of wine and if they can do so without spilling any, they will have good luck. Then we see some small droplets of wine spilled on the bride's gown, symbolizing the bloodshed to come.One thing that is well executed is the discrepancy between the youthful (perhaps played by actors not quite youthful enough) naivety of the three protagonists pre-war and the difficult post-war fallout. The bonding of the circle of the male friends pre-war had all of the maturity of early teens. By the end of the movie Nick was dead, Steven had lost his legs and was suffering mental and physical readjustments, and Michael, the strongest, was having his own problems reentering society. In fact the often puzzling reactions Michael had to returning home were for me the most moving scenes in the movie.A good part of the first act of the movie is an exceptionally beautiful filming of Steven's wedding in a Russian orthodox church. That segment is almost worth the price of admission by itself.I can't quarrel with the acting--the fine cast turns in quality performances. The editing is sometimes quite effective. After the wedding sequences we are abruptly put into the middle of the fighting in Vietnam; this emphasizes how the three friends must have viewed the transition. For those who lived through the Vietnam era, this movie will most likely bring back a lot of painful memories.I find that most good movies improve on second viewing. This was an exception for me. I could not get beyond the improbabilities and emotional manipulations the second time around.

I felt as though the director was trying to make a movie, but failed to in an interesting way. None of the characters were interesting, well I do admit the only character I found interesting was the hitchhiker. I loved the way he was portrayed, and the way the actor was confident in his role enough to come out as a genuine loon. The rest of the cast, although they were good actors, the characters were poorly written, we didn't get to know them enough to form a temporary bond with them, therefore the movie fell flat around the 70 minute mark when I realized the director was only trying to fill his film with enough minutes to be classified as a movie. Having let loose the bad foundation this movie has been built over, I can honestly say there are some terrific elements that has been a blueprint for the future horror genre. Not only was the chase scene between Leatherface and Sally terrifying, it was exhausting to watch and exhilarating to experience. This particular scene will be glued to my mind for a while, and for the first time in 10 years I woke up in the middle of the night after watching this movie, due to a nightmare about this one scene. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in my honest opinion, would have done just fine as a short film. It was okay as a full length movie, but the story was a terrible fault of which the horror had to make up for. A great horror movie has not only gore, violence and horror, a great horror movie has a captivating plot and likable characters with some thrills thrown into the blender. This unfortunately, was only half of what makes a great horror film.

In this case it didn't, it was the beginning of a nightmare. But similar things do happen. You come to a location where someone else has power over you, someone who rips the situation and uses his power to hurt you in any way. I asked myself several times through the movie, what would I do, later, when I'm grown up, if I would be in such a situation as a child? I would desperately feel the need for some justice too, logically.Sleepers showed me from the beginning to the end, as an example and replacement to all similar stories, how the live of abused victims could turn out, and if you take revenge, crucify and kill the offender, it only eases your pain for a certain moment, but the wounds will never really heal.

In addition to critical opinions, it is ranked 33 in the top 250. I went into this film, fully expecting to be blown away by the acting, plot, storytelling, and music. I was none of these things. I have no complaints with the acting, and the story is told effectively through the use of flashback.The music is for the most part not bad, although it does not set the mood as effectively as the works of John Williams or Bernard Herrmann (Alfred Hitchcock), nor is it integral to the movie like the works of Danny Elfman (Tim Burton) or Enrico Morricone (Sergio Leone).

But when young Ross Malinger calls a radio psychologist played in voice only by Caroline Aaron about his father it sets off an entire chain of events that make you believe in fate.Tom Hanks is the recently widowed father of Malinger they've just finished burying his wife Carey Lowell and he thinks a change of scenery is in order to assuage his grief. Hanks and Malinger move to Seattle and its from their new home in Seattle that young Master Malinger makes his fateful call.

This movie shows us the harsh streets of Washington D.C. in a new way as it follows the young man Ray Joshua played by Saul Williams as he has to make the decision of his life. After going to prison for having illegal drugs on his person after witnessing a drive by shooting of his friend Ray is given the choice to either confess do the court, fight in court, or to rat out main people so that he will be set free. While in prison he meets the beautiful love interest Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn) a prison teacher who runs a poetry club in the prison. When he is free he seeks her out and learns how poetry can be used to express his feelings and his thoughts. The message of the movie is definitely one you will remember, just as long as you can relate to it and can get over the mediocre acting and cinematography.Ray is young man living in the slums of Washing D.C. and his main source of income is selling illegal drugs to the people in the ghetto. Ray also has a passion for the world of rap, throughout the movie he spits rhymes and says poems about how he feels or what's on his mind. Ray also does not show signs that he is part of the violence that torments the city, he minds his own business and even hangs out with kids and helps them with their own rhymes. But after witnessing his friend Big Mike (Lawrence Wilson) being shot in the head by a drive-by shooting, ray is caught by the police with the very drugs he used to sell. While in prison he sees the same violence inside the prison as well. He is later set free as one of the main gang leaders in the prison pays his bail, but then has the decision to make, to either confess to having the drugs so that he only serves a few years, to try t fight it in court and potentially risk more years, or snitch on some important people and possibly serve no time at all. We do not know what choice he makes which not only leaves a huge cliff hanger at the end of the movie but also leaves you with lack of discloser.Along with the lack of discloser there are a few more problems with the movie that could possibly steer you away from the main message. One of which is the plot that doesn't feel hundred percent complete, at one point in the film Ray convinces Big Mike to lay down his weapons and not seek revenge, but after he does that part of the story is completely dropped, like it was just added to lengthen the film a bit longer then an actual plot point. The terrible acting and cinematography that take you out of the film, it almost feels like it was done by a high budget high school.

Yet when the 1943 awards were handed out, this movie only received a Best Supporting Actress & that in spite of the big budget color feature this was. The busy cast of this movie is quite an accomplishment in itself. Gary Cooper & Ingrid Bergman were shooting Saratoga Trunk this year too though that movie would not be released until a couple of years later. They came to this movie at Paramount almost straight from their work at Warner Brothers. Sam Wood who directs this one also directed them in Saratoga Trunk. These 3 working together so soon should have really provided the spark. What happened is now legend.While over at Warner Brothers, before doing Saratoga Trunk, Bergman did a little assembly line black & white picture with Humphrey Bogart known as Casablanca. That little black & white film which Bergman did not particularly like, trumped this movie at the awards. Even the great writing of Ernest Hemingway could not beat the day to day writing of some lesser known assembly line writers of the other picture.It is interesting how in this color feature, Gary Cooper looks younger & better than he does in the black & white Saratoga Trunk where he looks older. Maybe he had a bad make-up man in that film? This is a mystery. Bergman looks great in every movie. Imagine though in a short span of three years, Bergman works in two Sam Wood movies, does SpellBound with Alfred Hitchcock, & yet today is most remembered for the movie she liked the least, Casablanca. The irony of this just shows how life can achieve greatness by accident. If Bergman had skipped the Bogart film, you wonder what the result of these other fine works she did would be.In For Whom The Bell Tolls, Bergman is just as fine with Cooper as she is in Saratoga Trunk, though Trunk is more of Ingrid's Gone With The Wind Performance. Sam Wood is a fine Director, who did a good variety of films. While these Cooper-Bergman films are an accomplishment, his most remembered directing effort today might just be that comedy known as A Night At The Opera. Just imagine Wood's resume without that crown jewel though this effort is outstanding. The Bell Tolls for thee,& since these people answered the bell, they have a lot of good work.

Paramount & the author were very happy with the film. It was nominated for Best Picture & 8 Oscars all told. Yet when the 1943 awards were handed out, this movie only received a Best Supporting Actress & that in spite of the big budget color feature this was. The busy cast of this movie is quite an accomplishment in itself. Gary Cooper & Ingrid Bergman were shooting Saratoga Trunk this year too though that movie would not be released until a couple of years later. They came to this movie at Paramount almost straight from their work at Warner Brothers. Sam Wood who directs this one also directed them in Saratoga Trunk. These 3 working together so soon should have really provided the spark. What happened is now legend.While over at Warner Brothers, before doing Saratoga Trunk, Bergman did a little assembly line black & white picture with Humphrey Bogart known as Casablanca. That little black & white film which Bergman did not particularly like, trumped this movie at the awards. Even the great writing of Ernest Hemingway could not beat the day to day writing of some lesser known assembly line writers of the other picture.It is interesting how in this color feature, Gary Cooper looks younger & better than he does in the black & white Saratoga Trunk where he looks older. Maybe he had a bad make-up man in that film? This is a mystery. Bergman looks great in every movie. Imagine though in a short span of three years, Bergman works in two Sam Wood movies, does SpellBound with Alfred Hitchcock, & yet today is most remembered for the movie she liked the least, Casablanca. The irony of this just shows how life can achieve greatness by accident. If Bergman had skipped the Bogart film, you wonder what the result of these other fine works she did would be.In For Whom The Bell Tolls, Bergman is just as fine with Cooper as she is in Saratoga Trunk, though Trunk is more of Ingrid's Gone With The Wind Performance. Sam Wood is a fine Director, who did a good variety of films. While these Cooper-Bergman films are an accomplishment, his most remembered directing effort today might just be that comedy known as A Night At The Opera. Just imagine Wood's resume without that crown jewel though this effort is outstanding. The Bell Tolls for thee,& since these people answered the bell, they have a lot of good work. Imagine Gary Cooper's career without High Noon, which is really his crown jewel. Once again, this is an excellent film, still it has not been the crown jewel of anybodies career except for Ernest Hemingway. It is the best screen play of his best novel.

As a matter of fact, I find it alternately fascinating, hilarious and simply bizarre.We all know the shots of the cardboard graves moving, the night into day into night sequences, the ridiculously human and effeminate aliens, the tin foil flying saucers, the ludicrous replacement of Lugosi (who died during the filming) for a lookalike -- the obviously younger and taller Tom Mason, chiropractor.I've seen this film at least seven times and I would watch it again and again.The presence of the foppish and hammy Criswell is a big plus. For me, the scene where Duke Moore as police lieutenant scratching his head with the barrel of his revolver is priceless.And say what you will about the talentless Wood, the images of Tor Johnson and Maila Nurmi as Vampire Girl walking through the graveyard are veritable horror icons, right up there with Karloff as Frankenstein's monster and even Lon Chaney in his London After Midnight makeup.I don't know if we needed Wood's story told in a movie, but Ed Wood seems to lovingly record so many of the quirks of Wood's life. And Martin Landau's performance as Lugosi is uncanny.Personally, I get a bigger kick out of the actual documentaries about Ed. Look Back In Angora is a telling portrait of the frustrated movie director\/cross-dresser.What Wood lacked in talent he more than made up for in sheer will and a great love of horror movies.I believe the public became aware of Ed Wood when the Medved brothers proclaimed Plan 9 as the worst movie ever made in their Golden Turkey award book on bad films.I've watched most of Ed Wood's films and find them all pretty terrible. Bride of the Monster is almost as fun as Plan 9. Night of the Ghouls and Orgy of the Dead are truly rotten.

Tracy takes his little fishing boat farther out than usual, lands a giant marlin after a fierce three-day struggle, and then loses his trophy to the sharks who tear the great fish to pieces, leaving only the head, spine, and tail.If it get off to something of a slow start, it nevertheless involves us in Tracy's fate all the way. There are lyrical interludes while Tracy watches the birds, the flying fish, the porpoises, and dreams of lions on the African shore. He follows the baseball in the newspapers and admires Joe DiMaggio.And the battles are monumental. Tracy has to fight the huge marlin, then the multitude of sharks that attack it, and -- constantly -- his own age and fatigue. The viewer gets to feel the desperation behind all of these contests. Tracy pulls it off with the help of Dmitri Tiomkin's somewhat bombastic score, with its echoes of Rio Bravo and High Noon. There are three problems though. First, modern viewers have been spoiled by recent advances in special effects and process work. The marlin, seen up close, looks like the rubber bladder it is, even when disguised by the blurry image representing Tracy's dizziness. After it's been stripped by the sharks, the spine looks like a lead pipe bought at the local plumber's, with a few plastic ribs attached. The scenes of the marlin leaping out of the sea aren't well integrated with the studio footage.Second -- and let's face facts -- Big Ernie doesn't translate well to the screen. His bare-bones attempts at thought-provoking folk poetry come across as stilted and sometimes risible.Tracy (to himself) Do not blame the hand. It is not the hand's fault.

He is not a Cuban bartender; he is not strong and has no aficion. Most of all, there is a problem with Spencer Tracy, an actor whom I deeply admire. Even my crude Irish stepfather from Charlestown who never had a sensitive thought in his life, was once moved to say, Y'know, he's a good-lookin' guy. I don't mean handsome, but manly.

I'm certain I've read somewhere that Hemingway was among the spectators at the arm wrestling contest flashback but I'm not sure it's true.Despite these deficiencies, the author, the cast and crew pull it off. Hemingway had Hispanic fatalism down pat. In the face of what we would call bad luck, they become Stoics. That Olympian generalization isn't mine. A Latin American professor devoted an entire lecture to it. It's a moving and tragic story touching on Hemingway's familiar themes of pride and defeat.

After Eddie was kicked out his home by his mother Jack and his partner Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) takes Eddie under their collective wing. Eddie quickly makes friends with porn actors Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack convinces Eddie to become a porn actor himself. Eddie renames himself Dirk Digger and he quickly becomes one of the biggest name porn stars around. Eddie\/Dirk believes in Jack ideal of telling a proper story in his porn films. But fame is a fickle thing with the porn industry changing and Eddie\/Dirk's own person problems pushing him back.Anderson shows his talent as a director early on in the film with an amazing opening sequence with was a 3 minute long continuous shot. He expertly handles the drama, showing both a colourful party side to the late 70s\/early 80s to more darker elements which was bound to happen considering it's plot. Anderson perfectly treads a fine line between comedy and tragedy. Anderson mixes in a lot of style to his film with some well handed shots, excellent cinematography and some stylist camera tricks. There was an strong influence from Martin Scorsese behind this film. The plot does have a similar to films like Scarface and Goodfellas where the protagonist starts from a low point to getting fame, money and power to them losing it because of their own arrogance. Boogie Nights is also shot in a similar style to those two films and the ending was a little like Raging Bull, but Anderson's skill made it seem more like a homage then directly coping those films. Anderson mixes in a few themes into his film one being an very unorthodox way to fulfil the American Dream and use what ever asset you have available to you. They is of course an in-depth look into the plot industry with Anderson showing that whilst some actors may have a tough or unusual background they were willing and happy within the industry and Jack is made out to be a more noble type of director, wanting to at least tell a story in his films. There is also a darker look into why people get involved and the world of excess that inhabited this world but Anderson was darning to show some sort of a positive spin. Anderson also tackles how the porn industry changed in this period and became more of horrid mass produced product.There is a great cast in this film. Wahlberg, Reilly, Reynolds, Moore, Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy and Robert Ridgely, all offer good performances. Wahlberg is of course very good in the lead role and his character grows and changes throughout the film and showed the emerging talent he was about to become. Boogie Nights was easily Reynolds and Graham's best film, showing the two are good actors, showing their dark side in the process. Moore and Reynolds were very believable in the mentor role of the film and that Moore's character was filled with heartbreak and tragedy. There were simple, powerful scenes in the film involving some of the characters, such as between Reynolds and Ridgely in prison, a wonderfully handled scene and a small scene with Hoffman crying in his car, a bitter, raw scene that was very real.

With his first major film Paul Thomas Anderson uses this period as a backdrop for his wonderfully told drama.Eddie (Mark Wahlberg) was a 17-year-old high school dropout, working as a dishwasher at a small nightclub. Eddie is spotted by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who hears that the kid was well endowed. After Eddie was kicked out his home by his mother Jack and his partner Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) takes Eddie under their collective wing. Eddie quickly makes friends with porn actors Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack convinces Eddie to become a porn actor himself. Eddie renames himself Dirk Digger and he quickly becomes one of the biggest name porn stars around. Eddie\/Dirk believes in Jack ideal of telling a proper story in his porn films. But fame is a fickle thing with the porn industry changing and Eddie\/Dirk's own person problems pushing him back.Anderson shows his talent as a director early on in the film with an amazing opening sequence with was a 3 minute long continuous shot. He expertly handles the drama, showing both a colourful party side to the late 70s\/early 80s to more darker elements which was bound to happen considering it's plot. Anderson perfectly treads a fine line between comedy and tragedy. Anderson mixes in a lot of style to his film with some well handed shots, excellent cinematography and some stylist camera tricks. There was an strong influence from Martin Scorsese behind this film. The plot does have a similar to films like Scarface and Goodfellas where the protagonist starts from a low point to getting fame, money and power to them losing it because of their own arrogance. Boogie Nights is also shot in a similar style to those two films and the ending was a little like Raging Bull, but Anderson's skill made it seem more like a homage then directly coping those films. Anderson mixes in a few themes into his film one being an very unorthodox way to fulfil the American Dream and use what ever asset you have available to you. They is of course an in-depth look into the plot industry with Anderson showing that whilst some actors may have a tough or unusual background they were willing and happy within the industry and Jack is made out to be a more noble type of director, wanting to at least tell a story in his films. There is also a darker look into why people get involved and the world of excess that inhabited this world but Anderson was darning to show some sort of a positive spin. Anderson also tackles how the porn industry changed in this period and became more of horrid mass produced product.There is a great cast in this film. Wahlberg, Reilly, Reynolds, Moore, Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy and Robert Ridgely, all offer good performances. Wahlberg is of course very good in the lead role and his character grows and changes throughout the film and showed the emerging talent he was about to become. Boogie Nights was easily Reynolds and Graham's best film, showing the two are good actors, showing their dark side in the process. Moore and Reynolds were very believable in the mentor role of the film and that Moore's character was filled with heartbreak and tragedy. There were simple, powerful scenes in the film involving some of the characters, such as between Reynolds and Ridgely in prison, a wonderfully handled scene and a small scene with Hoffman crying in his car, a bitter, raw scene that was very real. Hoffman is one of the best character actors in Hollywood.An excellent film that shows American film-making at its best.

Basically seventeen year old Jim Stark (BAFTA nominated James Dean) has moved to Los Angeles and is enrolling at Dawson High School, and he has a habit for getting into trouble, he and his family have moved before. The film opens with Jim arrested for public drunkenness, and he is allowed to open up to the questioning officer while waiting for his father Frank (Jim Backus), his mother Carol (Ann Doran) and his Grandmother (Virginia Brissac). He is let go, and we next see him attending school, where he meets new friend John 'Plato' Crawford (Oscar nominated Sal Mineo) and Judy (Oscar nominated Natalie Wood). But he also meets the tough ones who see him as the new threat and outsider, led by Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen), with his gang members, including Goon (young Dennis Hopper in his first big screen role). After getting in a serious switchblade fight with Buzz, Jim agrees with Buzz to participate in a chickie run, where the first person to jump out of a speeding car before going over a cliff is the coward. Buzz loses this battle, and his girlfriend Judy believes that someone grassed to the police when they start searching for her, Jim and Plato. It all comes to a head with Plato getting really agitated with a gun, he winds up shutting himself in the Griffith Observatory, and when he does come out, he is gunned down for refusing to drop the gun, and all Jim can do is introduce Judy to his family. Also starring William Hopper as Judy's Father and Rochelle Hudson as Judy's Mother. The phrase live fast, die young was coined on Dean's behalf, other actors with this title include River Phoenix and Heath Ledger, people speculate whether they, Dean especially, would be as popular as they are with more films, I think it is likely they would. It is also really ironic that we see Dean speeding in a car in the film, and that is exactly how he died at just twenty-four, oh, and his car parts have been locked away as they are believed to be cursed, killing many other victims. Anyway, Dean is brilliant as the troubled teen, the supporting cast are all great too, and there are some really memorable moments in what is quite clearly a classic (teen) drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. James Dean was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, he was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 59 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Most of the time we tend to keep things to ourselves and hope that it will wash away, but others use different methods to release those situations and let people know what it is that's happening and what is the solution. In the movie Slam directed by Marc Levin and written by Marc Levin and Sonja Sohn is a story that takes those situations and turn them into spoken word poetry. The movie is about a young black man named Ray Joshua played by Saul Williams, living in Washington DC that hustles in the streets selling weed while he has a bunch of rap verses running in his mind. When he is caught by the cops and is in jail for an amount of time, he discovers the poet in him with the help of a woman he falls in love named Lauren Bell played by Sonja Sohn. While in jail, he makes a decision to not get involved with murder and drugs anymore for the reason that he wants to change. Lauren Bell is a poet and performs at different Spoken Word cafés and when Ray Joshua gets released from jail, he goes out and finds her and she introduces him to Spoke Word poetry. This film does critique many things about society. The movie shows the gangs and drugs movement in our urban society. It also shows how one person can change the outcome of many people. Many things define Ray Joshua for example the streets and all of the drug problems. While in jail, he decides to change and quit the gang but he is sucked in back by force by the gang leader in jail. But after many things, he succeeds in getting out of the gang and making a change in his life and the other gang members. Stealing us was the smartest thing they ever did. This film shows many things and suggests us to take considerations in many aspects in our society. One of the things that this film is trying to get to us is that if we look deep in our hearts and we find our true selves, we could make the right choices. I strongly recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if they are into poetry. It also might change your views on society.

Sylvester stallone, Talia shire, Burt young, Carl weathers and introducing Dolph lundgren all star once again in Rocky 4. This movie takes place a little after the third movie after Rocky had just faced for what has to be his most powerful opponent Clubber lang. A Russian fighter by the name of Ivan drago (Dolph lundgren) comes to America with his wife and the Russian politicians. Rocky's now good friend Apollo creed wants to fight this new Russian because he feels that the russians are trying to make them look bad. Apollo believes that once your a fighter that is who you are and people can't change. Rocky doesn't really like the idea of Apollo fighting Drago right away because they know nothing about him.Apollo decides to make one hell of an entrance before his fight with Drago but in the end he won't be making much of an exit. Drago kills apollo literally in the second round and rocky goes into another depression and he decides to fight Drago in Russia and of course Adrain (Talia shire) disapproves because she saw what Drago is capable of. Rocky said that he's a fighter and thats the way he's made and he goes to Russia without Adrian and brings Paulie (Burt young) and tony duke(Apollo's trainer Tony burton) and Duke trains rocky in Russia.Rocky has no real equipment in Russia and Rocky trains ghetto like sawing wood and chopping down trees and running up a mountain while Drago on the other hand has all the high tech equipment and sparring partners and he takes steroids. Adrian eventually comes down to Russia to support rocky. The biggest fight of rocky's life is now on and at first the Russian fans boo and jeer at rocky but it wasn't until they saw rocky's determination and heart that they started cheering for him.Really good 4th entry in the series and this had my favorite music. Dolph lundgren was very intimidating and mysterious as the Russian fighter Ivan drago. Yeah this movie was probably the most unrealistic in the series but thats what makes it fun.
