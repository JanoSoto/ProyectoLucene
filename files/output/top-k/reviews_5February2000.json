[{"date":"5 February 2000","score":"","review":"  Alexander Payne's brilliant examination of an election at a public high school in Nebraska.  His story involves an over achiever, a vengeful teacher, a brain-less jock, and his lesbian sister.  Got that?  The whole point of the film being, anyone who has a goal and wants it badly enough will attain it, even if it means stepping on a few people on the way up. Released way back in May, I've seen it four times and each time I think to myself, what great film making.  Will offend most people because of the adult content, but it's necessary for such a truthful and poignant story. ****  out of four ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2000","score":"","review":"  Alexander Payne's brilliant examination of an election at a public high school in Nebraska.
