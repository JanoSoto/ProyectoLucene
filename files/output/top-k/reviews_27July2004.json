Fans go on about how hard it was on them, but consider Paramount and Viacom for a moment. Suddenly, their sacred cash cow was gone, and the Next Generation series, which was in its fourth season by the time the original crew were put out to pasture, was not living up to the enormous international sensation it followed.When the first Star Trek feature film was released, it dared to do something different by offering a very scientific and researched future. Sound effects in space were kept to a minimum, gadgets were barely used, leave alone acknowledged, and the focus was almost entirely upon human drama. It might have presented one of the most unbelievable scenarios a science fiction film has ever been based on, but it grounded that scenario in just enough reality to make it work. Which is where Generations ultimately loses the plot.The whole opening of Generations just cheapens the end of The Undiscovered Country. The original cast got a beautiful send-off with a major Roddenberrian goal accomplished, their signatures recorded on film, and their model spacecraft riding off into the sunset. It was a high note that could never be equalled. But some moron at Paramount thought let's bring back some of the old cast and do a crossover, it will make a fortune. Given that Scotty seems to have adopted the mode of speech associated with Spock, it is quite apparent Leonard Nimoy told Paramount he'd rather do something that qualifies as creative. As one critic said, let them go people, it's only a TV show.Like Insurrection, Generations shoots itself in the foot by basing itself on a classically uninteresting premise. A wave of cosmic energy sweeps through the universe, and those who come into contact with it are trapped within their own unreal fantasy land until they can get out of it. Putting aside the premise of locational heroin for a moment, it doesn't bode well that this is pretty much all I can remember about this dull, uninteresting film. Given the adventures that Kirk has had in previous outings, to rewrite his history so that he goes out on a note like this is insulting to those who paid good money to see the previous six films.I'll admit it, I've never found the Next Generation cast a tenth as interesting as the Original Series cast. But that is hardly a fault of the cast. Patrick Stewart has floored me before as Charles Xavier in both of the recent X-Men films, so it isn't like he is incapable of making a well-written role work. Marina Sirtis almost screams that she could do so much more with a better-written part. As for Malcolm McDowell, well, this is the guy who made a name for himself in one of the most controversial adaptations of all time. He certainly can't have too many agents left to fire.In the end, Generations suffers from exactly the same problem as the TNG series. Too much gloss, not enough cerebral activity. Again, scientific credibility is stretched to its limits. When Kirk is sucked into the Nexus, the idea that he is the only one to go is laughable at best. What makes the rest of the film fail is that the writer and director don't seem to realize that a feature film is not a two-hour television episode. One cannot rely on endless scenes of people sitting down and conversing to carry the film, but this is exactly what they try to do. It is for that reason that this load of swill, which would have been much better as a three-episode arc in the television series, gets a one out of ten from me. It isn't the worst in the series by a long shot, but it comes off that way when all the penalties are tallied up.

For those who are fans of extraordinary acting, strong characters, a great plot and priceless dialogue--it just doesn't get any better than this!  When I say you're in for a treat, I mean it with the utmost certainty.  Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey are on my list of favorite actors.  The rest of the cast isn't quite on there, but they're all actors that I highly admire and some of which come close to being on my favorites list.  First of all, it's hard to not be at least somewhat interested by a film written by David Mamet.  He is simply the master when it comes to pacing and sharp dialogue.  He truly has a style like no other.  There's a million lines in this movie that I love to quote, many of which are in Alec Baldwin's opening speech.  F**k you, that's my name.  You came here in a Hyundai, I drive a 80,000-dollar Oldsmobile--that's my name.  And Kevin Spacey's Go to lunch speech is great as well.  Every time I watch that scene I think back to when he read those same lines with a student on Inside the Actor's Studio.  Mamet's dialogue is delivered a lightning-fast pace, which I find fascinating.  It makes you feel like you're watching an old movie, only in color and with an abundance of cuss words.  This film brought tears to my eyes, not because it's incredibly sad, but because it's so intense.  Watching actors like Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon share a scene is like a dream for any true film buff.  Lemmon gave one of the best performances of his entire film career in this movie, and that's saying a whole lot!  Needless to say, we suffered a tragic loss when he died.  It's a surprise that he didn't receive an Oscar for his work in Glengarry.  Pacino also gives one of his best performances, in my opinion.  In his recent films like The Recruit and Simone, he hasn't gotten the chance to show off his acting chops to the fullest extent.  His performance in this movie is an example of Pacino in full gear.  Spacey is perfectly slimy in his role, and I despised him every minute he was on screen.  Everyone who's ever had a job is familiar with some secretary or assistant manager, who's uptight and constantly plays by-the-book, just so he can maintain the respect of the boss whose butt he kisses every minute of the day.  We've all encountered scumb*gs like him, and that's why it made it so easy for me to hate his guts.  Every character is multi-dimensional, and I was able to feel either a deep sympathy or a deep hatred towards each of them.  Some have criticized this film for being visually unimpressive, since it takes place mainly on one location.  That didn't bother me one bit.  When you have actors this engaging, setting is definitely not the issue.  People always feel that when a play is adapted onto screen, it has to take place in many different locations, to take advantage of it being a motion picture.  I always feel that good writing and good acting are the key elements of a good movie.  If you want to see great visuals, go rent the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy.  But for those begging for something of substance should love this movie.  I'm constantly on the edge-of-my-seat when I watch this movie.

I watched the trailer several times but never got to see 'Donnie Darko' in the theaters. But on March 19, 2002, 'Donnie Darko' was released on DVD; I immediately ran out and bought a copy of the film. From that day on I have been hooked on the film. I must have seen the film at least 20 times since then and I was very happy to be able to see the Director's Cut on the big screen.'Donnie Darko' is a very hard movie to explain mainly because everyone thoughts on the film are different. Heck my theories about the film change from time to time after repeated viewings. But the basic premise is this Donnie Darko is a troubled high school student. He is seeing a shrink because he sees an imaginary 6-foot tall evil looking rabbit named Frank. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end unless he stops it. The movie then follows Donnie through paths of destruction and violent behavior, during this time Donnie himself is trying to figure out what is going on and if Frank is real or just messing around with his head. A lot of thought provoking content, an interesting and unique story, and a what the hell ending ensue&#133;'Donnie Darko The Director's Cut' is 20 minutes longer than the original cut released to theaters in 2001. What I liked about the directors cut was the fact that it added footage that helped the audience try to understand the film better. The added 20 minutes surprisingly does not contain an alternate beginning or ending. It's just footage that will help the audience understand the film better and the main part of that which helped the most in my opinion was to show chapters of the Philosophy of Time Travel book that Donnie reads in the film. If you have seen the film because and really enjoyed it, I suggest that you check out the director's cut. If you haven't seen the film, I advise you watch the directors cut before you watch the DVD version. The cast of 'Donnie Darko' is great. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the Donnie Darko character perfectly and this is a great Jake Gyllenhaal role not like his newer mainstream roles in crap like 'The Day After Tomorrow' & 'Lovely and Amazing'. I liked the Donnie Darko character because he was weird, lonely, and interesting. I think Jake did a great job of playing a psycho teenager. Jena Malone plays Donnie's love interest Gretchen. Jena Malone like usual is wonderful in the role. She plays the lonely new girl perfectly. Her character was a very sad and had a very disturbing background story. As for the smaller roles, Patrick Swayze stars as the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham. He as well plays the 'Fear' guru perfectly. Not to forget Jake Gyllenhaal's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars as Donnie's hip sister. The film also stars Drew Barrymore, Holmes Osbourne, Mary McDonnell, and Beth Grant all of which whom are near perfect in the roles they played. Casting was really perfect for this film. Although at the time this was released most of the cast seemed unknown. Richard Kelly was the director and writer of the film. Again Richard Kelly is one of the many first time writer\/director who has made a terrific film on his first try. Richard Kelly knows how to write a thought-provoking movie. The script was fresh and original. The script also contained drama, comedy, and horror. I liked how Mr. Kelly created a film which was interesting and unique story. I like the fact that you as many times as you see the film you have a different opinion on it and is a good movie to chat about with friends. I also liked that Donnie Darko was a touching movie because you really felt the emotions of its characters. Richard Kelly caught the emotions of these characters and the pain and suffering of them as well. I also like how the movie featured a love story, which was never over the top and sappy. I really liked what Richard Kelly did with script and his direction of the film. I particularly like how Richard Kelly chose to shoot the film in a late 80s settings. I think it really helped out for the tone of the film. 'Donnie Darko' is a near perfect masterpiece, which is always just as good each time I view the film. I however feel that the director's cut is a bit better than the original release for the reasons I previously stated. I highly recommend 'Donnie Darko' to all people who like to think when they are watching a movie. I recommend it to people who like originality when watching a movie.

Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.At its heart, Return Of The Jedi is the story of one boy who has (finally) grown into a man, and started to face his destiny. He starts off in this by demonstrating that he has mastered one aspect of the Force, in that he can reliably use its powers to his advantage. After doing so, he is told by one of his old mentors that he is just about to face the real test of resisting the temptation to use it in an overtly evil fashion. It's painfully oversimple at times, and sadly indicative of Lucas' tendency to see everything in black and white, but it works.What makes it work is not Lucas' creative direction, but rather the input of others. The climactic phase of the duel on the new Death Star is a perfect example of this. Here, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill, John Williams, and Richard Marquand all band together to deliver a performance that, in 1983, had every audience member holding their hands over their mouths in sheer tense panic at what they thought was happening. When it twists and turns back and forth to its climax, the surprise factor is enough to make the audience forget that it really is clichéd to an extreme. In other words, it works.It also highlights one thing that Lucas seems to have forgotten in the past twenty-two years. Namely that in any film, regardless of its theme, the human performance element is always the most important. In contrast to later films, the majority of what the viewer sees here was built on a set and could be interacted with in front of the camera while the film was being shot. In simpler language, the performances have more impact because the actors aren't struggling to plant themselves in the reality of a scene where they are almost the only things on the set.Another area where Return Of The Jedi excels is its sense of humour. The numerous booby traps and improvised war machines improvised by the Ewoks deliver some well-timed laughs. Peter Mayhew must have been glad at this time to not be the only person on the shoot who had to struggle with being covered head to foot in fur, too. Matter of fact, it seems the entire cast is more relaxed this time around.If there is one problem with the film, it is that dialogue which would have helped the human element of the story to some degree has mostly been left out. Questions like what Yoda would think of his last student going on such a major rampage against an admittedly despicable crime figure, for instance, are never answered.Delving for a minute into another slight problem, the special edition improvements were just a bit unnecessary. One has to wonder what the crew who invested countless hours into making the puppetry work for the musical number in Jabba's palace thought of the new number. Putting aside the annoying performers for a second, the number they chose is really awful. It seems we are going to have two competing visions of the future, music-wise. Lucas appears to support the Backstreet Boys version. Seriously, the number in the palace is so clichéd and predictable you can predict every repeated line without having heard the song before. Give me Basil and Zoë Poledouris' number in StarShip Troopers, any day.Overall, however, I felt Return Of The Jedi was worthy of nine out of ten. It was a slight improvement over A New Hope, and a slight letdown after The Empire Strikes Back. However, even compared independently of the prequels, it is a fun ride that involves a little higher thought on the part of the viewer, which is always a good thing.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"27 July 2004","score":"","review":"  By 1983, the market had become so saturated with Star Wars and science fiction clones that programs were beginning to fail left and right. Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.At its heart, Return Of The Jedi is the story of one boy who has (finally) grown into a man, and started to face his destiny. He starts off in this by demonstrating that he has mastered one aspect of the Force, in that he can reliably use its powers to his advantage. After doing so, he is told by one of his old mentors that he is just about to face the real test of resisting the temptation to use it in an overtly evil fashion. It's painfully oversimple at times, and sadly indicative of Lucas' tendency to see everything in black and white, but it works.What makes it work is not Lucas' creative direction, but rather the input of others. The climactic phase of the duel on the new Death Star is a perfect example of this. Here, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill, John Williams, and Richard Marquand all band together to deliver a performance that, in 1983, had every audience member holding their hands over their mouths in sheer tense panic at what they thought was happening. When it twists and turns back and forth to its climax, the surprise factor is enough to make the audience forget that it really is clichéd to an extreme. In other words, it works.It also highlights one thing that Lucas seems to have forgotten in the past twenty-two years. Namely that in any film, regardless of its theme, the human performance element is always the most important. In contrast to later films, the majority of what the viewer sees here was built on a set and could be interacted with in front of the camera while the film was being shot. In simpler language, the performances have more impact because the actors aren't struggling to plant themselves in the reality of a scene where they are almost the only things on the set.Another area where Return Of The Jedi excels is its sense of humour. The numerous booby traps and improvised war machines improvised by the Ewoks deliver some well-timed laughs. Peter Mayhew must have been glad at this time to not be the only person on the shoot who had to struggle with being covered head to foot in fur, too.

Therefore, I'll say up front, that I have no idea how true this is to the source material; if it is, however, I might consider trying to to find some of the comics, or look for some form of release for the series. It's pretty entertaining, considering that it's a B-movie-like gore-packed bloody horror film, that can easily be classified as corny and maybe even lame. I heard someone comparing this to From Dusk Till Dawn; you could say that they are somewhat similar, but I think this has much more emphasis on the blood and gore than Rodriguez\/Tarantino's film has, which has far more action and one-liners than actual violence(it barely has any violence in the first half, whereas this has violence about 15 minutes into the film). The plot is fairly good, for a film of this genre, and moves along damn fast; if you don't pay attention, you'll most likely miss something. Of course, that's just want the film wants your attention for 90 minutes of gory, bloody, violent fun; nothing more, nothing less. The acting and characters are about as good as they come for this genre(the little-to-no-point-apart-from-as-much-violence-in-as-little-time-as-possible genre).

All in all, an enjoyable little gory film to put on if you've got nothing else to do, and you need to kill 90 minutes without being bored.

Oh GOD, is this movie long and drawn out. By the end of the movie, I was so happy it was over, that I didn't care what had happened. I was just glad to hear that great theme song, which is the only thing that is great about the movie. It's a good movie at best and I would only recommend this to people who feel the need to see some of Oscars worst picks. I believe this is based on a true story about the 1924 British Olympic Team that apparently was an underdog story. The movie is sooooo uninspiring though, that I really don't care to look up anything about the factual story. The plot is slow, confusing and most of all BORING!!! I could see where it was trying to show the struggles of the athletes and their conflicts, but the acting was so poor for a movie of this stature, that it just hurt to watch for 2 verrrrrry long hours. One thing I was inspired to look up was the filmography of the unknown main actors in this movie and to no surprise are the lists unimpressive. I was not shocked to see that any of the top 4 actors listed have done nothing before or since the movie came out in 1981 and Chariots of Fire is the only recognizably impressive thing on all their lists. The beginning of the movie is confusing and sorting out the characters is more of a challenge than the one the athlete's go through in the movie. The plot and story continue to be uninspiring and the great moments which are far and few between are missed b\/c of how drawn out things are to get to them. The only great aspect of this movie is the theme song and it is not played enough to save the movie. But here's something strange We have a movie set in the 20's with music that has synthesizers from the 80's. Throughout the movie, I'm thinking, This was set in the 20's right? So even though the music is great, it really sticks out like a very sore thumb when you hear it in a TWENTIES timepiece.The scenery throughout the movie is good also but we don't watch a movie b\/c it has a great view of a person running on a mountainside. When I found out this movie came out the same year as Raiders of the Lost Ark, my jaw hit the floor. There is no way this was the best picture of 1981 and it is proof that some years, the Oscar idiots don't even come close. I have a theory that you can sometimes pick the most Jewish picture and it will win the award. I would bet that this holds true for 1981. B\/c one of the characters has a Jewish background, it ended up winning. I know it's a stupid theory, but it works sometimes and holds water when a movie like this is picked over a much more entertaining and pleasurable movie like Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie is good, not great. It's overrated and never deserved an Oscar for best picture. The only Oscar it deserved was best original score and it won that. Justice was not served in the others that it won and I can only imagine what great movies were overlooked that year.

Whilst this first film was dark and creepy, with a decent plot, the following five were awful.In the very first Hellraiser movie, we are introduced to Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman or Oliver Smith depending upon state of decomposition) who, upon messing with a magical little golden box, is tortured by the Cenobites, masters of pleasure and pain.

Returned to the real world in a half reconstructed state, Frank convinces Larry's wife (and Frank's lover) Julia (Clare Higgins) to help him to recover and escape once and for all from the Cenobites.Whilst Hellraiser is an original idea, it's by no means the best horror film ever. Compared with more extreme horror's like recent classic The Ring (2002) and the influx of recent zombie movies, Hellraiser is mild and irrelevant. This does not make it a bad film however. This film is a well constructed, gruesome little piece which screws with your mind and is likely to give a lot of people nightmares. Clive Barker is arguably in the top three horror writers of all time (the others being Wes Craven and Stephen King perhaps) and his other major series, Candyman (1992) is another brilliant well constructed idea.

Whilst Doug Bradley is the only consistent actor throughout the series (playing head Cenobite Pinhead), in this first piece, Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins perform well as Larry and Julia Cotton, Higgins in particular showing how Julia's character changes as she flexes her morals more and more for Frank.To summarise, Hellraiser is not quite your typical horror movie. Adding an element of thinking to a gore filled piece, Barker has created a well thought out film. It's not the best, personally my preference is for the early Friday The 13th movies, but that doesn't make it a bad film.

Whilst Doug Bradley is the only consistent actor throughout the series (playing head Cenobite Pinhead), in this first piece, Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins perform well as Larry and Julia Cotton, Higgins in particular showing how Julia's character changes as she flexes her morals more and more for Frank.To summarise, Hellraiser is not quite your typical horror movie. Adding an element of thinking to a gore filled piece, Barker has created a well thought out film. It's not the best, personally my preference is for the early Friday The 13th movies, but that doesn't make it a bad film. For a film which is gut renching, yet simultaneously makes you think, watch Hellraiser. If however, you just want blood and obscure deaths, your better off with a different series.

It grabbed my attention immediately and never lost it. The plot is interesting and captivating; it revolves around Timothy Hutton, who plays Willie, a late-20's piano player who returns to his home town after ten years, to meet his old friends and celebrate the 10-years high-school reunion with them. When he arrives, he quickly finds out that nothing really has changed in the last decade, at least not for his friends and the town in general. His friends are all still struggling with their love lives, their family and their lives in general. Among those friends are Tommy(Matt Dillon), who has a girlfriend, and an affair with a married woman with a child; Michael (Noah Emmerich), who has settled down and gotten a family, and seems to be content and Paul(Michael Rapaport), who's girlfriend has just broken up with him, because he couldn't commit after a long relationship, and who almost worships models, because he is very hung up on beauty. Willie quickly meets the new neighbor, or, rather, the new neighbors teen girl, Marty(Natalie Portman), who almost immediately casts her love on him, despite their obvious age difference. The entire cast does a great job; Timothy Hutton plays a great somewhat happy guy, who realizes that no one in his home town, where he grew up, have moved on, done something with their life, like he has. Matt Dillon gives a great performance as the former high school stud, who can't give up on either of the girls in love with him. Noah Emmerich plays a believable dependent father, who can't seem to raise his kids without his wife's help. Michael Rapaport portrays the hopeless dreamer who couldn't settle down with his girlfriend, and can't get over his ex. Natalie Portman gives a great performance as the Lolita-like Marty, who falls in love with someone she knows, deep down, that she can't be with. The characters are all well-written and interesting, and, despite the fact that there are so many, they all get the screen-time they deserve and require. I also enjoyed and somewhat liked every single character; even the one played by Rosie O'Donnell, who I normally loathe, was entertaining and interesting. The humor in the film is great, it doesn't seem forced and it just blends in. The film doesn't have any of the cliches often associated with dramas that have a high school reunion in them. The actors all have great chemistry, and really make you believe that they *are* that character, not just an actor playing a part. I liked the Wizard of Oz theme and references, though I'm not entirely sure what to make of them. Either the city was Kansas, or it was Oz. Anyway, all in all, a great drama, with great humor and great acting. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors, fans of dramas and generally people looking for a good little film with an all-round great cast and believable characters. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I mainly watched this to see Natalie Portman, as I've been a fan of hers for some time, and have been very impressed with most of her performances, but I have to admit, as I started watching it, I really liked it.

The movie is like no other. It is a complete original. That is rare these days. Living in a town similar to the one depicted in this film it makes thing all the better for me. Of course the dreariness is taken to the extreme, but I think it could be done no other way. The performance by Spacey was phenomenal. Benning did well. And the rest of the cast was stellar. I don't think I've seen a movie that shows the ugly side of modern day upper-middle class communities in such a sly comical way.I dunno. If you're a person that has to be chipper and can't stand being a bit down, then you may not like this movie. Very well written script, nice cinematography, and stellar performances make this movie a one of a kind masterpiece ever person should see.
