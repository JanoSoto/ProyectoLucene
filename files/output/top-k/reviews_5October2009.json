It Happened One Night, easily the finest Best Picture Academy Award winner up until that point is what it is thanks to a perfect teaming of talents in its writer, actors and director. This exceptional group created a picture that is the essence of 1930s Hollywood &#x96; one of the most neglected and misunderstood periods in cinema history &#x96; and yet is universal enough in its appeal to be widely enjoyed today.Let's begin with the writer, one of the unsung geniuses of 1930s cinema, Robert Riskin. While everyone knows about the directors who couldn't handle sound or the silent stars who found themselves out of work, it's rarely remembered that screenwriters had a hard time adapting too. No-one seemed to know how to balance dialogue and action, and one of the weakest elements of many early talkies is the screenplay. It Happened One Night is one of the first really beautifully constructed screenplays of the era. Riskin's pacing of the budding romance is spot on, ensuring there is never a dull moment by smoothly easing us from romantic intimacy to comic absurdity. One of the most effective juxtapositions is when the coach passengers all join together to sing The Man on the Flying Trapeze just before the coach crashes. The song draws into the warm feeling of community spirit, making the crash more of a jolt. Riskin's dialogue is abstract in that it is witty and almost poetic at times, but every sentiment is believable, and makes the characters larger than life.The early 1930s had also seen a scramble to define a great screen performance. The Academy Award-winners for acting thus far had been a very mixed bag, with a tendency towards rewarding the most grandiose theatrical performances. While the previous year's Best Actor &#x96; Charles Laughton as Henry VIII &#x96; is admittedly the most watchable and absorbing slice of hamming I have ever seen, and totally deserving of the prize, it was not of a style that could become the norm if the talkies were to progress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were not spectacularly good actors, and there are many better performers who were never even Oscar nominated. But they deserved the awards here because It Happened One Night captures the fullness of their admittedly limited ranges &#x96; form Gable, suaveness and street-smartness, from Colbert haughtiness and sophistication, and from both a flair for comedy and down-to-earth realism. Most importantly they make their characters likable, something that the deepest or most versatile players still sometimes fail to achieve.And now we come to producer-director Frank Capra. Capra had a massive ego when it came to marketing his own brand, but on the screen he took a decidedly relaxed approach, using long takes and few camera movements. One of the best things a director can do to aid the actors is simply give them space to act in, not cluttering up the scene with a lot of bizarre angles or tracking shots. Capra often does something known as cutting down the line, which means during a scene he switches to a closer or more distant shot without changing the angle. This technique is sometimes frowned upon, but it is effective because it steps up the intensity of a moment without changing the positioning of the performers in relation to the camera. Capra keeps his attention-grabbing whip-pans and close-ups to a functional minimum, using the former to draw us into a scene (like those horizontal wipes), and playing the latter like a trump card at moments of emotional intensity.Writer, cast and director &#x96; each was ideally suited to the material. This was the only way in which a picture this special and this enduring can have been made. The auteur theorists may not be able to accept this, but the Academy did. It Happened One Night landed the Oscar grand slam of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Credit where it's due.

Bertrom immediately inflates the episode as an attempt on his life, initiating a chase by the authorities, the unfortunate pair ultimately hiding in a crate on a dock. They fall asleep, finding the next morning that they have been loaded aboard a luxury liner, making them inadvertent stowaways. As luck, and admittedly ham-handed writing would have it, Bertrom has booked passage on the same ship, where he hopes that The salt air will heal my wounds, and the motion of the cool, green sea will soothe my tortured soul.Arthur and Maurice's presence on the ship is soon found out, and with the help of sympathetic cruise director Lily, played by Lili Taylor, disguise themselves as stewards and manage through luck and mayhem to stay just ahead of Bertrom, Meistrich, the severely Prussian head steward, hysterically played by Campbell Scott, and the gentle, mild mannered Marco who is charged by Meistrich to apprehend the stowaways. In the process, the duo learn that the first mate, played by Tony Shalhoub, is in fact a terrorist cum freedom fighter of an obscure and unnamed country who plans to blow up the ship, and that an American couple, Johnny and Maxine, thieves masquerading as Parisians, are planning to seduce and murder a wealthy widow and an Arab Sheik, respectively.Set sometime in the 1930's, the tone feels decidedly European, with European sensibilities. There is elegance here, within the confines of a limited budget. There are tuxes and flower arrangements galore, but this ain't Titanic. That said, the production design pokes fun at itself in that the bulk of the movie is shot on a static ship-board set that does not resort to the use of fancy lighting, gimbals, or even water, and in place of a green screen uses a cheap, to hell with 'em if they can't take a joke painted backdrop. The pace is quick and frenetic, energized by the extensive use of hand-held camera work. The acting, for its part, is poured not into characters per se but joyfully and unabashedly into cartoon-like characterizations. And this is not the hallmark of bad acting as some would suggest, for the writing allows the actors free rein to deliver in places great monologues, in the way jazz artists are given, each in turn, an opportunity to display their virtuosity in their solo performances. I would suggest that it takes great skill to flesh out such vivid and flamboyant personages.This movie would best be described as a gag movie, in that it has the appearance of a string of set-piece gags that are carefully set up and sprung on the viewer. And, if the art of humor lies with the delivery, than the delivery here is top-notch, with great lines joyfully delivered by over-the-top characters. It should be noted that in the hands of lesser talent, lines such as Meistrich The danger of the chase has made you perspire. It has made me also&#x85;moist. Maxine What are we gonna do with all that cash, Johnny? Johnny What do you think, baby? Maxine Take it on the lam and scram to some far-off land and lead a life of bliss, Johnny? Would fall flat and strike the ear as crushingly hokey. It takes real chops to make material like this work.And the delivery isn't made up just in the acting. The camera has an active part in selling the lines, also. To illustrate, Marco and Lili are romantically involved, but Meistrich, who is infatuated with Lili, repeatedly tries to insinuate himself in every private moment the couple manages together, the camera drawing away abruptly and without warning at such times from an intimate two shot to a three shot, revealing the intruder Meistrich. The music helps establish the mindset in the viewer also, alternating between delightfully continental Tango music to breezy and raucous Dixieland.And though this is most assuredly a gag movie, the bits are not just strewn helter-skelter against a vapid storyline. All the jokes become glittering sequins on a lovingly woven and coherent fabric of plot. It hangs together very nicely, thank you. However, it should be noted that not all the gags work, however. The sheer volume of them and the variability of taste in movie-goers would decree that at least some fall flat, and for this reviewer that is the case, but many more are delightful, and more than make up for the klunkers. So why didn't this do better at the box office? And why does it have a ranking of 6.0 on IMDb? It isn't for the craftsmanship; technically, the directing is first-rate, the writing also, the acting top-notch, and the soundtrack is superb. So the problem is that of taste. For any one individual, that person's taste will decree that they are either going to like this movie or they won't. I know folks who, to their credit, have tried to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail several times and still can't see the funny in it that tickles others. For myself, this one is a gentle, joyful froth that does not concern itself with heady examinations of the human condition or the subconscious. Rather, it is cinematic playfulness, perfect for distracting me at least temporarily from the burden of seriousness that life imposes.

Heck, I won't even bother continuing...suffice to say it's just weird.Overall, while the acting and script occasionally fall flat, the film is funny, twisted and never fails to surprise--particularly the hallucinogenic ending! In addition, the film has a great sound track--one of the best I've heard. It's full of punk music AND retro 50s rifts that I particularly loved. Who would have thought I would have liked music from the likes of Iggy Pop and The Plugz?! Plus, if you really like the tunes, you can buy the special edition which comes with the movie on DVD and a music CD as well.By the way, as you are watching here are a couple interesting things to note. The food in the movie is all in generic-style containers and say 'food', 'beer' and the like. Also, note when the one punk is dying--listen to his death speech--it's a classic!

I don't really know as I type this. Every character my fingers hits, every key-stroke, brings to me a new realization of my thoughts' worth on film. In that vein, I hope that what I've written has served those who've read my reviews to better guide them to quality entertainment, and hopefully with new insight.But, to the film.Singing in the Rain has a special place in my heart. It's a window on an era of cinema that itself is another window on another era in cinema. We're seeing what the people of the 1950s thought of film some thirty to forty years before during its infancy.But, the real charm of the film is that we have a dancer who is masculine in his poetry. That, and he carries himself (to borrow from the film) with dignity. This is another icon of male that a lot of men looked up to when the film was first released. Gene Kelley didn't ogle women, nor mistreat them. He showed gentle power through grace and poetry. A thing that today would be considered effete, or perhaps too high brow for the common man.But, even though we see Kelley giving us his smooth cultured delivery, we're also shown his comic side. He's a clown, but a smooth one. Even the most dignified have their comedic moments. He shows us guys how to court a cute young woman like Debbie Reynolds, and shows us that a woman of quality wants a man of quality. And quality doesn't come in the form of a fat bill fold, but the shedding of baser impulses, and embracing of the heart.Then we have Cosmo, the a-sexual friend whose relegated to the realm of emasculated dudeness. He's the class clown who never grew up. Does he date? We don't know. But then again, does it matter? He seems happy and content to play second string to Kelley's Lockwood character, but shines himself as he brings us the former Vaudevillian turned Hollywood supporting star.Then, there's Reynold's Kathy Selden character, who takes pot shots at the big boys from her humble station. She is elevated to professional performer status from her Catskills beginnings as a side show girl. She's beautiful and charming when she isn't being jealous of those who made it into the industry, and is taken under the wing of Kelley's smitten character.The plot thickens with Jean Haggen's Lina Lamont, the not-so-ditzy blonde with a nose for leverage. She may not know art, but she knows what she likes. And she likes getting the lime light, and it doesn't matter whose talent she has to exploit to get that light shining on her instead of those making her the starlet she's been made into.There's the head of the studio, the high energy director, various supporting roles, and, of course, the musical numbers. Call me nuts, but I like a good musical. To me there's something reassuring about men and women being able to show their physical prowess to the creative notes conjured by a musical mind. To me that's the peak of expressionism. Why musicals have been unfairly attached to fringe and counter culture is beyond me. Sure, they're old and corny, but why attach a feminist quality to those characteristics?The great thing about Singing in the Rain is that it's a musical comedy that formulaic, doesn't take itself very seriously, but is smashingly successful. The guy gets the girl in the end, and isn't that what it's all about?Singing in the Rain is good old fashioned Hollywood film. It truly is, in every sense of the word. It was done in the days before CGI and green\/blue-screen techniques, has its own brand of SFX, has a lot of dazzling production numbers (again, to wow the audience in the days before model spaceships and CGI), and somehow manages to focus all of that on the haphazard and somewhat rocky (yet still sweet) flavored courtship between a man who wants to be a talented star, but isn't, and a woman who should, but is held back. The two eventually meet, and romantic magic is conjured.And I guess that's why it's my favorite film. It has all the gags and good musical numbers from days of old, but it also tells a tale of the way love ought to turn out. The way it ought to be. And, in spite of all the Hollywood gloss, glitz and glamor, it stays focused on that single message.There's of course Gene's famous dance number, which, truth be told, should resound with every red blooded male who's ever fallen for that one special lady. It should also give us guys hope that that special lady is out there, just waiting to inspire us so that we too can go splashing, and Singing, in, the Rain.I loved films from my days as a boy. This film was, and still is, one of my inspirations for life. If I were to go back into the film industry, hopefully, if allowed, I would be able to go back in time and visit the MGM lot during its musical hey-day, and help create magnificent films like the one I just reviewed. Something with a lot of humor, pizazz, little violence, and gentle story about a man and a woman meeting one another.

Sometimes,money doesn't usually bring happiness and success for people, only family, respect for others, and love are what keeps a family together. No matter how many times a person hasn't succeeded in a goal, they continue to persevere until they make themselves happy and successful in their goals as well as making their family proud.It was Steinbeck's novel and the screen writing is what made this movie stand out as the best movie of 1940.The narrative writing of the film was full of realism by showing us what it would have been like to live in a poor family that's been evicted by their home by greedy land owners, banks, gangs, and sheriffs that are supposed to protect the people from harm's way in the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The narrative allows viewers to feel the experience and be in the movie as the actors were reliving real life experiences of moving away from home,exploring life, traumatized by death, despair, anger, and hope of finding a new life. The overall acting in this movie was excellent and well shown through their actions, the directing, and the script. The use of real natural wind, light, and the outdoor setting also made the story even more realistic and believable within the time period of the depression giving the film a more realistic feel. The photography and the use of the camera lens was excellent!! The juxtaposition of the two pictures of images in Muley's flashback and the movement through the states as shown by the signs in the moving time period, flowed well with ease through the story and adding the dimension of how the family drove and persevered to reach their goals and their attempts to save their homes from destruction. The use of shallow depth of field, lights and darks on the actor's faces, and the dark and light contrast in the sky was used very well in the film. The dark contrast and shadows brought out the mood of fear,anger, worry, and sadness that each of the characters expressed throughout the film during the tough economic crisis that was very emotional for the entire United States. Lighting created a sense of emotion, depth,mood, and how we see these characters in the film. Lighter outdoor scenes in the film were very opportunistic and bright as the families were looking into a happier life in the future.This's the best movie that Zannuck has ever made in his life!! I would recommend this movie to everybody that needs to be influenced and want to persevere into having a better life for their family during the recession or need to be cheered up.

The use of real natural wind, light, and the outdoor setting also made the story even more realistic and believable within the time period of the depression giving the film a more realistic feel. The photography and the use of the camera lens was excellent!! The juxtaposition of the two pictures of images in Muley's flashback and the movement through the states as shown by the signs in the moving time period, flowed well with ease through the story and adding the dimension of how the family drove and persevered to reach their goals and their attempts to save their homes from destruction. The use of shallow depth of field, lights and darks on the actor's faces, and the dark and light contrast in the sky was used very well in the film. The dark contrast and shadows brought out the mood of fear,anger, worry, and sadness that each of the characters expressed throughout the film during the tough economic crisis that was very emotional for the entire United States. Lighting created a sense of emotion, depth,mood, and how we see these characters in the film. Lighter outdoor scenes in the film were very opportunistic and bright as the families were looking into a happier life in the future.This's the best movie that Zannuck has ever made in his life!! I would recommend this movie to everybody that needs to be influenced and want to persevere into having a better life for their family during the recession or need to be cheered up. It's an excellent movie overall!! ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 October 2009","score":"","review":" During the Great Depression and today's recession, it's important for families to never give up hope on themselves and keep looking foreword and ahead to the future as they want to advance towards a better life in an economic, political, and social standpoint. Sometimes,money doesn't usually bring happiness and success for people, only family, respect for others, and love are what keeps a family together. No matter how many times a person hasn't succeeded in a goal, they continue to persevere until they make themselves happy and successful in their goals as well as making their family proud.It was Steinbeck's novel and the screen writing is what made this movie stand out as the best movie of 1940.The narrative writing of the film was full of realism by showing us what it would have been like to live in a poor family that's been evicted by their home by greedy land owners, banks, gangs, and sheriffs that are supposed to protect the people from harm's way in the Dust Bowl of the 1930's.

So when Jerry Blake (formerly a Mr. Harrison or other, doesn't matter which really) married widowed Susan Blaine, her daughter (Jill Schoelen) isn't too happy. There's something just... off about him she can't quite pinpoint, which she also tells her therapist. But this doesn't stop her from acting out, and getting expelled from high school (in an almost pointless scene except to make her unsympathetic and set up a bland plot point), and it's something Jerry will just have to work a little harder at, to keep the family unit together.... or else! There's nothing too special about the plot here, and only a few scenes (perhaps those meant to be really thrilling, or perhaps not) really stick out as being exciting or interesting. The rest are a series of either dull\/blandly acted or just over-the-top moments where everyone aside from Terry O'Quinn does there best to act but, gosh-darnit, none of them can. Maybe this has less to do with the screenwriter, late novelist Donald E. Westlake, and more to do with the director Joseph Ruben, who would a few years later make The Good Son, another contrived 'I'm-just-a-normal-face' killer movie.

For those who know him just from Lost as Locke (and you know who you are, such as myself), it's a treat and a half - he plays it just right in the calm 'normal' scenes, and then goes to town in taking this guy 'Jerry Blake' into another dimension of nuts. Just a simple facial expression after Jerry freaks out about his step-daughter's kiss with another boy is priceless.

Well that's not for me to argue, but I found the 2000 movie Under Suspicion a scintillating crime-drama, complimented with a brilliant story, superb acting and outstanding directing.Gene Hackman stars as Henry Hearst, a successful lawyer residing in San Juan, Puerto Rico who has found a dead body of a murdered little girl. A long-time friend, police Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman)starts questioning Hearst about the murder. Eventually the questioning leads to a full-blown interrogation that leads to Hearst being the number one suspect.The script was crisp, clear and it shows that a lot of hard work was done in writing the script because never one did the scenes seemed random or forced. We get cramps in our stomach in determining whether Hearst was innocent or guilty because th interrogation scene is filled with a plethora of surprises. The ending is one you'd never expect and leaves you with many thoughts to ponder.From the director who gave us Lost In Space, Stephen Hopkins did a masterful job in bringing this sadly over-looked crime-drama. The camera-work was well structured and the jump-cuts are what make the dialogue so involving. My main complaint would be the more development of Benezet's character and why he's so fixated on nailing his old-friend Hearst. I also found it a bit unorthodox to see the film set in Puerto Rico with a predominant cast of American characters. But that doesn't matter to me that much since the direction by Hopkins is one of his best work. The acting was rock-on solid as Morgan Freeman was as brilliant as in most of his films he's starred in, good or bad. His whole obsession of proving Hearst's guilt never fizzles out and he stays in character in every scene he's in. Gene Hackman is at an equal with Freeman as he delivers an excellent portrayal of a long-suffering man who's unpredictable to the fans in determining his innocence or guilt. Monica Belucci who's a star in Italian films lends support to the cast as Hackman's wife who's mysterious ways could throw you off guard. The real weak link leading actor is Thomas Jane as the detective. He just couldn't keep up with the level of power the other performances that the cast provides. I would've suggested someone of Latino extraction to have played his role. It would've been more accurate.A really riveting crime story with plenty of mystery and intrigue to deliver. It truly deserves a 9 because it will keep you guessing and is backed up by two of Hollywood's most outstanding performers.

In spite of her actions, the team starts to win, they begin to gel a little, but are not yet playing together as a team. She decides to take some of their things away, like their plane and their equipment. They have to travel by bus, and have no equipment (like whirlpools or hot water, to help their aches and pains). Bob Ucher plays a baseball announcer who adds tremendous comedy to the movie at almost every turn. Tom Berringer plays Jake Taylor an aging catcher, who knows the game well, but his age is causing problems. Jake's wife (Played by Renee Russo) has divorced him, because he played around when he was younger, but now his aging has changed his view and he is far more serious about baseball and his relationship. He wants a shot at some sort of Baseball Championship as it may be his last shot. He also wants his wife back. However, she is now engaged to a rich successful guy and in addition she continues to see Jake Taylor for the playboy he used to be. It may be too late for either of Jake's goals. With 41 games left, the Indians have been a shocker in that they are 60 and 61. This is when the coach discovers the new owners true plans to move the team to Miame and get rid of these players. The Coach relays these plans to the players. This is it, the thing that brings them together! Jake verbalizes their goal to win the whole thing. They determine they need 32 more wins to do it. That goal of going 32 and 9 seems impossible, even as motivated as they are to do it. The Indians begin to play as a team. They work on their weaknesses and the city energizes behind them during a good music\/movie montage. They win their way to a one game playoff with the New York Yankees for the Eastern Division Championship. Well you can guess what happens, and you can also guess what happens with the Jake Taylor and his wife. But, despite this predictability, this movie climax has enough surprises (Centering around Jake Taylor) to rank up there among the very best movie climaxes ever.This movie exhibits a sound\/music climax coinciding with the story climax. Therefore, if you can, try blasting the volume just at the point the Manager calls Ricky Vaughn (the Wild Thing) out of the Bullpen. Leave the volume up from that point upto the final shot. It will be worth it.

The Coach relays these plans to the players. This is it, the thing that brings them together! Jake verbalizes their goal to win the whole thing. They determine they need 32 more wins to do it. That goal of going 32 and 9 seems impossible, even as motivated as they are to do it. The Indians begin to play as a team. They work on their weaknesses and the city energizes behind them during a good music\/movie montage. They win their way to a one game playoff with the New York Yankees for the Eastern Division Championship. Well you can guess what happens, and you can also guess what happens with the Jake Taylor and his wife. But, despite this predictability, this movie climax has enough surprises (Centering around Jake Taylor) to rank up there among the very best movie climaxes ever.This movie exhibits a sound\/music climax coinciding with the story climax. Therefore, if you can, try blasting the volume just at the point the Manager calls Ricky Vaughn (the Wild Thing) out of the Bullpen. Leave the volume up from that point upto the final shot. It will be worth it.

The Owner of the team, a former showgirl, wants to move the team to Miame, so she puts together the worst collection of ball players she can possibly assemble. In spite of her actions, the team starts to win, they begin to gel a little, but are not yet playing together as a team. She decides to take some of their things away, like their plane and their equipment. They have to travel by bus, and have no equipment (like whirlpools or hot water, to help their aches and pains). Bob Ucher plays a baseball announcer who adds tremendous comedy to the movie at almost every turn. Tom Berringer plays Jake Taylor an aging catcher, who knows the game well, but his age is causing problems. Jake's wife (Played by Renee Russo) has divorced him, because he played around when he was younger, but now his aging has changed his view and he is far more serious about baseball and his relationship. He wants a shot at some sort of Baseball Championship as it may be his last shot. He also wants his wife back. However, she is now engaged to a rich successful guy and in addition she continues to see Jake Taylor for the playboy he used to be. It may be too late for either of Jake's goals.

After not seeing it for a very long time I sat down last night and played it. I can gladly say that the film has aged very well and is every bit as solid and moving as when I first saw it. Barbara is as beautiful as she ever was in any film. Redford made legions of ladies swoon with his natural, rugged, non-tampered handsome blondness.The story is quite believable and borrows from the historical record that it is placed in. There were lots of Jewish people who got caught up in the anti-Fascist, anti-war and anti-bomb movements. But the actual beliefs or disinterested lifestyles, although well articulated in the film are secondary throughout, helping to craft the tensions that underscore the real theme romantic but inevitably doomed love.Streisand and Redford threw themselves into this work and their on screen chemistry is wonderful. Barbara's singing of the theme music pulls at the heart strings as it is meant to. This is a beautiful and adult drama that reminds anyone who has lived through disappointment and heartbreak in love what it was all about. One of the best films for both actors. For me only Yentl eclipses Barbara's success on screen. Watch for a very young James Woods early in the film. Keep the Kleenex box close by. Still one of my favourites.

The best thing about this type of movie is that it doesn't try to be anything more than it already IS, and for that it truly succeeds.

The cast - largely unknown at the time - does an excellent job of bringing the characters to life, particularly Keith Gordon who conveys pre-Christine Arnie's nerdiness, post-Christine Arnie's single minded obsessiveness, and the transition from one to the other, all with complete believability.A tolerable job is carried out in using mechanical effects (and film run backwards!) to convey the fact that Christine has a life of her own.And the movie contains one of THOSE moments, you know, the ones which make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, when Arnie says Show me, Christine's lights come on, and the music delivers a creepy downwards glissando.
