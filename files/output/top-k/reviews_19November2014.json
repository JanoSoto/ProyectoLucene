[{"date":"19 November 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Whenever we lose someone we always carry the painfully subconscious need to want to hear their voice one last time, just to know they use to exist or to know if somehow their still around.This is a sci-fi that I feel is a bit under the radar, I wouldn't say it's entirely overlooked but it's been forgotten.It's true that there in inconsistencies even some holes in logic but this film isn't concerned about about it, this is more pulp sci-fi, like with most of those stories and TV shows they were always focus on story, adventure, and fun while leaving most to all logic on the shelf. And that's great because it really gives the film a throwback feel because in a way this whole film is a Twilight Zone tale which were always about ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.The production value I think is great despite very few special effects, which to me just adds to the film's throwback feel and I feel is another example of sci-fi working without minimum to no effects, even the TV show The Twilight Zone had almost zero effects and that show is legendary. Music score I think is very good, it really fits the film because in some places it has an emotional sensibility or even in the suspenseful situations intensity.However two of the things that stand out for me for this film are the use of both the suspense thriller and time travel format. I really love how both of them are just a beautiful combination and most time travel stories by their nature are suspense thriller because it's about stopping something before it occurs. For the time travel aspect I really like that they did something different with it for once, where instead of traveling in time it's communicating with another time period. Personally I think it's a interesting and creative idea, and it really works as we see certain cause and effect physics where in the past the desk gets burned and then suddenly you see that same spot in the present knowing it wasn't there before. Yeah, I know a real head turner but that's what makes it fun.Also what they do with the suspense thriller format where in most usually were always a step ahead of the protagonists and the suspense is hopping they figure it out sooner than later. But here for once the protagonists are a step ahead, they have the means and the tool for the job. It's still really suspenseful because it's all based on the cause and effect principle, where something happens in one time period will affect what happens in the other, it's all a matter of how the protagonists utilize the principle to their advantage.However the other thing that really makes this film stand out for me is that it has a lot of heart because it has characters you actually feel a deep sense of pathos for. You literally want the protagonists to win because you actually feel the outcome really does matter.It really does have a really solid cast most TV alums, like Elesbeth Mitchell from TV's Lost and Once Upon a Time which is ironic since those shows are mysteries based on cause and effect. Andre Braugher from Broklin Nine Nine, Jim Caviezel from Person of Interest which I'll admit is really ironic if you've ever seen the show. And of course Denis Quaid whom I think is an underrated actor to me this is one of my favorite roles from him.I really like the dynamic between both Frank (Denis Quaid) and John (Jim Caviezel) Suliven. The father son dynamic is interesting because it's mainly both of them in the same room and radio but in different time periods. It's really touching and even a bit sad since we already know Frank died, or even as we see in a really sad scene another tragedy occur with the mom. But this is just all the more motivation for the protagonists to win, you could say what's happening isn't just a coincidence in nature but it could be God or fate giving them a chance to right what once when wrong.I really like how they interact and work together in the situation their in. Even how they react toward the whole phenomenon of communicating with each other in different time periods, it feels like how anyone of us might react. Their in the same boat as us they have no idea why or how this is all really happening.But I really like the certain amount of depth both have like the fact Frank is a Baseball fun which is cool since I like Baseball. Even certain things that happened in their lives like Franks smoking and John's marriage problem and both actually help each other out. I really like those scenes when both are just simply talking to each other which is touching because it feels like the kind of conversations you have with you own father or parents. Which in a way makes the film as a whole more of a story on the love of a father and son as well as parents and siblings. And of course the film is actually gives me a good feeling at the end which I don't get enough even from the sci-fi genre.This film is loud and clear.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Whenever we lose someone we always carry the painfully subconscious need to want to hear their voice one last time, just to know they use to exist or to know if somehow their still around.This is a sci-fi that I feel is a bit under the radar, I wouldn't say it's entirely overlooked but it's been forgotten.It's true that there in inconsistencies even some holes in logic but this film isn't concerned about about it, this is more pulp sci-fi, like with most of those stories and TV shows they were always focus on story, adventure, and fun while leaving most to all logic on the shelf.
