Tommy Lee Jones and the woman's shoes are smoking from the heat of the lava beneath them, yet the shoes themselves seems to not remain hot after they are dropped on solid ground. Seismologists who thinks it's a brilliant idea to go alone at 4 AM to investigate a place where several workers have boiled to death from heat. One of said seismologists who thinks it's smart to sit right above a crack in the ground where the steam has come from. Blowing up a huge building in 20 minutes. Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense, I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie.Kelly (Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie) is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15, but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward, needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy, spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope, she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car, pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh, but at the hospital, she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later.I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident, yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for.In conclusion, the movie is very stupid, but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times, there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2012","score":"","review":" This movie has a lot of problems.

He arrives in Hollywood and quickly meets the other wonderful cast of animals Tilly Hippo, Cranston Goat, T.W Turtle, later Woolly Mammoth, and another cat simply named Sawyer; who is not too pleased with Danny's dream-chasing, singing and dancing attitude. Shortly after the introduction to the others, he lands a spot on the latest movie Little Ark Angel starring America's Sweetheart, Lover of Children and Animals Darla Dimple who's pretty much a cross between Shirley Temple, Baby-Doll from the animated Batman, and a Disney villain. While filming the movie, Danny makes himself noticed much to the displeasure of Darla who shows her true colors as a spoiled little munchkin who again is as heinously evil as some of Disneys most evil villains. Which results in the calling of the gargantuan servant of Darla known as Max, which results in Max teaching Danny a lesson that I'm not gonna lie is actually pretty funny. After that happens, we find out why no one liked his little number and why Sawyer is so despondent toward Danny. We find out that Hollywood, for no clear reason, wants talented human actors and not talented animals. And the other characters we've met have talent that was wrongfully overlooked, Sawyer being both the most promising and seemingly the most broken of the group. But Danny, still wanting to follow his dream, tries to convince the others to do the same. The result the rest of the movie.If I took out the nostalgia, I would love Cats Don't Dance all the same. I love how fun it is, I love how sincere it is, but mostly I love how passionate and driven it is. Its not a flawless movie; some of the singing voices sound a bit odd when compared to the talking voices. Danny isn't THAT well developed but not enough that I think he brought the film down. But aside from a few nitpicks I truly do love it.The music is done by Randy Newman. And while I don't love Randy Newman, this is really good. The songs are both catchy and fit the moods appropriately. The orchestral work is impressive as well, fitting the 1930s Hollywood setting perfectly. The animation is fantastic too; offering a familiar Warner Bros. animation feel.Honestly, I love this movie. I love everything about it. It's great, fun to watch, memorable and very underrated. I love the characters, the music, the animation, the drama; but mostly the passion. Its serious nostalgia for me, and people should definitely watch it.

It sounds like an awesome idea right? Well it ends up being not so awesome for Douglas Quaid when he takes his virtual reality tour, only to discover that a chip has been implanted in his brain and all of his memories are fake, and they were implanted there by some sort of secret government agency. Or... were they? Total Recall is, in part, a sci-fi action flick as well as a mind bending thriller where nothing is as it seems and we're never really sure what is reality and what is a dream. Douglas Quaid, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is looking to escape reality through the virtual reality trip service Rekall. Things go awry and Quaid learns startling things about himself that he sets out to find the answers to. But, the question is, is it all really happening to Quaid or is it just a dream put together by the Rekall system? Throughout the film there are various events that hint towards both sides, and in the end we must decide for ourselves.With this kind of ambiguity running rampant throughout the film there's an element of excitement that makes the whole film very interesting to watch. We want to know the truth, but we can't be too sure of anything. Then, at the same time the reality versus dream storyline is taking place, it's the undercurrent for the story taking place on Mars that has to do with the rebels trying to take down the Martian government so that they can get air at a fair price. Mars is run by the ruthless Cohaagen who is in charge of distributing all the air on Mars, and it is the thing that keeps him in such control over the whole planet. Quaid makes it his mission to defeat Cohaagen and save Mars from tyranny. But, once again, is he really doing all this or is it all in his mind? Story wise, Total Recall is awesome. It's brilliantly original and wildly creative. It's what makes Total Recall an awesome film to watch, because it lacks in some other areas. Nothing too serious, but the film is a little cheesy with it's streak of dark humor running through it, some sappy dialogue, as well as pretty terrible acting.

For better or worse, I measure my super-hero flicks against the comic book icons that existed during my personal Golden Age when I was around ten years old in the early Sixties. So in that respect it was easy enough to identify with a Superman whose molecular density provided unlimited powers under a yellow sun.From an entertainment perspective this film was OK, though if you want to get nit-picky, that would be easy enough to do. Clark\/Superman (Christopher Reeve) should have known that the gun Lois (Margot Kidder) used didn't fire a real bullet at him, and I wondered why she wouldn't have been committed for jumping out of a high rise window - how does one explain that? There was a clever gimmick I got a kick out of when Superman reversed General Zod's (Terence Stamp) heat vision with a mirror, and the advertising sign behind Zod said 'Cool It'.However if there was ever a film that shamelessly took advantage of high rolling commercial opportunities this was it. Marlboro and Coca-Cola were the most blatant examples, but you also got a glimpse of thrifty advertisers like Kentucky Fried Chicken as well. Usually product placement is done in a much more subtle way but here it was pretty much in your face.I guess what I'm saying is that it's not that easy for a director (or two) to interpret a character that will turn out satisfactory for every fan that ever grew up with a favorite super hero.

There did seem to be a disconnect between the character of the three Kryptonian villains at the start of the picture and the way they ended up in their final showdown with the Man of Steel. For better or worse, I measure my super-hero flicks against the comic book icons that existed during my personal Golden Age when I was around ten years old in the early Sixties. So in that respect it was easy enough to identify with a Superman whose molecular density provided unlimited powers under a yellow sun.From an entertainment perspective this film was OK, though if you want to get nit-picky, that would be easy enough to do. Clark\/Superman (Christopher Reeve) should have known that the gun Lois (Margot Kidder) used didn't fire a real bullet at him, and I wondered why she wouldn't have been committed for jumping out of a high rise window - how does one explain that? There was a clever gimmick I got a kick out of when Superman reversed General Zod's (Terence Stamp) heat vision with a mirror, and the advertising sign behind Zod said 'Cool It'.However if there was ever a film that shamelessly took advantage of high rolling commercial opportunities this was it. Marlboro and Coca-Cola were the most blatant examples, but you also got a glimpse of thrifty advertisers like Kentucky Fried Chicken as well.

It takes a little while to get to the main plot, but once you do it's a great Friday or Saturday night film (not that it's boring before this). It's an action classic, in many ways.

They were responsible for some of the best-known British films of the eighties and nineties, mostly costume dramas based upon literary sources and dealing with the lives of the well-to-do classes. They did not invent the film genre which has become known as heritage cinema- that dates back at least to the late sixties- but are perhaps its best-known practitioners. The Remains of the Day- the significance of the title is rather obscure- is in many ways a typical example of their work, although the action takes place in the 1930s and 1950s rather than the late Victorian\/Edwardian era with which they are normally associated.The main character is Mr. Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, an English stately home, during the 1930s. (Stevens' Christian name is James, but he is rarely referred to as such. By convention, senior servants in a household were referred to by their surnames alone). There are two strands to the plot, one political and the other personal. The political strand involves Stevens' employer Lord Darlington, an influential politician who frequently hosts gatherings of important international figures at this home. The personal strand involves Stevens' relations with Lord Darlington's housekeeper Miss Kenton, who falls in love with him although he fails to reciprocate her sentiments. (Or possibly he does, but fails to show it).The central political theme of the film is the politics of appeasement. Darlington initially appears to be in many ways an admirable character, kindly, honourable and idealistic. Although he served in the First World War he, unlike many veterans of that conflict, bears no hatred or animosity towards the Germans- indeed, he believes that Germany was harshly treated in 1919 by the vindictive Allies. His main fault is that he cannot understand those who are not honourable and idealistic, and this blinds him to the evils of Nazism; in the misguided belief that Hitler is a trustworthy man of honour he becomes an outspoken advocate of appeasement. As the film progresses, however, his own character deteriorates; he openly welcomes outright Nazi sympathisers as guests in his home, and even dismisses two Jewish chambermaids for fear of upsetting such persons.Stevens prides himself on being a model butler. He is calm, courteous and efficient, punctilious in the performance of his duties, unfailingly loyal to his employer. He regards any display of emotion as a weakness, and preserves an iron self-control at all times. Miss Kenton- we learn late on in the film that her name is Sarah, although she prefers to be called Sally- is equally efficient professionally, but is warmer and more openly emotional.The question the film raises is whether one should allow oneself to be defined entirely through one's work and through one's relationship with one's superiors. It is the same question as the great Austrian dramatist Franz Grillparzer was raising in his play Ein Treuer Diener Seines Herrn. Like Grillparzer's hero Bancbanus, Stevens is a faithful servant of his master- the literal meaning of the German title- but one whose faithful service comes at a cost. In Stevens' case that cost is both personal, in that he sacrifices his chances of finding love, and moral, in that his loyalty leads him to close his eyes to his master's behaviour. When the two Jewish maids are dismissed, Miss Kenton is outraged, but Stevens refuses to utter a word of criticism of his employer, even in private. We are left wondering whether he is simply being diplomatic, or whether he actually does believe that the rich and powerful can do not wrong.When I recently reviewed 84, Charing Cross Road, I stated that while Anthony Hopkins is sometimes regarded in specialising in forceful, flamboyant or monstrous characters such as Hannibal Lecter or Captain Bligh in The Bounty, he can be equally good as quieter, more restrained individuals, such as Dr Treves in The Elephant Man, C S Lewis in Shadowlands or Frank Doel in 84, Charing Cross Road itself. The Remains of the Day is perhaps Hopkins' finest performance in his vein. It is a superb piece of acting, quiet and unobtrusive, but all the more effective for being so. Emma Thompson is also good as Miss Kenton, as is James Fox as Lord Darlington. There are also good performances in smaller parts from the likes of Peter Vaughan as Stevens' elderly father, although I was less impressed by Christopher Reeve as American Congressman Jack Lewis. (Lewis' part appears to have been expanded beyond that he plays in the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, doubtless in order to provide a role for a big Hollywood name).The film displays the typical Merchant-Ivory characteristics of high production values and a loving recreation of period detail. It is, to my mind, perhaps too leisurely and slow-moving, which is why I would not rate it as highly as some other Merchant-Ivory productions, such as A Room with a View or Howards End, made the year before and also starring Hopkins and Thompson. It is, however, a well-acted and well-photographed movie, and often a thought-provoking one in its analysis of interwar history and its theme that loyalty often comes with a hidden cost. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Although Ismail Merchant was Indian by birth and James Ivory American, and although many of their film-scripts, including this one, were written by the German-born Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the Merchant-Ivory partnership came to be seen as quintessentially British film-makers.

Larry Miller does an excellent job of giving the story meaning and holding all the story together. Without this father figure with his rule about dating for his daughters, there would be no story.It is slightly predictable, but in away that doesn't distract from the film in anyway.It is one of my favourites, and I suspect always will be, despite not being sci-fi or fantasy based, despite being a little chick flick, despite being based on a classic work of literature.The film just works. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't tend to do reviews of films as I watch films I like and like the films I watch.

Films that I have no interest in or don't like I don't watch. Therefore most of my reviews come out as gushing sections of superlative prose, showing only positive criticism of anything. My reviews don't tend to give any negative comments. However this film deserves my praise.This film is a case in point. I love it.I was 25 when this film was released and so was arguably at or above the age range that this was targeted at. I was aware of this when I choose to watch it, and being male was a little quiet about my willingness \/ keenness to watch it.I generally don't re-watch films. There are a few exceptions; epics like Lord of the Rings; classics like Star Wars and comedies like Spaceballs, Hot Shots and Monty Python. Even then I haven't watched them that many times. However 'Ten Things I hate about you' I have watched again and again &#x96; not obsessively five times in a day, but probably once a year (or more) since it was released.Why do I keep coming back to this film? I don't know, but everything about it exudes quality. I'm male, cantankerous, stubborn and cynical but this film is emotional and of such a calibre that it affects me each time.The plot is not simple, it is a number of different people and how one persons goal affects and intertwines them all.

One of the things I find most impressive about it is the respect it maintains for the original, where most sequels of this type (including T3 and Terminator Salvation) can't wait to distance and differentiate themselves from their lineage. Even though the first Terminator had aged quite a bit in the seven years between films, T2's sharp, daring script constantly cites events, characters and situations from its timeline like a religious zealot thumping the bible. It also builds directly upon the dark, challenging themes and premonitions of its predecessor, resulting in a towering, substantial world that seems so real I could almost touch it. Of course, I'd be silly not to mention the still-spectacular action scenes, which flawlessly build in size and scale until they reach a timely crescendo at the end of the third act. CGI was still in its infancy in the early '90s, but James Cameron's knack for its timely, appropriate application is already at veteran levels in T2. As a direct result, those infamous scenes with a transmorphing T-1000 remain striking and impressive, where other effects of the period now seem clunky and unrealistic. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, it's among the very best of the batch in multiple genres, and Arnold has never been more at-home in a character.

So it was a stressful thing, because it could turn out that you are no one at all and have no story, hence the dissolution of self so common in noir, hence the hallucinations, the world conspiring against you, the feeling of dazed powerlessness disguised as fate from above. One option you have is to read everything with repressed male sexuality in mind, that is fine, Beau Travail. But let me point you at something else, what I call layered dreaming.

He wants to marry her but she won't have him. That's a lie too.If you have no imagination, and why would you dream about him if you don't, he's just the pimp a little wobbly from the war himself. Boring. You will know him as our guy, remember he is telling the story and the story is about waking up, so our guy hallucinating different selves and each self has a life out there and comes back home, maybe an empty home, maybe waiting for a woman who is not there, maybe she could be the wife, maybe it isn't even a home, at any rate it is him in that place he comes back to at nights and mutters to himself echoes from that maybe-life out there.If I had to pick a single favorite moment in film noir, this would be it.

Then 30 Days of Night stripped all that away and made blandpires nothing more than savage parasites truly to be feared.All From Dusk til Dawn manages is...uh...well you got gratuitous profanity by a master dialogue scribe and equally copious amounts of gore. What is kind of funny about it, is that all of the actors behave as though this isn't the first, second, or even tenth time they went to a dive and encountered this sort of a debacle! And to think this is what Clooney gave up E.R. for. But it get's worse, he followed this up with that dreadful Batman and Robin and all it's ingloriousness and homo-eroticism. But hey, not every movie can have the same pedigree of Heat, Braveheart, or Citizen Kane. It's because of crap like this that you truly appreciate when a good movie graces our televisions.

We soon learn that Newman isn't playing an Indian; he is playing John Russell, AKA El Hombre, a white man who was raised by the Apache, was 'rescued' but returned to the Apaches as soon as he could. He learns that he has inherited a boarding house but decides to sell it which leaves manageress Jessie out of a job. They end up leaving town together on the last stage coach along with several other people. The coach has been hired by Indian agent Dr. Alex Favor, he has the air of a civilised gentlemen but unknown to the others he has embezzled several thousand dollars that was meant to be used to feed the Apache on the San Carlos reservation. Somebody knows about the money and they are ambushed on a remote desert road. Russell kills two of the attackers and retrieves the money but the gang's leader, Cicero Grimes, has taken Dr. Favor's wife hostage. The group weren't too keen on Russell, due to his Apache upbringing, when they were on the coach together but now they know that if they are to survive against the bandits and the desert they will have to stick with him.It may take some time for the action to get started but that only serves to let us get to know the characters and when the action starts in is well worth waiting for. Paul Newman puts in a brilliant minimalist performance as Russell; he doesn't say much, he doesn't even do much but what he does shows his character perfectly. He isn't the only person putting in a good performance; the rest of the cast do good jobs too; making us believe in the group and in the bandits who are determined to get the money. The setting is both bleak and stunning; it really looks as if a person would die out there is they hadn't brought water.The story is solid with a good range of characters; John Russell is more of an anti-hero than a hero; quite willing to let others die if he feels it is necessary; Dr. Favor, a man who robbed the Indians and would willingly let his wife die than risk his own life and Cicero Grimes, a thief who is determined that he will get the money and Jessie a woman who finds herself out of a job and must move to find a new living. The ending is not the happy sort that we get in most westerns and we can only assume the money would get back to the Apache as promised. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fans of the genre.

Right from the beginnings of the silent era and effortlessly continuing through the many ensuing decades, horror cinema has left it's mark on audiences and always leaves with them wanting more. Dracula, The Mummy and Frankenstein were the giants of the 30's and in the 50's monster movies were all the rage, but for the most part these movies, although scary at times, lacked a sense of sheer terror to them. The type of movies where you grip the person next to you or dig your nails into the seat just didn't exist. Cinema hadn't matured enough yet and these films relied heavily on the 'fantasy of cinema' rather than realism, or in the case of horror a sort of hyper-realism. Then the 60's came along and things began to change. Films like Psycho and Rosemary's Baby brought that realism into the genre. The spectacular-ness of the previous era was over and the new filmmakers entering the industry were brining new and interesting ideas and changing the way things had been done. Case in point is George A. Romero. In 1968 he made and released Night of the Living Dead. This movie was terrifying, gory and a game changer for the industry. This movie single handedly cemented into the minds of the general public what a zombie is and what it looks like. Rarely had a horror movie shaped the genre as much as Night of the Living Dead had done. By the 70's horror had become something completely different to the days of Legosi and Karloff. Movies like The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were bringing in a sense of realism that suggested to the audience that these events could happen to you, out in the woods or even right there at home. Strong acting, methodical directors and innovate and gory effects took horror movies into a far darker place than ever before. Then on October 25th, 1978 Halloween was unleashed on the public. Directed by John Carpenter and starring Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis, Halloween was unlike anything that had come before it. An unstoppable evil killer, Michael Myers, haunts a small town killing anyone he comes across as his doctor races to stop him. Halloween is a tense, scary and exhilarating thrill ride from the opening scene to the last shot. It's got a dark and moody atmosphere, and beautifully composed shots by a very young Dean Cundey. The dark lighting has Myers popping in and out of the blackness that surrounds Laurie and her friends and helps set the mood of the film. As does the music. composed by Carpenter himself. The haunting score is simple but effective and is used perfectly to emphasize the terror of Myers. His nightmare inducing theme is an instant classic. And there are plenty of music-less stretches too, where all you can here is Myers breathing and not knowing where he will pop up next. It is fantastically directed by the young Carpenter who pulls great performances out of his leads. You feel for Laurie, you believe Dr. Loomis when he speaks and you fear Myers; a hulking large, brooding, masked killer who oozes evil in the way he walks and the way he moves. Unfortunately the acting of the kids in the film is poor and is really the only thing wrong with Halloween as a film. Everything else just works perfectly. There aren't that many kills, there is no gore and there is not much action until the last half hour but again, everything just gels perfectly. Watching the film will have you glued to the screen for every second of its 90 minute run time. Halloween is a well made, original horror movie that is outright terrifying and downright unmissable. You can watch this movie over and over and never get bored and even though you know what's coming you'd still be scared and gripping your blanket tight.Film Rating 95%Breakdown (How Halloween scored 95%)Production Design 9 out of 10 Cinematography 10 out of 10 Re-playability 10 out of 10 Originality 9 out of 10 Costumes 9 out of 10 Directing 10 out of 10 Editing 10 out of 10 Acting 8 out of 10 Music 10 out of 10 Script 10 out of 10view all my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Horror movies have been around since the early days of cinema.

Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in The Worst Witch. I recommend this.

As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is out of his depth here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project got to them.The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here....
