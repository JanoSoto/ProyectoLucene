Conversely, there are those that read like a checklist of ingredients that assure critical accolades as though they were impersonally constructed on an assembly line and act as though the viewer has an Oscar ballot in their popcorn bucket. Leaving Las Vegas is definitely one of those films.Alcoholic loser Nicolas Cage decides to commit suicide in the title city by drinking himself to death. He drifts into a love affair with prostitute Elisabeth Shue on the understanding that she will not interfere with his death wish. That is pretty much it for the plot and if there is a morsel of interest in there, it gets lost in translation to the screen.Director Mike Figgis has always been a master of the moody, but less successful with the substantial. Here he provides the suitable melancholy background for the tale of woe to unfold, but it feels unusually manufactured. A description that infiltrates into all areas of this film. There is an odd feel that we are watching something mass-produced rather than organic. Figgis specializes in scenes where losers drop in melancholy despair on benches while nuns in full habits are seen in the background handing out pamphlets on salvation. Cue the irony! Everything disturbingly comes off as a grab for attention.Much of the problem centers on the main character played by Nicolas Cage. Leaving Las Vegas symbolizes Cage's fall into the predictable. This role is a veritable grab bag of Oscar musts and the screenplay sanitizes alcoholism just enough to make it palatable. Naturally, Cage is not a violent drunk, but a relatively docile one and the film strains itself to make him an object of pity rather than scorn or revulsion. When he vomits from his binge drinking, it is never really shown &#x96; just alluded to. To say that Cage's backstory is flimsy is an understatement. We never learn what has driven him to his suicidal impulses or why the romance with Shue never causes him to reconsider his decision. We also never understand why Shue is initially attracted to and compelled to cohabit with Cage, nor are we ever sold on why this love permeates Cage's bleary-eyed delirium to develop into something more than a one- or two-night stand. The entire central relationship ends up seeming like it was dreamed up by writer's whim for the imagined inherent melodrama. Additionally, the film's depiction of the onlookers is absurd &#x96; and I am speaking as someone who grew up with an alcoholic in the house. Nearly every person presented seems to have an unending supply of patience and pity for Cage. Bartenders want him to be saved, prostitutes fall for him, even the security that escort him out after he upends a table treat him with a modicum of concern. Aside from one instance, no one is annoyed by his behavior or his self-destructiveness. They are all just incredibly and improbably moved. Every aspect of the writing for this character and Cage's performance is perfectly calibrated to prompt pity at every turn.Shue actually gives the better performance despite being miscast, largely because her role by definition is at least allowed to have more of an emotional range than Cage's. Shue is sympathetic, but not really convincing. First off, no matter how much garish make-up and how many provocative costumes you dress her in, Shue still looks like the freshly scrubbed all-American girl-next-door. There is absolutely no way that any woman who looked like this would be a third-class hooker in Las Vegas - someone would have snatched her up and employed her in a far ritzier capacity. The film would have us believe at one point that Shue's experienced hooker would not know to avoid a gaggle of drunken frat boys or how to finesse the situation, so naturally we end up with a gratuitous rape scene. An actress who appears far more seasoned may have been a better selection here. It also does not help that Shue is forced to spend a great deal of time staring earnestly with dewy eyes at Cage's slurring lump. And, in the end, it is difficult not to realize that Shue is stuck playing that most clichéd of roles &#x96; the prostitute with a heart of gold.Then again, the haphazard writing may well have done anyone in. For instance, outside of the sanitized view of alcoholism, Shue's classy living quarters and her ability to pay for a quality therapist hardly seem to jibe with the low-class hooker the film otherwise wishes to paint. But then again, these flourishes are ostentatiously included to remind us that this call girl has insight, depth and aspirations. The most telling moment of the film's inadequacy occurs at a weekend outing where the drunken Cage falls into a glass table and then starts dancing around yelling I'm a prickly pear! I'm a prickly pear! The annoyed manager comes over to clean up the mess and politely invites Shue to get Cage and leave. The camera focuses on Shue's astonished boo-boo face and one realizes that this minor role of the manager is the only realistically portrayed person or moment in the film. To say there is nothing worthwhile here is incorrect. The photography is well done and, as previously mentioned, Shue is worthwhile despite the less than convincing casting. However, the film is nowhere near as provocative or moving as fans and critics would have you believe. I find the film fairly unmoving. The clichéd writing and Cage's showy pity me performance are off-putting enough, but there is a synthetic feel about the entire endeavor. Everything seems like it was belabored on storyboards for maximum potential to the point where it literally has a muted emotional impact. In short, it comes across like watching pasteurized Oscar fodder from a can by Chef Boyardee.

The shows blend of action, humor and moral earnestness was so popular it spawned a companion series called Xena Warrior Princess. Unfortunately, it also shaped this sub-mediocre entry into the sword-n-sorcery genre.Kull is another creation of Robert E. Howard, the mind behind Conan the Barbarian.

This movie has only the barest of those details in common with Howard's writing, and I'm not sure why they bothered. Kull the Conqueror has very little to do with the spirit or substance of Robert E.

It's basically a more generic and inferior version of Conan the Destroyer, which was itself a huge step down from the original Conan the Barbarian.The first half of the film deals with Kull's (Kevin Sorbo) ascension to the throne and the plotting nobles led by General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith).

His enemies seemingly kill Kull, but then he turns up fine and teams up with the fortune teller and her priestly brother (Litefoot) as the story becomes the exact same sort of quest we've seen a jillion times before in these films.The first thing to know about Kull the Conqueror is that is has a cringingly bad hair metal soundtrack.

On the outside, Will looks like an average teenager from an impoverished neighborhood. He wears raggedy clothes, he lives with his best friend in the slums of Boston's South End, he hangs with a band of rowdy drunkards, and he gets into trouble with the law almost ritualistically. However, there is one thing that makes Will worthy of the audience's attention, that makes him different from anyone else in the film. He's literally a genius.Early on in the film, it is established that Will has a natural ability to solve complex mathematical problems and absorb and memorize information. This fact is discovered by Prof. Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård), a brilliant mathematician, when he finds that one of the unsolved problems left on his white-board had been solved on a white-board in the hall. It quickly is realized that Will has no real direction in his life. He holds no true aspirations and so he does whatever it is he feels like doing with his friends, unable to contemplate a life beyond that. Lambeau enlists the help of several separate psychologists to try and come to terms with what is blocking Will from his potential, be the boy deflects their efforts in the most humiliating and degrading of ways. However, Lambeau finds an answer in an old schoolmate-turned-psychology-professor Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).Despite being an intellectual giant and a well weathered member of the South End, Will still has his vulnerabilities. One of these is that he's unable to get close with anyone. During the first-half of the film he is introduced to Skylar (Minnie Driver). They soon hit it off and start dating.

Gene Wilder is as hilarious in his bit role here as in his whole riotous performance in The Producers. And one of the movie's great moments comes as Clyde offers his gun to an evicted black sharecropper so he can put a bullet through a bank's foreclosure sign.If Clyde provides fascination, what with all the symbolic overcompensating by guns and rampaging cars, Bonnie provides hype. She writes The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde and sends it to a newspaper, and she models for photos sporting a pistol and a cigar. Clyde's brother Buck is less clouded by compensating for sexual inadequacy and more interested in bank jobs than tabloid headings. He comes fastened to Blanche, whose shrill protests aggravate Bonnie, and us. When agents besiege one of their hideaway, she runs earsplitting across the lawn, still holding the spatula she was using to cook.

In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname Brutal due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to infect Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his infection. Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.My ReviewThe Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this.

This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname Brutal due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to infect Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his infection. Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.My ReviewThe Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please!

The convoluted plot crowds in so many mismatched pieces that it seems like Craven decided to cram sketches of several movies into this one, and the end result is an over-long pastiche of clichés that limps along to its obnoxiously lame conclusion begging desperately to be put out of its misery.I'm hoping that writing the plot down will help me make sense of it in my own mind, so let's give it a shot. The story is centered around a brutal serial killer named Horace Pinker (played by the normally solid Mitch Pileggi, who eschews acting here in favor of presenting an over-blown caricature of a movie psycho) and a twenty-something protagonist named Jonathan Parker, who, in a fine example of how relentlessly silly this movie is, we later discover is actually Pinker's long-lost son.Though this is never made clear, the sequence of events seems to suggest that after suffering a concussion at football practice, Parker somehow develops supernatural powers that allow him to dream of Pinker's murders while they're happening. After Pinker butchers Jonathan's entire family (except for his detective father), and later his girlfriend, the vengeful lad makes catching the madman his personal mission. This leads to a Nightmare On Elm Street-cloning moment where Jonathan forces himself to fall asleep to see where Pinker will strike next and asks a friend to wake him up at the first sign of trouble.Through Jonathan's resourceful plan, Pinker is captured and eventually executed via electric chair (the next day, apparently, since no effort is made to suggest any sort of time elapsing in between). However, before this justice is meted out the crafty maniac performs a Satanic ritual with the television in his cell, during which demonic yellow electricity overtakes him, ostensibly giving him the ability to transfer his essence into other people's bodies and take them over. Using this power, Pinker is able to escape his demise in the chair by jumping into someone else's body, and the killer is then free to roam the streets again while masking his identity with a series of human disguises (remember the movie The Hidden? If not, you should check it out, since it's a hell of a lot better than this one).Clearly miffed that Jonathan foiled his murderous plans, Pinker's first order of business is getting revenge on his nemesis. Luckily, Jonathan is informed of Pinker's non-demise thanks to a dream he has, in which his dead, covered-in-blood girlfriend appears to warn him. In the vision, she hands Jonathan the necklace he once gave her and tells him it's the secret weapon that will stop Pinker once and for all (???), and, in yet another Elm Street lift, Jonathan wakes up to find the necklace in his bed.Thus begins the second phase of the film, in which Pinker pursues Jonathan while inhabiting a variety of bodies. Apparently our hero read the script ahead of time, because the first time he is confronted by Pinker (disguised as a police officer), he immediately sees through the ruse and deduces that the malevolent spirit of Pinker is controlling the cop's body, and he also figures out without hesitation that when the body's life force is used up, Pinker will have to find another vessel to occupy.In one of the film's ludicrous high-points, Pinker zaps into the body of a little girl, who then commandeers a conveniently abandoned tractor with the key in the ignition and tries to run Jonathan over with it. Despite Pinker's ability to leap into someone's body by touching them, he fails to use this skill when our hero picks up the little girl (wouldn't it be easier for Pinker to just jump into Jonathan's body and force him to kill himself?).After escaping a few more retarded twists during this scenario, Jonathan seeks help from the first person anyone with a shape-shifting murderer chasing them would run to his football coach (who, naturally, believes our hero's entire story without question and can't wait to help). Pinker takes over more bodies, he kills some people, he gets a few guns along the way and shoots at Jonathan approximately 819 times without hitting him, etc.It takes almost two hours for this tripe to arrive at its thudding conclusion. Jonathan eventually figures out a plan to stop Pinker (way too involved and stupid for me to waste your time with here), but before he implements it he takes a break to have sex with the ghost of his dead girlfriend. In case you're curious, the climax finds Jonathan transforming into electricity (?), leaping into a television set (??), and doing battle with Pinker throughout TV land (???). Oh, and our hero also uses a remote control to force Pinker through a series of grade-school pratfalls (fast forward makes the brutish killer talk in a high squeaky voice, hardy har). Other than the ample displays of Pinker's gory handiwork, there is absolutely nothing to recommend in this wretched mess. The meandering plot never coheres into a rational story, and the padded sentimentality of Jonathan's visits from his ghostly lover belongs in a young adult romance novel, not a fright flick. About the only thing Craven gets right is ending the movie in a way that doesn't blatantly crack open the door for a sequel (I can't even imagine how awful Shocker 2 Electric Boogaloo would be...). The only shocker here is that the same film-maker who made a horror film as intelligent as New Nightmare also helmed this load of abysmal, mindless crap.

Much to my dismay, I haven't been able comment because, for one reason or another, I kept missing it. This was remedied recently when it finally re-appeared on TV. It's an interesting film that's marked by one particularly extraordinary performance and an awful lot of profanity (swearing).Gary 'Gal' Dove is a retired gangster, he lives in Spain with his wife, Dee Dee. His friend, and ex-colleague, Aitch and wife Jackie live nearby and they barbecue, hunt, eat, drink and generally lie in the sun and have a good time. This is until the day Jackie receives a phone call from Don Logan. Don is a nasty piece of work who has decided he wants Gal to come out of retirement to do one more job. The thing is, Gal is happy with his life and doesn't want to go back, but Don is on his way to persuade him. Also, an ulterior motive is revealed for Don's visit that leaves all involved feeling quite uneasy. Now, the heist is being planned by crime boss Teddy Bass and it involves the robbery of a depositary owned by a character known as Harry, but can Gal be persuaded.There is a really good cast in this one; Ray Winstone plays Gal very well, he has all the attributes to pull off this role with aplomb. Amanda Redman plays Dee Dee, his wife, Cavan Kendall is Aitch and Julianne White is Jackie. Teddy Bass is played by another well known British actor, Ian McShane, as is Harry, who is played by James Fox. But the star accolade must go to Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, I don't know what he was on, but he pulls of a masterly performance in this one. It's so different to everything else I've seen him in and I loved every minute he was on screen.I really enjoyed this film, admittedly, the performance of Ben Kingsley has a lot to do with that, but there were also a few rather innovative touches that made the story a bit more interesting that it might have been.

His friend, and ex-colleague, Aitch and wife Jackie live nearby and they barbecue, hunt, eat, drink and generally lie in the sun and have a good time. This is until the day Jackie receives a phone call from Don Logan. Don is a nasty piece of work who has decided he wants Gal to come out of retirement to do one more job. The thing is, Gal is happy with his life and doesn't want to go back, but Don is on his way to persuade him. Also, an ulterior motive is revealed for Don's visit that leaves all involved feeling quite uneasy. Now, the heist is being planned by crime boss Teddy Bass and it involves the robbery of a depositary owned by a character known as Harry, but can Gal be persuaded.There is a really good cast in this one; Ray Winstone plays Gal very well, he has all the attributes to pull off this role with aplomb. Amanda Redman plays Dee Dee, his wife, Cavan Kendall is Aitch and Julianne White is Jackie. Teddy Bass is played by another well known British actor, Ian McShane, as is Harry, who is played by James Fox. But the star accolade must go to Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, I don't know what he was on, but he pulls of a masterly performance in this one. It's so different to everything else I've seen him in and I loved every minute he was on screen.I really enjoyed this film, admittedly, the performance of Ben Kingsley has a lot to do with that, but there were also a few rather innovative touches that made the story a bit more interesting that it might have been.

It makes the girlfriend (in this version Helen) out to be a victim, and the killer (here Kit) out to be a charismatic man, even admired and liked by the police. The very casual feel really makes me think it is more realistic. Of course, the focus for Stone was on the media, so he was telling a different story in that respect.I have a general dislike of Sissy Spacek and still have not figured out how she ever got as big as she did. However, I did not mind her here. Granted, she is rather hideous with her skull face and ginger freckles, but at least plays a character we can feel sympathetic for.

In recent years, Mel Gibson's reputation has taken hits, but there can be no denying that he is a gifted actor and in this movie presents a novel, dynamic interpretation of Hamlet that brings new life to the character, transforming a brooding young man into a man of action who takes charge and pays the price, wherein lays the tragedy. For Hamlet is a tragedy. However, unlike previous renditions of the play, which focus on the murky and somber, this rendition is lit up, the characters are active, Gertrude is young and beautiful, all of which make the ending even more provocative and powerful. This movie should have been nominated for an Academy Award in every major category; that it wasn't is perplexing. All in all, this movie represents another triumph for Franco Zefirrelli, once again who proves that Shakespeare can be produced for the screen, if you do it right.

You must be in the right mood for some serious drama before watching this. And don't expect some cutesy, happy ending. If that's what you want, watch Harvey. Harvey and Suddenly, Last Summer are polar opposites of the same theme A family member wanting to commit a relative to an insane asylum for questionable reasons. The parallels are so distinct I wonder if Tennessee Williams set out to do this.I see no one else has written a review since Elizabeth Taylor's death on March 23, 2011. Some people assumed that a woman with such flawless beauty could not possibly also be blessed with great acting talent. I was never one of them, and this movie certainly proves she was a great actress. We all know of the difficulties child actors have transitioning to adult roles, even for great ones such as Margaret O'Brien or Shirley Temple. This movie illustrates the challenge You must also be able to convey adult emotions like anger, fear, terror, sometimes even madness. Taylor comes through in spades. It is interesting comparing the performances of Taylor and Katherine Hepburn, who normally is renown for her radiance and vitality. Here it is Taylor who exudes vitality, while Hepburn appears to be a sparkling personality with an empty soul. This was surely deliberate and took great acting skill, not to mention humility to stand in Taylor's shadow. What I admire about Taylor's performance is its many layers. We hear about her long before she appears on screen, that she is a basket case in need of a lobotomy. And at first we might believe this to be true, but gradually she transforms her character as the truth unfolds. We learn that she is acting crazy, more or less deliberately, but why? It is not clear whether she wants Clift to believe her to be sane or insane, or even whether she might actually want the lobotomy, though in the end she fights against it with every ounce in her. The problem is Taylor doesn't even know the truth herself, is afraid of the truth, but must face it, or face a lobotomy, a powerful incentive. What you get is a multi-layered, dynamic performance. It reminds me of Marilyn Monroe in Bus Stop, another great beauty who did really have great acting ability. The madness of the scenario brings to mind Shakespeare, and Taylor's acting rises to the Shakespearian level.The threat of a lobotomy provides a powerful driving force in the plot, but what really charges it up is the issue of Hepburn's potential donation of $1 million if the lobotomy is performed. Now you have the issue of misuse of psychiatric diagnostics for money, for prestige, for social convenience. Not every psychiatrist would have had the integrity of Clift to insist on digging for the truth. As Taylor's character unfolds, we see a very real, very alive human being whom we can relate to. Taylor has produced such empathy, it is we who are threatened with a lobotomy, and all the horrors this would mean. This is not electroshock therapy, a more common cinematic device, but a method to keep the body alive while killing the mind, a truth we suspect, and she realizes as she looks down into the pit of mad women. The movie is becoming a living nightmare.And so we find a very beautiful, privileged actress who somehow finds within herself the full breadth and depth of human experience, much as Marlon Brando did. Taylor did not live a charmed life. Despite the beauty, talent and glamor, she had more than her share of tragedy and illness, though this came later. She was also the first great movie star to allow her real private life to be covered in the press honestly, without the PR hokum. I don't think that it was because she craved fame, which she had since she was a child, unlike some some modern celebrities without a fraction of her talent. What you see in Suddenly is a very open, honest, vulnerable Taylor who is able to project her humanness onto the screen. This isn't something you can fake. Elizabeth Taylor was a great actress and a fine human being who lived an extraordinary life. You won't soon forget Suddenly. But you might need an antidote for its bitterness. I suggest you follow it by watching Harvey.
