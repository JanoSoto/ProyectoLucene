This guy realizes that he and his grumpy old father has, like the title says, nothing in common. And now David needs to find a good balance between his career, a devotion with his parents and some possible love relationships.This was Tom Hanks first attempt in a more serious film, he was very fresh in the success of Splash and wanted a serious role without losing his comedian moves. The screenplay didn't help him much because created something in the between that took too long to develop, be interesting, be funny and serious at the same time. The story is good but it never reaches the perfect potential, it's a almost get there movie. It is effective on the drama level, in the comedy sometimes works (the 2001 A Space Odyssey reference used when David mets his new office was hilarious), other times it is very difficult to follow the proposition of the writers and director Garry Marshall. I enjoyed the conflicted drama between Hanks and Gleason and Saint; the reason of why David's parents didn't work out and some family secrets were presented in a good tone, nothing so melodramatic and the result in the ending was very satisfactory and kind of surprising I must say. I won't tell much but the things between the couple gets unsolved and that works brilliantly here because it was a realistic alternative, very surprising and escaped the Hollywood happy cliché. On the comedy side one of the biggest moments here is when Hanks presents his final advertising project along with his colleagues creating a interesting and original presentation where he read the presentation cards explaining the commercial and his colleagues start singing\/dubbing all the characters of it. Hanks was good, Gleason in his final film role was very good (towards the ending mostly) and Eva Marie Saint is always a pleasure to watch her (her only scene with Gleason is touchy). The movie also includes Tuesday Weld, Barry Corbin and Hector Elizondo in effective supporting roles. The soundtrack is very 1980's and good to hear it, featuring two main songs (one performed by Christopher Cross and other by The Thompson Twins) and many other good songs. Just because it's not so great that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. Despite the fact that it was a box-office failure and the ratings here are so low, this underrated movie deserves a better view. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 September 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In this dramatic comedy Tom Hanks plays David a successful and very happy advertiser working on a big project when suddenly his world falls apart when his mother (Eva Marie Saint) separates from his father (Jackie Gleason) ending their long marriage and leaving to him many questions about relationships and family matters.

This is unusual. In most cases of isolated children there is a kind of launch window for language acquisition that closes at about the age of twelve. Hauser does quite well, though, and if at first we might be inclined to think of him as retarded, we kind of get over it.He retains a couple of quirks that suggest primitive thinking. He's convinced, for instance, that his prison cell in the village tower is larger than the tower itself? How come? Well, explains Hauser, when he was in his cell, whichever direction he looked, he saw only the walls of the room. Now that he's outside, he can see the tower when he faces it, but if he looks in any other direction there are only wide open spaces. Therefore the tower is smaller than the cell it encloses. (Get it?) Another quirk is what one might be tempted to call the attribution of agency. In fact, I myself am tempted to call it that, it's such a beautiful phrase. The attribution of agency. I savor each syllable.All it means, though, is that you see something as being a causal factor, as having intelligence, a goal. For example, a man wants to demonstrate will power, so he explains to Hauser that he can roll an apple along the ground and make it stop rolling when it reaches another man's shoe. Well, this isn't astroturf we're talking about. The rough sward of a village green has its bumps, and the rolling apple hits one and bounces over the shoe meant to stop it. The apple is smarter than the man, concludes Hauser, because it chose to jump over the shoe.Is it okay to give a personal example here that might make the principle a little clearer? When my kid was only a few years old I took him to a pond in Golden Gate Park where men sailed radio-controlled boats. The boats were about two feet long and could be mighty elaborate.So here's Josh, standing on the bank, watching these half-dozen boats scoot around. And one of them slowly, warily, makes its way over to him and stops a few feet away, out of curiosity. Josh gawks at the boat and it sits facing him. Then it toots twice. Josh is silent. (He was Korean and only just then learning English.) Then Josh begins to walk along the bank, but the boat -- now joined by one or two others -- follows him slowly. When Josh stops and faces the boats, they stop and face him. Toot toot. He was drawing no connection whatever between the behavior of the model boats and the laughter of their controllers a couple of yards away.The boats were doing exactly what they wanted to do, just as Kaspar Hauser's apple had a will of its own. If it sails like an agent and toots like an agent, it's an agent. It takes a certain kind of imagination to bring in a third party as the causal factor -- let alone a fourth or fifth party. (I'm almost afraid to mention that all these factors may be operating at the same time with different degrees of influence.) Or, let's ground that argument. If an economic boom or bust occurs during a given president's administration, he's the agent behind it. Right? After all, he's the one doing the tooting.The movie is rather slow. Herzog never seems to rush through a story. A lot of time is given over to villagers who are trying to figure out just what to do with this anomaly. At one point they exhibit him in a freak tableau. Their reasoning is that he's costing them money and we all have to earn our keep. Herzog gives us compassion but it's oddly distances from the events we see on the screen. Hauser isn't turned into a particularly sympathetic figure. He's not friendly, but he's not hostile either. He constantly wears a fundamental half-smile, even when he's just burned his finger in the unfamiliar flame of a candle and tears wet his cheeks. The director treats Hauser and his predicament the way a doctor treats his patient -- Gee, it's too bad, but my feeling sorry for him isn't going to get the job done.Sometimes his stuff can be a meandering and tiring slog, but I admire Herzog and his willingness to take artistic risks. This is no Elephant Man. Hauser has no hidden skills. He learns to play a little Mozart but he stinks at it. Nobody's particularly noble or evil.

He sits next to the woman in a casino and they play roulette together, Lawrence bets on all the same numbers as the woman. When he loses all his money he tells his associate that he would like to sell his ring for some more money, and to that his associate replies that he can't sell the royal ring. So Lawrence leaves the table and the woman follows. Lawrence tells her that he in facts is a Prince and is trying to raise money to help save the people of his country. She eventually gives him a large sum of money to help out the cause. Then Lawrence goes on a train and watches how Freddy Benson cons a woman into buying him a meal by saying how he is saving money to help his grandmother. After a series of events Freddy takes lessons from Lawrence even though Lawrence is secretly trying to get him to leave the area because he does not want Freddy to ruin the con hunt for him. Then these two dirty rotten scoundrels make a bet to see who is the better con artist...The screenplay for this film was really quite witty and clever. It was entertaining the whole way through and the characters were very evenly balanced. By that I mean that there really was not one character I favored the whole way through until really the end I chose a side. The jokes were solid and I thought the absolute ending was brilliant. I thought part of the end was predictable but then it just took that and brought it to a new level. A very delightful screenplay and it was converted delightfully to the screen.The direction for this film by Frank Oz was also quite good. He got great comedic performances from his leads and also kept a film that could have easily been drawn out and boring entertaining. There was really no complex shots in this film but none were really required because it was not trying to be an epic film or something of that sort. What made the direction truly great, and all great comedies great is the reaction shots. They were all perfectly timed and just so effective. Oz proved that he is a comedic force to be reckoned with.The acting in this film was hilarious, enjoyable, and so easy to get sucked into. Caine was great as Lawrence Jamieson using several different accents brilliantly and making it so easy to like him as a person even though he makes a living out of stealing other people's money. He is the cultured French man who also loves the art of the con. Steve Martin was also wonderful as Freddy Benson who was the amateur con artist that only had really one trick up his sleeve but had to compete in the big league against Lawrence. He provided most of the great reaction shots and to tell you the truth I forgot that both of the two were acting and just got sucked into the film.Overall I give this film a solid 8\/10.

After a series of events Freddy takes lessons from Lawrence even though Lawrence is secretly trying to get him to leave the area because he does not want Freddy to ruin the con hunt for him. Then these two dirty rotten scoundrels make a bet to see who is the better con artist...The screenplay for this film was really quite witty and clever. It was entertaining the whole way through and the characters were very evenly balanced. By that I mean that there really was not one character I favored the whole way through until really the end I chose a side. The jokes were solid and I thought the absolute ending was brilliant. I thought part of the end was predictable but then it just took that and brought it to a new level. A very delightful screenplay and it was converted delightfully to the screen.The direction for this film by Frank Oz was also quite good. He got great comedic performances from his leads and also kept a film that could have easily been drawn out and boring entertaining. There was really no complex shots in this film but none were really required because it was not trying to be an epic film or something of that sort. What made the direction truly great, and all great comedies great is the reaction shots. They were all perfectly timed and just so effective. Oz proved that he is a comedic force to be reckoned with.The acting in this film was hilarious, enjoyable, and so easy to get sucked into. Caine was great as Lawrence Jamieson using several different accents brilliantly and making it so easy to like him as a person even though he makes a living out of stealing other people's money. He is the cultured French man who also loves the art of the con. Steve Martin was also wonderful as Freddy Benson who was the amateur con artist that only had really one trick up his sleeve but had to compete in the big league against Lawrence. He provided most of the great reaction shots and to tell you the truth I forgot that both of the two were acting and just got sucked into the film.Overall I give this film a solid 8\/10. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a smart, entertaining comedy.

In 1993, he helped the overlooked masterpiece Tombstone gain recognition by applauding it and Val Kilmer's performance, and during his eight years in the presidency, he watched Fred Zinnemann's classic Nigh Noon seventeen times. It is his favorite movie and a favorite of many, including myself. High Noon has oftentimes been called a Western for people who don't like Westerns and it very much is, because it has so much depth in its otherwise conversant premise.The setup is familiar. An outlaw has been paroled early from prison and is returning to town to gun down the marshal to sent him there in the first place. The marshal (Gary Cooper) ties the knot with his Quaker fiancée (Grace Kelly) on the day that he learns the outlaw is meeting up with his old gang after he arrives on the noon train. Cooper, feeling a responsibility to protect his town, starts preparing to face down the enemy. That daunts him, but what complicates the scenario is that nobody, not his fiancée, not his deputy, nor anybody else in town will lend a finger to help him.This is not exactly an original plot premise for a Western. In fact, it's been used many times. Now the denouement and the payoff of the movie is vastly alien from the way this type of movie usually ends, but there is so much more to it than that. Right away after the opening, which gives you the impression that the story will be familiar, screenwriter Carl Foreman and director Frank Zinnemann construct a very deep, very complex, and compelling story that oddly enough parallels the political divides (maybe that's why it has such appeal for Mr. Clinton?).High Noon may be a Western but it almost seems like the type of Western that Alfred Hitchcock would have directed. Like that wonderful movie of his' Rear Window (1954), High Noon spends most of its time setting up the scenario and then the final act is sheer suspense. Suspense of waiting for the noon train to arrive, waiting for the hour hand to strike twelve, waiting for the outlaws to come and kill Cooper, who can't even find old friends willing to help him. I don't wish to give too much away, but there is a spectacular moment that really shows how alone the marshal really is. After the train has arrived, he stands in the middle of the town. The shot begins with an eye level close-up of him and then pans back, high into the air (a crane shot) and we see Cooper standing alone in the middle of a deserted town and with nothing on the soundtrack, we sense his dread and feel his isolation.Another very interesting scene is a moment in the town church, which seems to a representation of political arguments. The movie has also been noted as an allegory for blacklisting, which is why John Wayne had a particular dislike for the film, even though he was courteous enough to accept Cooper's Oscar for him the following year when he did not attend the ceremony. There are also great subplots with additional characters and a lot of depth is explored in these scenarios. This feels not like a staged story. It feels like a real event.Gary Cooper won his second Academy Award for High Noon and he was more than deserving of such a prestigious honor. His performance as the isolated marshal is absolutely superb, zeroing in on his lines with precision and an atmosphere of panic, yet optimism that somebody somewhere might help him. Grace Kelly as his wife is terrific, as she always was and it's movies like High Noon that make me wish she had done more pictures. Lloyd Bridges is effective and buttoned-up in his performance as Cooper's cowardly, conflicted deputy and Katy Jurado, a marvelous Hispanic actress, is superb as the businesswoman who seems to have connections to most everybody in town in one way or another. There are other great performances by names such as Thomas Mitchell, who brings a lot of flamboyant charisma to his role as he always did, and keep an eye out for Lee Van Cleef in his dialogue-free feature film debut. It's fun to think that he stared here playing a bit part, then went on to slay Ray Harryhausen's rhedosaurus in The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms and ultimately facing down Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach in one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history at the conclusion of Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Another great performance is, oddly enough, by the clock, which is apparent enough to almost be a supporting role. The clock generates almost as much fear as the outlaws do.This is one extraordinary Western that I agree will have appeal for all sorts of people. It really got me involved. Heck, you know, Bill Clinton may just make a movie critic yet....

There is absolutely no relationship between the physical world and this movie. The science, social interaction, and character interaction comes from another dimension.One of the first abominations of this movie is the tar pit. All of a sudden, a giant cloud rises out of a tiny lake, lightening flashing out of it. Ok.. You say, but then giant meteors shoot out of it. These fire balls deliberately attack certain stores and signposts. Its almost as if the director is a fire bug. Because he constantly focuses on randomly objects burning up. Like hey, set the mask on fire! Set the giant cutout of that woman on fire! At one point, the lava balls become even more deliberate, attacking a fire truck to stop fire fighters from reaching a burning mansion. One of the dumbest scenes is where a fire fighter is trapped inside the truck, while lava flows towards him. Another fire fighter tries to get him out, but they both burn alive. Instead of showing us die, we sit through 10 seconds of a shot of a burning clown-fireman figurine that is attached to the truck.I really enjoyed the part where a giant ball of lava lands next to Tommy Lee Jones' daughter, it looks at her, she looks at it, and it spits lava at her. Eventually they outsmart the lava balls, when Anne Hache informs fire fighters to wait until a fireball has almost hit them before moving, so it doesn't follow them. Of course! And such comments as What is that stuff? abound. Its LAVA! Its existed since time immemorial. How can you not know what it is? I love how Hollywood acts like they're educating the world so these 'tree' objects.. You say they're lifeforms made of a substance know as 'wood'? How about it seems apparent that the reinforced concrete of the Los Angeles river might hold the weight of the lava *facepalm!* No joke, this was a conversation from the movie Sir, our fire trucks are all out of water! That's OK, pump the water out of all the swimming pools in Los Angeles; that should give us more than enough The character interactions aren't even worth describing. They're just not realistic. Tommy Lee Jones is reliving his days of yelling out orders, straight from The Fugitive. It reminds me of that show where they build unfortunate people new houses; they gather around, completely calm that they're going to die in 20 seconds, and have an enthusiastic group meeting with EVERYONE (400+ people), and then they all shuffle off to their places.Anne Hache and Tommy Lee Jones' daughter are just there to add pretty faces. They're not used for much else.This movie was insulting. It overstates how Hollywood lives in its own little world. It was a massive waste of resources.

The movie follows 3 main characters, the heroic and young US President, the highly skilled Jet Fighter pilot and the tree-hugging and extremely smart Scientist. All of them will combine their forces in order to kick some major Alien booty.You'll love Independence Day if You like nicely done and very, very, very, VERY, big and loud explosions, dogfights between UFOs and Jet Fighters, over the top heroism, typical Hollywood characters and cheesy one-liners... did I mention the loud BOOMS? Get a big bucket of popcorn, turn off your brain and just pretend you are a 10-yeal old kid that just wants a bit of Hollywood Humor, great special effects, big aliens and big boobs... oh, forget the last one, wrong movie. I've got to admit that some scenes really touched my black, hellish and tasty heart despite them being way too typical... you know, over the top bravery, a bit of romance, etc. I also have to admit that I wanted the Aliens to win... sorry fellow humanoids!You'll hate Independence Day if You want realism and good characters. Logic literally takes a backseat in this movie... a movie where a race of EXTREMELY advanced aliens traveled millions of light years only to show us, the Homo Sapiens, how stupid they are despite their superior technology. They get killed in all kinds of stupid ways that are far from realistic or at least believable. Even their initial strategic placement over major cities has no meaning... I mean why exactly do the aliens want to destroy the White House and not a military base with nuclear missiles??? Do they hate big fancy buildings or something? Next the characters are the usual typical bunch. The extremely heroic US President, the Jew, (therefore smart), scientist and his old pops, (I loved that guy!), the honest lap-dancer, a black jet fighter pilot, (therefore Macho & too Hip-Hop), the nerdy secret scientist, (I hate this stereotype), and so on and so forth. The biggest problem is that while most actors do a good job they once again play themselves, like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. I really wanted to avoid saying this but this movie is way, way, WAY too conservative, almost Disney-ish and maybe a bit too GOD BLESS America!!!FINAL VERDICT Popcorn Movie (4.7\/10)+ Great SFX like massive spaceships and even more massive explosions. Somewhat funny. Perfect movie to test your Home Theater Speakers.- Way too stereotypical characters and not all actors portraying them are exactly good. Not a movie you'll see twice, (especially out of the Cinema). Not enough aliens&#x85;Also Check Armageddon (1998) - Jurassic Park (1993) - Mars Attacks! (1996) - War Of The Worlds (2005)P.S.

We have the now-Christmas classic Home Alone, tear-jerker classic Ghost, several decent action-packed flicks (Hunt for Red October, Total Recall, Die Hard 2, Steven Segal before he became ridiculous), and of course, Rocky V (totally kidding). But, 20 years ago, there was one movie that truly rose up amongst the usual pile of movies and delivered one of the most exhilarating experiences in the history of cinema. Goodfellas is a masterpiece of its genre, and would change the movie world forever. It was too intense for some, but if you can rise past the grittiness, you are in for a wild ride through the drugs, violence, humor, and money associated with life in the gangsterhood. This movie would change a genre forever, and would pave the way for several promising careers.Much like the way Sergio Leone (and eventually Clint Eastwood) made classic westerns (For a Few Dollars More being my favorite) that made all the other westerns made at the time inferior, Goodfellas made The Godfather and all crime\/mafia pictures look silly. That's right, I said it. Godfather is a decent flick, but it is no Goodfellas. Nowadays, whenever you make a gangster movie, you aren't borrowing details or techniques of Coppola, you are copying good ol' Martin Scorsese and his masterful directing style associated with this flick. Even television shows have a lot to owe to Goodfellas--&#x97;The Sorpranos features over 25 actors and actresses that were in the movie. Easily the best film from 1990, and easily the best crime-film of all-time.Goodfellas follows the lives of several gangsters and their families throughout multiple decades, as you see their rise and fall in terms of position, power, and money. All of this is being narrated by the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). What separates Goodfellas from every mafia\/gangster film before and since its release is its very humble, down-to-earth presentation of its story. While The Godfather made the mafia life a larger-than-life event with a God-complex, Goodfellas toned it down and made it look like a gritty, blue-collar lifestyle that pays well and provides plenty of benefits. Also, unlike all gangster films at the time, Goodfellas didn't just focus on the main players, but also focused on the wives, mistresses, kids, and families of the gangsters involved. It was a family affair, and this was a realization that Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi clearly pointed out in their excellent script full of crisp diologue and plenty of substance.Another great thing about Goodfellas is that gangsters, bosses, villains were all given a heavy dosage of human character. They were all people you can relate to, they weren't just existing and talking to progress the plot, they engaged in deep conversations about subjects that were not always related to their job. When the audience can associate themselves with the people in the film, it's a great connection, and few films can connect better than Goodfellas. It never feels like a film that is 146 minutes long.Complimenting the superb writing was the phenomenal acting. Every single performance was excellent, from the small (Samuel L. Jackson) to the much bigger roles (Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta). The excellent cast of actors and actresses contributed mightily to the powerfulness, and the humbleness of the movie, as it humanized the lifestyles of mobs, gangsters, and the mafia. Even the rampaging murderer Joe Pesci portrayed was likable because despite his rage and murderous attitude, you can still feel his admiration and care for some of the people around him.But the standout feature of Goodfellas has got to be the phenomenal directing of Martin Scorsese. Prior to Goodfellas, there was not a single director that perfectly mixes long shots, close-ups, track-shots, freeze-frames, long takes, and gritty hand-held-like cinematography like Scorsese. The movie lacked the long, artsy, pointless sweeping shots of most gangster films before 1990; not a single shot or scene of Goodfellas was unnecessary. For example the wedding scene of the first Godfather went on for too long because of its constant shots of the wedding events; now compare that to the epic long tracking shot of the main character entering the Copacabana. The action and the mayhem was always close-up, sometimes with a gun pointed directly at the camera, as if it was right on your face.Bottom Line If you enjoy a good film, then Goodfellas is for you. If you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest displays of perfect directing in the history of film, and easily the best crime film you'll ever witness. From the writing to the acting to the music selected to the flawless mix of style and substance, Goodfellas set the bar much higher for films of its kind, and all adult films overall. It's one of the first modern Hollywood films to not have that Hollywood touch; as it remains down-to-earth, and allowed for a similar R-rated crime masterpiece (Pulp Fiction) to flourish a couple of years later.While the general public usually ranks The Godfather as the quintessential crime film, I am one of the few that will safely say that The Godfather is overrated, and it's because movies like Goodfellas exist. This film is very realistic, very intense, and full of so many spectacular moments, you'll need multiple viewings to truly embellish yourself in it all. This movie is literally only one scene away from cinematic perfection (the infamous Last Day as a Wiseguy scene ran just a bit too long). I strongly recommend this movie, as it will change the way you watch movies. And if you are aspiring to be in the film industry, it will change the way you make them.

Some of them have been sweet, some sad and some wistful. Frailty is probably the most terrifying and unsettling coming-of-age movie of all time, a near brilliant perspective on just how jarring and awful the transition from child to adult can be&#x85;and how that journey doesn't always end up in the place we want it to.On a rainy night in Dallas, a man calling himself Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into FBI headquarters and insists on seeing the agent in charge of the search for the God's Hand killer. Fenton tells FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) that the serial murderer is Fenton's brother. Doyle is understandably dubious. In his law enforcement experience, people don't just walk in and tell you who the killer is. So Fenton has to explain it to him. He tells Doyle the story of his childhood, how young Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and his three years younger brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) were happy living behind the public rose garden in Thurman, Texas with their mechanic father (Bill Paxton). At least they were happy, until their father walked into the boys' room and told them he'd been visited by an angel and given a holy mission to destroy demons in the world.Dad tells Fenton and Adam that God has given him a list of people who aren't people and will command him to exterminate them using a metal pipe, a pair of work gloves and an ax with the name Otis carved into the handle. And it's not just Dad's job. Fenton and Adam are to help as well. At first, Fenton tries to deny what's happened to his family. But when he sees his dad out by the shed in the middle of the night with a woman bound and gagged at his feet, Fenton can't deny it any longer. Dad claims that when he touches these people their demonic nature is revealed and young Adam, seemingly caught up in his father's madness, claims he sees that too. All Fenton sees is innocent people being butchered by his father. Adult Fenton tells Agent Doyle that he tried everything he could think of to stop the killings, but Agent Doyle knows there's something Fenton isn't telling him. Something shocking and unbelievable. Something Fenton has to show Agent Doyle so he can truly understand the story of the Meeks family.Frailty is very smartly written, well acted and looks really good. The story cleverly blends a child's loss of innocence with the more mature concept of falling away from God and ties it all up in chains of Gothic horror. It eschews cheap scare tactics in favor of a pervasive sense of dread that flows under even the sunniest of circumstances. There's a quiet strength to all of the performances, particularly Matt O'Leary. The fear and conflict he shows in Fenton when his father, the center of his existence, apparently transforms into a murderous lunatic feels deep and true. His struggle to escape this impossible, insane situation is as frightening as any of Dad's ax murders. Bill Paxton also does some impressive work, letting the audience see just enough of the father's humanity to make him relatable but still giving him a frightening unknowability. Paxton's direction is just as impressive. He bestows upon the movie a leisurely pace, like a more normal coming-of-age story, which only emphasizes the creepiness and unease of this bizarre tale. Paxton demonstrates a fine visual sense as well, crafting scenes of such awful normality that they're scarier than the blood-drenched slaughterfests of a thousand lesser films.Frailty is a dark and violent movie. However, there is very little gore and not even that much bad language. There's virtually nothing about this movie that is exploitative or sensational, in the worst sense of that word. It's not simply content to stoke the baser emotions, but aspires to provoke an intellectual uncertainty that's much harder to shake. Most horror films are aimed at teenagers and relatively stupid teenagers at that. This is a horror movie for grown ups and I highly recommend it.

Dad claims that when he touches these people their demonic nature is revealed and young Adam, seemingly caught up in his father's madness, claims he sees that too. All Fenton sees is innocent people being butchered by his father. Adult Fenton tells Agent Doyle that he tried everything he could think of to stop the killings, but Agent Doyle knows there's something Fenton isn't telling him. Something shocking and unbelievable. Something Fenton has to show Agent Doyle so he can truly understand the story of the Meeks family.Frailty is very smartly written, well acted and looks really good. The story cleverly blends a child's loss of innocence with the more mature concept of falling away from God and ties it all up in chains of Gothic horror. It eschews cheap scare tactics in favor of a pervasive sense of dread that flows under even the sunniest of circumstances. There's a quiet strength to all of the performances, particularly Matt O'Leary. The fear and conflict he shows in Fenton when his father, the center of his existence, apparently transforms into a murderous lunatic feels deep and true. His struggle to escape this impossible, insane situation is as frightening as any of Dad's ax murders. Bill Paxton also does some impressive work, letting the audience see just enough of the father's humanity to make him relatable but still giving him a frightening unknowability. Paxton's direction is just as impressive. He bestows upon the movie a leisurely pace, like a more normal coming-of-age story, which only emphasizes the creepiness and unease of this bizarre tale. Paxton demonstrates a fine visual sense as well, crafting scenes of such awful normality that they're scarier than the blood-drenched slaughterfests of a thousand lesser films.Frailty is a dark and violent movie. However, there is very little gore and not even that much bad language. There's virtually nothing about this movie that is exploitative or sensational, in the worst sense of that word. It's not simply content to stoke the baser emotions, but aspires to provoke an intellectual uncertainty that's much harder to shake.

Some of them have been sweet, some sad and some wistful. Frailty is probably the most terrifying and unsettling coming-of-age movie of all time, a near brilliant perspective on just how jarring and awful the transition from child to adult can be&#x85;and how that journey doesn't always end up in the place we want it to.On a rainy night in Dallas, a man calling himself Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into FBI headquarters and insists on seeing the agent in charge of the search for the God's Hand killer. Fenton tells FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) that the serial murderer is Fenton's brother. Doyle is understandably dubious. In his law enforcement experience, people don't just walk in and tell you who the killer is. So Fenton has to explain it to him. He tells Doyle the story of his childhood, how young Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and his three years younger brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) were happy living behind the public rose garden in Thurman, Texas with their mechanic father (Bill Paxton). At least they were happy, until their father walked into the boys' room and told them he'd been visited by an angel and given a holy mission to destroy demons in the world.Dad tells Fenton and Adam that God has given him a list of people who aren't people and will command him to exterminate them using a metal pipe, a pair of work gloves and an ax with the name Otis carved into the handle. And it's not just Dad's job. Fenton and Adam are to help as well. At first, Fenton tries to deny what's happened to his family. But when he sees his dad out by the shed in the middle of the night with a woman bound and gagged at his feet, Fenton can't deny it any longer.

Fitzcarraldo is probably the best film about a middle aged European male ice-maker whom is based in Peru and has a fondness for opera so much so that he tries to construct his own opera house, that you're ever likely to see; a two and a half hour tale of one man and his eccentric dream to venture into the unknown so as to achieve the nigh-on impossible. The crux of the man's plight is highlighted in a simple exchange between he and someone else Do you have any idea what you're doing? snorts the individual. Something no one ever has our lead retorts. We ask the question the initial character asks, we ask the question to both the lead character and even to those working on the film; their respective replies are in the undertakings of such missions, and it is a reply well worth seeing.The titular character is a certain businessman of Irish descent named Brian Fitzgerald; his surname of which is the origin of his nickname and film title Fitzcarraldo, he is played by Klaus Kinski and lives with his wife Molly (Cardinale) in a small, down trodden hut in a Peruvian village at around about the start of the 20th Century. The first time we see him and his wife, they have just arrived at a large opera house on the continent of South America after having rowed down the Amazon River for two days by themselves in a small boat, only to then struggle through the general opera area as they strive to catch a glimpse of an ongoing performance. The sequence is the first instance in which our lead goes to extraordinary lengths purely for the opera, the linkage being the travelling under somewhat extreme circumstances in a boat down a stretch of water so as to get closer to this medium of high art. After leaving the place somewhat disgruntled, Fitzcarraldo claims that he himself will one day run an opera house of his own.Fitzcarraldo is surrounded in squalor and generally low level living conditions; his hut surrounded by local Peruvian people whom mingle in with local farming wildlife meshing into one big, third world level of existence. His home and existence humbling; his spirit, boldness and levels of aspiration sky high; his target a patch of land deep within the jungles under-looking the Andes mountains, a patch that is, according to those whom live in and around there, unfinished by God. The film is ultimately a tale about the plight of a man attempting to bring a piece of high culture to a zone of low level and dishevelled living, further still encompassing a battle between man and nature. The items of entertainment and things you do to kill time when granted spare time of your own in and around Fitz's existence comes in the form of gambling and card playing; the film allowing both us and Fitz to observe the sorts that indulge in this activity as being less than desirable and not particularly bothered by just sitting around and loosing money if it means a good time with a bunch of guys.His coming into contact with such living conditions, the world around him and the fact he must accept this is where he is in the world with what he really likes a two day row away down a perilous river spurns him into action. Upon hearing of this untouched patch of jungle land, located deep within the dense rural wilderness and amongst dangerous local natives he sets out to attain his dream. A prior coming together of both director Werner Herzog and lead actor Klaus Kinski in the jungle saw them produce 1972's Aguirre, The Wrath of God; with said film culminating in Kinski's own character on a boat and in the middle of the dense, rural wilderness that was a large jungle dreaming or aspiring to greater things which appeared impossible. Fitzcarraldo sees Kinski pick up where he left off, so to speak, as he takes to the waters of South America once again with a vision in his head of greater; larger; more expansive targets that at first appear fruitless in the attempting of said feats.Fitz sets off after having got a hold of, and consequently touched up to the best of his ability, an old steam boat with which he places an ex-seaman from the Netherlands as the captain of complete with a makeshift crew.

The problem is, the woman he remakes is his daughter, his infatuation is incestuous and she's busy restoring or remaking a fresco in a church. End result? An obsessive remake of a film about remakes and obsessions which is itself about the destructive obsession of remaking. In other words, its an allegory for not only the postmodern predicament, but De Palma's own brand of cinema, which stages revivalism as a form of necrophilia, indecency, voyeurism or incest. The plot Cliff Robertson plays Michael Courtland, a man paralysed by melancholia. Courtland, we learn, lost his wife and daughter during a bungled kidnapping and ransom situation many years ago. Rather than pay the kidnappers money, Courtland filled a suitcase with blank pieces of paper, an act of deception which led to the deaths of his wife and daughter. And that is the awful, crippling weight Courtland now bears he chose the money over his family. Over the real image. Money thus become abhorrent to Courtland, and he begins to increasingly associate his wealth with the loss of his wife and child. This becomes the first risk of the film because he dared not risk losing something valuable, Courtland has lost the ability to find value in anything.Years later, however, Courtland sees a double of his dead wife. She's not only a perfect image but an impossible image, as she looks not as she would be now, but exactly as she looked then. Furthermore, this strange doppelganger is working on &#x96; naturally - the restoration of a local church. It is here where she faces a dilemma beneath one of the church's frescoes seems to be another painting. It could be a great lost masterpiece or it could be nothing. This is the second risk of the film should she risk destroying the fresco for the sake of what might only be a stain?Of course this dilemma, this risk, is doubled in both Courtland and the doppelganger should he investigate and dig deeper at the risk of destroying this young woman, or worse, destroying his image of her? And should she dig deeper into Courtland, at the risk of losing a potential lover?The film's ending, suffused with a dream-like haze (indeed, everything and everyone in the film seems dead, ghostly, like resurrected images), initially seems to be a happy ending, a moment of resolution, but look closer and it is a vaporous, disturbing, distinctly creepy thing; father and daughter, subject and object, lover and incestuous image, spinning around and around, gripping each other's hands&#x85;One must remember that De Palma directed both Phantom of the Paradise and Get To Know Your Rabbit before Obsession. Paradise was about a devilish record producer who constantly resurrects nostalgia bands and an artist who, in aligning himself with a parasitic devil, sells his soul in order to make easy cash. So if Obsession is about resurrecting images from the past, Phantom's preoccupied with a resurrecting of past sounds. And of course Get To Know Your Rabbit is about a man who quits this soul-deadening cycle to become an artist. How does he do this? He becomes a magician (a career choice which leads to him being exiled and ostracised by friends, co-workers and family) and trains under none other than Orson Welles, a director kicked out of Hollywood for refusing to sell his soul (or more correctly, repeatedly forced to sell his soul) and for being too original. Problem is, as soon as the film's hero becomes a successful magician, the devils come knocking again, quite literally consuming and turning the magician's humble art into an insidious version of corporate hell.The character arcs of every film De Palma made during this period therefore reflects his own career trajectory. Fired from Get To Know Your Rabbit, with his early satirical\/counterculture films making little money and with his career almost over with, De Palma was pushed, like Welles, into making thrillers to keep working. These thrillers are typically dismissed as works of pastiche (they are), but there's always a critical mind, a satirist, operating just underneath. In this regard, something like Black Dahlia, dismissed as noir homage, should really be viewed through the lens of De Palma's more political films (Redacted etc), or even the more playful Phantom of Paradise; one's about the rot of the music industry, the other about the rot of the image factory. Incidentally, the majority of Obsession's incestuous subplot was edited out (or cleverly masked using edits and fades) due to protests made by Bernard Herrmann and the film's producers. The result is the film's confused approach to the father and daughter romance at its core. Their incestuous relationship is not only barely acknowledged, but shamefully covered up.8\/10 &#x96; A lushly shot, macabre comedy. Worth one viewing.

And should she dig deeper into Courtland, at the risk of losing a potential lover?The film's ending, suffused with a dream-like haze (indeed, everything and everyone in the film seems dead, ghostly, like resurrected images), initially seems to be a happy ending, a moment of resolution, but look closer and it is a vaporous, disturbing, distinctly creepy thing; father and daughter, subject and object, lover and incestuous image, spinning around and around, gripping each other's hands&#x85;One must remember that De Palma directed both Phantom of the Paradise and Get To Know Your Rabbit before Obsession. Paradise was about a devilish record producer who constantly resurrects nostalgia bands and an artist who, in aligning himself with a parasitic devil, sells his soul in order to make easy cash. So if Obsession is about resurrecting images from the past, Phantom's preoccupied with a resurrecting of past sounds. And of course Get To Know Your Rabbit is about a man who quits this soul-deadening cycle to become an artist. How does he do this? He becomes a magician (a career choice which leads to him being exiled and ostracised by friends, co-workers and family) and trains under none other than Orson Welles, a director kicked out of Hollywood for refusing to sell his soul (or more correctly, repeatedly forced to sell his soul) and for being too original. Problem is, as soon as the film's hero becomes a successful magician, the devils come knocking again, quite literally consuming and turning the magician's humble art into an insidious version of corporate hell.The character arcs of every film De Palma made during this period therefore reflects his own career trajectory. Fired from Get To Know Your Rabbit, with his early satirical\/counterculture films making little money and with his career almost over with, De Palma was pushed, like Welles, into making thrillers to keep working. These thrillers are typically dismissed as works of pastiche (they are), but there's always a critical mind, a satirist, operating just underneath. In this regard, something like Black Dahlia, dismissed as noir homage, should really be viewed through the lens of De Palma's more political films (Redacted etc), or even the more playful Phantom of Paradise; one's about the rot of the music industry, the other about the rot of the image factory. Incidentally, the majority of Obsession's incestuous subplot was edited out (or cleverly masked using edits and fades) due to protests made by Bernard Herrmann and the film's producers. The result is the film's confused approach to the father and daughter romance at its core. Their incestuous relationship is not only barely acknowledged, but shamefully covered up.8\/10 &#x96; A lushly shot, macabre comedy. Worth one viewing.

The problem is, the woman he remakes is his daughter, his infatuation is incestuous and she's busy restoring or remaking a fresco in a church. End result? An obsessive remake of a film about remakes and obsessions which is itself about the destructive obsession of remaking. In other words, its an allegory for not only the postmodern predicament, but De Palma's own brand of cinema, which stages revivalism as a form of necrophilia, indecency, voyeurism or incest. The plot Cliff Robertson plays Michael Courtland, a man paralysed by melancholia. Courtland, we learn, lost his wife and daughter during a bungled kidnapping and ransom situation many years ago. Rather than pay the kidnappers money, Courtland filled a suitcase with blank pieces of paper, an act of deception which led to the deaths of his wife and daughter. And that is the awful, crippling weight Courtland now bears he chose the money over his family. Over the real image. Money thus become abhorrent to Courtland, and he begins to increasingly associate his wealth with the loss of his wife and child. This becomes the first risk of the film because he dared not risk losing something valuable, Courtland has lost the ability to find value in anything.Years later, however, Courtland sees a double of his dead wife. She's not only a perfect image but an impossible image, as she looks not as she would be now, but exactly as she looked then.

Joseph Cotten is remarkably passive in the opening, something that stays with him till he sees his niece, Charlotte Charlie Newton, played by Teresa Wright. The movie belongs to those two. Macdonald Carey was so young I didn't recognize him playing Charlotte's love interest, and this is Hume Cronyn's first screen appearance. Patricia Collinge is great as Charlotte's mother (Emma Oakley Newton), the sister of the sinister Charles Oakley (Cotten). Charlotte is named after her mother's brother, and there are jokes throughout that the two are twins, telepathically connected.We know that something's wrong with Charles Oakley from the beginning, but we haven't a clue what it is. When he arrives at sunny Santa Rosa, California, on the steam train, we get to my favorite scene. I have no idea how Hitchcock pulled it off. The train steams into the station trailing a black cloud of exhaust which covers the sky and casts a dark shadow over the whole scene - Charles is here. It's like MacBeth when the witches say, Something wicked this way comes.Cotten is great as Uncle Charlie. Smooth, affable, courteous when it pays for him. I got more out of watching him with his back to the camera than most actors give me when they face the camera. Cotten knew how to sell Charlie to me just by how he stood and walked. You know Charlie is a very dangerous sociopath without ever knowing why you know it or what the danger really is. Collinge's Emma is beautiful as the loving, gracious sister with no clue what her little brother has become.Teresa Wright plays the main character, the hero. This is not a typical Hitchcock movie where the hero is a good guy trapped in a bad man's clothes from which he must extricate himself and convince the cops he didn't do it. Charlotte is a good girl leaving no doubt about her goodness. The issue is coming to grips with the evil Charlie brings into their home. Wright is great as we see her spiral from joy to despair as Charlie's nature begins to expose itself. The conflict is how to protect Emma from knowing the real Charlie.Thornton Wilder contributed to the screenplay, and the beginning when we see Charlotte and her family is pure Wilder - families are supposed to be happy, they talk, they are all adults (even the 9-year-old). But as Charlie works his way on the Newtons, things get dark. Our Town goes sour as death becomes all too real. Charlie takes Charlotte where she's never been before. It's a place where no small-town girl before World War II needs to go, a place she shouldn't even know exists. Sally Benson was co-screenwriter for this movie. She may be best known for her short stories of growing up in St. Louis, which were made into Meet Me in St. Louis, directed by Vincent Minnelli and starring Judy Garland (although Benson did the screenplay for Viva Las Vegas, too.) How you get from happy, frothy musicals to foreboding Santa Ana is a mystery.Alma Reville also gets screenwriter credit. She was Hitchcock's wife, so I'm guessing where the darkness came from. Mystery solved. Nothing like being married to Alfred Hitchcock to bring out the darkness in one's soul.And Hitchcock knew his way around a set with a camera. He used the sets here with his usual greatness, giving us shots of Charlie and Charlotte that emphasized their dynamic relationship. Good and evil was black and white in those days, and although we're offered an excuse for Charlie's sociopathy it doesn't really hold water. Hitchcock doesn't really care how Charlie got that way; the issue here is Charlie and Charlotte. The tension is from Charlotte's journey of discovery, not Charlie's.

That is however when a charming Clara Clayton, (Mary Steenbergen) comes to town, Doc suddenly finds himself head over heals for her. While this is going on, Marty's short temper lands him a staged fight with the notorious Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Not only that, but the Delorean time machine is still not functioning correctly.The original theatrical release landed on Friday, May 24th, 1990 - Memorial Day weekend. Limited places around the United States were showing all three films back to back to back.What makes the third film exciting in it's own way is that this was a first chance to go into the wild west from the perspective of a time traveler, not somebody who was already there. This had never been done before, let alone having a time travel series reach a second sequel. The only other storyline that is remotely like this is A Yankie Doodle in King Arthur's Court, which is a plot that has been a bit over-exhausted.True fans of Back to The Future will no be disappointed. All of the main actors from the first two films returned, (minus Crispen Glover who had a few problems with the way his character was portrayed). Tom Wilson who plays Biff Tannen in the series made history by taking on multiple roles of the Tannen family members, Griff Tannen, Old Biff, Biff in 1985 and Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.Rumors of a fourth film have gone across the web and back. It is in the contract with Universal and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have stated that it ends with the third film. The only other versions were the Saturday morning cartoon that ran from 1991 to 1993 and the Ride at Universal from 1991 to 2007.
