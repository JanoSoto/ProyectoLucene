Some of the performances were very good, while others were bordering on simply bad.  The film itself was beautiful, yet the lines were hard to stomach, to say the least.  But this is the most baffling part of all given all its faults, Pearl Harbor is addictive.  I've seen it twice and I want to again.Here's a brief synopsis of the great performances Josh Harnett, Ben Affleck, Tom Sizemore, Kate Beckinsale, and Ewen Bremmer.  Josh was not only adorable, but he good enough to not let the lines drag down his performance, with the exception of I think World War Two just started.  Ben Affleck was good because he wasn't made out to be perfect.  The scene where he busts his nose twice in one day was a very well played out scene.  Tom Sizemore actually has a hand up in this category because I consider him the definitive actor when it comes to war movies, especially WWII.  Kate Beckinsale was so beautiful and so poingnant that she it could arguably be said that she's a candidate for the new leading lady of Hollywood. Finally, Ewwn Bremmer.  Honestly, I had not seen him before this movie, but he was just so charming.  The scene where he's struggling to say The Japs are here was so painfully ironic that I gotta give him props.I'm too nice to mention names, but if you're smart you'll realize that those who didn't make the great list weren't so great, and that includes some big names.Basically, if you pay attention to statistics, this movie is not so good. However, if you listen to a big skeptical crtitic like me, ironically you will like this movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2001","score":"","review":"  Pearl Harbor baffles me.

The movie wasn't about Pearl Harbor at all, it was a dopey, cliche love story SET IN Pearl Harbor.  I was expecting to see a gripping war story and instead saw a three hour melodrama with a very expensive fireworks display thrown in.  I did enjoy watching the special effects, but that alone can't make a movie good.I think that the standard for the current generation of WWII movies should definitely be Saving Private Ryan.  That was an excellent movie.  The opening sequence was unbelievable, and it set the tone for the entire film. They didn't taint the storyline by throwing in a stupid love plot to sell tickets to 16 year olds, this movie was deadly serious.  Then came Enemy at the Gates.  Not bad, unfortunately there was a love sub plot, but it was just that, a sub plot.  Then comes Pearl Harbor, where the (factual) battle is the sub-plot, and the true focus is this absolutely dopey (fictitious) love story.SORT-OF SPOILER ahead, but it was shown in the trailer on tvLike I said, I did like the battle sequence, but even that got silly fast. First off, I expected more from Cuba Gooding Jr's role.  His role was basically a cameo, an afterthought.  All he did was appear for about five minutes, just enough to gain the audience's approval,  and then assume the role of hero as he shoots a plane down from his sinking ship.  He was there for the sole purpose of putting him in the trailers to sell more tickets.SPOILERS AHEADSecondly, they had to portray Ben Affleck and his best friend as superheroes, the only two pilots who could cause any damage at all to the Japanese.  They make it to a nearby airfield, and there's only a few planes that are ready to fly, how 'bout that?  It gets better.  Then, the first guy (a nameless pilot) gets into a plane, tries to take off, and gets shot to pieces on his takeoff roll.  Of course!  We can't have some schmoe cramping Ben Affleck's style, right?  Next, our heroes mount their steeds, and wow! They made it off the ground to fight the Zeroes!  Then the Japanese pilots instantly go brain dead, and Ben and company start picking them off as if they were shooting at hang gliders.  And then it gets even better!  Ben and his friend each have three zeroes on their tail, and they can't shake them! Oh no!  So what do they do?  They pull the same whacky hi-jinx that they did at the beginning of the film, and play chicken!  Ben and his friend come barreling toward each other, all the while the enemy fighters are courteous enough not to fire a single shot at them, and at the last possible second, our heroes turn away from each other and the zeroes are all destroyed in a massive midair pile-up!  At this point, I literally covered my mouth and began to laugh uncontrollably.  It was contagious, as my girlfriend saw me and she, too started to laugh.  That dogfight scene was so silly, I was beside myself.  If that film had even the slightest shred of seriousness in it, at that point it went down in flames along with the six zeroes that crashed into each other.  The only thing I could think of was, C'mon Luke, it'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back at home! (a Star Wars quote for those of you who don't recognize it)OK, YOU CAN LOOK AGAIN, END OF SPOILERS.So to sum up, I'd say rent the film on video or DVD, fast-forward till the battle scene, watch that part, and return it.  This movie made a mockery of Pearl Harbor, it used that terrible attack as nothing more than a backdrop for a ridiculous love story and an excuse to spend millions of dollars on special effects.

(a Star Wars quote for those of you who don't recognize it)OK, YOU CAN LOOK AGAIN, END OF SPOILERS.So to sum up, I'd say rent the film on video or DVD, fast-forward till the battle scene, watch that part, and return it.  This movie made a mockery of Pearl Harbor, it used that terrible attack as nothing more than a backdrop for a ridiculous love story and an excuse to spend millions of dollars on special effects.  If you want to see the REAL Pearl Harbor movie, it's at most video stores.  It's called, Tora! Tora! Tora!

It clearly lacks the likeable, quirky characters of the original trilogy. It also lacks a villain that we can really enjoy hating. Yes, I know it's the phantom menace. I genuinely enjoy the idea of Senator Palpatine\/Darth Sidious pulling the strings behind the scenes. However, a great opportunity was lost by making Darth Maul such a one-note villain. I remember fans (and myself) just gasping with awe when we first saw the trailer for the movie in the fall of '98. That tattooed face, and the double-bladed lightsaber! Such possibilities. Who knew that he'd have more lines in the tone poem commercial than in the entire film? What the original trilogy lacked in fight choreography, it made up for with dramatic intrigue. Luke being taunted and enticed to come over to the dark side, minus one hand. Vader threatening to corrupt Leia....In Phantom Menace, wonderful fight choreography, but no drama to connect the characters to each other. Why wouldn't Qui-Gonn ask Maul about who he is or what he wants?Another sad reality is that, as others have stated, it seems as though the actors didn't quite know the nature of what they were acting and reacting to. George Lucas is certainly a master storyteller. However, we can only hope that in Episode II, he'll provide the players with a greater understanding of the true nature of what will be filling in the bluescreen spaces that the actors have to work around.And though I'm loathe to admit it, the storyline could have used tightening. Loathe because I'd hate to send a message to Lucas that his audience can't really grasp or embrace complex storylines and situations. However, the review that heads up this section illustrates how many fans just didn't get it. The phantom menace IS NOT the trade federation. They are the puppets of the true menace, which I thought was pretty clear anyway--Darth Sidious\/Senator Palpatine. The true menace is the one that represents the real danger, not the seeming threat easily identified right in front of you...My only wish for the next film in the series is that a greater effort will be made to give the characters some weight and depth...and humor. At the same time, that humor can exist within the structure of a very serious and intense story, more philosophically aligned with The Empire Strikes Back than with the more teen\/kid targeted efforts in The Phantom Menace and ROTJ.In summary, TPM is a good movie and is useful in that it introduces our favorite galaxy far, far away and the situations that will shape that galaxy.

He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.

It's a good thing he said Americans, because he easily could've been speaking about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, the trio involved in a love triangle plot that is one of the movie's pitfalls. The sequence of the attack itself is magnificent, but is bookended by the development of the sappy love story and the American attack on Japan. It's not a good sign when, forty minutes into the movie, you find yourself favoring the trailer over the actual movie.Beginning a movie with character development is a good thing, but only if you know how to iron it out. The film opens in Tennessee, with childhood friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) playing pilots in a barn. Moving along a couple of years, they are pilots in the United States armed forces, and like most pilots do, they spend their leave chasing nurses, who are just as man-hungry as the cadets.To make a long and tedious story short, Rafe meets Evelyn, falls in love with her, and is called away to duty in Britain. Circumstances intervene, and Rafe returns to find that Danny and Evelyn are now lovers, casting the whole relationship into strife just in time for the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese air forces.The movie tries unsuccessfully to balance the love story with historical facts and events. Every now and then, we leave their happy lives together to venture to the United States War Department, where Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) and President Roosevelt serve little purpose except to foreshadow the impending attack that we already know is imminent (the title, duh!). We're also given a dosage of Japanese movements, from their planning of the bombing to Japanese naval craft and planes making their way to Hawaii. If we had more of this kind of material, the movie just might work.But instead, it loses focus from the real story behind Pearl Harbor, settling for the love story in hopes of bringing out some sort of human drama to bring out our emotions for the tragedy as a whole. This brings out the ever-present Titanic machinations, as it also included fiction with history. Now, I cannot begin to criticize the historical aspect of the film; I know too little about the whole sequence of events to make a comparison. But what I can tell you is that Titanic was able to provide us with likeable, involving characters amidst a very accurate historical setting.For some reason, the same formula applied here fails. We can't really care for Evelyn, Danny and Rafe because of the story they are given. There's toomany romance clichés which bury the characters in a mess of break-ups and budding romance similar to the switches that an everyday, stereotypical teenage girl would make. Maybe that's an audience-targeting tactic, or just an honest mistake. Either way, the love story does nothing but add on the baggage, filling the cracks with sappy one-liners and unconvincing dialogue.And the movie's turn of events after the actual bombing itself is ludicrous and draggy. It makes Rafe and Danny out to be heroes known among all, hoping to instill some air of patriotism alongside flag wavers and cheers from the men in the water as they successfully down two Japanese fighter planes. Soon after, they must leave on a mission to Tokyo, where they set out to perform a counterstrike against the Japanese. At one point, one of the characters (I think it was Doolittle, played by Alec Baldwin), makes the statement that the mission is to avenge Pearl Harbor. Obviously an attempt to connect this action with the previous sequences, but no such luck. It goes on for too long, and wouldn't you know it, there has to be more of the love story involved as well.Which brings me to my discussion of the actual attack portion of the movie. This is the section to see, if you are willing to stick it out until then. The intensity really does reach a high note as the planes begin descending on Hawaii, and although we know what will happen, it's quite exciting and moving to watch it all unfold onscreen. The bombing of the ships does not happen too fast, but gets it just right by taking its time in showing us the panic in and out of the ships in the bay. Another high point is the events that take place in the hospital ward, where thousands of wounded soldiers begins appearing. The movie does well with this entire sequence, not only because of some spectacular special effects, but because the love story characters are left alone to perform their real duties, leaving behind the sap and giving us a real taste of human drama.In summation, Pearl Harbor does not live up to the hype surrounding it. The human drama and excitement of the attack on American forces is drowned by the love story, which never reaches a level of reality, while the ending flatlines completely. I had many questions at the end of the movie is this really the work of Randall Wallace, who also wrote the magnificent Braveheart?

Even men friends have loved it -- the fight scene especially, I'm told. Audience laughing loudly and throughout. Was slightly disappointed in ending (bit too contrived and sappy) and annoyed, occasionally, with melodramatic violins (e.g., during Tarts and Vicars party, when Bridget smoked with her dad outside and during Naked-American-Stick-Insect- Sitting-on-Bathtub moment). Otherwise, the music enhanced many of the scenes (e.g., All by Myself, It's raining men, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, etc.). But the crowing glory was Renee's performance. Without her nuances of expression and comedic timing -- I think audiences would have been more critical of this first-time director's cut-and-pasted look. It definitely needed tighter editing and a better flow (musically and otherwise). Also, the British humor was sometimes completely lost on the Americans. Most American women don't find sexual flirting in the workplace funny, or comments from men to women like ...you dirty bit__ or ...you ham-fisted cu__ funny either. Nor do Americans find heavy smoking and drinking particularly funny. They can't really relate. Wonderfully naughty British humor. Would highly recommend the film, despite criticisms. To tell you the truth, when I raised these issues with friends, they all thought I was being too picky. Everyone I know has adored this film.

Was slightly disappointed in ending (bit too contrived and sappy) and annoyed, occasionally, with melodramatic violins (e.g., during Tarts and Vicars party, when Bridget smoked with her dad outside and during Naked-American-Stick-Insect- Sitting-on-Bathtub moment). Otherwise, the music enhanced many of the scenes (e.g., All by Myself, It's raining men, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, etc.). But the crowing glory was Renee's performance. Without her nuances of expression and comedic timing -- I think audiences would have been more critical of this first-time director's cut-and-pasted look. It definitely needed tighter editing and a better flow (musically and otherwise). Also, the British humor was sometimes completely lost on the Americans. Most American women don't find sexual flirting in the workplace funny, or comments from men to women like ...you dirty bit__ or ...you ham-fisted cu__ funny either. Nor do Americans find heavy smoking and drinking particularly funny. They can't really relate. Wonderfully naughty British humor. Would highly recommend the film, despite criticisms. To tell you the truth, when I raised these issues with friends, they all thought I was being too picky. Everyone I know has adored this film.

I loved it, but only because of the dancing, the costumes, and the fact that, like all the other girls in my class, I was in love with Paul Mercurio.Nine years later, after seeing Moulin Rouge for the third time, I remembered how much I loved this film as a child, and so I went out a week ago and bought the video. I watched it eight times in six days.This is an amazing film. It evokes such incredible feelings in me, and I appreciate it on so many levels as a dance student, as a film student, and as a human being.When I was eleven I never realised how electrifying the chemistry is between Mercurio and Morice. The scene where they dance behind the curtain at the state championships gives me goosebumps; my tape is probably already wearing thin in that section! And the climactic ending is wonderful; verging on cliche, but that is what makes it so uplifting.The characters are perfectly fleshed out and believable in an unbelievable way, and the comedic angle is played to perfection. My mother watched it with me on one of my repeated viewings and said, Oh, I forgot how funny this film was!. I agreed wholeheartedly.Also, another highlight is the amazing editing. Different scenes and shots are bound to each other seamlessly, and even the occasional montage of speedier cuts are not too noticeable or too imposing, as they suit the action on screen so well.This is a magical film with a simple but beautiful message. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine film making and, as previously mentioned by others, a very sweet, old-fashioned romance which doesn't resort to putting the leads in bed together to make it intense and rewarding. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2001","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I first saw this film as a little eleven year old for a school excursion.
