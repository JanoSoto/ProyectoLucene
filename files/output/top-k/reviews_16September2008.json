Eddie Murphey is a perfect voice for Donkey, but Mike Meyers doing a strange accent for Shrek just comes off odd to me. Cameron Diaz is also as annoying as always, and I wish her character was more lovable. It would move the film along better. Without giving it away, the way Lord Farquod is done away with (killed) is very unappealing and sudden to me. The ending doesn't really work.

Few films, particularly family films, in the past few years have come off as funny to me as The Emperor's New Groove. Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade, excellent) is a selfish ruler turned into a llama by a former employee after firing her. That's a funny enough concept on its own, but its simply the over-the-top, ridiculous characters that make this as hilarious as it is. Kuzco's overly selfish nature, such as him scribbling out characters on the screen so we can focus on him, is simply hilarious. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her assistant Kronk, simply hysterical as a childlike supporting character that steals every scene he is in, are both great. There are just too many laughs in this film to describe in a review, and not a single one of them deserves to be spoiled here. I'll just tell you to see it now. Your whole family can enjoy it and laugh and laugh. Not quite perfect, because of a few annoying scenes, particularly with Pacha's (John Goodman) kids and a few poor attempts at humor here. Despite that, it's a very, very funny movie. One of Disney's best, and simply one of the most hilarious films I have ever watched.***1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"16 September 2008","score":"","review":" Talk about one laugh after another.

A 13-year-old is tired of being a kid and being too small to do anything, so he finds a wishing machine and wishes to be big. He wakes up the next day in an adult body and cannot convince anyone, except his friend, who he really is. By implausible coincidence and chance, however, he ends up getting an easy job in a toy company and makes some new friends (and enemies) as well as a girlfriend along the way. The film proved to be enjoyable and even tender and moving, with great scenes such as Tom Hanks' interactions with the owner of the toy company (very funny). Nevertheless, it was not a perfect film for me. For one thing, I don't really understand why people consider this a family film just because it has kids in it. The profanity and female upper-nudity are really way too strong for a family film. I would have liked it more had it been more family-friendly. Also, some of the scenes can be a bit annoying, such as the silly ones with Tom Hanks playing around with his ice cream sundae. That said, it is still quite an enjoyable film. It is considered monumental being the first of its kind, though I actually enjoy Freaky Friday and films like that more than this one.

I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed once&#151;I heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the cliché We're men raised by women! so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this daring or original needs to understand something it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of We're men raised by women!, so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alive&#151;but the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as men&#151;once again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understand&#151;including false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax\/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 September 2008","score":"5 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining.

Kara becomes just as powerful as her cousin on her way to earth, setting up her status as a Superhero herself. Supergirl is one of those movies that you either really like, or really dislike. Most people, however, don't know what to think, so they go with their instinct, and reject the unfamiliar, and because of this, Supergirl is unfairly deemed a 'bad movie.' The goods that this film brings are rich and plentiful. We see a plethora of special effects, most of which still hold up to this day; we see Faye Dunaway, Brenda Vaccaro, Peter O Toole, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow, and Simon Ward have fun and play around with their acting chops; we see Helen Slater look beautiful, and prove she was worthy of working with her co-stars; we hear one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest marches; and we get Oscar worthy cinematography by Alan Hume. Those are undeniable. What is the big debate is the writing. The story was written with a much different style and structure, than the orthodox Superhero movie, defined by the film's predecessor, 'Superman The Movie.' But is STM could set the standard for a superhero film, being a story, then who's to say that SG couldn't do the same in order to establish a wider audience, seeing that the characters from the comic book original, though contrasted by a few devotees, are just as different? Through the film, Kara goes through many changes, learning how to cope away from home, use her powers, and ultimately defeat evil. There are so many metaphors and allegories in this film, it would be too loquacious to list them all, so I'll condense it. Supergirl, instead of setting a trend for the high flying Superhero, told more of a coming of age Superhero story, wherein our hero (heroin) must learn things about herself, about how to adapt *as* as superhero in a new place (LONG before that 'X-men' Crap.) Once she has done this, she is tested by the villain, and learns something more, and must gather herself for her next 'test.' Hmm...Something we only *assumed* Superman did in the opening scenes of STM. That's just the surface. There have been many comments on this site that list in detail, what other fine points this movie has, so I won't bother. I will say that the film is bright and colorful, like a comic book would be, and each shot is carefully planned out. Suffice to say that when people tend to dislike the film, it really is only a matter of either opinion, or just not getting it. Nothing wrong with that, but in ignorance they sound off and blast the film instead of trying to understand it more, where it's coming from, because in the end, we have a full blossomed, bona-fide Superhero who has learned as much as she has fought, and conquered. I see nothing wrong with this at all Because there isn't anything wrong.

Once she has done this, she is tested by the villain, and learns something more, and must gather herself for her next 'test.' Hmm...Something we only *assumed* Superman did in the opening scenes of STM. That's just the surface.

I will say that the film is bright and colorful, like a comic book would be, and each shot is carefully planned out. Suffice to say that when people tend to dislike the film, it really is only a matter of either opinion, or just not getting it. Nothing wrong with that, but in ignorance they sound off and blast the film instead of trying to understand it more, where it's coming from, because in the end, we have a full blossomed, bona-fide Superhero who has learned as much as she has fought, and conquered.

In fact it lacks temporal economy, as if the filmmaker was so in love with his images that he wants you to take twice as long with them as you normally would. Not all of them deserve this.But all the scenes with the daughter surely do. She is the subject a beautiful young woman with an accidentally disfigured face. Her experiment surgeon father just happens (!) to be experimenting with face transplants. The story itself is too ordinary to mention.What's remarkable is the way this woman's face is used. She usually is wearing a mask that looks eerily real. Then we see her reconstructed face, and then the mask again. First, the woman without the mask. She is an Audrey Hepburn type, actually to my mind, very much more graceful and poised. She must be a dancer, something you can see in her work with Orson earlier. Viewers at the time would have been familiar with her beauty and her off- screen scandal involving the murder of her husband's lover.

I'm not one of those people. It's not a bad film, but it never really made much of an impression on me and I find myself having a hard time sitting through the whole film sometimes. William Petersen stars as retiring FBI Agent Will Graham, who returns to his job for one last case. A serial killer on a lunar cycle is killing entire families in grisly fashion and the FBI has no leads on the psychopath, and Will Graham (the man who caught Hannibal Lecktor) is the only one who can enter his mind-frame and stop him before the next full moon.One aspect of Mann's film that catches me off guard every time I watch it is the blatant 1980's flair accompanying it. There were a lot of films from that decade that you can watch and they are somewhat timeless; this film slaps you in the face with it's 80's style. From the bright neon green opening titles to the 80's rock soundtrack swallowing some scenes, there is no forgetting what era this film is from. For the best example of all this, rewatch the final confrontation at the end of the film the use of Iron Butterfly and the strange neon purple dawn feel like something from an 80's music video.The movie did have it's highlights, mostly from the cast. While Anthony Hopkins will always be THE Hannibal Lecktor in my eyes, Brian Cox did a fantastic job as the first person to play the character. He had the same eerie sense of menace and evil as Hopkins would years later. Tom Noonan was great as psychopath Francis Dollarhyde. I didn't think he was as good as Ralph Fiennes in the 2002 version of the film, but I still enjoyed his performance as the disturbed antagonist. I should also give an honorable mention to Dennis Farina, whose performance I enjoyed in his role as Jack Crawford (Graham's superior in the FBI).The first Lecktor story has never been my favorite of the series, but it's not the worst either (that dishonor goes to the 2007 prequel fiasco). I enjoyed the novel and, while this movie takes quite a few liberties with the storyline, it manages to say true for the most part. I wish they have delved into Dollarhyde's back-story as was done in the book, giving the audience a better understanding of what created the monster; I also felt the Reba McClane plot was rushed during the final act. We get some good performances from the cast and a visual style that feels like an LSD flashback at times. It's a good addition to the Lecktor series but certainly not the best.

He begins as a selfish man using the Jews to work for him so he can make a profit. As a result, he pays to save the Jews from Hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. A large number of Jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. By the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the Jews. The scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. This is where the movie is at. It makes us all wish we could do more to help. At over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason I cannot call it perfect. Nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. The depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. Spielberg pulls it off once again. Hard to say if this should be the Best Picture of 1993, though. The Fugitive is my personal favorite movie and I would have liked that to win.

Not one of the top ten of all time for me, but a must see for all.***1\/2 out of **** ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"16 September 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Every once and a while, a movie comes around that defines a generation. EASY RIDER, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THE BREAKFAST CLUB are all Examples. I would argue, however, that no film better defines the generation it came from than REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, which aired last night on Reel 13. As a matter of fact, the cultural impact of the film as well as the legend of its star, James Dean, almost seem to overshadow what I was reminded of last night &#150; what an artfully and skillfully crafted film it is.The first thing that struck me about REBEL upon rewatching it was the extraordinary richness of the color. Director Nicholas Ray was shooting in Warner Color (at the time, each studio was working with various labs to patent their own color process), but it's more than just the film stock or processing. Much of the beauty of the color has to do with the choices Ray makes in terms of the wardrobe or the objects &#150; the red of Natalie Wood's overcoat in her first appearance, the colors in the observatory presentation, the yellow of an apron donned by Dean's screen father, Jim Backus (a.k.a. Mr. Magoo), the mustard color of Sal Mineo's wardrobe or the famous bright red coat Dean wears through much of the film. They all combine to create a beautiful palette worthy of paintings in the Louvre.The second thing that I noticed was consistently inspired framing and angles &#150; and a lot of camera motion, which was not as prevalent in the period as it is today. Ray knows exactly when to be wide and just when a close up is called for. It seems as if he shot a lot more coverage than most directors of the period and used it to perfection. The scene where Wood and Dean are alone in the mansion is notable in the sense of how tightly the two of them are framed together in such a big house &#150; as if they are the only two people in the world. Another example is during the first showdown at the observatory when the cool kids sit on Dean's car while he looks on from overhead. A few times, Ray cuts to an extreme low angle shot with the cool kids in the foreground with Dean and Sal Mineo very small and high in the way background. An unusual shot to be sure, but effective and telling. Other unorthodox ideas Ray sets forth in the film include the occasional Dutch angle (shots off the standard axis) that he uses in moments of extreme crisis (the scene with Dean's parents on the stairs and at the climax of the film). Ray has only recently been recognized as one of the era's premiere auteurs and his ahead-of-his-time work in Rebel only cements that theory.The third thing I noticed was the incredible subversiveness of the film, particularly in regards to the potential promiscuity of Natalie Wood's character (Judy) and the sexuality of Sal Mineo's character (Plato). Neither of these subjects were dealt with head-on as they were taboo at the time, but Ray certainly plants the seeds with subtleties and a clever usage of the mise-en-scene. In the beginning, the police detective subtly hints at why Judy was picked up and her relationship with her father seems awfully unusual &#150; even for the time period. As to Plato, Sal Mineo's effemininity is one thing, but details like the picture of a male actor in his locker and the way he gazes at Dean throughout the film are strong clues as to the truth of Plato's problems &#150; he is not just a boy whose parents abandoned him &#150; he is a young gay teen in a society and era that rejects homosexuality. What's particularly interesting about how careful and hidden these subtexts are is that the film works hard to spell out the surface problems each of the characters have. At one point, Dean, who is still a high school student, theorizes that Plato was trying to make he and Judy his surrogate family (quite an analysis for a 17 year-old). These surface issues that the characters have are almost too easy and laid out for us that I wonder if the extent to which they offer analysis was in part to mask or draw attention away from the more subversive aspects to the film.If Ray is the brains behind the artistry of REBEL, James Dean is the heart and soul. As many of you know, he was a disciple of the Actors Studio in New York and their style of method acting, which was slowly permeating its way into the movies in the mid-50's (STREETCAR was the first major film that prominently featured this performance style). Out of his three films, EAST OF EDEN features the most method actors, GIANT is about half and half and as a result is a weird hybrid film in terms of performance and REBEL puts Dean all alone on his method island &#150; which in a way, fits the narrative. It almost seems as if he's acting in a whole different movie. Wood is no match for him and is actually not very believable, particularly in her more emotional scenes. Similarly, Mineo's old-school theatrical performance style seems particularly archaic when pitted with Dean. Actually, only consummate character actor Edward Platt (who always seems to be playing lawyers, cops or doctors) seems to be anywhere close to Dean's level as the police psychologist Ray Fremick. With that said, Jim Backus (best known to most as Thurston Howell III on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) is extremely sweet in his role as Dean's father. While he is by no means a naturalistic actor like Dean, his portrayal of weakness (read spinelessness) is at times both bold and quite beautiful. Actors generally don't like to play characters that are weak, but Backus manages to do it with layers and dignity.

Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt the first stereotypical zombie film which would influence so many films to come after it. Night of the Living Dead was an extremely controversial film that was put down by critics, but looked at very fondly as a cult classic, and a fantastic piece of violent social commentary. The social commentary in this film is very present, and can be looked at differently by different people.Night Of The Living Dead is actually a basic 50s science fiction movie in the style of The Last Man On Earth (1963) Starring Vincent Price. Many look past the fact that Night of the Living Dead is based on the same novel as The Last Man On Earth; I Am Legend, which was recently adapted again into another movie of the same name. Night of the Living Dead balanced the 50s sci-fi theme along with modern (for the time) violence. The violence may look cheesy or tame compared to movies to come out half a decade later, but is still disturbing looking at the way this film is shot. Night of the Living Dead uses the Black and White format better than any other film I have ever seen. The black and white format adds a dark, grainy look to the film which adds a good, unsettling feeling. In my view, Night of the Living Dead may not be the goriest zombie film ever made, but is still the scariest. The dark atmosphere done by director George A. Romero is excellent, and beats anything else done in the genre. The cast is also outstanding. The movie provides some very good performances all around. The character chemistry is outstanding. A large part of the movie is simply character arguments, yet that is the fun of this film. The fun in this film comes from the great directing, which makes the viewer feel like they are in the arguments themselves. The realism of this film is almost frightening in itself. I seen this movie before having any knowledge that it was a classic, and boy was I impressed.Night of the Living Dead has done many things. It lit the match and set the fire for the zombie genre, it set plenty of interesting ground rules, established Romero as a great director, and started off one of the great trilogys of all time.

If the movie had been all serious some of the moments within the movie for sure would not had worked out and would had been painfully bad and laughable instead. But it's as if the movie had foreseen this and went with an often light and pleasant approach instead. The movie never takes itself too serious, for which you can also thank director Fraser Clarke Heston, who indeed is the son of screen legend Charlton Heston.The movie has a good story, in which the devil in flesh, played by Max von Sydow, is setting people up against each other by letting them perform tasks for them, so they can get their 'needful' thing from him. The story is nicely constructed and build up and shows a different but interesting portrayal of the devil, as a man who uses people their own sins to set them up against each other and let them commit horrible acts, without ever getting dirty hands himself.The movie has a pretty amazing cast with actors such as Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Amanda Plummer and J.T. Walsh all involved. Von Sydow plays a great role and so does Ed Harris, though for a 'main hero' he just doesn't have quite the screen time you would expect him to have. Also great was J.T. Walsh in a crazy role in which his character more and more starts to derail. These were the kind of roles he always was best at.The movie has a kind of cheap look over it.

Walsh all involved. Von Sydow plays a great role and so does Ed Harris, though for a 'main hero' he just doesn't have quite the screen time you would expect him to have. Also great was J.T. Walsh in a crazy role in which his character more and more starts to derail. These were the kind of roles he always was best at.The movie has a kind of cheap look over it. A kind of look you would perhaps more expect from a TV movie, which might be due to Fraser Clarke Heston inexperience as a director, though it also is definitely true that this movie was just fairly cheap made and got never aimed toward a large audience and in many countries never made it to the cinemas.Simply one fine and enjoyable movie, that you just don't need to take too seriously.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"16 September 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I have to declare I wasn't a fan of Stanley Kubrick. His movies weren't the type I could watch over and over again and enjoy. He was always set on adding stuff you would feel rather uncomfortable to watch.Still, I have been rediscovering Stanley Kubrick, and Barry Lyndon was one of the movies I missed before.The visual style of the movie is stunning. There are great landscapes in almost every single shot, and, because it's slow pacing, most of these shots seem like actual, beautiful, paintings. The wardrobe and make-up is quite accurate, although, since you are not so accustomed to the fashion of the time, you might find some of the extravagant hair-dos and heavily powdered faces rather laughable.The story itself surprised me. Even though most of what happens is extremely simple, I was left hooked. As I am very fond with venturing and traveling to the unknown, I felt rather excited. I'm not sure if this is was Kubrick intended, but my sympathy for Barry slowly disappeared, as he was shown more and more as an opportunist, concerned with his own status than with his own wife.Although the narrator was an informative resort, I felt it was spoiling much of the surprises, which also happened with the titling of each respective part.Most of the performances were above excellent. All of the actors understand the posture and gestures one had to have while living in that time, and so, most dialogs may sound minimal. I personally would have enjoyed more small talk between characters, but the movie was more governed by style and setting.As for the music, although very repetitive, the selections do fit the scenes good. Of course, Haendel's Sarabande heard here is beautiful and tragic at the same time. Unfortunately, you hear it far too many times.Kubrick's style is present in the movie, but I think it arrives a little late, after the first 30 minutes. For the opening scenes, I didn't feel I was watching a Stanley Kubrick movie. It was as if the first scenes were inspired by classical paintings and so, they had look like them as much as possible. Still, the long shot with a character in the center does eventually appear, and it doesn't break the whole style of the movie.I warn that, like most of Kubrick's films, you can't watch it with your friends or with the whole family. But this time it isn't because it's has strong graphic material or harsh language. It's more for how dense this movie really is. Every minute is heavy with emotion, visual elements, music, and extreme slowness.

Usually I'm not a big fan of sentimental stories or coming-of-age flicks. I'm more into action films and intriguing battles, but Stand By Me was one of those rare coming-of-age stories that I found to be extremely riveting. The tale of four boys set out on a journey to search for a dead corpse didn't have much appeal like The Goonies where seven kids search for lost treasure. However, the kids from Stand By Me exceeds The Gonnies in terms of more believable characters and the story is centered more on the boys rather then the mission that they are on. The train track scene provided a very scary incident, though it was one of the more memorable scene in the movie. I literally yelled at the boys to get off the damn tracks. The movie can boast an impressive soundtrack with classic rock and roll and doo-wop music that was widely listened to back in the late 1950's to create a nostalgic atmosphere during time when life was simpler. I was taken back a little bit by surprise that this movie was written by horror guru Stephen King (originally titled The Body). The meal ticket to this movie was superb acting by the four kids who would go on to become successful stars in their adulthood. Wil Wheaton was excellent as the intelligent, but poor self-esteemed Gordie Lachance who would grow up to follow his dreams to become a successful writer. Gordie feels left out in his family after the tragic death of of his brother Denny and is desperately yearning to find someone to encourage him in achieving his ambition. Corey Feldman turns in a hilarious role as the mentally unstable Teddy DuChamp. Like, Gordie, Teddy can't seem to find love in his family as well. His father has psychological problems. One day, Teddy's father tried to burn his ear off on an oven and got in trouble for that, making poor Teddy trying to find love. Jerry O'Connell was in top form as fat kid Vern Tedessi, a fat kid who has his doubts about his friends' quest, but tags along for moral support. But the best of the quartet goes to the late River Phoenix as rebel kid Chris Chambers. Phoenix is hugely impressive as being the kid with a tough outer demeanor with a soft spot on the inside. It's a sad ironic truth that his character in Stand By Me has his life taken away shortly just like in real life as well. The scene where Chris is crying in the woods is one of the most sensitive scenes in the story. Aside from the four boys, I have to give my hat off to Kiefer Sutherland. Over the years I have watched Sutherland vary in characters making him one of the most versatile actors then and now. As Ace, the boy's bully along with his gang of meanies, are also destined for the same mission as the four boys as they try to find the dead bodies before Gordie's gang does. It's a shame we don't see enough of Sutherland, but he was still effective in his supporting role. Although the central character is around Wheaton's Gordie, Phoenix and Sutherland turn up the best performances of the cast.Overall, this movie has plenty of witty dialogue, intriguing adventure, a suspenseful mystery and a sensitive drama that will you satisfied.

Usually I'm not a big fan of sentimental stories or coming-of-age flicks. I'm more into action films and intriguing battles, but Stand By Me was one of those rare coming-of-age stories that I found to be extremely riveting. The tale of four boys set out on a journey to search for a dead corpse didn't have much appeal like The Goonies where seven kids search for lost treasure. However, the kids from Stand By Me exceeds The Gonnies in terms of more believable characters and the story is centered more on the boys rather then the mission that they are on. The train track scene provided a very scary incident, though it was one of the more memorable scene in the movie. I literally yelled at the boys to get off the damn tracks. The movie can boast an impressive soundtrack with classic rock and roll and doo-wop music that was widely listened to back in the late 1950's to create a nostalgic atmosphere during time when life was simpler. I was taken back a little bit by surprise that this movie was written by horror guru Stephen King (originally titled The Body). The meal ticket to this movie was superb acting by the four kids who would go on to become successful stars in their adulthood. Wil Wheaton was excellent as the intelligent, but poor self-esteemed Gordie Lachance who would grow up to follow his dreams to become a successful writer. Gordie feels left out in his family after the tragic death of of his brother Denny and is desperately yearning to find someone to encourage him in achieving his ambition. Corey Feldman turns in a hilarious role as the mentally unstable Teddy DuChamp. Like, Gordie, Teddy can't seem to find love in his family as well. His father has psychological problems. One day, Teddy's father tried to burn his ear off on an oven and got in trouble for that, making poor Teddy trying to find love. Jerry O'Connell was in top form as fat kid Vern Tedessi, a fat kid who has his doubts about his friends' quest, but tags along for moral support. But the best of the quartet goes to the late River Phoenix as rebel kid Chris Chambers. Phoenix is hugely impressive as being the kid with a tough outer demeanor with a soft spot on the inside. It's a sad ironic truth that his character in Stand By Me has his life taken away shortly just like in real life as well. The scene where Chris is crying in the woods is one of the most sensitive scenes in the story. Aside from the four boys, I have to give my hat off to Kiefer Sutherland. Over the years I have watched Sutherland vary in characters making him one of the most versatile actors then and now. As Ace, the boy's bully along with his gang of meanies, are also destined for the same mission as the four boys as they try to find the dead bodies before Gordie's gang does. It's a shame we don't see enough of Sutherland, but he was still effective in his supporting role. Although the central character is around Wheaton's Gordie, Phoenix and Sutherland turn up the best performances of the cast.Overall, this movie has plenty of witty dialogue, intriguing adventure, a suspenseful mystery and a sensitive drama that will you satisfied. A definite must see! ","genre":"Adventure, Drama"}]
