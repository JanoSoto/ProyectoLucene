Not even able to remember his own name, he is further shocked by the two bullet wounds on his back, by his sudden ability to speak numerous languages, and by his Swiss safe deposit box, where he hides a gun, several fake passports, and stacks of money from multiple nations. The subject of an aggressive international manhunt, the young man is widely persecuted, yet his instincts soon reveal physical, combative abilities that repeatedly secure his escape. Constantly on the run, a chance encounter with Marie (Franka Potente from Run Lola Run) proves troublesome as she compulsively decides not to leave the fugitive's side.The Bourne Identity tries to create suspense by assigning its character the difficult mission of piecing together evidence that may reveal his true identity and bring back his memory, while simultaneously establishing the convenience of being assumed dead by his enemies. However, when dangerous enemies discover Jason Bourne is alive and launch their searches, the plot degenerates into a series of persecution scenes that sacrifice further character development in favor of thrill-seeking action. In this manner, the film's most valuable players --Ted Conklin and The Professor find no truly meaningful place in the film. (The most extreme case of lack of character development, however, is seen in Julia Stiles' Nicolette, whose role as Conklin's secretary is limited to functions that are inconsequential to plot, such as answering phones and taking notes.

We live in rural Appalachia and unfortunately, a lot of the people in the audience just didn't `get' this movie. I saw three couples get up and leave about half way through. One man mumbled `What a rip-off, this is boring' on the way out. Another couple plotted to break into Scooby Doo. That's more of a comment on the poor taste of rural Appalachians than of the quality of the movie. This film required thought to watch and some people just don't like to think.MILD SPOILERS (not too many details, like a movie trailer)My wife and I both found the move totally thrilling. It is definitely not a mindless a `Triple X' or `Mission Impossible 2' type action flick. In fact, Spielberg's film is only part action. It also contains equal measures of sci-fi, and murder mystery. Much to our delight, the film succeeded on all three fronts. So many Sci-fi pictures fail because they don't paint a believable image of the future. Spielberg creates a very plausible future universe that is *ALMOST* devoid of annoying plot holes. The holes are so minor, that I didn't even notice them until the next day. His vision of the future is one segregated by classes, where the rich live in new, completely automated luxury apartments and cruise on elevated highways far above the old city. The middle class are still living in vinyl sided or brick faced two story houses in bland suburban neighborhoods. The poor are huddled into government build apartment complexes. Advertising has run rampant. Everyone has their eyes scanned whenever they walk by a talking billboard, shop at the GAP, and even when they get on the Subway. I take it the subway sends them a bill based on their retinal scan. Personal privacy in Spielberg's future world has been compromised to a believable degree. And that in itself is kind of scary.As far as action, there are plenty of cliff hanging, high speed chases. But the highlight was a fight on the conveyor belt or a 100% automated LEXUS plant where Cruise's character escapes by driving off in a car that ends up being built around him. That's clever! Most people were caught off guard by the resolution of the mystery, but they didn't complain. The mystery plot, like the rest of the film, was not all that far fetched, and a delight when finally revealed.Some of the scenes are quite beautiful. Drenched in brilliant white light or grey industrial skies, every scene from start to end is pure eye candy.  The female `precog', Agatha, is freaky to behold while lying in her `soup' bath (you'll understand) and even weirder when on the lamb.There are so many GOOD things about this movie, so much attention to detail, that I can't possibly list everything that this film managed to do well. But there is one consistent fault Spielberg that he can't seem to shake--his incessant and predictable use of the `Hollywood ending.' In my opinion, it is the only thing holding Spielberg back from being a timeless director. In my opinion, the ending could have been way better. The film would have made more of an impact if it stopped twenty minutes earlier in the prison. The ending as it stands almost seems tacked on. I can't help but think that Spielberg did end the film where I thought it should end, but it didn't `test well' in group, so he re-wrote it. Perhaps a redneck or two at the screening test got up and walked out because it wasn't to their liking. Ah, well.

During a scheduled rendezvous with his family, he witnesses them die in a bomb explosion that also claims seven other people. A grieving Gordy discovers his wife and son were victims of a political cause instigated by a Columbian terrorist dubbed The Wolf (Cliff Curtis). He seeks out CIA agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) to bring justice to his family and also realises he saw the terrorist before the tragedy. Disappointed and frustrated with the Government?s response to not hunt down his family's killer, Gordy sets on his own vendetta to seek out The Wolf. He infiltrates Columbia, and finds himself emersed in a dangerous solo mission where he is a target for the Guerrillas and an excuse for the CIA not to pull out their forces from the country. Amidst all the potential threats, Gordy's focus remains on hunting down The Wolf and bringing justice to his family.   Collateral Damage was initially due to be released in 2001, but was postponed due it's terrorist subject matter in relation to 9\/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Although the plot is an action film involving the hero taking on terrorism, there is very little social commentary explored and surprisingly minimal flag waving as well, and it shouldn't be confused with a serious film about terrorism. It is basically a fairly tight action thriller with Arnie seeking vengeance for his beloved family. The Wolf is demonised villain to a certain extent in this film, but his character is given some depth and his actions are based on his ideologies, which makes him a little more realistic than more bad guys. Similarly, Peter Brandt's character is also portrayed as ideological driven person, and Gordy continues to confront and question his motives. The circumstances surrounding terrorism may have people questioning the purpose of this film, or the sensitive politically-correct audience may not like the representation of the Columbian guerrillas, yet 'Collateral Damage' is just an Arnie film with a plot for a change! The bad guys are bad guys, and are no more different than the cultural villains portrayed in True Lies, the Rambo films, Patriot Games and other action films with terrorists.Arnold Schwarzenegger provides a sympathetic character in Gordy and he is far from the poster boy of the all-American hero versus the third world- after all he is Austrian. There is plenty of action without being ridiculously over-the-top, and a reduced amount of gratuitous blood and gore in this film. Francesca Neri is fairly good as a Columbian mother who assists Gordy for her own personal motives, and Elias Koteas is entertaining as the dislikeable agent in Peter Brandt.  Schwarzenegger does some decent acting, and he is still entertaining to watch. The rest of the cast provide support including John Turturro and John Leguizamo in small but amusing roles, and director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) utilises the lavish locations of Columbia. The surprising aspect of 'Collateral Damage' is that it does have a fairly interesting plot where audiences can relate to the whole premise of an ordinary man seeks justice on those who killed his loved ones. This plot might have been received better and less scrutinized had terrorism not been such prominent issue in the American psyche as of late. Either way, 'Collateral Damage' provides an entertaining escapist flare that shouldn't be taken to seriously. A solid action piece that has enough thrills and a semi-realistic plot, yet ultimately doesn't offend or get too clouted with sentimentality and sees Arnold Schwarzenegger back on solid ground compared to his last few films. I recommend 'Collateral Damage', especially if you don't take it too seriously!***1\/2 out of *****!

The bad guys are bad guys, and are no more different than the cultural villains portrayed in True Lies, the Rambo films, Patriot Games and other action films with terrorists.Arnold Schwarzenegger provides a sympathetic character in Gordy and he is far from the poster boy of the all-American hero versus the third world- after all he is Austrian. There is plenty of action without being ridiculously over-the-top, and a reduced amount of gratuitous blood and gore in this film. Francesca Neri is fairly good as a Columbian mother who assists Gordy for her own personal motives, and Elias Koteas is entertaining as the dislikeable agent in Peter Brandt.  Schwarzenegger does some decent acting, and he is still entertaining to watch. The rest of the cast provide support including John Turturro and John Leguizamo in small but amusing roles, and director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) utilises the lavish locations of Columbia. The surprising aspect of 'Collateral Damage' is that it does have a fairly interesting plot where audiences can relate to the whole premise of an ordinary man seeks justice on those who killed his loved ones. This plot might have been received better and less scrutinized had terrorism not been such prominent issue in the American psyche as of late. Either way, 'Collateral Damage' provides an entertaining escapist flare that shouldn't be taken to seriously. A solid action piece that has enough thrills and a semi-realistic plot, yet ultimately doesn't offend or get too clouted with sentimentality and sees Arnold Schwarzenegger back on solid ground compared to his last few films.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"23 June 2002","score":"","review":"  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Gordy Brewer, a fire-fighter and family man with a beautiful wife and young son. During a scheduled rendezvous with his family, he witnesses them die in a bomb explosion that also claims seven other people. A grieving Gordy discovers his wife and son were victims of a political cause instigated by a Columbian terrorist dubbed The Wolf (Cliff Curtis). He seeks out CIA agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) to bring justice to his family and also realises he saw the terrorist before the tragedy. Disappointed and frustrated with the Government?s response to not hunt down his family's killer, Gordy sets on his own vendetta to seek out The Wolf. He infiltrates Columbia, and finds himself emersed in a dangerous solo mission where he is a target for the Guerrillas and an excuse for the CIA not to pull out their forces from the country. Amidst all the potential threats, Gordy's focus remains on hunting down The Wolf and bringing justice to his family.   Collateral Damage was initially due to be released in 2001, but was postponed due it's terrorist subject matter in relation to 9\/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Although the plot is an action film involving the hero taking on terrorism, there is very little social commentary explored and surprisingly minimal flag waving as well, and it shouldn't be confused with a serious film about terrorism. It is basically a fairly tight action thriller with Arnie seeking vengeance for his beloved family. The Wolf is demonised villain to a certain extent in this film, but his character is given some depth and his actions are based on his ideologies, which makes him a little more realistic than more bad guys. Similarly, Peter Brandt's character is also portrayed as ideological driven person, and Gordy continues to confront and question his motives. The circumstances surrounding terrorism may have people questioning the purpose of this film, or the sensitive politically-correct audience may not like the representation of the Columbian guerrillas, yet 'Collateral Damage' is just an Arnie film with a plot for a change!

In 1989, when BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was released, movie tickets cost five dollars.  Therefore, over fourteen million American people went to the theater to see this movie. The number of viewers increases when you take into consideration the people who rented it on video or watched a television broadcast.  It had that special something that made people think about issues that they might not have thought about before.  It is lamentable that by 1989, many of the members of Generation X had paid little or no attention to the Vietnam War, even though only sixteen years had passed since the war's end.  The younger generation was reminded that the war did, indeed, happen, and that the country was still being lambasted with the side effects.The camera work was extremely effective in relaying the messages in the film.  Different moods within the film were indicated by different tints in the color.  Combats were filmed in red, while blue indicated sadness, and white tints where used in the dream sequences.  Whether intended or not, the colors of choice also coincide with that of the American flag, which is very appropriate for the film.  The film also employed a wide variety of interesting angles without becoming confusing to the viewer.The musical score is one of the best of all time.  John Williams is a genius in the music industry.  His fabulous music can make a film feel the way it was intended to.  He seems to simply know what sequence of notes will produce what emotions.  Along with Williams' music, the score also includes some of the popular music from the time of the film's setting.  For instance, AMERICAN PIE by Don McLean, MY GIRL by the Temptations, and MOONRIVER by Henry Mancini, all give the viewer who remembers the music a sense of nostalgia, taking them back to those years.Two words sum up why the movie got the attention it did Tom Cruise. Many critics were skeptical whether or not the pretty boy of RISKY BUSINESS and TOP GUN fame had what it took to portray a real life Vietnam veteran and make the audience believe he was that person.  Fans crowded into the theaters to watch Cruise's handsome face (which was not so attractive through most of the film).  Critics went to watch him blow the role.  But he proved himself and went above and beyond what was expected of him in one of the most moving performances I have ever seen.  He literally became Ron Kovic.Many people were affected by BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  It had great cinematography.  Its soundtrack was inspiring and beautiful, pulling out of the viewer all possible emotions.  Tom Cruise's performance as Ron Kovic blew almost everyone away.  In short, BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY has what it takes to be a great film.  It overcomes Stone's blatant manipulation of facts, such as the violent conflict that in the movie occurs during a republican convention, but in reality occurred during a democratic convention.

Along with Williams' music, the score also includes some of the popular music from the time of the film's setting.  For instance, AMERICAN PIE by Don McLean, MY GIRL by the Temptations, and MOONRIVER by Henry Mancini, all give the viewer who remembers the music a sense of nostalgia, taking them back to those years.Two words sum up why the movie got the attention it did Tom Cruise. Many critics were skeptical whether or not the pretty boy of RISKY BUSINESS and TOP GUN fame had what it took to portray a real life Vietnam veteran and make the audience believe he was that person.  Fans crowded into the theaters to watch Cruise's handsome face (which was not so attractive through most of the film).  Critics went to watch him blow the role.  But he proved himself and went above and beyond what was expected of him in one of the most moving performances I have ever seen.  He literally became Ron Kovic.Many people were affected by BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  It had great cinematography.  Its soundtrack was inspiring and beautiful, pulling out of the viewer all possible emotions.  Tom Cruise's performance as Ron Kovic blew almost everyone away.  In short, BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY has what it takes to be a great film.  It overcomes Stone's blatant manipulation of facts, such as the violent conflict that in the movie occurs during a republican convention, but in reality occurred during a democratic convention.  Powerful and touching, it drives its point home and back again, never missing a beat.8 out of 10 stars ","genre":"Biography, Drama, War"}]
