The characters outside the institution, Lewis included, are a pragmatic lot. They have pragmatic views on life, pragmatic humor, and are cynically short of ideals. Nick, in particular, suggests that doing away with loyalty in a relationship is a valid concept, not because of any devotion to an ideal of 'free love' but simply because it does away with all the complications over infidelity.The actors, however, are far less restrained in their grips on reality, (however clichéd that may sound, trust me, these characters are not) and thus are allowed to dream. It isn't so much that they are delusional, (none really are) it's simply that they don't seem to have been indoctrinated with a grim view of reality. Roy doesn't just lie about his childhood to others, he allows himself to dream that he really did have a childhood that was remarkable and marvelous. More subtly, Henry is permitted to idolize his father in a way Nick never could. And sure enough, when the two's views on life collide, there are sparks, with Henry delivering most.Lewis, of course, must gradually progress from one to the other, but this is done in a way which is subtle and beautiful. His dream is the play itself, and he progresses from dreading his own misfortune in getting the job of making these nutcases perform a play successfully; to dreaming of making a perfect play with beautiful costumes and wonderful responses. What matters is that they dreamt of it and had the lack of sense to follow that dream.The film has a sterling wit and proceeds nicely, following the course of the patient's dreams and the friend's pragmatism and lack of dreams.

The rest of the cast were really funny and when the film ended I came out of the cinema in a good mood - always a good sign.

I can understand that if you got the wrong type of audience it may be hard to see this film in the right light.Normally, when I see a comedy in the cinema I am not usually the kind of person to laugh out loud. I just seem to smile a lot. In this film though, I was almost wetting myself with laughter. Maybe, it was because you weren't really supposed to laugh at some bits. I even laughed when they walked in the bathroom at the beginning and there was blood everwhere and it was quite a disturbing scene. I did tend to laugh more at the really disturbing parts.Watch this movie for what it is - a film in which people are really funny doing some 'Very Bad Things'.

The rest of the cast were really funny and when the film ended I came out of the cinema in a good mood - always a good sign. My mate had the same view, that you have to forget about morals, the sometimes unadventurous script, etc. and just sit back, relax and enjoy the couple of hours of great entertainment.The story wasn't serious and I think we were lucky to have an audience that did laugh at the many funny bits. I can understand that if you got the wrong type of audience it may be hard to see this film in the right light.Normally, when I see a comedy in the cinema I am not usually the kind of person to laugh out loud. I just seem to smile a lot. In this film though, I was almost wetting myself with laughter. Maybe, it was because you weren't really supposed to laugh at some bits. I even laughed when they walked in the bathroom at the beginning and there was blood everwhere and it was quite a disturbing scene. I did tend to laugh more at the really disturbing parts.Watch this movie for what it is - a film in which people are really funny doing some 'Very Bad Things'.

Now, I agree you do have to have a bit of a twisted sense of humour to like this kind of thing, but it was hilarious! I am not a sick person or anything. In fact, I am the kind of person that can get upset at some emotional scenes in films.However, you have to go into this movie without comparing any of the events with actual reality. The story does go way out of control, especially near the end, but I found this just added to its appeal. O.K, Christian Slater didn't extend his acting beyond 'Heathers', but he was very believable and is very good at that kind of thing.

I didn't need to see a girl who is passed out be raped.  Second, all the characters were the same.  Each character spoke the same dialogue.  Usually, characters are different.  In this worthless movie, Tully spoke and acted exactly the same as Casper or any of the other losers in this movie.  Third, the acting was horrible. Of course, the actors had nothing to work with but still did nothing that resembled acting.  Fourth, the dialogue was idiotic. Who wrote this movie, a 7th grader?  Who talks or acts like these idiots?? I never knew anybody like these people.  Yes, we talked a lot about sex but a whole day of it?  No. Even after Tully has sex, the next thing on his mind is which girl he is he going to bang that night.  Most guys usually don't obsess with sex immediately after they've had it. I don't know anyone who was as mean-spirited as the whole group of characters in this waste of film. All of the characters were one dimensional.  Even the meanest people I knew had some redeeming qualities.  Fifth, who in their right mind would have sex with such a goofball as Tully?   Where I grew up, guys like Tully got beaten up and spent many a lonely night watching the tube.  While I have bashed this movie, I do appreciate other opinions.

For example, in Shakespeare in Love I think the director took three credits, one at the start and two at the end. The producers certainly had a couple apiece, as did the writers. I can visualise the delicate negotiations as each tried to ensure that it got maximum exposure - very like the actors who were so lovingly lampooned in the film itself.In fact, the only name that was conspicuously absent from the credits was that of Shakespeare himself, presumably because he could not fight his corner along with Stoppard and co.This is a pity, since a significant portion of the script is by Shakespeare, and the film frequently uses his original lines, pure and unadulterated, to get its emotional force across. Surely this would have been worth a nod in the credits.It's also particularly unfair since, in my opinion, Shakespeare's lines were by far the best in the film. Unlike the scriptwriters' efforts, his words did not lurch from slushy romantic cliches ('a thousand times goodbye...') to archly modern witticisms ('I had Marlowe in my boat...'). The use of anachronism for its own sake is such a cheap trick. It will almost always get a snigger out of the audience, and it exists to do no more than that. It has the air of tacked-on laughs, rather than a sense of comedy inherent to the spirit of the whole film.
