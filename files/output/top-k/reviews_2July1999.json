Loss of Sexual Innocence does not. Normally I would applaud the freehand style the director uses in going back and forth between different times in the life of Julian, the main character, but some of his choices in doing so are confusing. When we first meet Julian he is a towheaded five-year-old living in Kenya; in his later youth scenes he appears as a dark-haired, obese teen, and as an adult he is rail-thin and prematurely gray. Morbid obesity is a deeply-affecting, emotionally scarring and virtually incurable condition (the cure rate is two percent, literally half the chance of leading an arguably normal life as has a heroin addict). The fact that Figgis, the author\/director, simply wrote 100 pounds out of the story and reintroduced the character as a thin adult is a cold betrayal of the writer's lack of emotional depth or knowledge of the human condition. We're being told the life story of a character by a writer who doesn't know as much about life as we do. The changing hair color could be explained -- it really does happen to people -- but it hinders the audience who's trying to decide if these three actors are the same character, or if they are separate characters unknown to each other. Another issue that is not addressed throughout the film is, are we still in Kenya? If these nondescript urban and suburban scenes are in fact a foreign country by virtue of a caption at the bottom of the screen that says Kenya, then what is the point of setting the scenes in a faraway country?Eventually (but don't hold your breath) Julian's story vignettes, plus those of some other characters, converge in a single plot wherein they go off to some location to make their film, but the trip results in some very physical repercussions among both central and ancillary characters. Now that the film, at this point, has condescended to tell a traditional story, we never do find out if the injured people recover.I'm reminded of a couple of the later films of Joseph Losey (Dark Ceremony; The Go-Between), who teased us by meting out small bits of the story here and there and not telling us everything, apparently never realizing himself that he didn't have that much to say.One final observation The use of the word sexual in the title and the appearance of naked people on the poster artwork are apparently designed to draw crowds by implying, by virtue of the film's title somehow relating this story to sexuality, that the film is therefore sexy.Don't be fooled.

After all, with this subject matter, there is enough to easily make two different films. Both films are excellent in their own right and as I said when I reviewed The 13th Floor, the only reason that The Matrix did better business is because it was marketed better.  And don't forget they seemed to copy a previous film that came out earlier called Dark City.Keanu Reeves plays Neo.  In his other life, he is a computer hacker with a seemingly normal job.  But he has inner demons.  There is a part of him that believes something is wrong with the world.  And then finally one day, he is given an ultimatum by a stranger.  He can learn all the secrets that he believes are out there or he can stay in his drab life and never know the truth.  What do you think he does?  Hmmm.He is taken into a world by a bunch of renegade freedom fighters led by Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus.  And this is where I think the strength of the film lies.  It is here that we learn what the Matrix is. And of course I don't think anyone reviewing this film is going to give away what that is, but just saffice it to say that it will stay with you for a while, especially if you are like me and occassionally question reality every now and then.The true strength of this film is not just Reeves, but Fishburne.  I remember seeing Fishburne in a little known film called Deep Cover.  I thought he was outstanding in that film and I was convinced that was his best work.  That is until the Matrix came out.

And a script like this is a delicate thing to handle.  There is so much information that it would be easy for another writer and another director ( fortunately they are the same here ) to give us a condensed version of what is in the film.

They are outstanding.  You will never see better stunts in any movie.  The choreography is so perfect it really is like watching a perfectly executed martial arts routine.  It flows so well that it makes you feel like you are there experiencing what is happening.  I don't think I will ever forget some of the fight scenes in this film.  They are sheer brilliance.But mostly what is enjoyable about The Matrix is the questions that it asks and how it answers them.  What is the Matrix?  Well, well I'm not going to give it away.  As I said it is one of the parts of the movie that will keep you intrigued and will astonish you at the same time.

I'm guessing that the old saying is true, what comes around, goes around.  First of all, in 1977, people of New York City are were afraid of a madman who called himself Son of Sam who at random killed innocent people (mostly young girls).  People locked themselves in to hide and be safe from the madman on the streets.  In 1999, we hold a different fear, the fear that is in our schools.  From the aftermath of the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado; people are terrified about sending their kids to school, and wondering if they not get struck by teenage rage and violence.Other similarites are  the New York Yankees were at the top then, and they are at the top now.  The big movie people were talking about in 1977 was STAR WARS, in 1999 THE PHANTOM MENACE (STAR WARS EPISODE I) was the biggest movie of the summer.  And when 1977 brought out the rebellion of punk rock, 1999 has the same with grudge rock. Watching SUMMER OF SAM really put me into another world where this world has many differences, yet they are similar. Which is why I was awestricken with how well, Spike Lee reproduced 1977. With people wearing t-shirts with Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, to reheated and gressy pizzas.  The look was there, the music was definitely there, even the costumes and culture was there.  But the only bad aspect is that Lee has some slow spots.  There are parts that we want to see more of, and get little of.  Then there are parts that we want to see less of, and get more of.  But that doesn't make this a bad movie.  Oh no, this is a very good movie, but not a excellent movie that I was hoping. SUMMER OF SAM is about the lives of four young people in New York City in the summer of 1977.  Disco is getting more popular, and so is punk rock.  It's one of the hottest summer's ever in New York City (114 degrees, that's normal in Phoenix), and there's a madman on the loose who kills people with a.44 caliber gun.  There are different stories, first there is Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna (Mira Sorvino), a young married couple who are great on the dance floor.  But their sex life is fading away, as Vinny is having affiars with many different women. Then there's Ritchie (played wonderfully by Adrien Brody) and Ruby (Jennifer Esposito), a young couple who are both falling into the world of punk rock.  However, it's Ritchie's new look and attitude that has a neighborhood vigilante gang (led by Michael Rispoli) wondering if Ritchie is the Son of Sam. Personally, I like Spike Lee's work.  I enjoyed CLOCKERS, GET ON THE BUS, and HE GOT GAME.  And I personally think that SUMMER OF SAM is his best work yet.  But I think that Lee concentrates on less exciting things, and doesn't focus on more interesting things.  We get the lives and life-styles of the four young youths, yet we are drawn more towards the paranoia and fear of the .44 caliber killer.  But this isn't about Son of Sam this is about some of the people that were around while the Son of Sam striked.  Like how the narrator at the beginning tells us, this is about New York City.  And I'm guessing that is what Lee wanted to focus more on. If you've seen Lee's other movies, you'll recognize some of his familar faces in the film (Mike Starr from CLOCKERS, Debi Mazar from GIRL 6, and Lee regular, John Turturro making a unusual cameo stay through the credits to see what he did). This is a very good film, but not a great film.  But I have to give credit to Lee, he's now making films that all of us can relate to, instead of certain people.

Their characters are always larger than life.  Rambo and Rocky are household names and The Terminator and films like Commando are great partly because of Arnold's physical presence.  But as good as they are, I don't think they can hold a candle to Harrison Ford. Sure he is in great shape, but have you ever seen an actor take average guys and make them so real that you want to know them?  Take your pick, Han Solo, Indy and even his character in Six Days and Seven Nights was an adventurer. Add Richard Kimble to that list.  As Kimble, Ford is perfect.

This is absolutely one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  And the reason for that hilarity is because of it's frankness and propensity to take risks. They don't make movies like this anymore.  Everyone is so worried about the damn sensors and that is too bad because a movie like this, while I can acknowledge may not be for everyone's taste, is one that explores teens in high school and it also explores how innocently cruel we were to each other in high school.What makes this film so funny is that the characters look like they are having fun.  They like to mess with each other.  They enjoy embarrassing one another and they are sex starved high school kids.  And really, weren't a lot of us males like that in high school?  Are a lot of us still not like that?You have an assorted cast of characters from Meat, the rather large ( in many ways ) guardian of the group.  Women love him for various reasons and it is his size and manliness that makes him so much fun to poke fun at. Then there is Tommy Turner.  He is the leader of the group and always seems to come up with the ideas to get his friends laid or in trouble.  You have Billy and Brian and of course PeeWee.  He is the guy that everyone likes, yet his exaggerated Casanova stories get him in several sticky but funny situations with his friends.  The characters at Angel Beach high school are hilarious and I honestly wish I could have known guys like this.The true strength of this film is the hilarity.  The kids make it funny because they always look like they are having fun.  When one person is taking their licks, the other five that are in on the gag are laughing under their breaths and all you get is a snicker or two.  And we can all relate to that.  How, something is funny but we have to play our part to keep the cherade going.  These kids do that with perfection here.  I also have to mention some of the scenes that make this film the teen classic that it is. The first is the scene when Mr. Carter, their principal is being pressured by Ms. Balbricker to find the guy who had his penis hanging out of a drain pipe in the girls shower.  Mr. Carter is doing his best to keep a straight face but he is going to crack at the absurdity of the request.  To make matters worse, the two male gym teacher are not making it any easier by snickering to themselves.  When Mr. Carter finally cracks, we crack with him.  This is comedy at it's best.  Also very funny are the Lassie part and the beginning when PeeWee is running down a country road naked.  You really have to see it.This film is unapolegetically crude, lude and vulgar in many ways.  But it is so damn funny that you don't pay attention to that stuff.  My gut still hurts from laughing when I watch this film.  And oh yeah, the shower scene isn't bad either.

Natural enough that a conclusion that so flagrantly violates viewer expectations of what a conclusion should be, and do, should meet with so much frustration, even anger, from so many viewers.But the viewer able to entertain a different sort of ending may be able to experience something quite extraordinary, nothing less than an existential epiphany of what it actually means to *be*, in the world.  For at the moment when the film ends, Sayles' protagonists have created a fullness of meaning, a fullness of love and compassion, *within*, and not falsely transcendent of that very moment.  And it is arguably not only illusory, but a downright lie to say that we are *ever* able to do more than this, though our ego spends its lifetime protesting otherwise.Very few films, independent or otherwise, shatter the web of samsara, the play of egoic illusion which fuels so much of our experience, and upon which benighted human activity rests.  Certainly, the Hollywood machine's machinations are bent on *furthering* the interests of samsara. Witness the almost constant barrage of weak messianism, nicely exemplified in that Matrix nonsense about Keanu Reeves' character being the one.  The only redemption offered in *that* film is from the need to confront the machine; Keanu enacts that confrontation *for* us, leaving us free to enjoy further illusion in the comfort of knowing that, since we're human, we will, we must, simply triumph over such illusion, in the end.  Keanu is just a prettier version (for most of us!) of the one that we all are.This sort of comfort is proffered through facile forms of closure in all the arts, in music even more egregiously than in film.  And I deem it proof enough of the triumph of our conditioning to the interests of such closure that so few of us can stomach what happens at the end of *Limbo*.For *Limbo* steadfastly refuses to offer up some closure that would be false to the actual experience of *lived* life.  We want to pretend that the characters, if we like them, don't *really* have to die, or if they do, we, immortal aesthetes that we are, will get a chance to relish, and properly subordinate their tragedy to our own ends.Well life doesn't work that way, and neither does Sayles' masterful film. And despite what many commentators have suggested, the film does not end in limbo.  The characters are either going to get rescued or shot; the conclusion is thus quite definite in its open-endedness.  But by not showing us *either* of those eventualities, Sayles gives us something much better, much more definite still.  For the love and mutuality we witness in the film's final moments is truer, more real, than the modalities of rescue or death could ever be.  And if we are willing to grant Sayles his donnee (would James?!), we may experience something quite extraordinary, something quite extraordinarily real.Thank you, John Sayles.  Thank you.

However, each film has a few scenes that I will never forget. In the first one it was the penis sketch artist scene. In here it will be the rendition that Billy and his counterpart put on in their Shakespeare Festival. They are dueling to the death in an epic sword fight. One of the swords break and it is up to Tommy to find a sword for them to finish to scene properly. So he hands him a leg from a woman's manikin...the same leg that made a nice lamp in Christmas Story, both films directed by honorary Canadian, Bob Clark.

This movie stays with you and effects you in ways that few if any films do. Every scene is perfect, every shot works - it is brilliantly written and is another master work of editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Its loss of the Best Picture Oscar to Dances with Wolves (of all movies) is the 2nd greatest scandal in Oscar History (next to the shutout of The Color Purple).It is its attention to detail and Scorsese's ability to pick the exact, singularly perfect song for each shot that makes this film so great. Take the scene for example, of Robert DeNiro, sitting at the bar, silent, smoking a cigarette, essentially contemplating who to kill. As the shot slowly zooms in on him, I defy anyone to find better music than Sunshine of Your Love' to complete that gripping scene. Or even more so, the playing of Sid Vicious' slaughtering of My Way over the closing credits.Pesci, Liotta, Deniro, Bracco and Sorvino (in the best role of his career) are stunning, but this is Martin Scorsese's triumph. He will be viewed upon one day (likely after his death) as the greatest ever American Director. He has four absolute masterpieces to his name, and not a single bad film. This, however, is the apex of his career.Goodfellas is not about anything other than life in a crew - being on the inside. The guilt, the pride, the easy life, the paranoia, the forced laughter, the constant fear and the struggle to lie correctly when asked a tough question. In the famous scene with Paulie (Sorvino) asking Henry (Liotta) about the killing of a made guy from another crew, I have always believed that Paulie knows the truth and wants Henry to lie, but has to ask the question because it is expected of him. Not a direct question, just Whaddya know about that thing?.Goodfellas is a gift to moviegoers - one that should be enjoyed over and over again. It is violent and it does have more f-shots than any movie I can recall. It is edgy and uneasy and it will get right under your skin and make it crawl. But it is also infectious and addictive at the same time. The Canadian Cable Channel Bravo often plays this uncut and commercial free late at night and I find myself awake at 4 am watching it, even though I own the video.The closing scene of this movie is probably the greatest sustained piece of filmmaking I have ever scene - Henry must sell some guns, close a drug deal, cook some pasta sauce, juggle his wife and girlfriend and outrun some pesky helicopters all in a fit of increasing paranoia. As the world closes in on Henry, it closes in on you and you want to squirm out. You know why Henry made his final decision.Absolutely perfect. **** out of ****.

Some of the humour is a bit gross ( seeing Sadam's rubber propalactic was funny but a little sick at the same time ) but I think these guys wanted to see how far they could go. And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more, and hey, I was very entertained.But on the political side, there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here.

But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way.  You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.  Free speech means free speech.  Free to express your thoughts in an open forum.  This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses.  It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue ( many of those films get an AA rating ) but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.  That really is silly.The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.  It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood, many  people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution.  There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.  A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it.  They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.  If the U.S. ever went to war with us, it would probably be over in a day or so.  So thanks for making us look at least competetive.

It's a shame that so many people are going to endure this train wreck of movie because Wild Wild West's the only thing out there for two weekends, but that's what Warner Brothers was counting on. Dr. Loveless would envy the evil genius of the modern distribution pattern where audiences are herded in like cattle the first two weeks with the dinner bell of slick marketing, therefore ensuring huge returns before word of mouth gets out. Lucky timing also helps. With no other big popcorn movies out this entire summer besides the not quite overwhelming Star Wars Episode I, West will benefit from the same scenario that helped Men in Black - which rode a big wave of disappointment with The Lost World - to box office manna.From the opening notes of the entirely new score, this West makes one misstep after another. Gone is the familiar ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum bum bum be-bum bum bum, replaced with a theme that defies an audience to try humming it when leaving the theater. Gone too is the animation\/freeze frame device that separated the sequence breaks. Granted this device took advantage of television's required commercial breaks, yet it also helped tweak the suspense by making each episode into a mini-serial. There's an attempt at some sort of half-assed homage in the opening credits, but high contrast monochrome images with blueprint schematics aren't the same thing.In short, if you liked the series stay far away from this not-even-trying-to-be update. Yet, I'm no purist about these things. I like Will Smith and as much as I thought casting him as James West was the worst type of stunt casting I was expecting to be taken in by his affable charm again.

Instead, they decided to make this movie for the fans-and by God, this has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all decade. There was never a dull moment, the audience was uproarious, and I was laughing harder than I have in years.Even going as far as to top There's Something About Mary in its crudeness and extreme vulgarity, South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut does what few TV-to-movies do make a jump to the next level by pushing the obscenity to the limit.I'll try and not spoil too much. The four kids go to see the Terrance & Phillip movie, Asses of Fire. There is a musical number featured in the movie-within-a-movie which had the audience rolling, the lyrics consisting almost entirely of the f-word (and the TV show's bleeps are discarded for the film). The boys soak in the movie's naughty language and come out spouting forbidden obscenities. Soon other children see the movie. In the school classroom, there is an eruption of swearing and the boys are sent to the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, who calls in their mothers to make them aware of what the Terrance & Phillip movie has done to the kids. They form The Mothers Against Canada and try to have Terrance & Phillip executed. Canada defends its humor while the United States laughs at them, and Canada retaliates by bombing the Baldwin brothers (very clever). Soon Canada and the U.S. are engaging in full-scale war.Meanwhile, Kenny dies (not surprisingly) and goes to Hell, where Saddam Hussein and Satan are in a homosexual love affair. Saddam only wants sex every five minutes and Satan wants to be loved. Their scenes in bed are a reason why kids should not see this movie. Back on Earth, the kids form a group to save Terrance & Phillip, La Resistance (obviously paying homage to Les Misérables) and make a plan to rescue Terrance & Phillip from the big USO show, where they are to executed. Guests at the USO meeting include Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder (who is happy to demonstrate her famous ping-pong ball trick). The kids attempt to sneak into the show and free Terrance & Phillip.This movie will shock you. You will not believe some of the jokes in this movie. It will offend many people. The film takes equal shots at Jews, blacks, Canadians, Bill Gates, and Jar Jar Binks, to name a few.

But this? This? Who ever thought that this was a good idea for a summer movie? There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with it like at the most basic level, the idea is rotten, like the first conception of the project was rooted in some bizarre temporary insanity, the conclusion perhaps that Will Smith is all a movie needs to be a smash.This is the most cynical and contrived form of film-making, the packaging of elements to excite a broad demographic, the synergistic Burger King tie-ins, music videos etc for maximum market coverage. But what is centrally lacking here is the movie itself. It is a dismal spiritless mess, devoid of any chemistry between its leading characters, an entirely unnecessary female character (Salma Hayek in an awesomely thankless part) and an utterly rubbishy villain (Kenneth Branaugh not nearly as funny as he seems to think he is).Of course the actors cannot be blamed. They are only actors for Christ's sake. What really counts in a deal like this is the script and Wild Wild West simply did not appear to have one. The plot was utterly incidental, a routine and tiresome paper chase across the old west to find a bad guy with a ridiculous bad guy world domination plan. This would be fine if the movie dispensed with plot and left Smith and Kline centre stage with a huge quantity of electrifying witty banter, but it doesn't. Instead they are given swathes of plot-related dialogue as though we were actually supposed to be interested. In the whole film, I don't think I saw one decent line of dialogue, not a single solitary spark of wit. No clever wordplay, nothing in fact that could justifiably be called comedy writing. Not even any of Will Smith's patented verbal clowning. Just talk and pulling silly faces.An embarrassment for everybody concerned, especially Kline who really aught to know better by now. The only person who comes out of this with dignity intact is director of photography Michael Ballhaus, who makes the desert look like a surrealist painting, as though John Ford and Rene Magritte had conceived a child in a crazy threesome with Alexandro Jodorowsky.Otherwise, I want my money back.
