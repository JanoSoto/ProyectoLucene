It is one of the best movies of the 1950's, easily. Watching Brando on screen is mesmerizing, as he is truly one of Hollywood's finest actors, in history. He may be on the actors mount Rushmore. And for a 50's movie, it's a real dark story. There aren't many smiles shared throughout this classic.One of the best parts about this movie is watching the young talent right before our eyes. You can really see the talent of not only Brando, but Eva Marie Saint. As she won her one and only Oscar for her role. Brando's character is a troubled ex-boxer who never really finds his own in the real world. He has to choose which side he's really on even with his longtime friends and brother on one side. From the opening scene of a murder the film glues you to the story. It didn't feel like a typical 50's movie at all. There wasn't any cheap romance and cheesy dialogue. Its written beautifully and is complimented with a great score. The script is brought to life by a great supporting cast led by the priest. He influences Brando to stick up for what is right even if it means ratting on his team. No wonder this movie has been number one on many all time great 50's lists. I think Rear Window and a Dial M for Murder still wins for me but this is not far behind. Very impressed with everything about this movie.My only complaint comes from the courthouse as I thought that scene feel flat. I wish we heard more dialogue and heartbreak from Terry after losing his brother. That perhaps would have made my score a 10. Nevertheless it's a great film filled with memorable performances.9.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There is a reason this film won 8 academy awards.

Yes, definitely! Is it as good as the first? No...but it comes close. The plot is this After seeing the delorean struck by lightning at the end of part II, Marty receives a letter from Doc. In the letter, Doc tells Marty that the lightning strike sent him back to 1885. Shortly afterward, Marty and the 1955 Doc find out that the future Doc was murdered in 1885. Ergo, Marty must also travel to 1885 to save his friend's life. Here's what I liked I liked the setting of the old west Hill Valley, I liked the character of Clara, and I thought that she added a nice new element to the story. Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen had an excellent chemistry together, and they played off each other very well. Once again, there were great performances all around, and unlike part II, this film had heart! As with the first film, it has a signature song Double back that fits the film perfectly. (ZZ Top is one of my all-time favorite bands!) Here's what I didn't like I didn't like some of the actors playing their original character's son, daughter, grandson or great-grandfather. (This also goes for part II.) It was too cheesy. To me, it just felt like a lame, cheap joke. Why does the villain always have to be Biff, or Biff's grandson, or great grandfather? I think the series would've fared better if there had been new villains for parts II and III. It would've been a step in the right direction, and not just a rehash every time. (Spoilers ahead) I really HATED Marty's Chicken complex! It just came out of nowhere, and it's only there to add another problem to the story. In part II, Doc tells Marty that the event with his son in 2015, will destroy his entire family. This however, is only the surface problem! In 2015 we learn that the future Marty is a wash-up. This sole problem, is a direct result of his Chicken complex. In part III, Doc tells him that this complex, is what causes him to get into an accident in the future. Marty asks what's wrong with his future, and what does Doc do? NOTHING! Furthermore, why didn't Doc tell Marty about this previously?! Marty knew that Doc was going to be shot in the future, so he warned him about it. Here however, Doc doesn't even so much as warn Marty about this event that destroys his future! I gotta call B.S. on that! As for the whole experience, Back to the future II was garbage, but III was very enjoyable and entertaining. As with many sequels, III falls short of capturing the original's magic, but it was a much more valiant effort this time around.

That about sums it up for me.There are films that don't necessarily need inventive and artistic camera shots, or groundbreaking special effects, or even gorgeous cinematography to be considered masterpieces. Sometimes a film like Groundhog Day comes along with a smart and charming story with performances and characters that are so well developed that it automatically connects with audiences by reaching for the heart, and turning it into an instant classic. With a premise that might seem boring due to the fact that the lead character has to repeat and live the same day over and over again in a small Pennsylvania town, director Harold Ramis manages to catch our attention by creating interesting characters and through a witty script he introduces important themes such as existentialism in a rather refreshing and light way. It is a very spiritual film without ever feeling religious. In a way the story reminded me of Dickens' A Christmas Story where you have an egocentric and arrogant character who is transformed once he experiences a supernatural event. In Groundhog Day the transformation is much more subtle while at times it does go to dark places. Ironically Bill Murray went on to play Scrooge in one of the many adaptations of Dickens' classic tale. Murray is the heart and soul of this film and although he is hard to like at the beginning of the film there is something about his performance that keeps us interested in him. This isn't one of those laugh out loud comedies (I don't think I laughed at a single scene), but it is so charming that it is impossible to resist and it leaves you with a smile on your face during its entire running time. Once it ends we realize how philosophical this film really was, but Ramis kept us so entertained that we didn't really pick up on it until the very end.The original screenplay for Groundhog Day was co-written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin. It centers on a weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) working as a TV meteorologist for a local Pittsburgh station. Phil is an arrogant narcissist who is expecting to work for a more important broadcasting channel soon. On the eve of Groundhog Day, he is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual festivities along with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) with whom he doesn't get along very well. Phil hates this assignment which he has covered over the past four years so he doesn't put much effort into his report. After covering the event an unexpected blizzard forces the roads to close so Phil and his crew are stuck in Punxsutawney for another day. The next day Phil wakes up and realizes he has to relive Groundhog Day all over again and he's the only one that notices that the day unfolds in the exact same way. Everyone else seems to be living the day for the first time, but he finds himself stuck in the same day over and over again like if he were trapped in a loop hole with no way out.The premise seemed boring for me at first considering I thought it was going to repeat itself too many times, but Murray's character is so fun and he relives each day in so many different ways that it managed to keep me entertained. At first Phil feels like he has gone mad and tries to rationalize things, but once he realizes his fate he decides to take advantage of it. Being the self centered person he is, Phil lives knowing he wont have to suffer any consequences, but eventually he grows tired of this hedonistic lifestyle. He feels so desperate that he tries to commit suicide in every possible way, but no matter what he does he still wakes up the next morning reliving Groundhog Day. Eventually Phil gives up on living for himself and begins looking at others and caring for them. He begins to find purpose and joy in life in helping others. Ramis has made a deeply spiritual and philosophical film without the audience realizing it at first. It could have become tedious and preachy, but it never does because the characters are subtly transformed and the growing chemistry between Phil and Rita is believable. Ramis found a way to reach out to our hearts and remind us that life isn't about living for ourselves, but finding pleasure in helping and caring for others.

The duels for instance take ages, but that's mainly because we're dealing with someone who knows what suspense is.

The only thing that's kind of shame is that the studio forced him to hire Ryan O'Neal, who is wrong for the character and robs the movie of some of its incredible charm.

Indeed, labeling this sparkling quartet from the 50's as ghosts would've been wrong. And except during some transitional moments where they have that ghostly 'quality', during the rest of the film, they're always seen with the hero, played by Robert Downey Jr.Maybe I'm going too fast, but I know anyone reading this review has already seen this film, and know what the plot is about. Four ill-fated persons who, in 1959, died in a bus accident at the same moment a boy was born, which made them entwined to him for an indefinite period of time. Charles Grodin is Harrison, a wannabe-singer whose stage fright caused him to leave the audition before even uttering a word. Alfre Woodward is Penny, single mother and night worker. Tom Sizemore is Milo, a two-bit thief failing to take stamp-collections, with high sentimental value, back from his contractor. Finally, Kyra Sedgwick is Julia, a pretty waitress who let the love of her life whose incapability to make up her mind caused her proposing lover to leave the restaurant.Visibly, they all took the same bus at the wrong moment, Harrison would have missed the bus had he tried to sing and Julia would have probably gone with her soon-to-be husband if she said yes while trying to get back to him caused her demise. As for Milo, the last thing he heard was you stink from the young collection's own. Penny only got loving hugs from her kids &#x85; which is only fair, since she's the only one who would have probably died anyway. But there's something particularly efficient yet simple in Ron Underwood's movie, it's the way these characters are carefully and subtly exposed, granted the subplots aren't revolutionary, at least when the accident happens, we know about their history, who they are, and their death is even sadder because it comes before their lives would come full circle.But that's what death is, it's as blind and untimely as love. But this is not a film to make you just cry, in one of these Capraesque strikes of fate, they are not sucked up to the sky, like the driver (David Paymer) whose naughty eyes rhymed with collective demise, instead, the four 'souls' join the newborn Thomas, born in a car nearby and this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. One must wonder how come they don't think about their former lives, but we meet them again when Thomas is still a baby, so they had time to resign to their fates, and at least, they had a cute little boy as company. Except that it doesn't turn well for the boy, he looks like an autistic kid with four imaginary friends, going at the races for Milo (why would a ghost need money anyway) or dancing in the toilet with his friends.Yes, that part of the film asks a few disturbing questions. Wouldn't they adults be aware that this attitude would cause the kid's trouble? And to make it worse, I'm not sure they took the right approach anyway when they left him. You know, you remember movies for a particular scene, well, imagine if Dorothy's friends let her alone in the forest, how traumatic it would've been. And the four souls leave the poor boy alone, forever&#x85; I understand it was to protect him, but they could have handled it more tactfully, I imagine how hard it would've been for poor Thomas to lose the friends who've always been there for years and years. This is quite a heart-wrenching scene, difficult to watch, but as Milo said life is tough &#x85; thankfully, it cuts immediately to a young sun-glasses wearing Thomas, played by Robert Downey Jr.The contrast is extraordinary, we understand the boy has grown more cynical and disillusioned and the 'ghost' episode has probably something to do with him.Yet the four friends never left Thomas, followed him everywhere, they still act the same, and I wonder where were they when Thomas discovered sex, whether manual or mutual &#x85; well, I don't want to know. The film is meant like a fairy-tale and such considerations are needless, otherwise, why wouldn't they be a real criminal among the four, even Milo is more of 'Disney' bad bot. Later they learn they all have an unfinished job, and have to make up for their past mistakes. But it's too late when they're finally explained why they were kept on Earth. Anyway, the bus driver, who's got one hell of a debt toward them, give them one day to finish their business. No they have one day to convince Thomas to help them, talk about short time &#x85; this is where the story picks up, and Downey Jr. blooms on the screen.He proves to have a real talent of mimicry when the ghosts take possession of is body, which will help them to accomplish their deeds. Whether mimicking the macho, the singer, the seductive girl and the mother who won't take any attitude, Downey is priceless and elevates the film to a comedic level that makes us forget its sadness. The whole film is an emotional switch between laughs and tears, it's one 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' moments but handled so tactfully, without any over ambitions that when the last soul leaves the world, with a sympathetic twist at the end, you know you've spent a nice moment and all you want is to be with those you love and tell them you love them.

Unfortunately, the worst thing about this film is the ending. I really don't like how the film was so dark. But the movie overall isn't really bad. It has inspired other studios to make more movies that relate to this. For this one, I don't think I would want to watch it again, because I am not a big crime type of guy.

Besides other references to my favorite writer.If I can share a little spoiler there, what most amaze me about Alpha 60 is the dichotomy between doesn't understanding poetry and actually citing them.
