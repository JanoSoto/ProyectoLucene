I have seen Shane at least 20 times over the last 35 years and still identify with those who think very highly of the movie.While I know that child actors can sometimes deliver their lines in a forced or self-conscious way, Brandon DeWilde's high-pitched voice does not annoy me, as it does a few people who disliked the movie, and though Alan Ladd may not exude much ruggedness, in my mind his mild-mannered but firm style allow him to more than adequately portray Shane himself.As for the movie's pace -- too slow for some viewers -- the weekly routine of homesteaders in the 1880's most likely included planting gardens, rebuilding fences, or traveling en masse to the general store. Gun duels on the main street or brawls in the town saloon probably seldom occurred. Even if Shane presents a largely idyllic image of managing a home and farm on the frontier, the lifestyle of many characters comes across as plausible. That some people consider Shane too devoid of thrills may reveal more of what they require of a movie to feel entertained than what keeps Shane from meriting more acclaim. For me, the awesome natural setting does more to enhance the film than would have any additional action, and the time taken to establish identities and personalities amongst the homesteaders and ranchers serves a fundamental purpose - to show that the residents of an isolated tiny settlement in NW Wyoming find that their uneventful lives have significantly changed after the arrival of a stranger on horseback.I have sometimes wondered if the viewers critical of Shane were born too recently to feel impressed by a film made so long ago, especially if they had had exceedingly high expectations beforehand because of having read or heard that they were about to see one of the best films of its genre, a classic. At the same time I have also asked myself if those who have nothing but superlatives for Shane would not have responded differently if they had not first seen the movie until the last 5-10 years.I first saw Shane as an 11 or 12-year old in the late 1960's, when my mother, upon seeing that CBS was going to broadcast Shane as its Tuesday or Thursday movie of the week, made a rare exception and allowed me and my brother to stay up beyond our 900 pm bedtime so that we could watch the movie.

It all started right here, and despite the cheesy lines and some of the bad effects (even though most of them are pretty incredible, especially for that time), I can't help but love it.Maybe it's the actors. Because let's face it, these actors were born to play these parts. Mark Hamill never really had another hit, and really, honestly, he's not a very good actor. But he was perfect for this role- some may say he's too whiny, but isn't that really what Luke was at the beginning? The same goes for Carrie Fisher- she never had another big, important movie like these, but I can't imagine the movie without her. Maybe other people can, and that's okay for them, but for me, I can't see anyone else as Leia.And what would this movie be without Harrison Ford? I have a theory that the reason the newest three Star Wars don't match up at all to the old ones is because the characters aren't interesting at all. Anakin is vaguely interesting, but we already know his story and Hayden Christensen doesn't do anything with the part to keep us intrigued. Amidala is boring, and while I think Ewan McGregor is a great actor, there was nothing he could do to instill anything worth watching into the character they wrote for Obi-Wan.And that's why these movies need Harrison Ford. Han Solo is without a doubt the most interesting character. In the new ones, there's no one with snappy retorts and sharp comments to keep the pace of the movie up. In the new ones, there's no one to give us the surprise ending we knew was coming but we didn't know how they were going to pull it off. I don't know about anyone else, but when I first saw this, I thought Han had actually left for good. It didn't even occur to me that he would come back to save the day in the end. And I'm not stupid. At least that's what they tell me. And without Harrison Ford, Han Solo would not be near as interesting as he is.Alec Guinness deserves plenty of credit too. His part is without a doubt the most boring in the movie, yet he makes it worth watching. His lines are usually descriptions, clichés, or they provide backstory. The actors in CSI will tell you that lines like that are hard to make entertaining. Yet Guinness is able to do so with years of training. It's no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for it.Oh, and there's the awesome action sequences with the light saber duels that, even though they tend to repeat themselves over and over, are incredibly dazzling. There's the epic feel and the neverending story of it all. There's the beautiful scenery and realistic set pieces. There's James Earl Jones's and Anthony Daniels's respectively foreboding and entertaining voiceovers, with Vader's wonderfully addicting breathing.

Sorry if that seems rather facile on my part. Hers is a very sophisticated and intelligent beauty. I think she looks absolutely gorgeous and her great presence carries the film and makes it far more than it would be without her.I was also surprised to see Marcel Marceau in the film. It was interesting to see him without his makeup and to hear him speak! Also, I had heard years ago that Duran Duran the rock group was named after a character in a film and at last I've found out which film and which character it was! Throughout the film I kept thinking that this was 1968 and the Beatles were popular and how wonderful that time must have been. If this film is anything to go by, they *were* a little strange in the late sixties -) Without wanting to sound like a male chauvinist pig I still get goosebumps at the sight of a really beautiful woman and in this film Jane Fonda really and truly is incredibly gorgeous, feminine, and intelligent and I for one am not worthy.

Maybe I've become blunted to quiet serial killers from watching countless slasher movies. Compared to Jason or Freddy, Michael Myers has always seemed a bit slow and unimaginative for my taste and the much praised first part is no exception to that. However, I'm not trying to put down those movies, I just want to make clear that it's no sacrilege for me to compare this second part to the holy grail that is the original for a lot of fans.The story picks up right where Halloween ended. Laurie has survived the first part of the night and is taken to the hospital. As we know, Michael Myers has not been killed by Doctor Loomis and is still on the loose. He continues his killing spree and follows Laurie to the hospital to finish what he has begun a few hours earlier. Along the way we learn a few things about Michael's and Laurie's past.In many aspects Halloween II is even superior to its predecessor. There are a lot more kills and some of them are even a bit creative (burning\/drowning a girl in a tub, jab to the eye) whereas the first movie (and most that would follow) often doesn't go beyond Michael Myers stabbing someone or slitting throats. Apparently, John Carpenter himself went back and added some explicit violence as he thought the finished version by Rick Rosenthal was too tame. Bless his soul! I think what a lot of people like best about Halloween compared to other slasher flicks, though, is that it relies more on suspense than gore. And Halloween II does indeed give you a lot of suspense. Although it doesn't seem like that when you read the story on paper, the hospital actually makes for a pretty good horror movie setting with its dark corridors and observation cameras.Plotwise the story develops a bit without moving as ridiculously far away from the original premise as some of the sequels did. That's not saying Halloween II doesn't have its share of ridiculousness. Dr. Loomis makes for a few unintentionally funny moments when he chases a completely innocent young guy down the road until he winds up in a horrible accident or when he threatens police officers with a gun to do as he says. Most of the time it's totally predictable where Michael Myers will pop up and who will die next, but then you must not forget that the slasher genre was still pretty new back in 1981 and that audiences were not yet as hard boiled as they are today.All in all, Halloween II is a worthy successor to the original. It may not be a genre cornerstone like part 1, but it's just as entertaining, if not more so. Unbelievable that this was made by Rick Rosenthal, the same guy who would later be responsible for the worst entry in the franchise (Halloween Resurrection), but even John Carpenter himself hasn't exactly developed positively the last 15 years or so, has he? Just goes to show how hard it is to stay fresh in the horror genre.

Afterwards when somebody goes missing, these idiots go one at a time to investigate (which is actually a good thing because seeing as I actually wanted the characters to die, it would increase the chances that my wish would be granted).

I never heard of the actors, the director or the novel on which the movie is based. But it's gut-wrenching and extremely well done. The director is Lee Tamahori and the principal actors are Rena Owen, a beautiful woman presumably in her early 40's, as the wife, Temuera Morrison as the husband, and Manaengaroa Kerr-Bell as their 13 year-old daughter, the middle child of five. The story is taken from a novel that was a bestseller in New Zealand, and it is easy to understand why. The clash between the wife's Maori culture which rejected her brute of a husband forms the backdrop as the two eldest children, both boys and both extremely troubled, find themselves becoming immersed in their mother's historic culture. I won't say much more about the plot so as not to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but each of the key actors is utterly convincing. Violence -- not just between husband and wife -- pervades the film. No guns the way violence is mostly depicted in American films, but fists, heads, knees, feet and any bottle, wall, appliance or piece of furniture that's handy. Morrison is no one you'd want to tangle with, believe me, though he exudes a certainly manly charm as well as physical attractiveness, making Owen's sexually charged desire for him totally explicable. Kerr-Bell is splendid as a sensitive teenager who does all she can to hold the family together and is ultimately defeated by her efforts.

However, the film does a poor job in capturing Arenas' words. It's snippety, trying to cram far too much information in to the short time frame. It spends way too much time exploring his final days when it would have been better spent developing some of the other characters. It also takes some pretty MASSIVE liberties with the truth - misrepresenting Arenas' work and life! This hardly does justice to his amazing and courageous story.The acting is superb, there can be no fault ascribed to Bardem and the others (including the always magnificent Depp's interesting turns). But the director made so many poor choices that I had to actually go back and read the book again, I was so disappointed in its portrayal on film. It would be nearly impossible to capture all that the book entails in just a two hour film - so don't try!!! He made some very strange choices with regards to what he decided to include and exclude from his story. And why he decided to fabricate some of the story is beyond me; the real life story is strong enough on its own.A final complaint is that they didn't film the entire movie in Spanish. Rather, they flip back and forth between English and Spanish. Unfortunately, while Bardem's performance is wonderful, his accent significantly detracts from the flow of the film. And by choosing only to occasionally provide subtitles for the Spanish, you always feel like you're missing out. Just film it in Spanish - we can all read the subtitles!!! Why make that kind of a concession to Hollywood when it so clearly detracts from the film. And Arenas' words are better heard in Spanish - and I don't even speak the language! If you did enjoy this film, great. But I STRONGLY recommend you read Arenas' original words (albeit translated) if you really want to get a feel for his experiences.

It was an aspect of Castro's regime with which I was unfamiliar. While I wasn't particularly shocked about the repression of artistry, I was unfamiliar with the hatred for homosexuality prevalent in his regime.I looked forward to seeing this movie a great deal. However, the film does a poor job in capturing Arenas' words. It's snippety, trying to cram far too much information in to the short time frame. It spends way too much time exploring his final days when it would have been better spent developing some of the other characters. It also takes some pretty MASSIVE liberties with the truth - misrepresenting Arenas' work and life! This hardly does justice to his amazing and courageous story.The acting is superb, there can be no fault ascribed to Bardem and the others (including the always magnificent Depp's interesting turns). But the director made so many poor choices that I had to actually go back and read the book again, I was so disappointed in its portrayal on film. It would be nearly impossible to capture all that the book entails in just a two hour film - so don't try!!! He made some very strange choices with regards to what he decided to include and exclude from his story. And why he decided to fabricate some of the story is beyond me; the real life story is strong enough on its own.A final complaint is that they didn't film the entire movie in Spanish. Rather, they flip back and forth between English and Spanish. Unfortunately, while Bardem's performance is wonderful, his accent significantly detracts from the flow of the film.

I was the same age as the character Conrad portrayed by Hutton and I had some of the same fears and insecurities at the time as his character displayed throughout the film. Although there wasn't any one emotionally devastating event in my life to trigger feelings of guilt, I nonetheless identified with Conrad's lost soul, and the effect on me was powerful. At that stage in my life, I was not one to be moved to tears over emotional drama...until this movie. I fought back the tears over two intensely poignant moments which I would not dare to reveal here.Suffice it to say that over the years, and subsequent viewings, this film continues to hit me in different spots as I relate events on the screen to what I have come to know about relationships. It hits home on so many levels. It seems to be one of the only films to deal realistically with dysfunction in a seemingly normal home environment. The facade is there, but the truth lurks not too deeply underneath the surface. And, when the truth is finally revealed, it is one of the most simultaneously shattering and exhilarating moments I've ever seen in film.While Conrad's journey to the core of his guilt is the emotional centerpiece of the film, some of the quietly played scenes between Conrad's mom and Conrad are as perfectly played as they are uncomfortable. I cannot remember who won the Academy Award for best actress of 1980 but the Academy made a huge mistake by not bestowing the Oscar upon Mary Tyler Moore. Her restrained frigidity haunted me and had me screaming for her to break through the ice...and at one of the rare moments where she finally does show any depth of emotion, it is a fascinating study of someone who, somewhere along the way, lost her ability to face reality.So many great moments exist in this film, and apart from the emotional turning point about three-quarters of the way through, one of the most memorable moments for me - and one that I can never forget - is a simple scene of a father and son hugging each other. You'll know it when you see it. I dare you not to weep uncontrollably when it happens.

Richard Roundtree's performance as the title character was wonderful. He had to find a girl who was abducted by some henchmen and the girl's father, named Bumpy, hired Shaft to go look for her. There are some intriguing scenes in the film, such as when Shaft sees this guy at a counter ordering some gum and gets the guy upstairs to his office (he thought it was Bumpy) and a fight breaks out between Shaft, the guy whom he thought was Bumpy (but wasn't), and another guy and the guy (mistaken for Bumpy) goes out the window. Another one is where Shaft and another man go in to this apartment building looking for some killers or the girl's abductors, but end up finding nothing.

Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. Willing and able, I was ready to be bored to death with trivial political matters, textbook film-making, and passionless stories. As the film closed, I did witness some of the aspects that I was expecting. The stories needed to be further developed and the politics of Cuba needed to be explained instead of countering with the mythological island conveying its heartfelt feelings &#133; yet there was something compelling about this film. The cinematography was brilliant. From the opening sweeping scene of the island to the dramatic walk through the streets of Cuba, I was captivated by the beauty that filmmaker Mikheil Kalatozishvili chose to explore while making this film. Without caring about the stories, you could easily be swept away by the sheer enjoyment of the camera work with this film. Kalatozishvili was that impressive. He reminded me of a mix between Jarmusch and Lynch and a sprinkle of Stone (Oliver that is).Soy Cuba was like watching a one sided debate, which works when creating a propaganda film. I know very little about the history of Cuba, or the regime in place prior to Castro, but I needed to see more of that in this film. I needed a bit of history, a little less overly played drama, and more true stories. If this is a Moore-like propaganda film, I have no doubt that Russia could pull true stories from the people of Cuba and recreate those instances. I do believe that what we witnessed were somewhat true, but overly exaggerated. If prostitution was an understandable and common, not respected, form of employment, than why would the boyfriend be upset? If sugar was such a priceless commodity, why didn't the landowner take that before selling the property? If the Cuban police force was that corrupt, would you feel that these students would have a secondary plan in place? Finally, the peaceful villager who wants to fight to end the war seemed a bit too bold to be honest. There just seemed to be a sense of drama surrounding these stories. Again, I suppose that you need them to create a true propaganda film, but would you not agree that a debater discussing the horrors of abortion by just telling stories after stories would not fully convey the point without some moments of history. In Soy Cuba, there needed to be more of these points. There needed to be facts, there needed to be honesty, and there needed to be a stronger divide between drama and truth. I believe that what Cuba was experiencing was terrifying, but I needed stronger evidence to support it. From an outside viewer looking in, I wanted to be persuaded. By the end of this film, I was not.I am a stern believer in skipping the special features of a DVD because those should not sell me on the film. It should be the film itself that is good, not necessarily the quality of the excess features. In past reviews, I have not mentioned the quality of the DVD because I want to have the film speak for itself. For Soy Cuba, I will break from this tradition, but just this once. The quality of this DVD is poor. I am not speaking of the transfer from film to DVD (which is not half bad), but it is the choice to use both Russian and Spanish dubbing with English subtitles throughout the entire film. I found no way to turn this off. Whenever a character had to speak in Spanish, we were bombarded with both the subtitles and the Russian dub over the voice. After the first fifteen minutes, this became extremely annoying. In fact, it takes away from the strength of the film. By the end of the two hours, you are either confused because you couldn't catch everything the characters were speaking, or you have a headache from trying to keep it. It was embarrassing.One cannot finish a review of this film without again stating the strength of the cinematography. Very few films seem to capture the beauty of a land, no matter if it is being torn apart by a government, or getting ready for a Russian rule. Soy Cuba accomplished the impossible and gave this beautiful island the cinematography it deserved. I mentioned before the sweeping opening shot, but the infamous top of the hotel to the pool shot kept me breathless. It was so impressive to the craftsmanship of the camera come into play with this film. You could tell there was heart and passion behind the camera, I just only wish there was more demonstration of that passion in front of the camera.Overall, the cinematography cannot stand alone. I thought long and hard about this film, and while I thought that Cuba was beautifully captured on film, the stories themselves did not stand up well over time. I also had major concerns about the lack of dedication to the DVD. The horrendous dubbing and painful translation was enough to churn the strongest of stomachs. With all of these points going against it, I do not think it is a film I could sit through again. There is a scene in the film where a man is boating down the river dodging your typical rivery obstacles, slowly taking his time as our island narrates some truths that are unknown. This scene best summarizes this film. Soy Cuba was slow, overly dramatic, and avoiding as many obstacles as possible that would have transformed this film into a stronger film. The only plus I can give it is the cinematography. Those interested in filming film need to see this movie, otherwise a National Geographic special would do better.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2006","score":"4 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" I must admit, this is my first experience with a Russian propaganda film.

By the end of this film, I was not.I am a stern believer in skipping the special features of a DVD because those should not sell me on the film. It should be the film itself that is good, not necessarily the quality of the excess features. In past reviews, I have not mentioned the quality of the DVD because I want to have the film speak for itself. For Soy Cuba, I will break from this tradition, but just this once. The quality of this DVD is poor. I am not speaking of the transfer from film to DVD (which is not half bad), but it is the choice to use both Russian and Spanish dubbing with English subtitles throughout the entire film. I found no way to turn this off. Whenever a character had to speak in Spanish, we were bombarded with both the subtitles and the Russian dub over the voice. After the first fifteen minutes, this became extremely annoying. In fact, it takes away from the strength of the film. By the end of the two hours, you are either confused because you couldn't catch everything the characters were speaking, or you have a headache from trying to keep it. It was embarrassing.One cannot finish a review of this film without again stating the strength of the cinematography. Very few films seem to capture the beauty of a land, no matter if it is being torn apart by a government, or getting ready for a Russian rule. Soy Cuba accomplished the impossible and gave this beautiful island the cinematography it deserved. I mentioned before the sweeping opening shot, but the infamous top of the hotel to the pool shot kept me breathless. It was so impressive to the craftsmanship of the camera come into play with this film. You could tell there was heart and passion behind the camera, I just only wish there was more demonstration of that passion in front of the camera.Overall, the cinematography cannot stand alone. I thought long and hard about this film, and while I thought that Cuba was beautifully captured on film, the stories themselves did not stand up well over time. I also had major concerns about the lack of dedication to the DVD. The horrendous dubbing and painful translation was enough to churn the strongest of stomachs. With all of these points going against it, I do not think it is a film I could sit through again. There is a scene in the film where a man is boating down the river dodging your typical rivery obstacles, slowly taking his time as our island narrates some truths that are unknown. This scene best summarizes this film. Soy Cuba was slow, overly dramatic, and avoiding as many obstacles as possible that would have transformed this film into a stronger film. The only plus I can give it is the cinematography. Those interested in filming film need to see this movie, otherwise a National Geographic special would do better.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":"Drama, Music, War"},{"date":"15 January 2006","score":"4 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" I must admit, this is my first experience with a Russian propaganda film. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. Willing and able, I was ready to be bored to death with trivial political matters, textbook film-making, and passionless stories. As the film closed, I did witness some of the aspects that I was expecting. The stories needed to be further developed and the politics of Cuba needed to be explained instead of countering with the mythological island conveying its heartfelt feelings &#133; yet there was something compelling about this film. The cinematography was brilliant. From the opening sweeping scene of the island to the dramatic walk through the streets of Cuba, I was captivated by the beauty that filmmaker Mikheil Kalatozishvili chose to explore while making this film. Without caring about the stories, you could easily be swept away by the sheer enjoyment of the camera work with this film. Kalatozishvili was that impressive. He reminded me of a mix between Jarmusch and Lynch and a sprinkle of Stone (Oliver that is).Soy Cuba was like watching a one sided debate, which works when creating a propaganda film. I know very little about the history of Cuba, or the regime in place prior to Castro, but I needed to see more of that in this film. I needed a bit of history, a little less overly played drama, and more true stories. If this is a Moore-like propaganda film, I have no doubt that Russia could pull true stories from the people of Cuba and recreate those instances. I do believe that what we witnessed were somewhat true, but overly exaggerated. If prostitution was an understandable and common, not respected, form of employment, than why would the boyfriend be upset? If sugar was such a priceless commodity, why didn't the landowner take that before selling the property? If the Cuban police force was that corrupt, would you feel that these students would have a secondary plan in place? Finally, the peaceful villager who wants to fight to end the war seemed a bit too bold to be honest. There just seemed to be a sense of drama surrounding these stories. Again, I suppose that you need them to create a true propaganda film, but would you not agree that a debater discussing the horrors of abortion by just telling stories after stories would not fully convey the point without some moments of history. In Soy Cuba, there needed to be more of these points. There needed to be facts, there needed to be honesty, and there needed to be a stronger divide between drama and truth.
