It had a nostalgic feel to it that gave it a yesteryear feel. This film was very moving and touching and brought a salt of the earth sort of tone to it that you mostly see in edgy movies from today. For example the very beginning was extremely edgy but done very tastefully, when Zach kept flash backing to his father not wanting to have much to do with him. Then in the present he had just spent the night in a supposed 3-way with a hooker and his Father Byron. The banter between him and his father with Byron's suggestive moves were just vague and ambiguous enough to be thought of nothing more than a man acting like a man (playing with his hand tucked into his underwear). The Graduation-Present lay sleeping as the father reaches for his son Zach who is leaving. A slight suggestive brush of his father's hand on his arm as he reaches for him not to leave. Not saying that any actual sexual contact was made between Zach and Byron other than the hooker between them, but it was there none the less. It gave it a haunting, touching, and emotionally charged feel. The longing Zach had for his fathers approval and to be close. Only to receive it in physical form via a female hooker, and possible incest that was only savagely and tastefully hinted or slightly suggested at. This didn't seem to scare the audience back then, but rather allow the radiance to use cognitive dissonance to grapple with the scene. The reason I share this view in such detail as I feel it sets a major tone for the film. It shows that Zach is trying to find something deeper than lust for a hooker (unlike his father). And at the same time trying to grow up without the nurturing his father didn't give him. He took what he could from what little attention his Dad gave him. To tear apart from that was like Velcro. To rip and tear away from the pull of one's own selfish motives and seek out something deeper. When he covered the eagle with the patch was a signal of his restraint. That he didn't want to be too free. But rather more focused on his own life and goals. I have more to say on this but I've written a lot already. This movie had so many different aspects (both hidden and obvious) to talk about that I couldn't point them all out in just one review. It was a great dynamic movie. And at times even underrated. But it did get plenty of accolades right from the start. Great love story between a man and a woman, great coming of age movie, great drama, very good writing, and had a awesome soundtrack.

While it is well known that every good Jackie Chan film is a little bit silly, this one is definitely the silliest I've seen so far. So, if you are the type of person who has a little Graham Chapman in you who, when things take a silly turn, will start strutting about saying Stop this! It's too silly!, then you might be better off giving this film a miss. On the other hand, if you are the sort of person who, when watching a film that turns silly, find themselves quietly hoping that Graham Chapman will march in, preferably accompanied by the knights of Ni and a man banging two empty halves of coconuts together, then you might just enjoy 'Mr. Nice Guy'.And having said that, I probably should specify that 'Mr. Nice Guy' is more slapstick silly than Monty Python's inspired lunacy.So, on to the film. In 'Mr. Nice Guy' Jackie Chan plays Jackie, a Melbourne-based celebrity chef with an inexplicable ability to punch and kick an inordinate amount of arse. He gets on the wrong side of some local gangs and as a result ends up having to kick the aforementioned inordinate amount of arse in order to save himself and his girlfriend (who they kidnap). There are a few more details I could add, but this really is about the sum of it.So if you dislike it when a waiter offers you a movie plot, insisting you take it and saying But Sir, it is wafer thin!, then once again you should probably avoid this film.However, for those of us who are aware that less time spent on plot means more for Jackie to spend punching and kicking and being generally awesome, it's worth mentioning that he punches and kicks very well here. He technically isn't as fast here as he was in the 1980's, but his comic timing is perfect, and on top of that he spends a scene pressed in some way against the wheel of a moving haul truck so there's a lot to be seen here.You might be wondering under what circumstances would it ever be in any way reasonable to be touching the wheel of a moving haul truck, and the answer is none. None at all. It makes no sense, and the notion that anyone might ever actually have to pull off the insane and impressive stunts that Jackie Chan does here is almost as silly as the notion of applying logic to this film. Because that's what I love most. Whole scenes will descend in to incoherent chaos for the sake of supporting a single whimsical stunt or gag. In one case Jackie spends a scene throwing samples of his cooking to audience members who would catch it in their mouths, which like dancing with a haul truck is something that you would never, ever do in the real world under any circumstances, and it only gets better when it becomes apparent that this only ever happened to make way for the main heavy to barge in and catch some food in his mouth (food that was intended for an actual audience member), and nom it angrily.I was speechless. I wouldn't mind it just being one person, but for the film to get made you have to have a whole team of people thinking that scenes like this are a good idea. It's... amazing, really.Suffice to say that I've not enjoyed a film this much in months. Which is why I give 'Mr. Nice Guy' 10\/10.

Several isolated times a stern and sober British Army officer is interpolated and announces to the viewers that this isn't worth watching because it's silly -- just silly. I ruefully found myself often agreeing.I don't suppose there's any point in trying to outline a plot because there is none. It's a series of sketches evidently gotten from their TV show. I first heard the dead parrot sketch on the radio and thought it was hilarious. Now, seeing it on the screen, it seems to have lost much of its voltage. Nor did I find it so amusing when a despondent man leaves a building, stops to think for a moment, and a huge iron weight falls on him and he splats under it.It's possible that this particular material is already familiar, so that watching the film is like hearing a joke for the second or third time. It's also likely that it doesn't seem so fresh or amusing because some of it is dated. The movie was put together in 1971, when much of Western society was in turmoil -- race riots in the streets, an unpopular war in a country no one could identify on a blank map, gays screaming out of the closet, widespread sexual indulgence, bloodshed in Northern Ireland, pop tunes encouraging revolution, that sort of thing. But it's all gone or at least abated today. So the Granny gangs don't resonate the way they did at the time. At the same time, the upper-class twit sketch still gets laughs. I mean, hunting live rabbits that are staked out and spread-eagled on the ground! Trying to commit suicide by shooting one's self -- and missing. I'm laughing now, just rerunning it in my mind.Each of their four features were to improve monotonically, with The Meaning of Life nearing perfection of the style. That last one is mature. Well, mature for Monty Python. And it's both engaging and carries a covert theme of the utmost seriousness. The Granny Gangs are long gone, but questions about the meaning of life, or the absence of meaning, still plague us.

Coppola's bold aesthetic decisions are wasted, however, on a film which suffers from a dreadful script that strays way too far from its source material, features some of the most embarrassing performances imaginable, and is quite simply a very, very dull viewing experience.Over the years, I've developed a pretty good idea of what makes for an effective vampire undead soul-less agents of Satan, their only desire should be to feed on the blood of humans, the more cruel and ruthless they are in this pursuit the better&#x97;oh, and if possible, they should look cool while doing so. They certainly shouldn't fall in love.And yet this film sees Dracula (Gary Oldman hamming it up for all he is worth), supposedly the most evil vampire of them all, sporting a really stupid get-up that makes him look like an old queen, and has him pining for a woman. And not just any woman, but bloody Winona Ryder, quite possibly the most insipid actress ever. In short, he's a bloody embarrassment to bloodsuckers everywhere!As if that wasn't bad enough, the film also features Keanu Reeves in the role of Jonathan Harker, a more miscast actor you would be hard pushed to find; Reeves's lamentable attempt at an English accent rivals that of Dick Van Dyke's dreadful Cockney in Mary Poppins for sheer ineptitude, turning his scenes into unintentional comedy gold. Anthony Hopkins fares little better as Van Helsing, Tom Wait's Renfield isn't a patch on Dwight Fry's in the 1931 classic, and Sadie Frost is overtly sexual when she really shouldn't be.For all the incredible sights on offer in this elaborate production (including the scrummy Monica Belluci once again baring her magnificent chest), this is a truly retched attempt at bringing Stoker's novel to the screen, and one that should be treated with contempt by all genuine Dracula fans.

I had to stop watching past the sitcom scene for about an hour. I consider myself to have a pretty high threshold for dark scenes in movies (American Psycho is one of my top ten movies), but the whole sexually abusive father set to a laugh track really put a sour taste in my mouth, to say the least.

From a technical standpoint, most of the camera angles and constant switching back and forth is completely nauseating.

It is after winning a large amount of money cheating in a game of poker that the two friends start a journey to Cleveland, but even when they do find her, and spend some time with her friend Billy (Danny Rosen) they find they are just as bored as when they were in New York. Willie and Eddie decide rather than go back home to travel to Florida, and obviously they take Eva with them, but after settling a bit they lose all the money they have betting on dog races, and they try to win it back in horse races.

But not for reasons of legitimate value, since the films content is a mirror image of the media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who was incensed by the film, it was attacked with pitchforks by newspapers all owned by Hearst. Thankfully years later the film is appreciated for what it is. The finest work of an avant garde filmmaking genius in Welles.Lets start with the element of mise en scene (the techniques employed to combine visual elements e.g lighting, camera movement, setting and camera techniques such as montage to parallel the on screen narrative). Firstly to create the complex and materialistic Kane, Welles puts in a first class performance a seasoned actor would be proud of. Since this was Welles' first feature film, its even more astonishing that his input stemmed top to bottom and worked to such perfection. With all this in mind it's understandable a young up and coming filmmaker would want to be expressive in his work, but its unbelievable that all works to such accord. But as stated, its the cinematic techniques and the little things we ordinarily don't place emphasis or attention to that impress.The use of extreme camera angles is noteworthy in symbolising the sway of power in exchanges; Kane is occasionally framed from extreme angles- low visually making him overpowering and mirroring the on screen events. Aside from this the use of shadow and chiaroscuro lighting parallel the on screen narration, e.g the enigmatic Kane is often filmed in shadow symbolic of the private and emotionally detached Kanes dark persona and the enigma behind 'rosebud'.Setting is another important tool in conveying a story and Citizen Kane not only showcases the perfect settings but its inventive camera-work perfectly complements the environments to maximise their effectiveness. A good example of this is in showing Kane standing at a window when his adoptive father speaks with him. The window appears overpowering next to the minute Kane in the distance, but with just a few steps forward Kane appears overpowering to the camera framing as he speaks of his own vision for building an empire. All appear irrelevant and you may read and think I'm reading too much into these little bouts of symbolism and visual parallelling narrative in aiding the story but one thing is for certain is that these are no accidents and are absolutely deliberate.A little about the story. Charles Foster Kane is dying and his last word uttered is 'rosebud'. Immediately the press attempt to uncover the significance of this and a reporter is sent to interview the nearest and dearest to Kane throughout different periods of his life. The narrative unfolds from the non linear technique of flashbacks and the use of montage is deployed in conveying the jumps in time at different points. One of the most interesting concepts about telling the story in this method is that its more expansive in fleshing out the protagonist Kane; since each storyteller has a different perspective of their own on Kane, each contributes to humanising and dehumanising him accordingly.If I had to place this film into a particular Genre is would categorise it as drama, the transformation of Kane from youthful millionaire with good intentions to selfish materialistic recluse dramatic and extreme. To preach, the film takes a swipe at the rewards and benefits of capitalist America at the time, Kane quoting 'if i hadn't been rich, i might have been a great man'. Profound and innovative it is with money and power undoubtedly being the catalyst for Kanes unpleasant transformation.Supporting performances are all top notch from Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotton etc are the icing on the cake making this film near perfect in truth.

All appear irrelevant and you may read and think I'm reading too much into these little bouts of symbolism and visual parallelling narrative in aiding the story but one thing is for certain is that these are no accidents and are absolutely deliberate.A little about the story. Charles Foster Kane is dying and his last word uttered is 'rosebud'. Immediately the press attempt to uncover the significance of this and a reporter is sent to interview the nearest and dearest to Kane throughout different periods of his life. The narrative unfolds from the non linear technique of flashbacks and the use of montage is deployed in conveying the jumps in time at different points. One of the most interesting concepts about telling the story in this method is that its more expansive in fleshing out the protagonist Kane; since each storyteller has a different perspective of their own on Kane, each contributes to humanising and dehumanising him accordingly.If I had to place this film into a particular Genre is would categorise it as drama, the transformation of Kane from youthful millionaire with good intentions to selfish materialistic recluse dramatic and extreme. To preach, the film takes a swipe at the rewards and benefits of capitalist America at the time, Kane quoting 'if i hadn't been rich, i might have been a great man'. Profound and innovative it is with money and power undoubtedly being the catalyst for Kanes unpleasant transformation.Supporting performances are all top notch from Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotton etc are the icing on the cake making this film near perfect in truth. I highly recommend giving this film a go, and cannot think of any reason to dislike the film. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, nobody can deny its creative flair, such was the innovation that it spawned a whole new genre in film noir.

Four men who work in a low-rent, shady real estate office, selling timeshare-like plans to people, or faceless leads, who will buy in. The men are Shelley 'The Machine' Levene (Jack Lemmon), a salesman stuck in a seemingly impenetrable rut, Dave Moss (Ed Harris), who is planning to upstage some sort of a corporate rebuttal against the system, George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), another agent stuck in a rut, and Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), the fiery suit who can close pretty much any deal and is currently the big man in the office.When Blake (Alec Baldwin) is sent by the unseen owners of the business, Mitch and Murray, to give the men a profanity-laced tirade, criticizing them for their work ethic and offering prizes to the closers, the men become desperate and power-hungry. Blake states that two biggest sellers will be given the promising Glengarry leads (leads is slang for potential customers) while the other two will be given pink slips. First prize is a new car, second is a set of steak knives, third, you're fired.The leads the men currently have are underwhelming and are tough to deal with. Pacino's Ricky gives a nice commentary to the manager, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), that dealing with men named Patel is an absolute nightmare. Williamson doesn't care one bit. He hates the four men with a passion, and is glad that walking papers will be handed to two of them. Desperation and betrayal quickly cloud their judgment, and the next day, it is discovered someone robbed the shop and stole the Glengarry leads.Glengarry Glen Ross is a fiery business drama centering around disloyalty to a company and looming corruption. It is among one of the most intelligent and most poignant pictures of the nineties decade, and occupies some of the finest dialog and performances from then, as well. Al Pacino gives a breakneck performance as Ricky, and kicks in during the last forty minutes which are set entirely in the office, with the camera circling to whoever happens to be speaking. Spacey, who is arguably one of the best everyman's in film, is stupendous, and the same can be said for Alan Arkin. But the performances I was sold on the most were Jack Lemmon, who unintentionally makes his character sympathetic, despite being a shameful, snaky soul, and Alec Baldwin, whose appearance in the film is less than ten minutes, but carries forth an impact that is truly a lasting one. He tells the office in his verbally abusive speech that they need to Always Be Closing and need to remember four things when striking a deal; Attention, Interest, Decision, and Action. Baldwin's delivery is rock solid and was worthy of an Oscar nominee, which the Academy sadly overlooked. I thought if he would've appeared a few more times during the film it would've been apparent he got a nomination. But that's the beauty of his performance - he shows up, bats off obscenities, passes judgment, and then walks out the door. What a beautifully cynical performance he gives.The whole film can be summed up by the phrase, beautifully cynical. It paints a bleak, gray portrait of the real estate world, how foggy and grim it really is, where desperation, thievery, and cloudy negotiations cut through honesty and devotion. The picture was based on a play by the film's screenwriter, David Mamet, and looks and feels every bit like one. It has only a handful of basic settings, cut-throat characters, some of the sharpest monologues out there, and the time just fleets past you. Glengarry Glen Ross is a deeply involving gem of a picture, all leading up to a heartless and involving conclusion. It's a shame a great film by all these actors today is seldom seen.Starring Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by James Foley.

Based on true events, it is more like a documentary than a feature film. It tells the story of Christopher Emanuel Balestrero, a happily married father of two young children. Balestrero is a musician. He plays the bass fiddle in a musical group at the upmarket Stork Club, a nightclub in New York. His wife Rose needs expensive dental treatment because she has four impacted wisdom teeth. The couple cannot afford the treatment, which will cost $300. So, Balestrero visits the office of the insurance company at which he is paying for life insurance policies for himself, his wife and the two children to see if he can borrow the money to pay for Rose's dental treatment against her policy. While there, he is identified by several members of staff as being the person who robbed the company previously. Balestrero is arrested and subsequently charged with the crime (which, as the title of the film suggests, he did not, in fact, commit). And that sets in train a chain of events that causes a huge amount of emotional and financial turmoil for the Balestrero family. The acting is first rate. Henry Fonda and Vera Miles are excellent in the starring roles. Miles is particularly good at portraying the emotional scarring her character (Rose) receives as a result of events that she is helpless to influence and which appear to be spiralling out of control. There are, however, a number of problems with the film. It is sombre in tone. That by itself would not ordinarily be an issue worthy of comment. But The Wrong Man is also - and this is somewhat surprising, given that it is a Hitchcock film - extremely dull and turgid. There is almost no suspense or tension. And there is none of the macabre humour that is present in most of Hitchcock's other work. Even the trademark brief non-speaking appearance by the director is dispensed with in this film (although that may be because Hitchcock makes a short appearance in shadowy form before the opening credits to explain that The Wrong Man is somewhat different from his other films). There are also some continuity problems. No further reference is made in the film (after the initial one) to the dental treatment that Rose supposedly needs. Did she receive it? And, if so, how was it paid for? Much later in the plot, Rose needs (and receives) what must surely have been expensive medical treatment under the American health care system of the time. No explanation is offered as to how it was paid for. This seems odd when the screenplay does address the issue of how $7,500 is found to fund Balestrero's bail and does refer to the problem Balestrero is likely to have in paying his legal fees (his lawyer is sympathetic and agrees not to insist on an immediate payment). Also, as good as Fonda is, I think he looks rather older in the film than the age of the character he is playing (who is 38 years old).So, although not a bad film, The Wrong Man is a disappointingly ordinary one that is unlikely to live as long in the memory as most of Hitchcock's others. 6\/10.

Hollywood's reaction towards minorities has always been very black and white from back in the days when the natives of America were portrayed on film as scalping savages. Yet here we get a now-trendy depiction of Islamic fundamentalists, just six years after Rambo helped the Taliban get into power. Although these films are just mindless entertainment, seeing the reflections of US foreign policy through them can be interesting. Art Malik plays a terrorist known as the Sand Spider (hmmmmmm, sound a little like a racial epithet you might know...?) who is sometimes used for comedy purposes, sometimes more sinister ones. At one point we're expected to laugh and cheer as this crazy fundamentalist has his nuts crushed on a plane and is fired off on a missile... yet before that we're shown his villainy as he slaps a woman twice in the face.Ah, the women. Jamie Lee Curtis' big role in this is to do a striptease. Though as she hits and kicks the guy who made her do it, it's okay, right? That's empowerment... take your clothes off for millions, but then kick a man and it's all okay, you didn't sell out. Though as she was previously most famous for getting her boobs out in Trading Places I guess it's a step up. And it's not as if her dad was using the medium of film to actually make worthwhile points, like The Defiant Ones, is it? Oh, wait.Yet the really repellent part of this film comes with the only other prominent female character, Tia Carrere's Juno. There only for the money (in more ways than one) she's the recipient of the previously-mentioned face slaps, a token Asian who doesn't care about anyone and only exists to be the victim of physical abuse, or to be called\/referred to as a bitch on no less than four occasions. Hollywood of the time had a penchant for violence against women as some kind of obnoxious titillation... in the previous year's underrated Last Action Hero, we saw Arnold's daughter being slapped around, conveniently landing on a close up of her cleavage before indulging in some crotch- kicking ripostes. Similarly, the following year's Godawful Stallone vehicle Judge Dredd saw two women going at it, with a token Asian girl getting bashed around by the righteous white American girl... after trying to kick her in the vagina, of course. Such a mess of sexualised racial-gender violence comes to the fore here, with a scene that has Lee Curtis slash Carrere's face open by deliberately turning her wedding ring inside out to slap her. We're supposed to cheer the nominal heroes, but are we really to cheer a woman mutilating another? Their conflict comes to an end after Curtis repeatedly punches Carrere in the face (who has, for the sake of completion, just done the same) before braining her twice with a wine bottle.Maybe it's taking it all too seriously to suggest that this overblown nonsense is a sexist, ambiguously violent and almost overtly racist propaganda vehicle for a guy who went on to become a Republican Governor. But there's a deeply unpleasant underside to this would-be action comedy, an unpleasant tract in the narrative. As a film it's competently made and stands up quite well as it approaches its twentieth anniversary, only the 80s-throwback soundtrack really dating it. The characters have more meat by the standards of a typical Schwarzenegger movie (which is to say, still next to none at all) though the humour inherent is bland, banal and obvious. Yet it still exists as an ethically questionable piece of work, a $115,000,000 political statement where you can thrill to a woman slashing open another woman's face. Great entertainment for all the family.

Art Malik plays a terrorist known as the Sand Spider (hmmmmmm, sound a little like a racial epithet you might know...?) who is sometimes used for comedy purposes, sometimes more sinister ones. At one point we're expected to laugh and cheer as this crazy fundamentalist has his nuts crushed on a plane and is fired off on a missile... yet before that we're shown his villainy as he slaps a woman twice in the face.Ah, the women. Jamie Lee Curtis' big role in this is to do a striptease. Though as she hits and kicks the guy who made her do it, it's okay, right? That's empowerment... take your clothes off for millions, but then kick a man and it's all okay, you didn't sell out. Though as she was previously most famous for getting her boobs out in Trading Places I guess it's a step up. And it's not as if her dad was using the medium of film to actually make worthwhile points, like The Defiant Ones, is it? Oh, wait.Yet the really repellent part of this film comes with the only other prominent female character, Tia Carrere's Juno. There only for the money (in more ways than one) she's the recipient of the previously-mentioned face slaps, a token Asian who doesn't care about anyone and only exists to be the victim of physical abuse, or to be called\/referred to as a bitch on no less than four occasions. Hollywood of the time had a penchant for violence against women as some kind of obnoxious titillation... in the previous year's underrated Last Action Hero, we saw Arnold's daughter being slapped around, conveniently landing on a close up of her cleavage before indulging in some crotch- kicking ripostes. Similarly, the following year's Godawful Stallone vehicle Judge Dredd saw two women going at it, with a token Asian girl getting bashed around by the righteous white American girl... after trying to kick her in the vagina, of course. Such a mess of sexualised racial-gender violence comes to the fore here, with a scene that has Lee Curtis slash Carrere's face open by deliberately turning her wedding ring inside out to slap her. We're supposed to cheer the nominal heroes, but are we really to cheer a woman mutilating another? Their conflict comes to an end after Curtis repeatedly punches Carrere in the face (who has, for the sake of completion, just done the same) before braining her twice with a wine bottle.Maybe it's taking it all too seriously to suggest that this overblown nonsense is a sexist, ambiguously violent and almost overtly racist propaganda vehicle for a guy who went on to become a Republican Governor. But there's a deeply unpleasant underside to this would-be action comedy, an unpleasant tract in the narrative. As a film it's competently made and stands up quite well as it approaches its twentieth anniversary, only the 80s-throwback soundtrack really dating it. The characters have more meat by the standards of a typical Schwarzenegger movie (which is to say, still next to none at all) though the humour inherent is bland, banal and obvious. Yet it still exists as an ethically questionable piece of work, a $115,000,000 political statement where you can thrill to a woman slashing open another woman's face. Great entertainment for all the family.

May saw the release of one of his most revered films, Rear Window. Then, only a few short months later he released another classic in August called Dial M for Murder. Rear Window might be the more well known of the two, but I don't think I'm prepared to say that it's the better of the two. Dial M for Murder is a thrilling story about an ex tennis player who plans to murder his cheating wife for the vast fortune she would leave behind. However, things go awry and he must elaborate a new scheme and comes up with an incredible plan B. It's a story full of intrigue, mystery, suspense, blackmail, two-timing, double-crossing, etc, etc. And it is absolutely awesome.This has to be one of the most brilliantly imagined and ingeniously constructed plots of all time. The plot is so elaborate for a story that only centers around three characters and the police chief investigating them. The plans that are devised are so well constructed and so meticulously played out that the suspense grows wonderfully throughout the whole film. There's a lot of dialogue and not a lot of action, but the genius all comes from this dialogue that perpetuates one of the most brilliant tales of deceit and deception I've ever heard. It is true genius via storytelling and it is certainly one of the most eloquently devious crimes I've ever seen in film.Of course, all the while the brilliant auteur that is Alfred Hitchcock directs the story with keen eye for witty detail, and beautifully arranged scenes with all sort of subtle brilliances that you don't quite catch at first. Hitchcock's flare that he always plays up in his films can come down to the simplest things, like how Grace Kelly's character begins the film wearing bright and vivid colors, but as the story grows darker and the situation more harrowing her clothes darken. It's brilliant things like that that make this film and all of Hitchcock's other masterpieces just that, masterpieces.I'm prepared to say that this is one of Mr. Hitchcock's finest directorial efforts and one of his finest films. The story is so elaborate and so masterfully told. The execution of Frederick Knot's script is perfect and the story is so enthralling and so exciting all the way through. The film isn't boring for a second. It is exactly what every crime story should be.
