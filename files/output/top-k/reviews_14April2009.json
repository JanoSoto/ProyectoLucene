As much as I like Gladiator and Troy, they always seem so distant. Perhaps this being closer to our time and fought on our turf, just before we set off on our own as a nation - it speaks more to me. Only Mel Gibson and The Patriot come close to the excellence in cinema that tells of this time. Like a lot of guys, I am easily won over by big, epic, sweeping, romantic stories of war and heroism - I enjoy them immensely. This is the one I enjoy the most. I think in part it's because all of the tribes at war here, are presented in a favorable light. The French and the British, Mohawk and Huron, the settlers and colonists - you like all of them! There are bad guys too, but it's the Noble men that stand out. And there are noble men and the showing of honor throughout. I'm sure Mr. Cooper's great telling of a good story has a lot to do with it - the writers always do. But it's the movie we're talking about.It might just be my imagination, but it seems that Michael Mann always does something with the lighting. I think it goes all the way back to his Miami Vice days. It seems to affect the intimacy, or the way we view the people. But I could be wrong. His two best films are this one and Heat. With the greatest shootout anywhere being the one in Heat. Daniel Day Lewis wore the part of Hawkeye as though it had been tailor made. What an excellent performance. But then he's famous for the study he puts into his characters. There are some seemingly smart strong people in every group presented here, no one tribe has all the virtue. In that sense, they are equals - a rarity in storytelling and movie making. So much of history is crowded with the master and servant relationship that also ends up in much of our literature. And there is always an element of truth to that, but it's not the whole truth. Don't forget, it's the winners who always write the history. Seldom does a conquerer speak well of a vanquished foe. The character of Chingachgook, the older Mohawk and former chief, has got the coolest weapon in the form of a Mohawk throwing axe. It's so big it looks like a rifle when it's slung over his back, but it's not. This is not at all a Western, which occupies a unique time period in our history between the end of the Civil War and the early 1900's. One hundred years before there was ever a west to have cowboys in - there was the Frontier and frontiersmen. A completely different time, place and people - not related to the cowboy. This is their say, let them have it.It all takes place during the time that the British and French are fighting for control over the fur trade in the north all the way up into Canada, and the sugar trade all the way down south into the Caribbean. Sometimes wars are about the land, but many times they're about the money coming from the resources. This is one of those times, and the heat of the battle over this money is the French and Indian War - at least on land. Which covers the period of our story. You never hear that in movies or novels, but that is the history of it. When left to themselves, Cain will always kill Abel - over something. I leave it on that note as it ties in perfectly with the sense of remorse and longing we're left with from the story. But you'll have to watch this most excellent movie for yourself to see what any of that means. I don't think you'll be disappointed. It is a rich tale, a grand sweeping romantic action adventure epic, a satisfying movie, and a most beautiful one at that.

The facts of Helfgott's life that seem to be beyond dispute are that he was a gifted pianist as a child and suffered a mental breakdown as an adolescent that impaired him for life. In spite of his disorder (that landed him in a mental hospital where he was administered Electroconvulsive therapy) he has been able to perform, first in a wine bar and then on the concert stage; he has also made several recordings. Director Hicks admits that this is a partially fictionalized biography and there is dispute as to just how fictionalized it is. Helfgott's sister Margaret has published a book, Out of Tune David Helfgott and the Myth of Shine, that disputes much of what is in the movie, particularly the portrayal of Peter, the father. And if it is fictionalized, why use the names of real people?Helfgott's story is indeed an interesting one, but pursuing the real David Helfgott story should not be a consideration when evaluating this movie.The biggest problem I had was with the total disconnect between Helfgott's personality in the first half of the movie (before his breakdown) and the second half, many years later. There is little hint of Helfgott's having mental problems before he collapses, after his recital. I cannot believe that such a dramatic personality-changing emotional disorder can be precipitated by a single event, as implied. There had to be warning signs and I felt it was unfair to spring this on us simply for dramatic effect. The extreme transformation from a rather serious, likable, reserved youth to a completely different man\/child who loves to hug people and babble incoherently I found unbelievable.The nature of David's mental illness is never explored, and that left me at a loss in trying to understanding the man. Helfgott's troubled relationship with his father is implicated in his breakdown as is his intense preparation for a performance of the Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3. But, lots of people have troubled family dynamics and most every person who embarks on a professional career has moments of extreme stress and they don't come close to David's reaction as seen in this movie. I find the suggestion that strictly external events caused David's breakdown to be disservice to what is known about mental illnesses. Clearly there was a ticking time bomb in David's brain just waiting to be set off.While studying the Rachmaninov at The Royal College of Music in London David's mentor Cecil Parkes makes the comments, Performing's a risk, you know--no safety net. Make no mistake, David. It's dangerous. People get hurt. Also, Helfgott's father has made the comment that the Rachmaninov 3rd Piano Concerto is the hardest piece in the world, which is simply not true. The concerto is indeed a difficult one, but no more so than dozens of other classical pieces and it should be within the abilities of a prodigy in late adolescence. Parkes and Helfgott's father make the decision to perform the Rachmaninov Concerto out to be a life or death venture, that only a few who attempt it survive--this makes for dramatic tension at the expense of the truth.David's father Peter is presented as having a controlling love for his son. Interspersed with some tenderness on Peter's part are episodes of his perpetrating mental and physical abuse. When David has the opportunity to study in America, Peter prohibits it. Later, when David announces he is going to London Peter tries to prevent it and when David says he is going anyway, Peter tells him that if he leaves he will never be allowed back in the house. Peter's behavior makes little sense--he wants his son to succeed in the worst way, but seems bent on preventing that from happening. When Peter tells his son that, No one will love you like me, I would think David's response would be, I certainly hope so.There are a lot of little bothersome things. Like the first scene that has David, as an adult, showing up in the rain late at night at a wine bar that has just closed for the evening. Ignoring discouragement David keeps knocking until the proprietor comes to the door and she quickly adopts the attitude of, Oh, come in, we love you. Hardly a believable reaction to a crazy person appearing at your door speaking in an incomprehensible staccato.When, as a child, David is playing a part of the Rachmaninov Concerto from what he has heard on a recording his father sends him off to bed and, amazingly, then picks up a score for the concerto that just happens to be on the top of the piano. Wouldn't David have looked at that score if he were really interested in learning it?Geoffrey Rush runs around trying his best to make the adult David out to be a mad, but lovable, genius. This is the type of flashy role that wins Oscars, and Rush did. For my money Noah Taylor, as the adolescent David, is the one who shines. John Gielgud, as David's London mentor, is delightful as usual. Armin Mueller-Stahl, as David's father, creates a believable, self-tormented character in his Oscar-nominated performance. Lynn Redgrave is fine as David's wife.I came away feeling that this movie was disguising what could be a truly interesting story.

But his performance as Lt. Col. Frank Slade in SCENT OF A WOMAN must rank among his top ten performances. It was a surprise film performance that captured his second Oscar, and gave new impetus to his career. It is also an interesting view on the importance of character, and how it can be intentionally smashed by those supposed to be building it up.Chris O'Donnell is Charley Simms, a teenager on a scholarship to one of the most elite prep schools in America. He works in the library. One day he and another student are the last two locking up the library, and they see three students (one is Bradley Whitford) trashing an expensive new automobile belonging to the pompous and unlikeable new headmaster Mr. Trask (James Rebhorn). Trask sees the activities and runs to his car, but the three boys scatter. He is pretty certain who they are, but he did not see them clearly. He does stop Charley and the other boy and demands to know what they saw. And here the problem begins that will mushroom until the film ends.Trask is a petty little snot-nose, and wants the heads of the three boys not so much because they did a wrong, but because they held him up to ridicule before the school body. Soon he is pressuring his two witnesses to cooperate, or face serious consequences (expulsion and probable social ruin). The other boy, your typical rich kid party animal, is weak and under additional pressure from his father (who'll ship him to the military if he does not knuckle under). Charlie is poor, and can be easily swatted, but Trask is willing that if Charlie cooperates there is nothing the school won't do for him when he heads for a high university career.It is Thanksgiving weekend, and Charley is not going home to Oregon. He sees that there is a blind officer who wants to go to New York City for the holiday, and needs an assistant. It is Lt. Col. Slade, and Charley goes to offer his services, only to find Slade a bitter and prickly man. He was once a promising military figure (he was an aide to President Lyndon Johnson) but he lost his eyesight in a stupid trick he was playing, and was retired from the military. Although he has a good pension he feels his life is in tatters.The two go to Manhattan, checking into a first rate hotel, and enjoying the sites (as much as Slade can enjoy it, or Charley for that matter due to the crisis back at the school). But the two click, and Slade begins seeing in Charley the son that he would always have liked to have. Highlights of the trip include a wonderful moment when Charley and Slade (who can pretend he can see) test a magnificent convertible on a deserted twelfth avenue in Manhattan on Sunday morning with Slade driving while Charley keeps an eye on potential dangers. Slade also is still quite the lady's man, the title being a reference to his enhanced sense of smell of women's perfumes.In the end Slade learns what the situation is for Charley, who cannot depend on anyone to help him (his father is long gone from his life, and his step-father could not care less about him). Slade ends up with Charlie at the conclusion - a hearing where Trask is going to break both his witnesses to get at the three guilty parties. And while the other boy somewhat caves in, Charley just can't bring himself to say anything.SPOILER COMING UP Slade is the one who humiliates Trask. He announces that whatever Charley failed to do to satisfy the little headmaster he was not a snitch, and that the ideals of the school are dying in the hands of the headmaster who'd break the spirit of the boys there for his own pettiness. The quote in the Summary Line is part of Slade's speech, in answer to Trask commenting about the great men who came out of the prep school. What good of having these great men to talk of if the very character building blocks that are sought are demolished by the likes of Trask? Slade points out to the students and teachers that if they leadership they should stick to Charley who won't snitch as opposed to the other fellow and the three idiots who caused the prank but lack the spirit to confess and face punishment. Slade's speech does the trick, and Charley is not punished.In the end one senses the two men will remain close. It seems right that they should.Oh, I kept referring to the other witness without telling who he is. It was a surprise when I watched the film recently. The character, George Wills Jr., is a party animal type - not really bright and his father has paved his way in with money and donations. I knew someone like that in my college - he was a nice guy but a heavy drinker. He died prematurely (before his own father) in 1989, from the results of his heavy drinking. The character of George Wills, Jr., helpless in the hands of his dad and Trask (though he tries to limit the damage of his testimony) was played by the young Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's interesting to see a budding personality of the screen in an early performance of promise. Within fifteen years Hoffman too would have his best acting Oscar.As for my old college acquaintance, this is dedicated to the unfortunate Donald.

It is also an interesting view on the importance of character, and how it can be intentionally smashed by those supposed to be building it up.Chris O'Donnell is Charley Simms, a teenager on a scholarship to one of the most elite prep schools in America. He works in the library. One day he and another student are the last two locking up the library, and they see three students (one is Bradley Whitford) trashing an expensive new automobile belonging to the pompous and unlikeable new headmaster Mr. Trask (James Rebhorn). Trask sees the activities and runs to his car, but the three boys scatter. He is pretty certain who they are, but he did not see them clearly. He does stop Charley and the other boy and demands to know what they saw. And here the problem begins that will mushroom until the film ends.Trask is a petty little snot-nose, and wants the heads of the three boys not so much because they did a wrong, but because they held him up to ridicule before the school body. Soon he is pressuring his two witnesses to cooperate, or face serious consequences (expulsion and probable social ruin). The other boy, your typical rich kid party animal, is weak and under additional pressure from his father (who'll ship him to the military if he does not knuckle under). Charlie is poor, and can be easily swatted, but Trask is willing that if Charlie cooperates there is nothing the school won't do for him when he heads for a high university career.It is Thanksgiving weekend, and Charley is not going home to Oregon. He sees that there is a blind officer who wants to go to New York City for the holiday, and needs an assistant. It is Lt. Col. Slade, and Charley goes to offer his services, only to find Slade a bitter and prickly man. He was once a promising military figure (he was an aide to President Lyndon Johnson) but he lost his eyesight in a stupid trick he was playing, and was retired from the military. Although he has a good pension he feels his life is in tatters.The two go to Manhattan, checking into a first rate hotel, and enjoying the sites (as much as Slade can enjoy it, or Charley for that matter due to the crisis back at the school). But the two click, and Slade begins seeing in Charley the son that he would always have liked to have. Highlights of the trip include a wonderful moment when Charley and Slade (who can pretend he can see) test a magnificent convertible on a deserted twelfth avenue in Manhattan on Sunday morning with Slade driving while Charley keeps an eye on potential dangers. Slade also is still quite the lady's man, the title being a reference to his enhanced sense of smell of women's perfumes.In the end Slade learns what the situation is for Charley, who cannot depend on anyone to help him (his father is long gone from his life, and his step-father could not care less about him). Slade ends up with Charlie at the conclusion - a hearing where Trask is going to break both his witnesses to get at the three guilty parties. And while the other boy somewhat caves in, Charley just can't bring himself to say anything.SPOILER COMING UP Slade is the one who humiliates Trask. He announces that whatever Charley failed to do to satisfy the little headmaster he was not a snitch, and that the ideals of the school are dying in the hands of the headmaster who'd break the spirit of the boys there for his own pettiness. The quote in the Summary Line is part of Slade's speech, in answer to Trask commenting about the great men who came out of the prep school. What good of having these great men to talk of if the very character building blocks that are sought are demolished by the likes of Trask? Slade points out to the students and teachers that if they leadership they should stick to Charley who won't snitch as opposed to the other fellow and the three idiots who caused the prank but lack the spirit to confess and face punishment.

The character of George Wills, Jr., helpless in the hands of his dad and Trask (though he tries to limit the damage of his testimony) was played by the young Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Hey Stella!Tennessee Williams' sexually charged play is given a superb adaptation by Elia Kazan with a screenplay from Williams. Blance Du Bois is Vivien Leigh in a powerhouse performance that rightly got her a second Oscar. Kim Hunter is Stella Kowalski and the amazing Marlon Brando is Stanley Kowalski, with one of his finest performances and one that should have won him the Academy Award as his performance was 'greater' than Bogart's in the African Queen. Brando brings the brutishness, roughness and volatile personality of Stanley Kowalski that is one of Cinema's defining performances. This is a film, like the play about personalities, characters, in the intoxicating city of New Orleans; it is a film about charged sexuality, strange relations, mystique, wonderful undertones and one of the greatest ensembles of actors ever displayed on film. Elia Kazan's film rightly deserves its place in the National Film Registry in the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant - and this film is significant and very influential.(Summary) As in the play, the film presents Blanche DuBois, a fading but still-attractive Southern belle whose pretensions to virtue and culture only thinly mask delusions of grandeur and alcoholism. Her poise is an illusion she presents to shield others, but most of all herself, from her reality, and an attempt to make herself still attractive to new male suitors. Blanche arrives from their hometown of Auriol, Mississippi at the apartment of her sister Stella Kowalski in the Faubourg Marigny of New Orleans, on Elysian Fields Avenue; the local transportation she takes to arrive there includes a streetcar route named Desire. The steamy, urban ambiance is a shock to Blanche's nerves. Explaining that her ancestral southern plantation, Belle Reve in Auriol, Mississippi, has been lost due to the epic fornications of her ancestors, Blanche is welcomed with some trepidation by Stella, who fears the reaction of her husband Stanley. Blanche explains to them how her supervisor told her she could take time off from her job as an English teacher because of her upset nerves, when in fact, she has been fired for having an affair with a 17-year-old student. This turns out not to be the only seduction she has engaged in&#x97;and, along with other problems, has left Auriol to escape. A brief marriage scarred by the suicide of her spouse, Allen Grey, has led Blanche to live in a world in which her fantasies and illusions are seamlessly mixed with her reality.In contrast to both the self-effacing and deferent Stella and the pretentious refinement of Blanche, Stella's husband, Stanley Kowalski, is a force of nature primal, rough, brutish and sensual. He dominates Stella in every way and is physically and emotionally abusive. Stella tolerates his primal behaviour as this is part of what attracted her in the first place; their love and relationship is heavily based on powerful even animalistic sexual chemistry, something that Blanche finds impossible to understand.The arrival of Blanche upsets her sister and brother-in-law's system of mutual dependence. Stella's concern for her sister's well-being emboldens Blanche to hold court in the Kowalski apartment, infuriating Stanley and leading to conflict in his relationship with his wife. Stanley's friend and Blanche's would-be suitor Mitch is trampled along Blanche and Stanley's collision course. Stanley discovers Blanche's past through a co-worker who travels to Auriol frequently, and Stanley confronts Blanche with the things she has been trying to put behind her, partly out of concern that her character flaws may be damaging to the lives of those in her new home, just as they were in Auriol, and partly out of a distaste for pretence in general.

Part VI seems to be happening as if part V never took place. Okay, the way Jason can come back to life is probably the coolest return in the whole series. The actors, however, are not that cool, and the actresses portray women as whores. No wonder many feminists were so angry on this movie (but, in fact, they were mad on the whole series, for not portraying female characters with more intelligence). This sort of horror movies - also known as slashers - let the audience see that women are sluts. Itis but to wonder if it really was (and is) so, or that it's all based on the thesis that guys are heroes and girls not (as in Temple of Doom). The women in this particular picture are portrayed stupid and dumb. They do idiotic things, like shooting paint on men with guns in their hands for fun. Yeah, that's really funny... What's also funny is the kind of humor in this film (sarcastic laugh) with only one cut, Jason beheads three of his victims at once. Pretty sharp sword, I would say.The cemetery scenes show us the horrors that await the characters, with fences around the graves (yes, you see them everywhere nowadays) to hold the dead in a cage, safely buried under the ground. If the young people 'visit' the cemetery, they break the cage of the dead, and by that, they give Jason a free card to go on killing the living after his death. Alcohol on a graveyard could mean the opposite of what we see, that the living are caged in the land of the dead. Because Jason lives, as the title says, it is probably that we are dead, or that we are maybe supposed to die.The few nudity scenes in part VI are worthless, you can't see anything in focus. So because there aren't any good nudity scenes in it, we must concentrate on the real horror in this movie.Since part V ended with a stupid death sequence that could hardly be called creepy (die! die! die!), it was actually a good idea of the director to do as if it never happened. But if part V never occurred, how did Tommy get the hockey mask of Jason in his possession? If part IV ended like it did, I would suppose the police put the mask safely away in a vault somewhere on the police bureau or something, unless Tommy's big sister would help her kid brother to hide that mask from the police. But why would she do something like that? Especially because she didn't return in part VI? Why??? 'Jason lives'? No, he dies almost every time, but he still manages to come back like Chucky or Freddy.

No wonder many feminists were so angry on this movie (but, in fact, they were mad on the whole series, for not portraying female characters with more intelligence). This sort of horror movies - also known as slashers - let the audience see that women are sluts. Itis but to wonder if it really was (and is) so, or that it's all based on the thesis that guys are heroes and girls not (as in Temple of Doom). The women in this particular picture are portrayed stupid and dumb. They do idiotic things, like shooting paint on men with guns in their hands for fun. Yeah, that's really funny... What's also funny is the kind of humor in this film (sarcastic laugh) with only one cut, Jason beheads three of his victims at once. Pretty sharp sword, I would say.The cemetery scenes show us the horrors that await the characters, with fences around the graves (yes, you see them everywhere nowadays) to hold the dead in a cage, safely buried under the ground. If the young people 'visit' the cemetery, they break the cage of the dead, and by that, they give Jason a free card to go on killing the living after his death. Alcohol on a graveyard could mean the opposite of what we see, that the living are caged in the land of the dead. Because Jason lives, as the title says, it is probably that we are dead, or that we are maybe supposed to die.The few nudity scenes in part VI are worthless, you can't see anything in focus. So because there aren't any good nudity scenes in it, we must concentrate on the real horror in this movie.Since part V ended with a stupid death sequence that could hardly be called creepy (die! die! die!), it was actually a good idea of the director to do as if it never happened. But if part V never occurred, how did Tommy get the hockey mask of Jason in his possession? If part IV ended like it did, I would suppose the police put the mask safely away in a vault somewhere on the police bureau or something, unless Tommy's big sister would help her kid brother to hide that mask from the police. But why would she do something like that? Especially because she didn't return in part VI? Why??? 'Jason lives'? No, he dies almost every time, but he still manages to come back like Chucky or Freddy.

In 2008, Tim Robbins, Rachel McAdams and Michael Peña took a trip across the country in The Lucky Ones. In 2006, a family took a trip to Redondo Beach, California for a beauty pageant in Little Miss Sunshine. And in 2002, Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna hooked a beautiful older woman in Y tu mamá también. Each film has its own reason for the road trip, but they all feature the same basic prospect all individuals stuck in the car find out a little bit more about themselves along the way. In the case of this film, the characters learn much more than a little; in fact, they learn quite a lot about themselves and about each other. I won't go into too much detail as to what exactly each person learns (because that would give so much of the movie away), but just be in for a lot of information coming at you at once. The acting is very good, especially from Maribel Verdú, portraying the woman that both boys fantasize after. I had a couple of problems with the film. Firstly, it tends to stretch on and on, and although it leads up to a very good finalé, I just think that it took a little too long to get there. Secondly, there happens to be random dialogue about the areas surrounding the car-going travelers, which helps to set the stage and the state of the country as a whole, but in the course of things, tends to distract the viewer from the actual story at hand. But aside from that, it's a very well-made film. One review I've read calls it a comment on economics and sexuality, which is very close to being correct. If you aren't partial to rampant amounts of sexual escapades, this definitely isn't for you. Any of the characters could find themselves in some sort of sexual encounter at any time, so be prepared for that as well. On the whole, a solid film that's worth a watch if you don't mind the sexuality of it all.

The opening scene shows the directors of CyberCorp discussing the next step in Mecha - a robot which can love. In real world discussions of AI (as well as in many well written science fiction novels), there's been a lot of thought put as to what exactly AI means. Is the sex-bot in the opening scene self aware? Obviously it's capable of abstract thought (love making takes planning, after all, as well as subtle judgements of one's partner), but is it capable of learning? Video game makers have already developed AIs that can adapt to the player's strategy, but they're not capable of innovating; of creating strategies that the makers didn't originally intend.So, for argument's sake, the sex bot has complex mechanisms for executing language, analyzing human emotion, and adapting to her partner - but not the more abstract ability to innovate or to self-reflect. The next step, then, would be to build a robot with an imagination... oh wait, we just want a robot that will love? Well, define love for me? Is it really that hard to program, if you already have the sex-bot program? Don't get me wrong, like any other human being love is one of my primary driving behaviours - but at the end of the day, isn't it just a fixation on one person combined with a positive-feedback loop? It's hardly a major challenge to AI writers, and if Michael Chrighton can be believed, they'd already developed it back in the 70s (re Terminal Man). Heck, I've played Civ 4, and if you play your cards right, you can get some of the other AIs in that game to 'love' you.You know... taking what I just wrote into consideration, maybe David's dialogue was pretty realistic, after all...Now, do you see what I just did there? I wrote an interesting, plausible, and easily-understandable piece on the development of AI. Instead of the Star Trek techno-babble about 'mapping neurons,' the CEO at the beginning of the movie could have said something like this; framed the moral question for the rest of the movie. But of course A.I. didn't do this, because it's *not really science fiction!* A couple of other points, that I won't belabour too heavily, but need to point out how smart was Teddy? If you were building an intelligent toy for small children, would you give it full reasoning ability, or would you just give it a simple 'comfort' algorithm? Free thought and independent thinking could make the thing dangerous; Keep It Simple, Stupid. Second of all, why do all the humans act as if they've never seen any of the apocryphal literature about Robot Wars? What is this, a zombie flick? A remake of Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) would have been more relevant. Even though he wrote it in 1921, it was more forward thinking (let alone original) than this movie was.

In real world discussions of AI (as well as in many well written science fiction novels), there's been a lot of thought put as to what exactly AI means.

It's hardly a major challenge to AI writers, and if Michael Chrighton can be believed, they'd already developed it back in the 70s (re Terminal Man).

It is probably a more flawed film than The Voyage Home and The Wrath of Khan (which are my favorite Trek films), but The Undiscovered Country nonetheless is a great, great send-off for the original crew (damn you, Generations!) with a very good story and villain and more than a hint of the political intrigue which would become a big part of Deep Space 9. Indeed, though it features the original crew with their trademark interactions intact, The Undiscovered Country does bring them into a story perhaps generally more at home in The Next Generation or Deep Space 9. Though I much prefer The Original Series to anything which came after (outside of a couple of seasons of DS9), this was an interesting direction to go for the original crew's final film, and one which paid off largely again due to the characters being so well-handled.A fairly complex plot in comparison to what we'd seen before in the Trek film series, so I won't bother explaining it, but there's lots of Klingons, lots of politics, and an air of mystery well-created by director Nicholas Meyer, returning as director to the series for the first time since The Wrath of Khan and as writer for the first time since The Voyage Home. Meyer seems to have an uncanny grasp on what makes Trek click and absolutely nails the character interactions as well as the tone of the films, which are ultimately optimistic regardless of how melancholy things can get. It's a great screenplay overall, with the social and political commentary being pretty obvious but very well-done and the characters, again, handled extremely well. Great dialogue too, with Chang being Shakespeare to Khan's Melville and Spock especially getting some classic lines. The cinematography by Hiro Narita is also worthy of note.Overall the cast here is definitely worthy of much praise. Of course the original cast, Mark Lenard as Sarek, and other Trek regulars like Michael Dorn as Worf need no comment as they are all reliable performers. It must be said though that Shatner still had a little of The Final Frontier in him and didn't really deliver a performance on par with his work in the trilogy formed by II, III, and IV. However, there were some very good additions as well. Kim Cattrall doesn't even come close to deserving the sort of criticism she's gotten from some, as she plays her Vulcan character pretty much flawlessly, and I daresay better than Kirstie Alley or whomever took over from her as Saavik. It helps that she's the hottest Vulcan not from Alberta. Christopher Plummer is really, really great as the villain Chang, who isn't as good a character as Khan, but I think Plummer gives perhaps the better performance.Overall an exciting, thrilling adventure filled with political intrigue which never loses sight of the soul of Trek the characters. I do think The Voyage Home has eclipsed this as my second favorite Trek film upon this most recent viewing, but I still love The Undiscovered Country and consider it not only in the top tier of Trek films, but also a great addition to the original crew's adventures and one of the better genre films around.

After my disappointment with classics like Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption (both very good films but I wouldn't consider them to be among the greatest) last month, I was also worried The Godfather might not live up to my expectations. By the time I was 45 minutes into the film, I was completely gripped by the film's unpredictable plot and the lives of the characters, and it just kept getting better as the film progressed.The plot shocked and surprised me at every twist and turn, and the film managed to keep me emotionally attached to the characters without anything ever feeling forced. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was brilliant in this regard, with dramatic events in the film simply shown as matter-of-fact, without any of the over-dramatization you often see in later crime films. The writing by Mario Puzo and Coppola was also brilliant, with plenty of foreshadowing right from the very beginning of the film.Another aspect of the film which stood out was how it wasn't simply centred around a main protagonist with the others having minor roles, but nearly the entire cast was well-developed to a high degree. Despite the powerhouse performances by Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and by Al Pacino as his son Michael, they never completely overshadowed the other cast members who were also brilliant in their own right, particularly James Caan as the elder son Santino, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Al Lettieri as 'The Turk', and Diane Keaton as Kay. Even relatively minor cast members like Talia Shire as Connie Corleone and Gianni Russo as Carlo were also very believable.

Nearly everything about The Godfather is spot-on, with hardly any flaws at all. The only flaw I could think of is the first half-hour being a bit slow-paced, but it really doesn't matter to me anymore seeing as how amazing the film turned out to be.In summary, The Godfather truly does live up to its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Despite the film's now legendary status, I had only watched The Godfather for the first time yesterday.

Very thought provoking. I feel the urge to watch it every year or two. But it's just me-) ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"14 April 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Fly taught me a valuable lesson. It is important for someone to see a film to understand what the film is about and not just take things you hear from other people to form an opinion.Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is a very smart and different type of scientist. After meeting a reporter named Veronica (Geena Davis) he shows her his latest invention. Brundle has invented a machine that will teleport inanimate objects into another machine. However Brundle has problems when trying to teleport living objects. After much work he finally is able to teleport a living baboon through and then he himself goes through it apparently suffering no problems. However unknown to him a fly was in the teleporting machine with him and as a result it has fused with him and slowly is turning him into a man fly.The main idea and story of this film is great. It is a great science fiction story, teleporting machine that can also fuse organisms together. But there is a lot of Horror in the film as well. So as far as being a good science fiction and horror film this film is quite effective.Jeff Goldblum is pretty good in this film. I really enjoyed his performances in Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Independence Day. He really plays a good scientist with a little oddness in him in this film. He speaks in a way easy to hear and understand and also has great facial expressions and hand gestures. Also the scenes where he is with Geena Davis were really good and no doubt their real life experiences together help them to have such good chemistry.There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this film. To be honest, I thought this film would be about Jeff Goldblums character turned into a normal fly. However really he starts to turn into a man fly type creature. Very disturbing scenes are in this film. If you are a person weak in the stomach this may not be a good film for you. Brundle has to do a lot of vomiting in his fly form and it really is quite disgusting. But it does a good job of getting the point of the film across to the audience and really gets the mood of the film across as well.A good science fiction and horror film. It is quite disgusting at parts but those parts seem to help the film out. I recommend it to anyone who does not get disgusted easy.

The cast is assembled with Matthew Broderick, Gary Elwes, Morgan Freeman and an Oscar Winning Performance for Best Supporting Actor - Denzel Washington.Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Broderick) and Maj. Cabot Forbes (Elwes) guide the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts. They are both young and enthusiastic Bostonians. Sgt. Major. John Rawlins (Freeman) unites the troops; and Pvt. Trip (Washington) is the runaway rebellious slave who embodies the strength of the regiment. The black regiment gamble sacrifice so they can gain respect and freedom and attempt to fight for equality.I consider this as a very favourable war film as there are constant heart stopping and evocative moments which make it appealing from start to finish. The film is focused on dignity, battles, emotional growth, brotherhood, solidarity, race, determination, equality and most importantly sacrifice. There is also a lot of optimism in the film and I witnessed the regiment unite together and stand as one despite all their differences. These are all common elements in war films but I feel Glory made a bigger impact on me than many of its contemporaries.The 54thth Massachusetts regiment are treated unfairly compared to any ordinary regiment. They struggle to gain respect and are ordered to do the impossible during training. This gets them prepared and stronger than any other ordinary regiment. I am impressed how touching this portrayal is and my sympathy towards the characters was very strong. None of the primary characters featured in the 54th are real, with the exception of Shaw (Broderick). The fictional characters still seemed to be very realistic and I can imagine many characters were similar in the regiment. Prior to watching Glory I wasn't fully aware of the story and how much of an impact it has on American history. The history created in this film feels very realistic and I consider myself very fortunate compared to the suffering these men had to go through. I feel director Edward Zwick's intentions were to make the film entertaining as well as educational, and he certainly succeeded with this. The dialogue also feels very pragmatic and I'm sure many people will be able to relate to it, especially those who have military experience. My one complaint with Glory is the fighting scenes. I didn't feel it expressively engaged me as much as the dialogue did. The choreography could have been a lot better and it stood out as quite weak to me compared to the story. However, Glory was released in 1989 and I did feel the cinematography is quite impressive in relation to blockbusters released in recent years, so I do give a lot of credibility for that. To conclude with this review I feel this is an important film to watch and I wasn't disappointed with it at all. It is a true story that has a real meaning. Edward Zwick concentrates on emotions in his films and the actors really managed to captivate this in the production. The film isn't too graphic like most war films which is a refreshing change and one of the main reasons I enjoyed this. I hope you will too.
