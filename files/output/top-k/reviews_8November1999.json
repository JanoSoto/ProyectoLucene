How does a film make that man feel?  Sometimes I think critics forget that there is a person watching a film and they concentrate way too much on what shot is being used in what frame and if they are using a dolly or a crane or a whatever they are using.  All I have heard from critics since this film came out is negativity towards it.  That I can not understand.  This film is as intense as any of the great horror that I have seen and it is as well acted as any film I have seen, so what is not to like about it?  I have heard words like impropriety and unrealistic and absurd.  And my response to those words are,  How do you know?  How is it exactly that critics seem to know everything about everything?  The problem with this movie is that they say that the Angela Jolie character is much too inexperienced to be handling the responsibility of doing forensics work in a crime scene.  But how do they know that is true.  If you go with what the film is saying (which I do)then she is the right person for the job because a man that does have experience has recommended her for the job and that should be all you need to suspend disbelief.  When you go into a film and all you want to do is be a critic, you are missing the point of going in the first place, and that is to have fun and be entertained for two hours.  Of course there are films like Double Jeapordy that are just plain garbage ( my opinion of course ) but a film like The Bone Collector is a tense and tightly woven movie and if you want to be on the edge of your seat then this is the film for you.  It is not a scary film in the same sense as Stir Of Echoes and Sixth Sense and Haunted Hill, but it is tense enough that it will have you gripping the seat quite aggressively.I really think Denzel Washington is one of the best actors in the game today.  He easily could have won a best actor Oscar for Malcolm X and he did win one for Glory.  And when you look at him in a film like The Seige, you understand his full range and body of work, The Bone Collector is another triumph for him.  Here he plays a quadripilegic man that is thrusted back into the spotlight when grizzly murders begin popping up all over N.Y.  With his genius and the ingenuity of his protegee, they have to solve a crime of a smart serial killer before he cna carry out his ultimate plan.  As I said, the acting is stellar in this film including people like Ed O'Neil.  The only qualm I have about the film is the misuse of Michael Rooker.  Here he plays the always-angry-for-no-reason-police-chief.  His scenes are not written on the same intelligence level as the rest of the film and the only reason he is here is to throw you off the real killer's identity.  The film spends so much time trying to make you think that Rooker is the killer that by the time Rooker has been an ass for the second time you already know he is not the killer, it would be to easy to figure that out.  So his acting talents are wasted on a forgettable role.  Michael Rooker, and this may sound strange to a lot of people, but in my opinion, is one of the best under appreciated actors in Hollywood.  I think he has taken over that distinction from Bill Paxton who has now gone on to be a recognizable face, not just as Chet and Hudson.  But think back to a film like Mississippi Burning or JFK.  Those two roles were Oscar material and they certainly helped him find work in Hollywood but this film is a waste for him and his character would have been better if he wasn't there.That aside, the film is wonderful.  We spend so much time with Jolie as she enters into dark and misty tunnels looking for clues to the killers next move.  And as she is nervous, so are we.  I was afraid to see what was around the corner as the camera became her eyes, we saw what she saw.  And that wasn't always pleasant.  There are some gruesome looking deaths in the film but this isn't a light hearted family film so you should expect that going in.  I also really enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads.  Washington and Jolie are explosive together.  When their realtionship grows we feel more empathy towards both characters and we want them to win the game.  I enjoyed Bone Collector for everything that it wanted to be and strived to be.  It does a great job of keeping you guessing at the identity of the killer.  And when you find out who he is and why, you are a little confused.  But when the dust clears, you are just glad that it ended the way it does.  This is a great film and a good suspense thriller.  I'm not sure where the negativity is coming from, but my advice to those people is realy simple. Lighten up people.  Not every film has to have a gritty pretencious feel to it like Bringing Out The Dead.  Some films are actually entertaining and make you feel something more than fatigue when you are watching it.  The Bone Collector may make your heart race a little faster and that is always a good thing.  This is a good, tense movie and if you don't believe me, then go see so for yourself.  Just don't listen to those that say it is garbage.  These are many of the same people that say Citizen Kane is the most exciting film ever made.

Granted it was a little long, and Billy Bob Thorton was extremely badly cast as the voice of Jigo, but otherwise it was beautiful.  The scenery was breathtaking, and the plot was a breath of fresh air from the movies I've seen lately (except for American Beauty).  I've been a fairly adamant anime fan for around 5 years now, and lately I haven't had the time to watch any anime, but this movie reminded me about why I like anime so much.  There are no definite evil\/good characters, and the drawings are beautiful.  I loved all the plot twists and the complexity of all the characters.  I didn't think it was the greatest anime movie I'd seen, Akira and Ghost in the Shell I thought were better, but it was pretty good, and since I haven't seen a really good movie in a while, this movie was a relief.  I don't understand how anyone (of the reviewers) could think that this movie was meant, in the first place, for kids, and how anyone could think that the faces of Disney characters were better than anime faces. The reviews always refer back to Speed Racer too, and it's pissing me off, because if that's the only anime they've seen, then the people doing the reviews shouldn't even be doing them on any type of anime film.  Anime is completely different from Disney style animation, first of all the storylines are more interesting, the good guy doesn't always win, and lastly, the drawings are a lot better.  So anyone that expects Disney type animation, and storyline shouldn't.  The PG-13 rating is probably the right rating for this movie because of the violence and gore, but also, because the plot is much more deep than many movies.

Granted it was a little long, and Billy Bob Thorton was extremely badly cast as the voice of Jigo, but otherwise it was beautiful.  The scenery was breathtaking, and the plot was a breath of fresh air from the movies I've seen lately (except for American Beauty).  I've been a fairly adamant anime fan for around 5 years now, and lately I haven't had the time to watch any anime, but this movie reminded me about why I like anime so much.  There are no definite evil\/good characters, and the drawings are beautiful.  I loved all the plot twists and the complexity of all the characters.  I didn't think it was the greatest anime movie I'd seen, Akira and Ghost in the Shell I thought were better, but it was pretty good, and since I haven't seen a really good movie in a while, this movie was a relief.  I don't understand how anyone (of the reviewers) could think that this movie was meant, in the first place, for kids, and how anyone could think that the faces of Disney characters were better than anime faces. The reviews always refer back to Speed Racer too, and it's pissing me off, because if that's the only anime they've seen, then the people doing the reviews shouldn't even be doing them on any type of anime film.

It was so unbelievably packed in the cinemas that almost every session was sold out on that day, and I truly had some difficulty in buying the tickets. And, the most important thing, after watching it, I was truly amazed and absolutely impressed by the movie. Brilliant original idea and marvellous performance by its actors, everyone who worked on this movie must be very proud of it.

The second and third time around were even better, although the surprising ending part was no longer a big surprise anymore, but really, the ending is truly the one to die for.

His name refers to the way everything he touches goes horrendously wrong, but what saved this movie for me from being too depressing was the humour and pathos in Crudup's performance which almost made me like the messed up character he plays. His journey is shown in a series of separate segments, staying reasonably close to the style of the acclaimed short stories by Denis Johnson on which the movie is based.  FH  has an on-off liaison with Michelle, powerfully played by Samantha Morton who was so impressive in the badly under-rated  This is the Sea  and in Jesus' Son is once again utterly convincing.A strong cast includes cameo appearances from Will Paton, Dennis Hopper and most notably Holly Hunter who is mesmerising in a brief appearance towards the end of the film as a woman who has suffered from dreadful things which keep happening to her husbands.By this stage I had become a litle bored with the succession of losers and  gory incidents - a guy with a knife in his eye being treated in the emergency room for instance - but Hunter's role together with the overall strength of Crudup's acting re-ignited the final section of this interesting movie.At the end  FH  does find some kind of redemption and his surprise at this situation is almost a happy ending. I was surprised too how much of an impression the movie made on me afterwards with little incidents and lines of dialogue making me want to see it again. So Jesus'Son, although not for the faint-hearted, is definitely worth checking out - especially for Billy Crudup's perfomance - and I am certain that Alison Maclean is set to be a major directorial talent in the years ahead.(Jesus' Son shown at the London Film Festival, November 06, 1999) ","genre":null},{"date":"8 November 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Director Alison Maclean's follow up to Crush follows the tortuous journey towards redemption of a drug ravaged loser called  Fuckhead , played by Billy Crudup, stumbling through a series of unpleasant or off-beat incidents in 1970s America.

The Bone Collector is no where near intriguing nor as intelligent as Silence of The Lambs.  The best comparison is a pretty good episode of the X-files.  The plot holes are many.  The ending is a little too neat and a little too formulaic.  However the acting is excellent and is what saves The Bone Collector from being another Copycat or last year's horrible In Dreams.  Denzel Washington seems to pull every movie he is in out of the sewer of Hollywood tripe.  All that said, The Bone Collector is definitely entertaining, even gripping at times, only if you don't think too much.
