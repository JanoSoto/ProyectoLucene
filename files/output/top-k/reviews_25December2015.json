In addition, if you're not able to take a buddy cop action movie the fourth installment in the Lethal Weapon series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) is the fourth installment in the Lethal Weapon series. It is the last installment in the franchise and it is a good one. It is the last movie in the series and it ended perfectly. I am glad there wasn't a fifth movie. I heard they are planning to reboot the original movie. The same is with Die Hard and those reboots are stupid! This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, this is entertaining funny action film I've ever seen. Best part I wish I had a siren right about now Rog Really hilarious!! I could watch it over and over again! It is my at least favorite movie in the series but it is still a lot of fun. The gangs are all back Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci and Rene Russo, there are some new additions in the cast Chris Rock and Jet Li.\/ Jet Li is such a bad ass and in this movie you have Chinese Triads, I was disappointed with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in this, I seriously think those two guys become a soft pussy's in this film. I think wife's and baby coming on their way making them a really wuss, don't get me wrong, Riggs and Murtaugh were both a bad ass in the whole trilogy. In this film they are fighting like a pussy's. But still I like this movie a lot, I still like Rene Russo I am happy that Riggs and Lorna get's married at the end of the movie and I also love that both Rianne Murtaugh and Lorna gives a birth to their baby's. The action sequences were not that great but Jet Li was a damn bad ass and that was his first American movie. It was one of the first roles I saw him as a villain, I was used more to see Jet Li been the good guy. I think it was hard to convince him to play the bad guy. Even for a villain he did a good job playing his character. This was the last movie in the Lethal Weapon series and I am glad the movie showed the different site of the characters. Especially the movie explained and made a perfect ending with what happened with all our favorite characters. The rest of the crew did a solid job and I like it a lot. I have all Lethal Weapon movies on Blu-ray and I also have 2 & 3 on DVD the director's cut. I couldn't got Lethal Weapon the directors Cut on DVD but I got Theatrical cut on Blu-ray. I also have the trilogy on VHS tape they are all Director's Cut. Seeing Director's Cut on DVD and VHS tape for 2 Hrs. 07 Mins the same running time is this film Lethal Weapon 4, I was really disappointed. I thought the movie was set too long than the theatrical cut I grew up with it. The theatrical cut was always my favorite of the first one. I am glad I own the original first movie on Blu-ray with theatrical cut. I am big fan of Lethal Weapon movies and I love all of them. The same is with Rambo franchise I love all four of them. Lethal Weapon 4 get's the same score by me as Lethal Weapon 2 did a 9. I am glad I know what happened with all the characters that I care for and the scenes in the hospital were beautiful, I love Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) in this movie as private detective. Who helped Martin Riggs when his wife is getting a baby. Lethal Weapon 4 was a by the numbers rehash of the franchise's formula, but the Martin Riggs character had lost his edge from the previous movies. A big disappointment. Tough I have enjoyed this movie considering its a 4th in the series, I thought Chris rock was funny especially his scenes with Joe Pesci = NO means NO..!, I'd agree in that I'd be hard pressed to choose between number 1 and number 3. Also like the idea of Chris Rock having his own movie. Perhaps in the same character he could take on a young partner and they become the next generation albeit different\their own characters within the Lethal weapon universe. Lethal Weapon 4 is the fourth installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. The 1998 sequel follows Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) as they uncover a smuggling ring involving Chinese immigrants. Rene Russo and Joe Pesci also return and the cast includes newcomer to the series Chris Rock and Jet Li, who made his American film debut. 9\/10 Grade A- Studio Warner Bros.

In addition, if you're not able to take an underrated supernatural horror flick comedy from the 80's, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Ghostbusters II (1989) is very underrated and hated by so many people and fans of the original movie, including Billy Murray him self. After this movie was released Billy Murray was very disappointed and not happy how the movie turned out. I know this movie is not a comedy like was the first one, it was more dark than the first movie it was scary. Bill Murray had a terrible dialogue in here. Which I understand him, why he is upset over this movie and he said he will never make any Ghostbusters movie ever again. Anyway I enjoyed this movie and like it a lot. I still found some fun moments in it. I don't think it is that good as the original! The original will always kick-ass for me. Unfortunately I don't think, I still have the VHS tape anymore in my video collection. I still and lucky have the original flick on Blu-ray. This is the film that introduced me into becoming a fan of the Ghostbusters and the animated series The real Ghostbusters (1986). I am sorry about a lot of fans been upset and Billy Murray, but still I think he could have made a potential in the third sequel, that Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis come up with! R.I.P. Harold Ramis November 12th, 1944 - February 24, 2014. I respect the actor, he wanted to play one more time Egon Spengler, which I think my favorite character of all time.I was reading the reviews people had left and I think that this was a great movie. Not only did you have the same humor and elements from the first film, you had all the same actors reprise their role. I remember seeing some sequels where some of the good characters weren't back and it was not just as good. I thought the effects were more crisp than the first film as well and I remember this one seemed to creep me out when I was little (see Subway scene). Overall, an excellent film and I will always cherish my proton pack! I think this was more scary than the first one. I remember as a kid I could never get to sleep after watching it. I would always have nightmares of Vigo The Carpathian. I heard Murray crap on it as well which is a shame. This definitely holds up as a solid sequel the same way Wayne's World 2 did.Things I didn't like in this movie I think the bigger problem with the movie is it's kinda a reboot\/sequel. They have to get their business back, Peter is trying to get with Danna. I kinda wish they just kept them in business but half of what they make goes to paying off the damage they did at the end of the first one since they got sued. This movie shouldn't have been scary, a baby been kidnapped from the ghost. It should have been a comedy like was the first one, I do agree with Bill Murray about it. Because the first one was not a scary movie, it was funny too and it is my favorite all time flick ever! The movie also has parts that kinda leave you scratching my head saying, WTF were they thinking. The Ghostbusters are forgotten in this movie, the only, only person that does have a heart in this movie n my opinion is Billy Murray. In my opinion Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson did a wonderful job on acting and playing on their respectful characters. I didn't like that Ghostbusters where thrown in to nut house, Vigo throw the baby on the floor, Ray was possessed by Vigo, the bath tub wanted to eat Dana and Oscar. The movie has a plot holes a lot in and too much slimmer and does not make any sense. Sorry guys those are the problems I just don't like in it.Things I like Rick Moranis as Louis Tully I think the actor did a great job, but his role was completely different from the first movie. In the original classic movie he was an accountant, but in this movie he is lawyer who on end of the film transformers him self in to a Ghostbuster and I love that he went there to help his friends to defeat the slime.The courtroom scene is awesome and The Statue of Liberty walking through New York to the tune of Jackie Wilson's Higher and Higher is undoubtedly one of the best scenes in the movie. Despite what people say, the gags in the 2nd film are aplenty. Sure, it wasn't big of a classic as the original film was, but it wasn't that bad! It was very different! It had a new villain that came from a painting, more screen time for Janice and Louis, more funny dialogue, good special effects and a great soundtrack. It was definitely better than it's reputation has gotten from the fans and critics. The movie is good on it is own, but does not beat the original film! 6 out of 10 for me.Ghostbusters II is a 1989 American supernatural horror comedy film, produced and directed by Ivan Reitman.

It's a slim novel almost entirely lacking in incident and action; rather, it's a mood piece, designed to bring to life a magical place and the characters who inhabit it. This 1993 adaptation tries hard to do justice to the book, but the results are mixed.I was pleased to see that although this was an American-made film, the entire cast are British. However, the actors are a mixed bag, and for a lot of the time they struggle with a sub-par script that makes the kids annoying. Yes, Mary was bratty in the book, but she never felt irritating like she does here. I didn't much care for Maggie Smith's poor Yorkshire accent either, although Walter Sparrow (ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES) is excellent as the gardener.Some parts of THE SECRET GARDEN are very good, like everything featuring the robin (I have the horrible suspicion that a modern version would simply CGI the bird) and the scenes that actually stick close to the book (and have the same dialogue in some cases). But in the effort to make the subject matter more cinematic, everything has to be bigger and grander, with random stone ruins within the garden. It was much smaller scale in the book, and some of the magic is lost. Also, they add in extraneous stuff like the stupid magic ritual, and Colin's father is NOTHING like he was in the book.

In addition, if you're not able to take a buddy cop action movie the third sequel in the Lethal Weapon series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 3 (1992) is for my opinion the second best in the series! I love this flick, I always have enjoyed much more than I did Lethal Weapon 2. I love this sequel, I think is so much better than Lethal Weapon 2! Because the second installment in the series was way too violent movie from the first one, this one was just fun action sequel to the first one and I love it so much! I thought Donner kept the level going for the most part throughout the films!!! Why don't people like the last two movies!! I pretty stayed up half the night for two nights in a row because I got so hooked with these movies!. I especially love Rene Russo she's so sexy, sassy, and kicks a lot of ass in it. A nice addition to the team. Rene Russo in this movie she was the second crush I had on her. She was the most beautiful girl playing a tough cop ever. I was happy her character was not killed off, by the end of the movie. When the film ended I was really sad because I didn't know what happened too Martin Riggs and Lorna Cole, did their romance lasted forever. I was always hooked up and when I hared they are making Lethal Weapon 4 in 1998, I couldn't wait for the fourth installment! I grew up with this movie and it is my childhood movie of all time I love it to death!!!Rock on Riggs and Murtaugh! Perhaps as a reflection of that, Weapon 3 depends more on chases, explosions and set pieces than it does on character development. The story again involves the partnership of Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover), buddies in the long tradition of movie cop partners. This time Murtaugh is only eight days from retirement, a sure sign in any cop movie that his life will be repeatedly in danger. I remember Lethal Weapon 3 was a lot of fun and I would say it's my 2nd favorite of the series. Stuart Wilson was a good bad guy, humor was great including the banter. It's an entertaining sequel. I know a lot of people don't like this movie like I do a lot of fans prefer Lethal Weapon 2 over this flick, I don't! I think 1 and 3 are great flicks, 2 is my third favorite film in the franchise!!! Part 1 and 3 of Lethal Weapon I absolutely love! I enjoyed Lethal Weapon 2, I like Lethal Weapon 4. I really love Lethal Weapon 3, I always had fun with it. I highly enjoy it. I don't mind the story, a lot of people complain about the story. I think that story is very interesting. I think Joe Pesci has more screen time in this movie than in part 2. I love when Riggs cut the wrong wire in the opening scene and the whole Building Explodes. They both grabbed the cat and they save the cat ha ha. Than they went on patrol officer now, not anymore detectives. This movie is fun back and forth. The armored car is driven by this crooks and Riggs is chasing it. Riggs eventually has to brake the vehicle hard, causing the armored car to come to a sudden stop, resulting in the bad guy flying through the windshield and coming to rest on the hood and say my favorite line. You have the right to remain unconscious. Anything you say ain't gonna be much. And Riggs punches the guy in the windshield and says Back to bed. Back to bed. The car chase scene Riggs jumps off the subway and commandeers an LAPD motorcycle, then continues his pursuit of the truck, which has by then left the rails and taken to the streets. Riggs pursues Travis on the wrong side of a freeway, then into a section that was under construction. Travis manages to get stopped, but Riggs flies off an unfinished ramp, getting hung up by some cables. The cables give way, and he falls through several platforms, to the ground. This scene is Excellent and outstanding stunt, I can always watch that! The scene in the hockey arena is one of my favorite when Leo (Joe Pesci) wrestles with Jack Travis (Staurt Wilson) Their struggle carries them onto the ice and Travis shoots Leo in the arm. Riggs follows Travis out of the arena, but loses him. That scene Riggis running on the ice was fantastic. The end fight scene when Murtaugh takes out Walters, then tosses Darryl's gun to Riggs, loaded with the cop killer bullets. Riggs shoots through the bucket of the front-end loader, killing Travis was awesome! This movie is awesome and it is my favorite film in the Lethal Weapon series. It is a 10 for me. Lethal Weapon 3 is the third installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. The 1992 action sequel has Detective Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) under the eye of an Internal Affairs detective (Rene Russo) during an investigation of a former cop who is dealing in illegal arms and armor-piercing ammunition.

I know blacks and whites are obsolete terms but that's the way the movie pitches them.The performances are pretty good. Denzel Washington is always reliable and Will Patton has done some superb turns on film. He was my supporting player in one of his lesser efforts, Everybody Wins.

Sheriff brought together two antagonistic groups of matched twelve-year-old boys, gangs that had been labeled the Eagles and the Rattlers. They hated each other. Then they were both faced with a difficult task that could only be achieved by cooperation. Sheriff called it a superordinate goal. It resolved the antagonism. I'm simplifying this but it's easily Googled. I refer you to Ronald Reagan's musing that if the earth were invaded by UFOs it would draw the disputatious nations of the world together. Likewise if they had to win a lot of football games over tough rivals from another planet.(2) A 1959 study by Aronson and Mills that demonstrated that the tougher the initiation rite, the more group loyalty you get. By browbeating them so mercilessly Washington enhanced the solidarity of the Low-Country and Panhandle Titans, blacks and whites together, both having suffered immeasurably at Washington's hands.

Because I knew this film was made in 1944, part of me wondered when that song was written with those lyrics (much different than the revised ones written for 1957 when Frank Sinatra sang it and others after him would follow suit) during that time whether it was meant to address the audience of that period of their worries of their loved ones being overseas during the holidays and their concern of them ever coming back to them in the future. Anyway, this is such an entertaining musical with such great comedy and drama from not only Ms. Garland and O'Brien but also Harry Davenport as the grandpa and Marjorie Main as the maid. The best sequence involves Ms. O'Brien going out alone on Halloween involving a prank that was common during the 1903 period. Oh, and Ms. Garland also did great numbers like The Boy Next Door and The Trolley Song. Oh, and no wonder she married director Vincente Minnelli after making this as she gets some of her best close-ups here! So on that note, that's a high recommendation of Meet Me in St. Louis. P.S.

In addition, if you're not able to take a classic action buddy cop movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon (1987) is my favorite classic action the best Christmas flick alongside Die Hard! It was always my favorite action flick from Richard Donner and Shane Black beside Superman (1978). If the Godfather is the Godfather of all gangster flicks, then Lethal Weapon is the Godfather of all buddy-buddy action cop flicks! In the summer of '87 director Richard Donner gave us Riggs and Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon is one of the Greatest Action Movies from the 80's. This is the movie I grew up and it is my childhood movie! You should know all of the great action movies Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, etc. This movie is a classic. Movie was the best cop movie EVER! It showed that cops are human too and have the same faults as the rest of us. The action scenes were great and keep you engaged through the whole movie. Gary Busey and Danny Glover both started in Predator 2. I think the man Gary Busey is very underrated actor for playing action hero's and villains. I think he did the best job ever. I seriously love him in Lethal Weapon and Predator 2! The first one in the Lethal Weapon series is a really fun 80s action flick! It's one of my favorite action movies of all time. I love this movie to death I love it!!! And the chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson is just flawless. The deserts scenes are outstanding and really fantastic in which Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) attempt to rescue Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in the desert, Riggs provides cover for Murtaugh using a Heckler & Koch PSG-1 sniper rifle with a high-capacity magazine and Harris bipod. He succeeds in taking out several Shadow Company goons and is about to shoot Mr. Joshua when General McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) interferes and captures him, later seen carrying the rifle across his back while escorting the captured Riggs. Lethal Weapon is the 1987 action film that was one of the first in the modern buddy cop genre. Mel Gibson stars as LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a cop who lives on the ragged edge and who could be suicidal, much to the chagrin of his new partner Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), who is celebrating his 50th birthday. Together they uncover a drug smuggling ring that involves a criminal gang comprised of mercenaries and former members of a CIA \/ special forces Black Ops unit with ties to the Vietnam War. The film was written by Shane Black and directed by Richard Donner (Superman The Movie). The success of the movie would help spawn a film franchise that spanned four films as well as numerous movie imitators. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, McAllister has no control over the accelerator and brake pedals, so he can only steer as the car enters a main street, where it's t-boned by a large bus and flipped over. The general is upside down, bleeding, surrounded by bags of drugs and several grenades. When McAllister is trying to reach and grabbing the grenades, they all explode, destroying the car and him). The gunplay is delivered in perfect Richard Donner style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable. In the Murtaugh's house the wall of the living room caves in and an empty police car crashes into the room, a police baton wedged onto the accelerator.

The fighting sequences between Joshua (Gray Busey) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) is very realistic! You don't see any realistic fighting scenes in any action movie like that! This movie is the best action packed filled with a lot of entrainment, excitement, joy, laughs and a lot of action sequences! It is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, great acting, the flying sequences between Riggs and suicide jumper is outstanding but a really crazy stunt, I have ever seen.

This first entry in the series that would spawn 3 sequels and countless duplicates, is the darker of the set.

In addition, if you're not able to take a classic action buddy cop movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon (1987) is my favorite classic action the best Christmas flick alongside Die Hard! It was always my favorite action flick from Richard Donner and Shane Black beside Superman (1978). If the Godfather is the Godfather of all gangster flicks, then Lethal Weapon is the Godfather of all buddy-buddy action cop flicks! In the summer of '87 director Richard Donner gave us Riggs and Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon is one of the Greatest Action Movies from the 80's. This is the movie I grew up and it is my childhood movie! You should know all of the great action movies Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, etc. This movie is a classic. Movie was the best cop movie EVER! It showed that cops are human too and have the same faults as the rest of us. The action scenes were great and keep you engaged through the whole movie. Gary Busey and Danny Glover both started in Predator 2. I think the man Gary Busey is very underrated actor for playing action hero's and villains. I think he did the best job ever. I seriously love him in Lethal Weapon and Predator 2! The first one in the Lethal Weapon series is a really fun 80s action flick! It's one of my favorite action movies of all time. I love this movie to death I love it!!! And the chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson is just flawless. The deserts scenes are outstanding and really fantastic in which Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) attempt to rescue Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in the desert, Riggs provides cover for Murtaugh using a Heckler & Koch PSG-1 sniper rifle with a high-capacity magazine and Harris bipod. He succeeds in taking out several Shadow Company goons and is about to shoot Mr. Joshua when General McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) interferes and captures him, later seen carrying the rifle across his back while escorting the captured Riggs. Lethal Weapon is the 1987 action film that was one of the first in the modern buddy cop genre. Mel Gibson stars as LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a cop who lives on the ragged edge and who could be suicidal, much to the chagrin of his new partner Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), who is celebrating his 50th birthday. Together they uncover a drug smuggling ring that involves a criminal gang comprised of mercenaries and former members of a CIA \/ special forces Black Ops unit with ties to the Vietnam War. The film was written by Shane Black and directed by Richard Donner (Superman The Movie). The success of the movie would help spawn a film franchise that spanned four films as well as numerous movie imitators. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, McAllister has no control over the accelerator and brake pedals, so he can only steer as the car enters a main street, where it's t-boned by a large bus and flipped over. The general is upside down, bleeding, surrounded by bags of drugs and several grenades. When McAllister is trying to reach and grabbing the grenades, they all explode, destroying the car and him). The gunplay is delivered in perfect Richard Donner style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable. In the Murtaugh's house the wall of the living room caves in and an empty police car crashes into the room, a police baton wedged onto the accelerator. Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) shoots a T.V. displaying a Christmas commercial with his Colt XM177 Commando at Murtaugh's home and fires all round in the police car.

We force ourselves to get through them just to see what the big deal is all about, and we end up feeling we have endured an unpleasant experience that has wasted our time.

If the answer is Yes, then the mystery is solved, especially if the work of fiction was censored or banned somewhere. In this lies the reason for all the undeserved praise for novels such as James Joyce's Ulysses, Marcel Proust's In Search Lost Time, and Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and for movies such as Man of Flowers (1983), Belle de Jour (1967), Last Tango in Paris (1972), and, of course, Fellini Satyricon.Why do some people praise novels or movies like this? One reason may be that they actually enjoyed them or learned something from them. That's a horrible thought! The other may be that expressing their appreciation for these novels or movies gives them a feeling of superiority over those of us who dislike them they come across as enlightened, cosmopolitan aesthetes, while we look like prudish, parochial philistines.Fellini Satyricon is mostly about a couple of pederasts fighting over a catamite, who silently sits there with a big, silly grin like Harpo Marx.

He was a homeless vet killed in a secret game to hunt humans. Natasha is rescued from a group of thugs by drifter Cajun vet Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme). She hires him to help. Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) organizes the hunts and is angry at his recruiter Randal for supplying Douglas who has family that comes looking for him. The overstretched police is reluctant to investigate Douglas' death except for detective Mitchell. They are pursued into the Bayou by Fouchon and his men. Boudreaux uses his local knowledge, super-kicks and his uncle Douvee (Wilford Brimley) to fight off Fouchon.Director John Woo brings his HK action style to America. I love his real stunt action but I've always been ambivalent to his slow motion film style. To me, it slows the pacing and reduces the tension. If done too much, it gives an artificial feel to the action. I often admire the stunt work without admiring the film work. Van Damme is playing a Cajun which excuses his accent somewhat. There is nothing great about the story or the acting. I love some of the stunts but even they start to wear thin.
