There are no battle scenes and there's little carnage; hardly any of the action you're conditioned to expect from a war movie. Even for a movie set in a prison camp there are no mass escape attempts (the one escape attempt I believe consisted of three prisoners.) This is instead more of a psychological study of the effects of captivity on soldiers - maybe even an early hint of what's come to be known as the Stockholm Syndrome - as prisoners begin to identify with and in some ways sympathize with their captives.The movie is set in a Japanese prison camp where the prisoners are ordered to work on building a massive railway bridge over the River Kwai. Alec Guinness put on a strong performance as Col. Nicholson - the senior British officer among the prisoners who fights for the respect of the camp commander Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa in another strong performance). The movie for a while offered a pretty good depiction of the harshness of Japanese prison camps, and was interesting in portraying Nicholson as ultimately besting Saito as he first gains the right (guaranteed by the Geneva Convention) for the officers not to be used as manual labourers and then gets the British officers in charge of building the bridge, thus ensuring that his men would be essentially under British command. That was well portrayed, as was the fact that somewhere along the way the lines of loyalty got tested. Nicholson devotes himself to building the bridge, making an even better bridge for the Japanese than the Japanese themselves were going to build - all in the name of keeping up the morale of the British troops and building a monument to the abilities of the British army. But - as was questioned in the movie - at what point does the legitimate duty of POWs (the Geneva Convention allows for enlisted prisoners to be used by their captors for manual labour) become treasonous? The bridge and railway will be used to transport Japanese troops. Did Nicholson have to ensure that it would be so well built? And Saito suffers some of the same psychological challenges, depicted as being in torment after realizing that, while he's going to get his bridge built, he had to do it by giving up control to those who were supposed to be his prisoners. It all builds up to a powerful last scene as Allied commandos try to blow up the bridge and Nicholson tries to save it before realizing what he's doing.The psychological study is interesting and the acting is good. I thought the movie itself was a bit too long at almost three hours. William Holden's role as an American officer who escapes from the camp and then becomes part of the commando team seeking to destroy the bridge was well played but struck me as rather unnecessary - at least I wasn't sure of the need for him to have been in the camp with Nicholson and then to have him return to blow up the bridge. Some of that seemed to me to add unnecessary filler to the movie, especially the scenes in which Shears is recruited to go back to the jungle as part of the commando team.It's a good movie and interesting enough - just a little too much extraneous material and therefore a little bit too long.

Being one of my all time favourites I was hopeful there was going to be a repeat showing. Fortunately the same channel obliged and I was able to record it for a viewing today. For me it is one of the three iconic films about the Vietnam War; the others being Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1986). I'm sure others will be mentioned in dispatches, but these are the three that have served me best. It is a film of two parts.The first part deals with the training of a group of U.S. Marine recruits under the watchful eye of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Among the platoon are characters Hartman calls Private Joker, Private Cowboy and, the focus of much of his scorn, Private Pyle. Unfortunately Private Pyle isn't really cut out to be a Marine and keeps making mistakes. It gets so bad that Hartman begins to take it out on the platoon whenever he screws up. This has a rather disastrous effect on Pyle and it doesn't end well for more than one of them.With training over the focus now switches to the theatre of action in Vietnam. We follow Private Joker who has become a journalist working for 'Stars and Stripes' magazine as a combat correspondent. He is sent into the combat zone with his photographer, Rafterman, where he joins up with a platoon that contains his old friend Private Cowboy. They are sent into a built up area to clear out any enemy combatants hiding inside. Having been pinned down by a sniper, it's up to Private Cowboy to figure a way out of the situation. I'll leave you hanging there, if you have seen the film, you'll know what happens, if you haven't well, it's just a little incentive for you to give it a look.Stanley Kubrick had a great eye for detail and looking at this film you can see that every little detail is perfect. I love the look and the feel of it, even though it is of two very distinct and very different parts. Great performances all round; in particular Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, Vincent D'Onofrio (who some of you may know from TV's Law and Order Criminal Intent) as Pvt. Pyle and R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Also worthy of note were; Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother, Dorian Harewood as Eightball, Kevyn Major Howard as Rafterman and Arliss Howard as Pvt. Cowboy.I will admit that I, like most people I know, enjoyed the first part slightly more than the second. I think it's because it has many more memorable, even iconic, scenes in it. But in defence of the second part, it was a hard act to follow! Having said that, the second part does deal with the gritty realities of war and goes some way towards satirising it. I should note there is an excellent soundtrack and the use of various songs throughout is well balanced against the visuals. Over all, a near-perfect war film (IMO) and one which comes very highly recommended.My Score 9.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 June 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film was on the TV in a pub I was frequenting last week.

I love the look and the feel of it, even though it is of two very distinct and very different parts. Great performances all round; in particular Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, Vincent D'Onofrio (who some of you may know from TV's Law and Order Criminal Intent) as Pvt. Pyle and R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Also worthy of note were; Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother, Dorian Harewood as Eightball, Kevyn Major Howard as Rafterman and Arliss Howard as Pvt. Cowboy.I will admit that I, like most people I know, enjoyed the first part slightly more than the second. I think it's because it has many more memorable, even iconic, scenes in it. But in defence of the second part, it was a hard act to follow! Having said that, the second part does deal with the gritty realities of war and goes some way towards satirising it. I should note there is an excellent soundtrack and the use of various songs throughout is well balanced against the visuals. Over all, a near-perfect war film (IMO) and one which comes very highly recommended.My Score 9.6\/10 ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"18 June 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film was on the TV in a pub I was frequenting last week. Being one of my all time favourites I was hopeful there was going to be a repeat showing. Fortunately the same channel obliged and I was able to record it for a viewing today. For me it is one of the three iconic films about the Vietnam War; the others being Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1986). I'm sure others will be mentioned in dispatches, but these are the three that have served me best. It is a film of two parts.The first part deals with the training of a group of U.S. Marine recruits under the watchful eye of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Among the platoon are characters Hartman calls Private Joker, Private Cowboy and, the focus of much of his scorn, Private Pyle. Unfortunately Private Pyle isn't really cut out to be a Marine and keeps making mistakes. It gets so bad that Hartman begins to take it out on the platoon whenever he screws up. This has a rather disastrous effect on Pyle and it doesn't end well for more than one of them.With training over the focus now switches to the theatre of action in Vietnam. We follow Private Joker who has become a journalist working for 'Stars and Stripes' magazine as a combat correspondent. He is sent into the combat zone with his photographer, Rafterman, where he joins up with a platoon that contains his old friend Private Cowboy. They are sent into a built up area to clear out any enemy combatants hiding inside. Having been pinned down by a sniper, it's up to Private Cowboy to figure a way out of the situation.

For me, 1931's City Lights' is the gauge to measure other Chaplin pictures by, if not the entire genre of silent film.

Chaplin takes his trademark character, the Little Tramp, and turns him, for purposes of the story into The Lone Prospector, or alternately, The Little Fellow. There are any number of memorable elements on display here - Chaplin's transformation into a giant chicken, the boot eating scene, the cabin at the edge of the cliff. Perhaps the best remembered signature piece from the picture involves the 'dance of the rolls', a uniquely creative segment that's often used in pictorials of Chaplin's career.

Basically the plot is about a psychotic billionaire named Max Zorin who wants to destroy Silicon Valley in California so his corporation gains a monopoly in the computer and IT industry.However, while a decent film to round off Moore's 12 years as Bond and vastly better than Connery's sign off with the ghastly Diamonds Are Forever, what really stands out for me is Grace Jones as Mayday. Beautiful in an unconventional way and with a conditioned physique, Grace Jones really takes to the role as Zorin's lover, assassin and bodyguard. This is one lady you wouldn't mess with as she is an expert at karate and judo and an expert with all kinds of weapons. Also she redeems herself at the end by siding with Bond when she realises Zorin has tricked her and has left her to die. Now if only Grace Jones had the role as the Bond girl- maybe as a good version of Mayday- this film would get ten stars as I found Tanya Roberts dull as the Bond girl in this.Also Bond develops an unusual skill not normally associated with 007, he is an expert cook, making a quiche Gordon Ramsay would be proud of. This again is typical of Moore's portrayal of Bond, being a bit more human than Connery, and as ever the corny quips keep coming throughout the film.If you decide to watch A View To A Kill, it is quite a good film with its budget well spent and is a good way to pass two hours. However, it isn't up there with the likes of Goldfinger and Moore is starting to look old by 1985.

Beautiful in an unconventional way and with a conditioned physique, Grace Jones really takes to the role as Zorin's lover, assassin and bodyguard. This is one lady you wouldn't mess with as she is an expert at karate and judo and an expert with all kinds of weapons. Also she redeems herself at the end by siding with Bond when she realises Zorin has tricked her and has left her to die. Now if only Grace Jones had the role as the Bond girl- maybe as a good version of Mayday- this film would get ten stars as I found Tanya Roberts dull as the Bond girl in this.Also Bond develops an unusual skill not normally associated with 007, he is an expert cook, making a quiche Gordon Ramsay would be proud of. This again is typical of Moore's portrayal of Bond, being a bit more human than Connery, and as ever the corny quips keep coming throughout the film.If you decide to watch A View To A Kill, it is quite a good film with its budget well spent and is a good way to pass two hours.

When it comes to movies, TV, music, haircuts, and girls, it's lovely decade indeed. For all the previous reasons I loved the 1980s. And as for Three Fugitives, it's an additional reason.No doubt it's wonderful and unforgettable movie. However, the no wonderful and so forgettable is its third act. Suddenly, the hunt &#x96; of the police and the other criminals &#x96; is finished, and the end is abrupt; as if there was some greediness for a sequel. I don't know why the script didn't extend the storyline of the hunt, by the police and other criminals, for longer ?! Hence, lines like Dugan is on our tails. near the end sounded strange, especially when (James Earl Jones) vanished after the end of the second act. Speaking about strange lines; (Nolte)'s line to the kid in the orphanage I'll take care of you like you took care of me. reminds you of another point of weakness which is the relationship of those 2 characters. I have always thought that it needed more to it in the second act; so they may fall in love appropriately and more convincingly. I believe these points are what caused the awful fate of received with mixed reviews !So, it's 2\/3 classic. The detailing is fascinating; the first 10 minutes is a very good example. The music score, by (David McHugh), is one of the best I have ever heard to say the least. The image is smooth and romantic. (Haskell Wexler), the director of photography, won 2 Oscars for (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? &#x96; 1966) and (Bound for Glory &#x96; 1976). His cinematography can't be bypassed in other movies like (The Thomas Crown Affair &#x96; 1968) or (The Man Who Loved Women &#x96; 1983). For reasons like that he's one of 6 cinematographers to have a star on the famed Hollywood Walk of Fame.The cast did their top. See how (Nolte) walks, how (Short) moves, or how (Jones) reacts to understand that well; it's rare to find a performance like this in a comedy. And when it comes to (Sarah Rowland Doroff), then we're talking about the movie's treasure. Casting her ensured this movie the immortality. OH MY GOD, every time I saw her; my heart just melts. She's too fragile to make you cry. It's apparent that (Francis Veber) directed her so well to an extent of feeling how she lost the nomination for the Oscar unfairly that year. (Veber) enjoyed us utterly, with exquisite adorable cadres, aesthetic lighting sometimes, and striking sense of comedy. He, as a writer, only lacked some balance in the last 20 minutes, and a satisfying finer climax. This movie has a philosophical side. Review with me  you have to be a criminal to raise a child correctly these days, love makes us fugitives in this world, and it's eventually a tale of 3 fugitives who get home by belonging to each other in some kind of family; with a serious stout father (Nolte), a helpless clumsy mom (Short), and a weak child (Doroff) who messes her father and mother. They all need a getaway to run from crimes they whether didn't commit or were pushed to commit lousily. The movie showcases that family obviously at the disguise by the Canadian borders. I love the 1980s and this movie too. With little fixing, it could have been received with great reviews.

While we see this film as more of an afterthought in our modern era, Revenge of the Nerds was viewed as a breath of fresh air when it came to hilarity within the everyday life on a college campus. The theme of the film has mainly to do with the everyday stereotype of Jocks vs. Geeks, and the everyday struggles of the nerds at the hands of their more superior opposites. Yet mostly, the theme within this movie relates to the everyday college life of students in general.The plot mainly centers on a group of geeks trying to outsmart and establish themselves on the campus of Adams College; all while trying to avoid utter embarrassment and humiliation at the hands of the Jocks. The leaders of the nerds, Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert Lowe (Anthony Edwards), are in a battle to establish the nerds into a fraternity within the campus after their frat house was overtaken by the jocks from the football team; with Stan Gable (Ted Mcginley) serving as the main antagonist from that group. What commences throughout the film from this point is a series of back and forth jock vs. nerds games that conclude with the nerds being embarrassed and humiliated the majority of the times. As the film progresses through these series of subliminal antics and humor, the culmination of the horseplay concludes within the school's Greek Games, in which the nerds finally overtake the jocks from the football team and claim a final victory.While the plot centers mainly on the shenanigans of the characters, it is hard not to ignore the nature of some of the action that goes on mainly within this film. Content such as the language, brief scenes of nudity, and overall complex of the setting depicts mainly what a typical college campus was like. The acting when it came to this content is comparable only to more modern films within The American Pie films. Speaking of which, this film is pretty much a pioneer for those types of films; like The American Pie and Van Wilder sequels. In these films, the themes are pretty much the same when it comes to the hilarity that is portrayed throughout the various scenes of these films. Additionally, what makes these movies so similar in comparison is the use of the camera angles and lighting within their scenes of humor.In terms of the camera angles, there is a serious approach to extracting numerous humorous content through the use of Telephoto Lenses, Fish-Eye Lenses, and the changes of camera angles through the use of zooming and panning. Likewise, the lighting within the various environments is more contemporary than anything, but when it comes to the humor scenes, there is more of a dusk kind of look whenever the nerds are humiliated in front of others.With all these factors mentioned, The Revenge of the Nerds is indeed an 80's classic; due in large part to the way that the nature of its humor reflected to the era of the film. While seeing it now clearly shows areas of old school, it is regardless a freshening experience due to how life is viewed without the modernism that we are accustomed to in today's world. In essence, this is simply just a movie about a group of new students who do not fit in any of the other social groups because they are fat, not attractive or nerdy group together and form their own fraternity. And although it does suffer from a predictable storyline, it is still an enjoyable movie. To fully enjoy this movie you need to appreciate, and be a fan of 80s comedies otherwise this may not appeal to you. This movie is definitely not for children or those who don't like bad language or nudity. However if you enjoyed other 80s style comedies this should appeal to you.

Likewise, the lighting within the various environments is more contemporary than anything, but when it comes to the humor scenes, there is more of a dusk kind of look whenever the nerds are humiliated in front of others.With all these factors mentioned, The Revenge of the Nerds is indeed an 80's classic; due in large part to the way that the nature of its humor reflected to the era of the film. While seeing it now clearly shows areas of old school, it is regardless a freshening experience due to how life is viewed without the modernism that we are accustomed to in today's world. In essence, this is simply just a movie about a group of new students who do not fit in any of the other social groups because they are fat, not attractive or nerdy group together and form their own fraternity. And although it does suffer from a predictable storyline, it is still an enjoyable movie. To fully enjoy this movie you need to appreciate, and be a fan of 80s comedies otherwise this may not appeal to you. This movie is definitely not for children or those who don't like bad language or nudity. However if you enjoyed other 80s style comedies this should appeal to you.

While we see this film as more of an afterthought in our modern era, Revenge of the Nerds was viewed as a breath of fresh air when it came to hilarity within the everyday life on a college campus. The theme of the film has mainly to do with the everyday stereotype of Jocks vs. Geeks, and the everyday struggles of the nerds at the hands of their more superior opposites. Yet mostly, the theme within this movie relates to the everyday college life of students in general.The plot mainly centers on a group of geeks trying to outsmart and establish themselves on the campus of Adams College; all while trying to avoid utter embarrassment and humiliation at the hands of the Jocks. The leaders of the nerds, Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert Lowe (Anthony Edwards), are in a battle to establish the nerds into a fraternity within the campus after their frat house was overtaken by the jocks from the football team; with Stan Gable (Ted Mcginley) serving as the main antagonist from that group. What commences throughout the film from this point is a series of back and forth jock vs. nerds games that conclude with the nerds being embarrassed and humiliated the majority of the times. As the film progresses through these series of subliminal antics and humor, the culmination of the horseplay concludes within the school's Greek Games, in which the nerds finally overtake the jocks from the football team and claim a final victory.While the plot centers mainly on the shenanigans of the characters, it is hard not to ignore the nature of some of the action that goes on mainly within this film.

But I found it uneven and it just didn't do much for me. The film is well made, the score is wonderful, Warren Oates is excellent and there is evidence of good direction. But here come the downsides, overall I just didn't find it funny. The script does have weaknesses feeling rather sporadic and ramshackle in the laughs, complete with jokes that feel forced and flat, and while the story starts off well the second half has a change of tone into a kind of a very generic action film that jarred with the rest of the movie and some scenes especially the mud-wrestling match and any scene involving PJ Soles and Sean Young that fell short on credibility. Oates is great, the other acting isn't that good in my opinion, Bill Murray plays a very obnoxious and unlikeable character and unfortunately he isn't very funny which is sad, Harold Ramis' character is interesting but is rarely built upon, both John Candy and Judge Reinhold with some weak scenes and dialogue are dull sadly and the best said about John Laroquette the better.

It had intense action scenes and all the things that made a young action movie fan wanting more.Only after 10 years or so when I saw it again, I noticed how weird the movie really is. Basically it is about one man's quest to compete in a secret tournament against the best of the best (and some of the weirdest) fighters around the world. He is fulfilling the last wish of his master by entering the Kumite and fighting to achieve the championship. It is said to be based on the real life events of Frank Dux but I cannot tell how much is actually real and how much is fiction, both in the movie and in the story Dux himself has told. The plot itself is not really complicated or anything too deep but Van Damme gives a good performance as Dux and is mostly very convincing.What 'bothers' me is the odd scenes here and there in the movie at one point we have this serious fight scene with unsettling music and the next we have Van Damme running away from two military law enforcement agents played by Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker with light-hearted, even comical, music.Also, the female love interest sub-plot is quite irrelevant to the plot as a whole and Leah Ayres serves only to slightly even the scales with the many testosterone-filled fighting machines. I believe she also somewhat blackmails Dux for letting her tag along to get into the Kumite since it is mostly off-limits to regular people. The blackmailing is bewildering to me since she tells Dux that she will tell the agents his whereabouts if he doesn't let her come with him the the tournament and yet the agents already know and\/or can locate Dux by themselves rendering the blackmailing pointless and ineffective. But of course, Dux being the gentleman he is, let's her tag along.Bloodsport is enjoyable martial arts movie and it belongs to every fan's must-see list. However, the overall pacing and some scenes take away some of the seriousness of the Kumite that the film no doubt tries to convey through some of the fight scenes and the menacing antagonist.
