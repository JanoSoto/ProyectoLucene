The script is completely awful. There is no element of surprise whatsoever anywhere, you can see where it's all going to end light years before it actually happens, so there is really no need to watch the movie to the end. Something I couldn't stand doing. Keanu Reeves destroys every scene he is in, and I guess since he is the lead he also destroys the whole movie. And that is sad because there are people who really can act here, like Anthony Quinn. It just hurts to see such a good actor in the same scene as Keanu Reeves, it's like they are from two different dimensions. There are extras in this movie that act better than Reeves. That CGI Gungan that you saw a few pixels of far away in a battle scene in the end of Phantom Menace, was a more convincing actor than Keanu Reeves! There is also a scene where they fly, flap the heat to the grapes so they don't get ruined because of the frost.WHAT PURPOSE DOES THIS SCENE SERVE?It's just silly! I sat there giggling, I mean they look like idiots! Not only that, the lead female character is prancing around in her nightgown. Wow, it must be cold! All right so Mr. director wants to show her features, but come on! This leads us to another major problem. Why should we even care about any of the persons on this vineyard at all? They're not poor, they have no debts, no nothing! A movie needs a conflict for it too be even remotely interesting! I could think of a million ways to get it a conflict and make it interesting, but hey I'm just a lowly movie fan, I shouldn't have to write this. Professional script writers should be very well aware of all this! All in all, if you like this movie I recommend the Bill and Ted movies mentioned in my one line summary. Fine pieces of cinema starring your dear Keanu Reeves.

This is an extremely human story stripped down to everyday realities in the lives of ordinary people.  This is certainly one of the best and most compelling films of 2000.  Writer\/director Ken Lonergan, who as a writer has given us such deep and subtle works as `Analyze This' and `The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' has outdone himself by light years with this moving story of regular folks dealing with common problems.Lonergan's direction of the actors is superb.  He always seems to strike just the right emotional note without the need for flashy technical tricks or stylized cuts and camera angles.  He lets the actors and their story dominate the screen, and he doesn't attempt to insert his directorial ego into the frame.  More and more I am coming to appreciate directors who know how to stay out of the way.  The character development is deep and sensitively done.  We learn to care about Sammy (Laura Linney) for her level headed strength and for Terry (Mark Ruffalo) despite his temperamental arrogance and loser mentality.  Throughout the film, the viewer is tempted to exhort Sammy to slam the door on her brother, though we know she can't do and shouldn't do it.  In the end, the bond between them is so touching and noble that it transcends the adversity through which they put one another.  Schmaltzy?  Yes, but an all too real portrayal of how people often do what they must instead of what they should.Laura Linney delivers a career performance in this film garnering a Best Actress nomination from the Academy.  It was an honor that was well deserved.  Linney makes Sammy a character that is admirable and lovable despite her human foibles.  It is a performance that runs broad and deep, examining the many facets and emotions of this middle class woman struggling to maintain her dignity and confer strong values to her son.  Mark Ruffalo is also outstanding as the embittered brother suffering from deep seated insecurities.  Ruffalo delivers a powerful portrayal of young man whose disappointments in life have gotten the better of him.  Yet despite the hardness of the character, he is able to show a gentle vulnerability and sincere affection with Sammy that makes many of the scenes so poignant.  The brother-sister chemistry between Linney and Ruffalo is perfect, at times nasty and resentful in its familiarity, yet with an underlying bond of love that is indestructible.Matthew Broderick is effective as Sammy's supercilious boss, who is more concerned with arbitrary rules than with the people that work for him.  Broderick, who is accustomed to playing quirky but likeable characters, does surprisingly well as the jerk.  His clueless insensitivity is a good imitation of the many people who let a little authority go to their heads.This film shows that an independent film with a microscopic budget can outdo the major studios armed only with an honest, simple story and an insightful director.  I rated it a 10\/10.  It is one of the best character studies I have seen in some time.  It is a treat for the refined viewer.

Life As A House had me reduced to a sniveling, awe-struck confidante of each character in one hour. I cried for the second hour and there is no lying about that. I can't really say anything brilliant about the direction, except that the director clearly commanded supreme performances from his cast. Otherwise, the direction was mute and I'm not saying that is a bad thing. He didn't scream, I am the director!. He let his cast do it. Kevin Kline is amazingly metamorphic. Kristen Scott Thomas (and her character because you can see her in her character and that's not a bad thing)is perfectly cast and extremely endearing. Hayden Christensen is not only exactly terse and pained as Sam, he IS Sam. I look forward to his Anakin like I never imagined before. What a well-kept and timely Vancouver discovery! Jena Malone blew me away in Contact and Bastard Out Of Carolina and she has matured into a true starlet. I've always liked Mary Steenburgen, but never really cared about her characters until now. (And you could light a cigarette on Ian Somerhalder, but that's enough about me). I think the beauty of this film is metaphoric in the purest form The building of a house, in the place where it was, creates a new house from the ashes\/splinters of the first. A phoenix. The celebration of the birth of renewed relationships from the fragmented shards of the past. I just cannot say enough about how much this film slayed me and, after some really stinky films lately, I'm glad to have my ardent love for film finally reinforced by a surprisingly overlooked jewel like this tear-jerking, complex and totally engaging conglomerate of very gifted film makers, actors, writers, producers and angels.

Don't mess with the Count of Monte Cristo. The man is out for revenge, and nothing is going to get in his way.

What a load of intellectual crap ! ( the comments, I mean, not the film ). I think this is an excellent film, the script is first rate, the actors excellent and the whole thing combines suspense laugher and a dose of tears! Critics who keep asking useless questions about the racial origin of one or other actors in the film or conversely who keep saying such and such an actor would do this or that or wouldn't react in such a way are just wasting their breath and haven't really understood what the film's about. The film is in no way a true to life documentary but examines the idea .........what if.....we all tried to help each other!. The result is both humoristic and edifying as we are treading on hitherto untrodden territory. True, the idea of doing good unilaterally has already been examined in such films as Magnificent Obsession starring Rock Hudson and more recently Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain starring Audrey Tautou but in this field, the film Pay it Forward was a cut above these. I admit I was very shocked and in tears at the end and I wasn't expecting the final outcome, but that's life! ( if I can express myself thus ) and the candle-light vigil could have been dispensed with but these are really minor reproaches about what to me is an excellent film and I would pay tribute to the excellent acting of all those involved. Highly recommendable and let's hope that will actually have the desired effect on a large number of people !!!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 February 2002","score":"","review":"  Lynch leans heavily on the performances of the actors and they truly pull it off.  Naomi Watts initially comes across like a vacuous nurse from 'flying docters' and rapidly shows she is a very talented actress.  Laura Harring did a good job, but Watts is clearly more versatile and subtle.  Mulholland Drive starts as a completely credible story and develops into a genuine David Lynch work of art enigmatic, cryptic, steamy, surreal, baffling, kind of slow with (unfortunately) terrible music.  Lynch totally forgets about entire parts of the 'plot' and concentrates on the unexpected.  Even some strange (horror) sequences from Eraserhead (1977) are recognizable.Unmistakenly from the director of Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway not exactly intuitively directed, but I say intuitive viewing is required like when viewing Lost Highway.  Don't try to explain everything that's going on and let the images and surreal editing\/developments create the atmosphere of the movie.  Some may say it's arthouse, but IMO it's too accessible for that.  I'd say it's off beat and haunting from beginning to end.  Peter Deming (Lost Highway, Evil Dead 2 !, From Hell) is quickly becoming one of my favourite cinematographers.  Get this guy in 'Visions of light 2' plz.If you thought David Fincher makes mind candy, see Mulholland Dr and think again.  Most people will find this more accessible than Twin Peaks though. Go see it in combination with 'Outer Space' (1999) in the Paradiso theater in Amsterdam.  There are some really annoying and pointless sequences, but I still rate it 9\/10 which includes positive discrimination of Lynch, not because I supposedly don't want to admit I didn't understand the movie ;-) This one really made me curious about the way Lynch directs a movie on set.

Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in their only really great film they made together star as George and Martha, an embattled couple swapping endless cut-lows, throwing curse words back and forth and finally making a last grasp at what's left of their marriage. Burton is easily at his finest hour in this film as George, the dry-witted yet world-weary college professor and Taylor turns in an unusually powerful performance as the shrewish Martha. The supporting cast consists of basically two other players; George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the young couple Nick and Honey. Dennis plays Honey brilliantly and Segal is really likable as always as Nick. This is also the first film to contain profanity and it predates the rating system which places the film in a unique position in film history. Mike Nichols' directorial debut is phenomenal. You'd think that even though he's got noteworthy theater experience his first film would get no more than mediocre reviews. As with Sam Mendes in American BEAUTY, Nichols turned his first film into a brilliant piece. It's subject matter isn't always light but it still turns out to be an unabashed work of art.
