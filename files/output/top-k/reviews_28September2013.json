Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, Noir, in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! Chinatown tells the story of J.J. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city.Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it perfectly. First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script.The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it.Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance.Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After masterpieces like Knife in the water, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.

It's rough around the edges, grueling to get through, but oh, so worth it! I consider this movie to be a near masterpiece for many reasons. The sheer skill of Gus Van Sant, says it all. He may have been responsible for the crappy Psycho remake, but when the man is motivated, he's hard to beat. The gritty nature of this film is absolutely perfect, and I thought the drug abuse was extremely realistic. I felt the desperation of Bob, as well as the undeniable shame that stemmed from robbing drug stores to maintain his habit. It also helps that despite Bob's selfish mannerisms, he manages to remain a sympathetic figure. He won't be sympathetic to everyone, but he was to me. All the credit goes to Matt Dillon for his sensational performance. Kelly Lynch is pretty good herself. She doesn't have as big a role to tackle, but her chemistry with Dillon was excellent, and was vital to the film's success. James Le Gros is good, whilst Heather Graham is splendid in one of her early roles as the clueless tag-along. Drugstore Cowboy also has touches of dark humor. It has a very funny stakeout scene that cracked me up. The most powerful part of the movie for me is when Bob goes straight for a little while. It's a really eye- opening experience, and reminded me how awful addiction can truly be. The movie ends on an ambiguous note. It makes you interpret the situation.

Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is.The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave.Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp\/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape.While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'.The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in The Son of Pink Panther, he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.

He really overacts and his lines sound As always the ducks are underdogs and for some reason can't beat the big bad varsity who isn't really impressive. I found one of the most annoying characters besides the varsity coach is the announcer for the games. That kid has no acting talent and he must be a relative of someone at Disney which got him the role. Let's not forget Charlie crying all the time about losing his C. A real leader doesn't need a C on his jersey to lead. It looks like Eden Hall is supposed to resemble Shattuck St Mary's in Minnesota which is a well known hockey high school. I could go on and on forever. This movie isn't as bad as the 2nd one, but it sure gives it a run for its money.

I.Q. has a lot in common with Roxanne, probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated than he really is. In Roxanne the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as President) and Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to Little Richard's Tutti-Frutti, which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fiancé James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt Gödel and Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie, and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between IQ and Roxanne, where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in Roxanne) of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old bespectacled bluestocking cliché. Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in Grumpy Old Men, but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt Gödel, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate IQ quite as highly as Roxanne, one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in Roxanne, is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, IQ is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2013","score":"","review":" I originally associated Fred Schepisi with true-life crime dramas like The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith and A Cry in the Dark, both set in his native Australia, but he is clearly a versatile director who has also turned his hand to comedy.

Even today, the story is recognized as one of the best Stephen King novels, but also as one of the greatest horror stories ever told. Two years after publication, director Brian De Palma would adapt this famous story for the big screen. The result was a fantastic horror movie with absolutely phenomenal acting performances and a chilling storyline that leaves an impact on everyone who witnesses it. Carrie White is a shy, socially awkward teenager who is subject to frequent bullying at Bates High School. Carrie is one of the girls who wears her hair down in order to cover her face. She lives at home with her mother Margaret, a mentally unstable Christian fundamentalist. Carrie is often subject to punishments from her mother, whether it's being forced into a closet to pray or repeating verses from the Bible over and over. Carrie is special though she has the ability of telekinesis, meaning she can movie objects with her mind. After humiliating Carrie in the girls locker room, the more popular girls at the school, including Sue Snell, Chris Hargensen, and Norma Watson, are sentenced to a week long detention for their inappropriate behavior towards Carrie. Feeling bad for what she did, Sue decides to get her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to ask Carrie to the senior prom in order to make up for the embarrassment. Reluctantly, Carrie accepts. However, when something goes down at the prom, the night turns from one of happiness and fun into one of pure horror. The story is chilling and unsettling without being a full-fledged slasher movie. What's great about the movie is the way takes the time to slow down and flesh out Carrie's story, giving a chance for viewers to realize just how terrible Carrie's life really is. As it progresses, Carrie becomes a more relatable and sympathetic character, which makes the climax all the more saddening and even understandable to a certain degree. The performances in Carrie are top-notch all around the board. Sissy Spacek, in an Oscar-nominated performance, plays Carrie extremely well. She plays all the emotions that Carrie faces in an extremely believable way, almost making it hard to tell if she's actually acting. Spacek also has a sort of physical appearance where she can match the qualities needed for the character of Carrie, but also where she is undeniably beautiful when she cleans herself up for the prom. Piper Laurie sort of revived her career with her performance as Margaret, garnering her an Oscar nomination also. She felt over-the-top at times, but Laurie's performance is undeniably unsettling, especially in the scenes where she physically abuses Carrie. Rounding out the supporting cast is Betty Buckley as Miss Collins, the gym teacher in charge of the detention and a comforting figure for Carrie, and John Travolta, in a breakthrough performance as Chris' boyfriend. There are a few aspects of Carrie that feel like they haven't aged well, such as the strange blurry lighting in some of the outdoor shots, but it's not enough to hinder it's greatness. The performances are solid, especially the Oscar-nominated performances from Spacek and Laurie. The story was well-written and well-executed, and offers some deep themes about bullying.

Repeatedly.Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film.Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating &#x96; I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living.

His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving.When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings Love Stinks at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie?An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride.Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful 50 First Dates but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings Ladies Night. 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity.The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's.For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2013","score":"","review":" It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter.

She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful 50 First Dates but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings Ladies Night. 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity.The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's.For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com ","genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance"},{"date":"28 September 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.

I think it was a break out roll for Alpacino who played Michael Corelone the son to the Don (Marlon Brando). I must say it made me wonder if the Italian mafia world really exists, and if so is this real in-site. There were some parts that could have been left out, I did feel the wedding scene was being dragged out, I understand that was the only day the Don would grant wishes. I still give it a 10 even the beginning was a slow start. In my opinion I do believe Michael made a good Don, and we all knew once the Don had an attempt on his life he would not fully recover from it. Sonny (James Caan) the eldest son to the Don was groomed to take his father's place if a tragedy were to happen to him, so i was very surprised and a little sadden when he was ambushed and murdered on his way to protect his sister. I think this movie gave some real in-site to a gangster's paradise. It showed how the power can change from one individual to the next in a blink of an eye.How ironic the one son whom wanted nothing to do with his fathers lifestyle, who went to college and fought in the war, was the son who ended up filling his shoes. I would recommend this movie for viewing as well as Thr Godfather II to explore Michael's Journey as the new Don Corelone.

There are neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy all over the country and I grew up in one similar to the one in the movie. Usually a neighborhood will have stores that represent the demographics of the population. What Spike Lee is saying in certain neighborhoods are about money and gentrification. An Italian and Korean store in a black and Latino neighborhood was a crucial plot point in the film because the attitudes combined with the humidity led to the movie's climax. I saw this when i was 13 years old and got the message instantly. I've never questioned Mookie's action of whether he did the right thing, because I understood the monologue Radio Raheem gave earlier in the movie. The love\/hate war Radio Raheem talked about was to me at 13, very clear, because just when you think hate wins, love subsides and overcomes. Right before Mookie threw the trash can threw Sal's window he yells hate! SPOILER-when he goes to Sal about getting paid finally at the end, they both cautiously become friends again (love). Radio Raheem wasn't a thug, he was just a normal guy in the neighborhood who had the respect for being older and yes, even more mature than the other people on the block. Spike Lee wasn't condemning anyone in this movie but examining norms affecting society in neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy, when combined with heat and the attitudes of a few trouble makers explode. When Sal's burned down, Spike left a hidden message there, do you think Sal rebuilt his place back to Bed-Stuy?? Of course not, but now the property is vacant and open to someone else at a low price for redevelopment (gentrification). So keep an open mind, Do The Right Thing is controversial, but it's also one of the best films made.

The film, however, falls too much in love with it, goes off on a tangent, and it is bound and determined not to end. The length of the climactic scene - if you can call it that - undermined the story's emotional impact. The film benefits from its cast, but Billy Bob Thornton and Miranda Richardson were the only supporting actors who added much depth to the plot. If you're looking for a similar Christian tale of redemption set in the Deep South, I would recommend Black Snake Moan. I found that one to have a better pace, more interesting characters, and tighter writing.
