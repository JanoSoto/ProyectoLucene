After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again.

I was sitting watching this on cable at the hotel, when my wife at that time, would not let me go out with her that morning on her route in Sierra Vista. It wasn't that I would get in the way of her talking to the doctors on her pharmaceutical rounds, due to the fact that she had already ask me to go with her a couple times before and I knew how things shake out with it, it was that she was having an affair with a co-worker and needed to give him a private long distance call, from a pay phone. At any rate, this was probably one of the most upending and unsettling and touching films I had seen in years. It was good that I stayed and watch Duvall's story of betrayal and violence. I came to a better grip with the circumstances that I was in, believe it or not. When he becomes E.F. the Apostle, you can see he seems starting to come apart, just before it happens. There is a much mis-gilded thought life that he has when he boldly steps up and decides that it's better to blame God than to 'take responsibility' for his very own misconduct and rage trouble. Farrah Fawcett provides an aging but provocative ex-wife that can't take the 'jambing' effect that Sonny seems to boldly posses. I.e. the baseball field assault on his ex's new man. It seems that at the end of the assault he just disconnected and said let's go home now. As if whatever he does, even when totally wrong, he can justify to himself despite the damaged inflicted on anything, or anyone else that is around him then. Then there is the scene at the church with Billy bob's character and they quickly end up in a brawl on the side of the church, while the deacons look on.

I think I learned even more about human nature and intentions, motives etc. It shows that even when people mess it up, there is always something on a sub-textual level, it's not always just 'Face value'. I am not a Billy Bob fan by the way, but even his character, that came to destroy Sonny's church, and ended up changing his own life in that process. Remember as well, even if he can 'justify' his own bad behavior, God did not let him go on and on, he had to be brought to 'Justice' himself. You can mock God but only for a little while. This film, definitely touched me and caused me to think deeper.Thanks, IMDb.com.... I recommend this to those with discernment about life and people and especially the Bible.

Given my usual aversion to any film described as a teen romance, it may be that I was just in a good mood, but to my surprise I rather enjoyed it.A large part of its appeal undoubtedly lies in the fact that John Cusack and Ione Skye do make a genuinely likable couple, helped out by an understated script that allows them to be just that. In a number of other films by Cameron Crowe, I've felt the emotion was cloyingly overdone. However, although Say Anything, with its central premise of nice guy gets nice girl, occasionally teeters on the brink of such sentimentality, it never quite topples.There's a pleasant naturalistic quality to the film. Not what you would call realism, just an unforced emotional sincerity. Despite the fact many of the characters could, on the face of it, easily be slotted into familiar stereotypes of the genre, the script ensures they diverge just enough to keep things interesting.This is particularly true of Ione's father, engagingly played by John Mahoney, better known as Marty Crane on Frasier.

Some of the evidence comes from Clarke's early work in space radar and radio, and in his article about meteorites. Copies of two of his articles can be found on my web site at www.geocities.com\/gregu10\/geek\/geek.htm Later in life Clarke became an expert in two other areas of space exploration, predicting how the astronaut will behave, and predicting when radio signals can be corrected for errors. All of these obscure technologies add up to a better explanation for the pods behavior, for the AE-35, and for HAL not letting Dave back in the ship.The first issue I have is the pod. Clarke's 1940s paper on meteorites concluded that a large space ship in the asteroid belt would not be nimble enough to dodge meteorites, nor powerful enough to destroy them. In the movie we see meteorites just before the fatal scene. Then the pod warning light turn on, then we see the severed air hose and the dead astronaut cross in front of us followed by the pod. The pod crossed the astronauts path after his death. The pod was trying to save the astronaut from a meteorite. This scene might be a pre-view of what happened to Apollo 13. That would be true if we could prove that Apollo 13 was hit by a meteorite and then the oxygen bottle failed. Similarly the accident on Challenger happened not because the wing failed, but because the wing had been hit by ice, and was the part of the wing most likely to fail if it got too much ionization.The second issue is the AE-35. Using filtering techniques such as the Viterbi algorithm for radio communications was well known in 1968. Viterbi developed his algorithm for the Venus spacecraft, and prior to that Wiener and Kalman had developed filtering algorithms used in television screens for radar applications. Hal never says the AE-35 failed. He predicted when it was going to fail, in the future. This is possible when using error correcting algorithms. Hal does not understand why the astronauts are so upset about his prediction. Despite something like 76,000 systems on board, Hal expects the astronauts to know all about the AE-35 unit at the base of the microwave. Hal has never seen anything quite like it. Hal suggests putting it back, and waiting for it to fail!The question is why does Clarke know it will fail. His 1947 article on radio range to Jupiter shows clearly that power and range are available for communicating to earth. Furthermore, Clarke showed that none of the other radio problems such as Doppler, ranging or tracking will create any unsolvable problems. So why was Hal waiting for the AE-35 to start error correcting? Why did Hal think the astronauts would want to know as soon as Hal knew? Was there some fact of radio that Clarke missed back in 1947? The answer is yes - Clarke failed to consider that a spaceship near Jupiter would accelerate to 35,000 mph or more, causing relativistic changes in wavelengths of the radio nearly one part in a million. This relativistic change is the reason the AE-35 unit started doing error correction, and led to the prediction of the failure of all microwave communications in a few days. But the AE-35 never did fail. They turned it off. In the 1960s book Making of 2001 Clarke is quoted saying the computer was perfectly correct, it was ground control who messed up. Ground control was not traveling 35,000MPH!!!At this point Hal knows that Dave is a threat to the ship. If you read the 1962 US Navy study about conflict resolution on my website by Mesarovic you will see the prediction that crew performance will decline rapidly if the two crewman talk to each other. This is what happened, and Hal was well aware of the fact - he observed their lips moving while they were together in the pod - talking paranoia about Hal. Early NASA studies such as the NASA 1962 University Symposium have simpler mathematical models for astronauts and test pilots. It was Mesarovic who worked out the case of two astronauts on a ship being controlled by the ground with a seven hour communication delay. If you think critically during the time that Hal is doing the psychological workup - you can tell that Hal doesn't know what they are talking about. Hal is just filling in the blanks for the psychologists at NASA. He is a boring chess partner too, not intelligent at all.
