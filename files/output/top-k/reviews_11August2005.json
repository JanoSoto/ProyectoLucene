Imhotep and anck-su-namun were so in love there was no way she would have run off like a coward and left him to die. This is the same woman that stabbed herself in the stomach in the first movie! If anything, she would have hurled herself into that fiery pit with Imhotep. This scene really spoiled the movie for me and up to that point I was having a great time.Yes, the Scorpion King looked like a plastic jerk and the CGI wasn't up to snuff, but you couldn't help being entertained by it. It was exciting, action packed and managed to squeeze in some great battle scenes, love scenes, and even an ancient fight scene between women (Nefertiri and anck-su-namun).Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bey) has to be one of the hottest actors on the planet! The man is simply gorgeous and quite talented. He is definitely leading man material. There were so many good looking men to drool over Ardeth, Rick and Imhotep. If I were Evy, I'd want to date both Ardeth and Rick and decide (much, much later) which one I wanted to marry. Okay, so marry Rick, live an upper-class life in England with your husband and son, but at least experience Ardeth first. Spend a few months out in the desert with this hunk and get a little ankle tattoo to remember him by! I felt sorry for Imhotep, and in this movie, he didn't seem to be the bad guy at all. I thought he had gotten a raw deal in the first Mummy anyway. He was just in love with the wrong woman and was willing to sacrifice everything to be with her. Who wouldn't have gotten a little riled at having one's tongue cut out, being buried alive and slowly eaten by scarabs, and then having an eternal curse put on you! I would have returned and kicked a few asses too. In this movie, all he seemed to really want was to be with anck-su-namum again. She was the monster in this one, if you ask me.Imhotep really didn't seem to have his heart into ruling the world and seemed happier once he was reunited with her, only to have her run off and leave him to die. I had tears in my eyes along with him and you could see he was heartbroken and no longer cared what happened to him. Here is little Evy dodging falling columns and leaping over breaking ground to save her man and anck-su-namun was supposed to be the bad-ass female warrior who would do anything for her man. She got what she deserved though and I cheered as the scarabs picked her bones clean. Too bad Imhotep couldn't have seen that! They never really explained how anck-su-namun was reincarnated in the first place. She just shows up in 1930s clothes, with a new name and spouting English like a native.Evy seems to have lost her sense of humor and ditzy ways in this one all together. I guess thats what 10 years of marriage and having a bratty kid will do for you. Now, she is a no nonsense, humorless, treasure seeker (instead of the librarian she proudly proclaimed herself to be in The Mummy) and just didn't seem as much fun as she used to be. Her clothes seemed awfully revealing for 1933 too. She is still very beautiful but just boring - even with her new butt kicking skills.The little boy's role was totally unbelievable. Not his acting - he did a decent job with what he was given - but he seemed to act more like a child of 12 or 13 years instead of 8. He was too self possessed, too articulate and too brave. Nothing scared him, he apparently had artistic talent well beyond his years (perfect sand depictions of ancient Egyptian cities and monuments were left as clues for his parents), he read and understood ancient Egyptian words that he wouldn't have really grasped even in English. He didn't seem upset when he thought that he lost both his parents in the dirigible crash and didn't shed a tear when he saw his mother knifed before his eyes. Just matter of fact and ready to go on with his life. The brother didn't even seem upset either. Now thats taking the stiff upper lip British thing too far!

It starts off when Marty McFly gets into a lot of trouble. Including with his girlfriend and school (are you surprised?!). But then Marty realizes, his best friend, a scientist who he calls 'doc', just invented a time machine... and guess what? It actually works! But then something happens. When he is about to go to the year 1955, doc is shot by Libyain terrorists from whom he stole plutonium, the liquid that makes the time machine work. Without any choices, Marty scrambles into the car and... finds himself in the year 1955. But the story doesn't end there. Marty accidentally stops his parents (who were teenagers then) from meeting and falling in love with each other, and puts his life at risk. Because if his parents never met, that means that they never had any children. And if Marty doesn't get to get his parents to meet each other.. it means that him and his brothers will simply disappear off the face of the earth. Also, Marty and the young doc encounter another problem. Marty needs to get back to the future, and he can't as plutonium was barely known in the 1950s. So how will he do it? See and find out! This movie is simply cool. Not only is it funny, it also has an excellent script and dialog. I like the cast and the characters and I also liked the set decoration.

Having sung many operas, I can tell you that if that element is missing, it is boring. Directors are very conscious of that element in their product. I felt it between Morgana and her son, the beautiful sequences of Guinevere and Lancelot and Merlin himself. After all that is one of Arthur's failings to her. That is what makes for such a powerful tragedy. We just ache for Arthur at the end. That's why we cry. Not just for him but for ourselves. Don't you think that is what makes us so taken with most myths, for instance Tristan and Isolde. Last night I watched Troy and noticed that Nigel Terry was a player. I honestly don't know who he played but it got me thinking about Excalibur. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. One of the reviews calls Nigel Terry to task for his acting in the first part of the movie. But isn't that one of the great things that he shows us; the way Arthur changes from a youth to a man. It seems a paradox that though the characters in Excalibur are mythic, they are human too. In contrast Troy is bloodless, yes sexless. Brad Pitt is beautiful (don't care much for the hair) but boring. The best performance is by Peter O'toole when he pleads for his son's body. The music in Excalibur is almost a character too. Wagner operas use the voice as an instrument to convey the grand emotions and here he uses the music to enlarge the experience. And all that energy becomes deep emotional love, its beauty for beauty's sake. Love's power is the life force of the universe. We can all of us experience its power for good or evil. I think that is another tragedy of Arthur, once he had that love's power and lost it. Not just Guinevere but his whole domain. But you see, we have the same thing, only we don't get the same send off that he did. But we can dream.

Drunkeness, which is at present a relevant subject matter in the UK, where the Government is advocating 24 hour drinking laws for England and Wales, can be a real and serious problem, with plenty of repercussions for friends and family, as well as serious health ones. However, as we don't really see the serious implications of drunkenness in this film, then perhaps it is because the wealth of a billionaire helps him or her cope with it that much better. From this we can deduce that social problems are not a cause or effect of over-consumption of alcohol, but more to do with social circumstance.Of course there appears to be no placement advertisements of manufactures of alcohol in this film. This one can assume is because manufacturers of alcohol don't want to be seen to be associated with 'drunkenness'. And some would say; quite right too'. This is because it is not the alcohol which is dangerous, but the person drinking it which is!As a drunk the late Dudley Moore plays Arthur superbly. While the film 10 might have turned Moore into an unlikely sex-symbol, subsequently serving to tarnish him with the label of; 'womanizer'. In fact Moore was a man of many talents. Not only was he an adept actor, and funny comic, but a no less than brilliant pianist, having been classically trained in this field. We actually see how at ease Moore is with the piano, as his character; Arthur plays it to the guests of his party.As for the late Sir John Gielgud, his role as the butler is made less by the lines he has to say, but more to do with the way he delivers them, with a deadpan expression, albeit with a glint in his eyes. I think Sir John is here made all the more funny because his comedic butler role is out of context with his serious Shakespearan actor reputation.Meanwhile, there appears to be a bit of laziness on behalf of the director here, who in my opinion could have done more to bring out the supporting cast. This is particularly so with the woman who, along with her spouse is woken up by Arther during the early hours looking for Linda. Here one can see the woman is mouthing the lines of Moore until it's her cue to speak her own. This also occurs with Liza Manelli, when she is in the store.What really carries this film is the acting of Moore and Sir John, and the excellent writing. These are what make this film worthy of prestigious film awards, and critical acclaim.

We actually see how at ease Moore is with the piano, as his character; Arthur plays it to the guests of his party.As for the late Sir John Gielgud, his role as the butler is made less by the lines he has to say, but more to do with the way he delivers them, with a deadpan expression, albeit with a glint in his eyes. I think Sir John is here made all the more funny because his comedic butler role is out of context with his serious Shakespearan actor reputation.Meanwhile, there appears to be a bit of laziness on behalf of the director here, who in my opinion could have done more to bring out the supporting cast. This is particularly so with the woman who, along with her spouse is woken up by Arther during the early hours looking for Linda. Here one can see the woman is mouthing the lines of Moore until it's her cue to speak her own. This also occurs with Liza Manelli, when she is in the store.What really carries this film is the acting of Moore and Sir John, and the excellent writing. These are what make this film worthy of prestigious film awards, and critical acclaim.

Drunkeness, which is at present a relevant subject matter in the UK, where the Government is advocating 24 hour drinking laws for England and Wales, can be a real and serious problem, with plenty of repercussions for friends and family, as well as serious health ones. However, as we don't really see the serious implications of drunkenness in this film, then perhaps it is because the wealth of a billionaire helps him or her cope with it that much better. From this we can deduce that social problems are not a cause or effect of over-consumption of alcohol, but more to do with social circumstance.Of course there appears to be no placement advertisements of manufactures of alcohol in this film. This one can assume is because manufacturers of alcohol don't want to be seen to be associated with 'drunkenness'. And some would say; quite right too'. This is because it is not the alcohol which is dangerous, but the person drinking it which is!As a drunk the late Dudley Moore plays Arthur superbly.

Now Leonard goes about life trying to catch the one who destroyed his life. He tattoos his body with clues as to who this man is and relies on pictures and his handwriting to help him remember certain things.In Christopher Nolan's film, Memento, he brilliantly constructs a murder mystery that leaves the viewer in the dark as to what really happened. Nolan structures the film in such a way that makes us feel exactly like the lead character, Leonard. The film doesn't follow any normal structure, because it begins with the ending, then ends with the stories beginning. The viewer has no idea what has happened prior to what we are being shown, much like Leonard who has short-term memory loss.Nolan uses black and white as transitional scenes between the structure of going backwards. These are breaks in the story line and act as a narration to give the viewer more insight into Leonard's condition. These scenes in black and white actually take place before the film and in the film's conclusion these scenes connect with the rest of the film. The viewer much like Leonard again must connect pieces of the story to come to a conclusion as to what has happened, but in the end the answer is ambiguous and we are told to make our own conclusion as to what happened.Leonard will never remember himself killing John G. He will always go on trying to find his killer even though he has most likely already killed him. There are no good characters in this film, since everyone Leonard meets ends up using him for their benefit. Teddy uses him to kill a drug dealer, Natalie uses him to get vengeance on Teddy, and even the hotel receptionist fools Leonard by checking him into two separate rooms. The film takes more then one view to comprehend what happens and it takes a great filmmaker to be able to make people talk about something years later. Nolan has manages to become an auteur with Memento, not only being the vision behind it but the creator all together.Joe Pantoliano, who has a knack for playing evil roles, sets himself apart here and really shines. Where Pearce is most of the times flat Pantoliano brings life and comedy into the film. His Matrix co-star Carrie Ann Moss also brings a certain charm here; in her own little evil way.Everyone should watch this film at least once, trust me, you'll need more then one viewing to know what's going on. It's structure and presentation is astonishing and should be awarded so. I give thumbs up for Nolan's Memento.

And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show\/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derrière and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.

The rest of the cast is no less great in their perspective roles. I was disappointed to see brilliant character actor Wayne Robson get killed off so early in the film. He has been around for such a long time and seemed to have such an interesting character but barely lasted any amount of time, although his death was very cool!! In fact the film is quite gory and the enormous variety of traps set in different rooms also gives you a serious sense of suspense and on the edge of your seat. The special effects are quite stunning considering such a low budget film. Cube brings out the fears in the human mind and each character shows a different range of emotions caused by this situation and setting. This makes the film very riveting and impossible not to watch. Unfortunately the film does leave you more than slightly unsatisfied with no real answer to any of the major questions. The plot really never thickens and never has a climax or an end. I hope that perhaps the following sequels to the film tie up some of that but by the sounds of it they really don't. They created something incredibly unique with this film and it's worth seeing just to see something completely out of the norm but still very compelling. I just think there was more story there to tell definitely.

It's about as far from Tango as it's possible to get but then Leconte's schtick is that he has no schtick and changes from film to film. I first heard of St Pierre when, as a kid, I discovered Damon Runyon and read his short story 'The Lily Of St Pierre' which is not, I suppose, a million miles away from this story.

As we approach her she begins a voice-over flashback of events in St Pierre and we naturally assume she is still there but how wrong can you be. Her story is the stuff of melodrama involving a gentle giant who indisputably murders a man before our eyes then undergoes a rehabilitation that stops just short of sainthood. The problem is that St Pierre is what vaudevillians used to call 'a wide part in the road' and lacks both a guillotine and an executioner which leaves military commander Jean (Daniel Auteuil) one one side and the town council on the other.

And the film has a very good engagement sequence at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple Eidelweiss ballad to How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria , Do Re Mi, My Favorite Things, The Sound of Music, I Have Confidence, The Lonely Goatherd, Something Good, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and the voice-challenging Climb Every Mountain. Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max.

It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience.

They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple Eidelweiss ballad to How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria , Do Re Mi, My Favorite Things, The Sound of Music, I Have Confidence, The Lonely Goatherd, Something Good, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and the voice-challenging Climb Every Mountain. Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time.

It went beyond the sexual parameters set forth in most films and instead lied them out on the table for the world to see. The was a very real love story. In fact, I would say it was one of the more true stories that I have seen on the screen for a very long time. You could see the chemistry, you could see the insecurity, you could see the beginnings of a beautiful relationship and it was perfect. You know the unsure feelings that you have when you first begin a relationship, the hesitancy, the butterflies, the stepping stones . well, they were all demonstrated in this film. I cannot speak enough of how real and true this film was. It confirmed my belief that you do not need to have the clichéd, pronounced roles of male and female to have a beautiful love story, all you need are two people and a heart that needs to be found.The acting was decent. There could have been a bit more passion between the two, but I am not complaining. I completely understood what they wanted, where they wanted to go, and what they needed to do to achieve it. One of the most powerful scenes of this film was when Kim undresses and they make love. For the first time in cinema history, it was love and not sex. They did it to better their relationship, to say to each other that they were comfortable with their decisions. They wanted to say I love you in the best way possible. While no words were spoken, you were able to glance into their minds and hearts, and it takes very good acting to allow this to happen. They even demonstrate this even further when Prentice lays for a while after talking about what just happened and he ponders over what to do now he had no job or money and nowhere to live. Together they work on a solution. There is no me in this relationship. This is when Prentice decides to finally make his true feelings known in a very bold, yet beautiful fashion. You will have to see the film to experience the true emotion.Overall, I was very impressed with this film. I loved the boundaries that it broke, again .. the truth that it spoke, and the realistic story that it presented. For those that will look at this review and get quinsy in their stomachs, I ask you think . what is so different between this story and most of the recycled Hollywood garbage that we watch on a weekly basis?

He does a good job of being extremely alluring and sexy, all that Dracula is supposed to be. His eyes are the most amazing color when they are green and when they are red, which adds to his character. You almost feel like he's looking at you, which is appropriately creepy and lovely at the same time. Anyway, enough about how much I'm in love with Dracula. Johnny Lee Miller also did a good job, and has some good lines. As for Justine Waddell, she does not do a good job. She's too much of the helpless girl, and I think that even I could do it better than she did. Christopher Plummer is good, although his accent makes him sort of hard to understand at times. So, if you're going to watch this movie, watch it to see how sexy Gerard Butler is. Also, don't expect the ending to be like the original, because it is completely different.

I can quote the dialogue verbatim. I saw it first about eight years ago on video. I knew the theatrical version was six minutes longer but as I never saw the original I never missed anything, until two hours ago that is. I finally saw the full theatrical version and I'm literally, blown away. It was a new electrifying experience. There is a moment within the first ten minutes of the film in which we have Adrian (Colin Firth) in bed talking, mumbling rather, to himself. It jolted me. I know the film so well that a new scene I've never seen before arriving at a totally unexpected moment threw me for six and yet, it made sense, completely. Adrian is walking a tight rope from the beginning and those few seconds underlines it in the most elegant, chilling, beautiful way. There is more, of course, much more. Colin Firth's performance couldn't be improved but the extra moments he has on the screen not only adds to his perfection but completes the strange and mesmerising journey that the Apartment Zero experience is all about. Hart Bochner hits all the right notes. He teases, he invites, he offers. It is a masterclass in seduction, trying to become what Adrian wants or needs. All the other characters that populate the building are a priceless collection of Hitchcockian, Polanskian delights. I'm sure a Hollywood movie would never allow its supporting players to have so much screen time but, personally, that's one of the many things I love about this film. They all have their moment, for an instant the film is about each one them. They are all the star when the camera is on them. I'm now waiting anxiously for the DVD release. I'm taking for granted that the full theatrical version will be included. I know for a fact that the experience is not for everyone - very few films are - but I, as part of an enormous minority, would like to live the experience in its full length form. Thank you very much ","genre":null},{"date":"11 August 2005","score":"143 out of 159 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a film I've seen more times than any other.
