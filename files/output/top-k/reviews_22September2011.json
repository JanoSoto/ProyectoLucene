[{"date":"22 September 2011","score":"","review":" Rounders. What an incredibly well-rounded movie! Everything about this movie screamed classic and the first I saw it I had never played a poker game in my life. This movie got me to explore the game and learn the intricacies of what was going on in the movie. No wonder why this film is attributed to the poker boom of the early 2000s. It's not just the poker that draws you in; it's how realistic this movie seems as well. John Dahl, the director, creates a fantastic underground poker scene in this 1998 movie. If you were to go to New York looking for a high stakes underground poker game, this is how your life could feel.This movie follows the main character Mike McDermott, an extremely skilled poker player who spouts one of the most famous lines in poker to start the movie. Listen, here's the thing. If you can't spot the sucker in the first half hour at the table, then you ARE the sucker. He is attending law school from the money he makes from poker. It is clear he has been doing this for a while. The film takes off when he tries to win big but loses his entire bankroll on a tough loss to the one of the best antagonists I have ever seen in a movie, Teddy KGB (played by John Malkovitch). Mike a couple months later meets his old high school buddy appropriately named Worm (played by Edward Norton) who just got out of prison. Worm was in jail for taking the fall for Mike on a scam they ran back in high school. Mike has changed considerably since then, Worm has not. Worm tells Mike that he has to pay back thousands of dollars to a loan shark. Mike vouches for him and this is where the movie takes off. They have to make $15,000 in just a few short days.The acting in this movie blows my mind every time I see this film. Edward Norton plays the slimiest and most disgusting human being I have ever witnessed in cinema history. Worm (Norton) always wants to fix the poker games they play and Mike (Damon) wants to win straight up. Norton jumps into this role so amazingly, that at one point in the movie he is getting beat up by the people who he cheated against in a card game and as a viewer I was so angry that I could have thrown a punch as well! His acting along with Matt Damon's impeccable way to play a genius, much like his character in Goodwill Hunting, makes the movie a thrill to watch. Matt Damon's character knows everything there is to know about poker, even enough to take on professionals. Yet, there is still that sense of Matt (Damon) not knowing how to make relationships work which Damon is a master of achieving. John Malkovitch plays an extremely entertaining and eccentric role as Teddy KGB. He is a delight to watch and he will have you imitating his accent after the movie. As for supporting roles, John Turturro, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, and Martin Landau seemed to have the perfect blend of characteristics to mesh with the main characters in the movie.The only lowlight of this movie seemed to be the unrealistic nature of some of the relationships between the characters. Mike seemed to be a smart and highly reliable guy and Worm is exactly the opposite. I am not saying this couldn't happen in real life because it does, but the way Worm goes around and gets into trouble in Mike's name seems kind of ludicrous. If these guys were friends since high school then I would like to believe Worm would care more about Mike than he portrayed in the movie. Another relationship that seemed a little off was Mike and his girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol). She acted the way I would expect her to act in the situations Mike put her in but it almost seemed like she cared more about Mike not playing poker than Mike himself.Rounders certainly had me from the start. There were no dull points, and the movie never really had any slow parts. Every scene had its purpose; there were no meaningless subplots to take away from the main story. Despite some of the odd relationships put in the film, it was entertaining and amazingly thorough even without an understanding of the game of poker. If you decide to learn the game of poker, this movie moves into another category. Classic. This film is in a genre of its own by mixing action-adventure scenes with the suspense of a thriller. It is for all of these great reasons why Rounders gets 9 out of 10 stars. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 September 2011","score":"","review":" Rounders. What an incredibly well-rounded movie!
