I love reading Viewer Comments, depending on the film, before writing my own and please forgive me here; some of them are downright bizarre. Movies are fantasy, even if they want to be factual so treat them as fantasy. I do not think that you should bring out your Bible and begin to thump it because you are there to protect the morals of your kids or as Christians love doing, protecting us, the Great Unwashed Masses, from ourselves. We will succeed in arriving somewhere without the help of the silly churches dotting the land like pimples on the earth's behind. This was a fantasy examination of what is and what might have been. Eastwood and Streep play their roles seamlessly; Eastwood's direction married to Steep's always sensitive acting is superb. I loved Streep's virtually flawless facial expressions mirroring her interior emotions throughout the film. I was not bothered by her accent or how other commentators saw it, her lack of an accent. The film's ending was hard; Francesca had decisions to make, she made them and must spend her remaining years recounting those decisions, as do all of us whether in career, or love or virtually anything in life. It is the old story of the Fork in the Road and the path taken. Yes, that reality is there but the details of this movie are still fantasy and should be seen exactly as that and nothing else.

But this film was never going to be judged on its own merits. It was always going to be compared to the first two Godfather films. And, not surprisingly considering the first two are among the most acclaimed and revered films of all time, Part III doesn't measure up. That doesn't make this a bad film though. Yes it has some notable flaws but there are certainly enough good things here to make this final journey into the world of the Corleone family worthwhile.The most obvious and most often repeated criticism of Part III regards Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone. And the performance is indeed rather terrible. But all the criticism of Sofia Coppola is more than a bit overblown. She was bad but she didn't deserve all the vitriol she received. On a first viewing of the film she certainly sticks out like a sore thumb, especially considering all the quality performers around her. But when you go back and watch the film again you realize that while her character was an important one in the story she's really not on the screen all that much. She's certainly not front and center to the point her presence could possibly sink the whole film. The criticism she received is way out of proportion with her actual impact on the film. And while she has some truly terrible moments there are some times where she's at least passable. The legend of the awful Sofia Coppola Godfather Part III performance has far outstripped reality.Sofia Coppola's awkward performance may get the most attention but it is not the only flaw with the film, certainly not the most important one. The biggest flaws deal with the story which is rather convoluted. So many shadowy figures lurking in the background, so many different strands of the plot which need to be tied together. The first two Godfather films were grand and epic. That sense of grandeur is missing here. The story is big, director Francis Ford Coppola is clearly aiming for epic. But this film falls short of that mark. Where the first two films built momentum all the way through this film is saddled with a story which only moves forward in fits and starts. With so much going on some important characters are never really properly developed. Who exactly is Don Lucchesi anyway and what strings is he pulling in the Vatican? What exactly is Archbishop Gilday's role in all this? Not really sure. Don Altobello, with the Corleone family or against them? And why? By the time some of these questions are answered, and some of them are never really answered satisfactorily, it's too late. The story seems to have gotten away from Francis Ford Coppola a bit and when he tries to bring it all together in the end, as he did so well in the first two films, the payoff isn't nearly as great this time around.Viewed through the prism of the first two films Part III is certainly a bit of a letdown. But rather than bemoan what it isn't, namely one of the greatest movies of all time like its predecessors, you can still enjoy and appreciate this film for what it is. If you can get your head around the story there are a lot of things to like about the film. Al Pacino is terrific as ever as a now beaten-down, worn-out Michael Corleone. Old reliables Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are back for another go although Robert Duvall is sorely missed, his replacement George Hamilton making no real impact at all. There are some good new characters. Andy Garcia does a very good job in portraying Sonny's hotheaded illegitimate son Vincent Mancini, newly welcomed into the Corleone family business. Eli Wallach is excellent as old Don Altobello even if the script doesn't provide us with much insight into the character. Donal Donnelly does very well with the role of the nervous Archbishop Gilday, a man with the weight of the Vatican bearing down on his shoulders. Unfortunately Gilday is another somewhat undeveloped character. Amongst other new characters Don Lucchesi is woefully undeveloped, Joey Zasa is an underwhelming antagonist and Mary Corleone has the aforementioned, if overblown, Sofia Coppola problem. The flaws with this film are plain to see. But the good outweighs the bad. This film was always going to be held to an impossible standard. It falls short of greatness but it still manages to pack quite a punch. Michael Corleone's journey is at an end, the saga is complete. History may deem The Godfather Part III to be a disappointment.

They dumped money into the project to turn ancient history into a boring, sickening, and vile sexploitation porn film. It is pitiful how an important time period was used to sell audiences disgusting filth. On top of that, the movie manipulated some of the finest actors of our time and embarrasses them on screen. I do not tell people to go see or avoid movies because they have a choice of their own that is beyond my grasp. I only tell them what I saw and what I thought of it.As I watched Caligula, I became confused, bored, offended, and disgusted towards the material. All my eyes beheld were fully naked bodies, pointless close-ups of genitalia, acts of oral sex, orgies, hardcore sex scenes, mutilation, self-mutilation, urination, some form of necrophilia, castration, rape, and senseless violence and torture (sometimes sexually). I do not feel proud telling anybody what I saw in Caligula. It is true that the real Caligula committed such senseless acts but I felt most of these sights were completely unnecessary.If that's not sick enough for you, there were actors and actresses who pleasured themselves as they saw people tortured or killed. Was it a way to depict the sadistic atmosphere of Rome? I know there are much classier ways to reflect the horrible society of the Roman Empire. I simply watch Spartacus Blood and Sand. Yes, there was an extreme amount of blood, sex, and brutality but there were also great stories with emotions and feelings that kept the series' heart beating. Spartacus reflected both ugliness and beauty but Caligula could only show me ugliness. Speaking of ugliness, I will share a couple of examples in Caligula. In one scene, Emperor Caligula raped a newly-wed couple in a kitchen as a wedding gift. First, he had intercourse with the virgin bride and then he (be prepared) stuck his fist up the groom's rectum. Why on God's good green earth did I have to see it?! What's even worse is that the movie gave us no emotion out of the travesty, not even an emotional flurry of music to give me a cathartic chill.The other scene was one of the torture sequences. Caligula tortured a guard by slashing him to death and a couple of random girls sexually urinated on his corpse. Seriously, this was garbage. But that didn't stop there. No, the guard's genitals were cut off and fed to dogs. This is referenced in Eli Roth's Hostel Part II but the big difference is that Roth did it to shock and horrify people. Caligula did it just to get some attention because it wanted to be the most controversial movie ever. And they polished a nuclear bomb to reach that target by going with the orgy of the senators' wives. It was a waste of time and utterly disgusting. As I look back at his role of Alex DeLarge, I could see Malcolm McDowell as Caligula but he was in the wrong production at the wrong time. The man himself said he hated the movie. Overall, his performance was satisfying yet it had terrible moments. When McDowell acted paranoid or screamed, I was disappointed how unconvincing he was. Helen Mirren had the role of Caesonia, the wife of Caligula, and she did a decent job but I was devastated to see her wearing a leash around her neck like a subservient dog. She deserved more respect than that. Giancarlo Badessi portrayed the uncle of Caligula, Claudius, and he annoyed me. He made Claudius look like an overweight, idiotic buffoon; according to history, the real Claudius did not have such attributes. It was unfathomable how Peter O'Toole could be involved in Caligula as the Emperor Tiberius and be below-average in the role as well. All O'Toole did was awkwardly pronounce sentences and burst out exclamations as if he had Tourette's syndrome. O'Toole and his co-star John Gielgud claim they never knew hardcore sex scenes were being filmed. How could they not?! I saw O'Toole caressing fully nude girls, kissing their bodies while sitting next to fully nude men in the movie! I suppose he was in denial. There were scraps of the movie I did admire. Some of the dialogue worked well in the movie and I enjoyed some of McDowell's comedic parts. Some important moments of Caligula's reign were covered but not enough to outweigh the ugliness in the rest of the film. The ending was the only scene I liked in the movie even though it is shot and executed sluggishly. The movie needed to end the way it did, no matter how horrible it looked. Caligula is an ugly, boring porn film which aims to exploit history in favor of cheap hardcore sex footage and gross-out shots. If there is any sort of reason to view it, see it to understand how I felt. As I stated before, I only share my thoughts to people and the decision to see a movie lies with them. For those who are brave enough to sit through Caligula, I commend you all for your courage.

Overall, his performance was satisfying yet it had terrible moments. When McDowell acted paranoid or screamed, I was disappointed how unconvincing he was. Helen Mirren had the role of Caesonia, the wife of Caligula, and she did a decent job but I was devastated to see her wearing a leash around her neck like a subservient dog. She deserved more respect than that. Giancarlo Badessi portrayed the uncle of Caligula, Claudius, and he annoyed me. He made Claudius look like an overweight, idiotic buffoon; according to history, the real Claudius did not have such attributes. It was unfathomable how Peter O'Toole could be involved in Caligula as the Emperor Tiberius and be below-average in the role as well. All O'Toole did was awkwardly pronounce sentences and burst out exclamations as if he had Tourette's syndrome. O'Toole and his co-star John Gielgud claim they never knew hardcore sex scenes were being filmed. How could they not?! I saw O'Toole caressing fully nude girls, kissing their bodies while sitting next to fully nude men in the movie! I suppose he was in denial. There were scraps of the movie I did admire. Some of the dialogue worked well in the movie and I enjoyed some of McDowell's comedic parts. Some important moments of Caligula's reign were covered but not enough to outweigh the ugliness in the rest of the film. The ending was the only scene I liked in the movie even though it is shot and executed sluggishly. The movie needed to end the way it did, no matter how horrible it looked. Caligula is an ugly, boring porn film which aims to exploit history in favor of cheap hardcore sex footage and gross-out shots. If there is any sort of reason to view it, see it to understand how I felt. As I stated before, I only share my thoughts to people and the decision to see a movie lies with them. For those who are brave enough to sit through Caligula, I commend you all for your courage. My Rating 2\/10 ","genre":"Drama, History"}]
