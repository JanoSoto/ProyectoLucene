I thought wow what a long name. I found myself quickly engulfed in the cleverly written cold war based plot. This movie sends humor your way in as many scenes as possible. It has all the characters you need to make a great comedy. I particularly liked the role of two characters, Peter Sellers who plays many roles in the film of which one is Dr. Stranglove. This Dr. seems to be of German descent, is in a wheelchair and finds himself unable to keep from hailing the president, who is also cleverly also played by Peter Sellers. At more than one time the President is having a phone conversation with the Russian Czar and by what you hear on our side of the conversation the writers are drastically poking fun at the Russians. I really enjoyed the performance of George C. Scott as Gen. Turgidson, he plays the Commie hating Gen. that never trust the Russians at face value. I found Gen. Turgidson to be incredibly funny.Movie starts at an army base were Gen. Ripper sends out a Plan R command to the in-flight B-52s that carry nuclear weapons. We are not told what plan R is right away. After giving this order Gen. Ripper barricades his army base and gives orders to shoot anyone attempting to get in, even American looking soldiers. Before long we are engulfed in two drastically different views. One one hand we sympathize with the commanders in the war room who are trying to stop a nuclear Holocaust. But on the other hand we find ourselves not wanting the crew of our B-52 to fail their mission. As luck would have it our B-52 looses radio contact and so they proceed with plan R which we have found out, means plan retaliation. We as we were attacked from the commies and we will retaliate with our nukes. On the home front the war room is having quiet the bustle of action the Russian Ambassador is aloud into the war room and Gen. Turgidson has a fit. We get our first glimpse of Dr. Stranglove here. The war room decides to take the base to acquire the codes to cancel plan R. Gen. Ripper fights till the end and eventually shoots himself so the codes are lost. Luckily he wrote them on a piece of paper on his desk before he died. Now the codes are given to contact the other B-52s whole cancel their plans. Our B-52 however is still flying low, Our leader of the plane is Maj Kong, who is a cowboy till the end when he ruff rides a nuke.

As much as he wants to settle down with his longterm sweetheart, he cannot bring himself to say the words. However when she is put into a coma in a car accident and the doctors say there is no hope of recovery he goes off the deep end and decides to volunteer to be frozen in an experiment being carried out by his friend Harry Finley. 53 years later he is woken up in a military storage unit by two young boys who were just messing around. Without a clue what happened to him or what to do, Daniel turns to the two boys for help.It sounds rather corny and obvious and, in a way, I suppose it is but by not ever playing it for laughs or being self-mocking the film creates a tone that means it all works as long as you meet it on its terms. The story is sentimental and slushy and in this way I imagine it will put many viewers off for being this way. I surprised myself by actually liking it though and finding it all rather engaging and sweet. Although I doubt he knows where Lost is going, Abrams does a good job as writer to avoid cliché and mush the best he can. Miner matches this by directing in a controlled manner that holds back on the sweeping music and emotion until he can actually use them.The cast work well with this approach and avoid the film becoming a soapy television movie. Gibson may not have had the best of days recently PR-wise (alleged drunk-driving and alleged anti-Semitic remarks) but here he is charming and reasonably good at the emotion. Of course he could have been better considering that when he awoke after 50 years the loss of his wife would still be fresh in his mind. Curtis is solid enough and deals with the material given her. The child support are better than I expected even if they are a bit cute in the way all Hollywood kids are. Wood works well with Gibson, which I suppose is the important thing.Overall this is a solid and enjoyable romantic film that is a bit slushy and melodramatic. It avoids cliché well enough but you do need to meet it on its terms and not be cynical. Not one for the die-hard action fans but it is a good date movie that is gentle and balanced enough to find a mixed audience without losing touch with the genre.

The story is one giant metaphor represented by Peter Sellers' character's name, Chance. In the early part of the story, where Shirley MacClaine (Eve) asks his name, as he takes a large gulp of liquor - thinking it's water - and she mishears his attempt at saying Chance the Gardener, to be Chauncy Gardiner, if he had succeeded in conveying the answer he intended, he'd have been treated differently. He would probably have been housed in the Rand's servants' wing, and dismissed in a couple of days when his injury healed. The circumstance after leaving his lifelong residence, and ending the day where he encountered Eve's limo and sustained the accident leading to his joining her and Ben (Melvyn Douglas) in their palatial residence, also occurred completely by chance. In the mentioned early scene in the limo, where Eve asks his name, and believing it to be Chauncy Gardiner - even then Chance doesn't in anyway have, or display, the least bit of pretense. Later, at dinner, when Ben asks if he may call him Chauncy, he doesn't pretend it's his name, but simply says, Chauncy's fine. The gist of the film is simple and direct - yet this makes the story more powerful and compelling. Everything - everything - Chance\/Chauncy says is literal, true and unadulterated. Yet everyone takes each comment or statement he makes as a metaphor, idiom or in some other figurative manner. His simple, brief, straight answers are taken as depicting a confident wisdom. In addition, a lot of his conversation is simply a reiteration of what the other person has said, which results in that person admiring him all the more, and (whether consciously or otherwise) feeling that his\/her own wisdom or opinion or correctness has been affirmed. From the outset, we cannot help but root for him, and fear that this man who gains in prominence and becomes so widely quoted, admired and respected, will be found-out to be a simple man who wants nothing more than ACTUALLY to be a GARDENER. The only character who suspects, and then confirms Chance\/Chauncy's true persona, is Richard Dysatt's physician. We also are grateful that he realizes Chance possesses no guile or ulterior motives (and really doesn't have the capacity for either). This movie has a lot, on a number of levels. There are top performances from all involved, from the great Peter Sellers to the other leading personnel (especially Douglas; Dysart; and Jack Warden, as the President), as well as the minor characters and actors.

One could argue that it would be near impossible as those two are undoubtedly some of the best films ever made, period. BUT, in that case, it would have been better if this film was never made. Coppola made a drastic mistake in doing this.There are some pros about this film. Al Pacino gives a mighty performance, arguably his best post-Scarface. Scratchy voice and all, he portrays and aging Michael Corleone with depth, sensitivity and emotion. When he calls out about how he murdered my father's son it is heartbreaking. Also, the final shot of this film is one of the most beautiful ever made. It's like a photograph that shows the aged Michael, the man once of so much power, weak, and finally, dead. It is the perfect ending for the series, capping off the movies as large tragedy they are, in the purist, classical sense. We see a great man go from being noble and brave, to being evil and blinded by ambition, then trying to regain his nobility and innocence, but ultimately succumbing to evil.Here are the problems. Francis Ford Coppola, quite frankly, lost his touch after Apocalypse Now. Gone are all the stunning, moving crane shots, the stark, emotional canvases, and what we are left with is a bunch of cut up close ups, straight outta the late-80's\/early-90's. Each shot is framed around a bunch people, and provides no feeling of grandeur, tragedy or affection that I always found in the first two. Then there's the acting, besides Pacino, everyone seems to overdo it. Especially Andy Garcia, an actor who I respect, who seems to be a caricature of James Caan's character from the first film. Diane Keaton (the only one I wasn't fond of in the first two) is as cold as ever, and even Talia Shire seems to be out of place. The venerable Eli Wallach tries, but he doesn't with the mood of the movie for me. Joe Mantegna is in typical Fat Tony form, over the top stereotypical mobster; he's an insult to mob movies. I won't say anything regarding Sofia Coppola, because I think enough has already been said apart from the fact that her scenes with Garcia make me cringe.

Also, the final shot of this film is one of the most beautiful ever made. It's like a photograph that shows the aged Michael, the man once of so much power, weak, and finally, dead. It is the perfect ending for the series, capping off the movies as large tragedy they are, in the purist, classical sense. We see a great man go from being noble and brave, to being evil and blinded by ambition, then trying to regain his nobility and innocence, but ultimately succumbing to evil.Here are the problems. Francis Ford Coppola, quite frankly, lost his touch after Apocalypse Now. Gone are all the stunning, moving crane shots, the stark, emotional canvases, and what we are left with is a bunch of cut up close ups, straight outta the late-80's\/early-90's. Each shot is framed around a bunch people, and provides no feeling of grandeur, tragedy or affection that I always found in the first two. Then there's the acting, besides Pacino, everyone seems to overdo it. Especially Andy Garcia, an actor who I respect, who seems to be a caricature of James Caan's character from the first film. Diane Keaton (the only one I wasn't fond of in the first two) is as cold as ever, and even Talia Shire seems to be out of place. The venerable Eli Wallach tries, but he doesn't with the mood of the movie for me. Joe Mantegna is in typical Fat Tony form, over the top stereotypical mobster; he's an insult to mob movies. I won't say anything regarding Sofia Coppola, because I think enough has already been said apart from the fact that her scenes with Garcia make me cringe. Speaking of which, the whole 'kissing cousins' thing has to be one of the worst plot ideas I've ever heard. It tarnishes the entire film, which should have focused on the struggles of Michael trying to legitimize his family while retaining the honor of his father. Not this pathetic incestuous relationship and the whole Vatican thing.This movie is worth 7\/10, it is watchable, and it has its good points, but overall, it is very, very disappointing. I may be nitpicking here, but this is the Godfather we're talking about here. As Goethe said, In art the best is good enough.

This is my 400th review on IMDb. Three years or more, 400 films, some good, some REEEALLY bad and I hope everyone enjoys my reviews because I enjoy writing them and I don't plan on stopping. So for each 100 films I have reviews a Superman film being such a huge fan but for 400 I decided on something special...this film easily hits my top ten of all time favorites list so without further adieu...Back To The Future.Did they know they were making something this incredible when they were making it?? I think perhaps they did, that is part of the magic because Director and creator Robert Zemeckis holds nothing back from this flat out eighties classic fantasy adventure. The film is just so incredibly unique taking a cool, completely hip stereo typical eighties teenager and tossing him back into the mid fifties experience and forcing him to save his own existence by making sure his mother and father hook up. The special effects, the utter intense detail that goes into this amazing story line that makes sure everything flows properly, and captures not only 1985 vividly, but 1955 vividly. Zemeckie creates Hill Valley California from scratch and makes it feel like everyone's home town and he makes sure that we see every aspect of it so we can be as stunned and blown away by 1955 Hill Valley just like Marty McFly. This film is just brilliant.Marty McFly, a classic character in the history of film is played by the irrepressible Michael J. Fox in his hey day. Fox (although 24 at the time) was perfect as the 17 year old kid that everybody wanted to be, and everybody wanted to be his friend and for the course of the film you felt like you were right there along with him. This is without a doubt Fox's best role and he has had some good ones but this one takes the cake. He is so smooth and a fast talking, material driven, eighties kid and he's perfect. How can we forget Dr. Emmett Brown?? We can't!! Christopher Lloyd plays the most eccentric and yet brilliant Scientist inventor of the eighties. Doc, as he is known to Marty, is brilliant but almost to the point of insanity. It shows in his personality, his actions and his creations. His I.Q. is obviously off the charts. Despite the age different Doc Brown and Marty have this incredible friendship and Fox and Lloyd's chemistry reflect this strong bond between them. No one could have expected these two would be such a great pairing but they are!! Lea Thompson plays Marty's mother Lorraine Baines McFly. She spends more time playing the bubbly, rebellious teenage Lorraine and she's terrificly believable as both that role and as Marty's mother. Crispin Glover plays whiny, rather weak George McFly, Marty's father. Now I'm not a big fan of Glover and his personal decisions (such as suing the producers of the sequels to this film) had not made me like him any more but he truly created a unique and terrific anti hero in George Mcfly. I will forever associate Back To The Future with the nerdy annoying laugh and his petrified nerdy walk. Thomas F. Wilson is the bully that everyone wanted to see get his in the end Biff Tannen. Wilson is just terrific as a guy that you absolutely despise and yet he still strikes that feeling of dread when he shows up...he's the perfect bully and adversary to Marty AND his father in 1955. They share the same enemy. The cast mesh so well together and the transformations of thirty years between everyone in the cast with the exception of Michael J. Fox is really astounding. I mean sometimes the make up looks a little cheesy but it's really quite amazing to see them. You really feel like you're traveling in time.And isn't that what makes Back To The Future one of the most incredible adventures of all time. You're right there with Marty 100% of the time and you feel like you're going through everything that he is. The story is brilliant and in such a complex film about time travel there is BOUND to be plot holes but Zemeckis does an incredible job and barely making you notice them and wrapping things up so carefully and creating this incredible world around the characters. Back To The Future is not something someone might see, it's something every single person should see because it IS a classic film and always will be. To this day (20 years after the fact) Back To The Future holds up as well now as it did then against ANY big budget special effects film nowadays. It was years ahead of it's time making it the absolute must see. The movie has a kick ass soundtrack featuring a lot of Huey Lewis and The News tracks that became associated with this film (Power of Love--for instance), and it's the absolute quintessential eighties film...the power of wanting material things (Marty's truck, George McFly's book) social status based on appearance...that's the eighties way!! Throw in some what was then cool four letter words (not a lot but enough to make it feel naughty to the youngsters) and you got yourself everything that Back To The Future is. An incredible film that I have probably seen a hundred times and love it equally as much every single time. 10\/10 THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEWS...100 MORE TO GO TILL 500!!

The plot is thin if you are coming to it looking for a well rounded story with a start, middle and end but it does have these themes running through it and it means that it is never tiresome or repetitive. Of course at its heart the real reason we are all here is the great material that the brothers serve up. My favourite and most dominate aspect of the film is Groucho's material. He is so sharp and quick that it is easy to have one laugh after another drawn out of you. The musical numbers are stronger here than in other films &#150; here they are funny and part of the narrative as opposed to other films where you get the feeling that they are playing instruments for the sake of it.Groucho is great value and does well throughout.

Dumont is a good sport and good fun in a role that mostly involves coping with Groucho's barbs. The rest of the cast mainly support the manic humour with Calhern being another example of someone just soaking it up as a good straightman.This is a great film.

However when a drunken binge leads to an assault on some police officers, Danny finds himself in prison where the welcome is less than, well, welcoming. Struggling to fit in and threatened by guards and prisoners alike, Danny accepts the offer from the gambling warden to stage a football match between the prisoners and the officers. However with few willing to stand up with Danny (and against the screws), things look like they will be near impossible.One of a couple of remakes of The Longest Yard, this film goes for a straight remake but with a UK setting. Despite it occasionally having a serious edge to it, this is mostly a film about laddish jokes, banter and sports. It could have had interesting subtexts about corruption, the impact of sport on society or the corrupting nature of power\/authority but instead it just goes for the lowest denominator every chance it gets. In this way it marks out its territory and its target audience and never really aspires to much beyond this. It is a shame really because it is clearly trying serious things but they just come off as clunky and not developed properly. The effect of this is that it regularly knocks the wind out of the fun aspect that only occasionally gets up a good head of steam.The cast do the best they can regardless and, in fairness, they do OK.

From the very moment the picture started, I had goosebumps. Marlon Brando gives an excellent Oscar winning performance, that I can't imagine anyone else playing Don Vito Corleone. Not to mention its Oscar nominated actors in supporting roles, Al Pacino, James Caan (who should have won), and Robert Duvall. The directing is absolutely spellbinding, the cinematography is terrific, costume design is great. To me, there is no better mob movie that explains the troubles of a Italian family in crime. I have many many favorite scenes, especially everyone else's favorite scene when John Marley finds his prized horse's head in his bed. There's that, and when Michael sends his guys to whack Moe Green and others during his baptism. The saddest scene in the film was when Sonny gets murdered, I know he was an ass-hole but he was cool too, it upset me so much I almost couldn't watch it anymore. I think the only scene that grabbed me was the very beginning of the film, when a man asks for justice over his daughter. I don't know why it always got my close attention, maybe it was because it was the very first scene in the movie, but ever since I was hooked on seeing that first scene whenever I would watch it. People often say that the best thing they get out of this film is Al Pacino as Michael, but I sort of disagree. Al Pacino launched his career in this movie, but the key element in this movie is Marlon Brando. This is the best and my favorite performance he has ever given in a movie, mainly because it was the first movie I have ever seen of him.

But here is the needle in the haystack.Nicholson's performance is overacted, uninspired, and adolescent. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Anjelica Huston seems to follow suit! It's almost as if there was a bad-acting virus on the set.However one actor who had apparently been vaccinated was David Morse. This is probably the one and only bright spot in the movie. Morse is fantastic. His portrayal of John Booth is convincing, multi-dimensional, and consistent. It is twice as amazing that Morse was able to pull off such an impressive job when one considers that he had to play off the pitiful Nicholson. Robin Wright did give Morse at least something to work with as her performance was fairly good, although hampered by the story.....which brings us to the worst aspect of the movie--the screenplay. Imagine a story called, The hammer hits the nail, where viewers are forced to watch an ultra-slo-mo of a hammer coming down on a nail, periodically broken up by sporadic, unnecessary banter, and you have this in a nutshell. The story is painfully predictable, and morbidly slow-moving. One walks away saying, That was it? But I already knew that. The actual story should only take about 5 minutes. The rest is filler. And bad filler.The climax of the movie (if one can call it that) is a pathetically unrealistic chase scene where the out-of-shape, 50-something, smoking alcoholic character played by Nicholson out runs the young, muscular and fit Morse over a distance of some 3 miles or so (although it seems like 20 miles to the viewer). Nothing is given away by this description however, since most viewers already know how a movie like this will end.The title of the film, The Crossing Guard is of course irrelevant to all but self-described film experts who have infinite time and desire to conjure up the real meaning of films and teach them to the rest of us. However, it most likely refers to the tragic failure of a talent-guard to catch this script before it made it to production.

Even his own mother despairs at his movements and the embarrassment they caused. Determined to continue on his own path, Scott looks for a new partner but the only one that seems to get what he is trying to do and is happy to lose as a result is the partnerless ugly duckling Fran. Scott gives her a shot and gradually the two start to work well together despite her total lack of confidence. As they prepare for their first contest, the sight fo Scott and Fran together causes consternation on the scene.The opening moments sum up the film really well as Luhrmann takes the uninteresting world of smalltown ballroom dancing contests and paints a mix of romantic drama and spoof. Many of us have local passions in which we will never rise above the local newspapers and this film gently lampoons that type of activity by exaggerating it and its characters while also keeping it engaging and enjoyable. The plot follows a fairly obvious arch but it is the energy and sheer invention that runs through the film that makes it so much better than the plot summary would suggest. The colouring and the feel of the film compliments the slightly exaggerated sense of humour and, as many have said, Luhrmann does a great job of announcing himself on an international scale. It doesn't really have jokes, but the hypersense of delivery makes it feel engagingly fresh and comic.The cast more or less fit into this style of delivery rather than standing out in their own right but everyone is good in their own way. Mercurio isn't the most charismatic of leads and he is a bit bland but he more or less does the job as his character is one of the straighter of the piece. Morice is pretty good alongside him and, although neither is brilliant, they work well together and make for a sympathetic couple. The larger-than-life supporting characters are much better and provide much of the energy the film needs. Hunter, Thomson, Whitford and Otto are among those that turn in reliable performances in this regard.Overall then this is a wonderful debut from Luhrmann. It manages to mock and convince at the same time &#150; exaggerating to produce energy and humour while never letting the audience lose touch with the story or the characters.

Even his own mother despairs at his movements and the embarrassment they caused. Determined to continue on his own path, Scott looks for a new partner but the only one that seems to get what he is trying to do and is happy to lose as a result is the partnerless ugly duckling Fran. Scott gives her a shot and gradually the two start to work well together despite her total lack of confidence. As they prepare for their first contest, the sight fo Scott and Fran together causes consternation on the scene.The opening moments sum up the film really well as Luhrmann takes the uninteresting world of smalltown ballroom dancing contests and paints a mix of romantic drama and spoof. Many of us have local passions in which we will never rise above the local newspapers and this film gently lampoons that type of activity by exaggerating it and its characters while also keeping it engaging and enjoyable. The plot follows a fairly obvious arch but it is the energy and sheer invention that runs through the film that makes it so much better than the plot summary would suggest. The colouring and the feel of the film compliments the slightly exaggerated sense of humour and, as many have said, Luhrmann does a great job of announcing himself on an international scale. It doesn't really have jokes, but the hypersense of delivery makes it feel engagingly fresh and comic.The cast more or less fit into this style of delivery rather than standing out in their own right but everyone is good in their own way. Mercurio isn't the most charismatic of leads and he is a bit bland but he more or less does the job as his character is one of the straighter of the piece. Morice is pretty good alongside him and, although neither is brilliant, they work well together and make for a sympathetic couple. The larger-than-life supporting characters are much better and provide much of the energy the film needs.

Investigations reveal he has a nephew (Longfellow Deeds) who, by default, will inherit the lot. Chuck Cedar and Cecil Anderson set out to be the first to bring Deeds back to New York to get him to sign the company over to them and the board. Deeds is perhaps a bit out of his depth but determined to keep his small town roots and morals even as company execs and media vultures try to take advantage of him.If you are making a feel good film and have a script that relies on you feeling for the little guy then it is probably a bit of a risk to cast Adam Sadler in the lead role considering how he tends to, well, polarise opinion in his audience. Not to put too fine a point on it but I'm not a massive Sadler fan and for me the establishing scenes where he is laid out as a regular nice guy fell flat because he comes over like an annoying and unconvincing person. The point is he has a heart of gold and doesn't go for all that big city business, insincerity and intelligence stuff. As he sees New York his adventure is a collection of scenes with him dispensing small town wisdom, slapping people who step out of line, getting drunk and so on. It is very basic stuff and sadly it says a lot about the audience that the makers were aiming for, or rather what the makers thing of us &#150; they think that we think that good people are just working Joe's who get drunk, smoke, egging cars and so on and look down on society types. As a result of aiming for this low level, the film is as basic as you like and although it is occasionally amusing it is terribly insincere from start to finish. Those who cannot see the narrative arch from about the first two minutes well, I suppose you are the people that the film is aimed at (no offence).I didn't really expect any better from this but I was still quite bothered by how simplistic, insincere and inane the whole thing is. Sadler matches the film by producing all the same characteristics in his performance. The people who love his dumb man-child stuff will love him here but understandably the majority of viewers will find him annoying and grating. He is well supported by all sorts of people who are served by the material in a variety of ways. Turturro is excellent and sneaks his way into stealing every scene he is in. Ryder is basic but appealing. Covert, Gallagher, Harris and Avari all draw the odd laugh but generally are just mugging their way through.Overall this is a very basic comedy that drew maybe two laughs from me and constantly aims for the lowest common denominator in terms of comedy and settles for cloying insincerity in place of a plot. It is dumb stuff that assumes that you and I (the viewers) are dumb too. If you can get past that offence then there sadly isn't a lot of fun or laughter to be had anyway.

It remains the only film I have reviewed for IMDb which I have awarded the minimum mark of 1\/10.I was, therefore, pleasantly surprised by Under Siege. Certainly, it is not a particularly good film, but compared with The Foreigner it looks like Citizen Kane. A group of terrorists take over an American warship, the USS Missouri, hoping to steal its nuclear-tipped missiles, but are thwarted by Casey Ryback, a former Navy SEAL now working as the ship's cook. At first Ryback's only ally is Jordan Tate, a Playboy centrefold (Miss July 1989), who has flown out to the ship for the Captain's birthday celebrations, but he later has the assistance of a group of sailors he manages to rescue.The best acting performance comes from Tommy Lee Jones as the psychopathic leader of the terrorists, a former CIA agent turned rogue killer. Jones's contribution, however, is something of a mixed blessing. While it undoubtedly improves the overall quality of the film to have a gifted actor in a leading role, the contrast with Jones's abilities serves to underline by contrast the weakness of Seagal's performance. Seagal plays Ryback in his normal tight-lipped, laconic style, rarely allowing himself to show any emotions. His martial arts skills are much on display; his acting ones are more elusive. Erika Eleniak (who was herself Playboy's real Miss July 1989) confirms her hard-won rank of Bimbo, First Class, a rank gained during her years as one of the Baywatch girls. The transition from television star to genuine first-rate film star is often a difficult one; like most of her fellow Baywatch beauties Eleniak has an impressively long filmography, but few if any of the entries thereon have made much impression on the critics.One hopes that in real life security on an US warship would be much tighter than shown here; I was surprised both by the ease with which the terrorists took over the ship and by the ease with which Ryback and his allies recaptured it. Jordan seems magically transformed from a frightened young girl to a one who shows a good deal more courage under fire and skill with a weapon than one would expect from a woman with her particular CV. The film, however, is more about entertainment than about realism, like most films in this goodies-against-baddies tough-guy action-adventure genre. Despite (or perhaps because of) its implausible plots, frequently wooden acting and extreme levels of violence, it was a genre that became very popular in the late eighties and nineties, and remains popular today.

Crashing in a forest in a remote part of North America, the inhabitant uses photographs and DNA from hair to take the form of Hayden, who died a year before. Naturally this puts the fear of God into his widow, Jenny Hayden, who has still not yet got over his loss. With his craft lost, the Starman knows he must make it to his rendezvous point within three days of he will die. He forces Jenny to drive him there. Initially she fears him but with time she starts to trust him and help him with his journey.Perhaps most famous for being the film that a studio picked instead of ET, my memory of seeing this film when I was much younger was not good &#150; I found it boring is all I recall but then I was younger so I figured I'd try again. Although I found it better than boring I can understand why I got that impression as a youngster because it is pretty plodding and obvious for the most part. As soon as the Starman takes the form of the grieving Jenny's husband, everyone should know where this is going and, although it is not badly delivered, the film needed to do more than just go through the obvious plot thread &#150; which is sadly just what it does. The development of the relationship is nice enough but there is little depth or originality to it. The alien learning things and being slightly bemused by things very quickly gets old (not helped by the lack of heart or humour in doing it) and there isn't much more beyond that. Carpenter directs well but he can't produce what isn't there in the script.Likewise the cast can only do the obvious and they don't do it that well. Bridges seems to be stuck in a very robotic performance that limits his ability to find depth. I can understand why he does it but it doesn't help the film. This leaves Allen to carry the whole bag and she isn't up to it. She does the obvious but she doesn't convince with her emotions and reactions to the wider story. Smith and Jaeckel are nice distractions from the rather sappy main story as they run around arguing morals but they aren't given enough time and I would have liked them to have more time to develop this side of the story.Overall this is an OK film but one that doesn't do anything special or original. The cast and direction do what they can but they can't get over that the script is pretty obvious and predictable. Those accustomed to television movies and daytime filler will love it but personally I wanted much more than it delivered and found it lacking on many levels.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"4 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is one of the best Steven Seagal movies but not that that is saying much of course.It's a pretty simple action movie, as action movies are supposed to be. It has a simple plot and basically only serves as an excuse to let the Seagal character kill as many villains as possible, preferably with a knife. It however is a better than average movie for a couple of reasons.Most important reason for this are the villains. Not the characters themselves but more the actors that portray them. Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey and Colm Meaney play the main villains. Three awesome actors. Especially Tommy Lee Jones is great, namely toward the ending when all the breaks are off by him. And I never expected to see Gary Busey as a drag queen. That was awesome, as well as unexpected (and completely unnecessary by the way once you really start thinking about it). I however felt that the villains were not enough present in the movie and the movie mainly was a Steven Seagal-flick, which will definitely still mainly pleases his fans of course.The action is good, although it mostly consists out of only shootouts and a couple of explosions. The knife fights were a bit too ridicules in my opinion but I guess Seagal himself enjoyed it more as I did. It didn't exactly made the movie any more credible. The movie itself is quite honestly nothing too spectacular, just an entertaining enough action-flick. The movie its reputation is definitely better than the actual movie itself.The musical score by Gary Chang is surprising good and worth owning and listening to.In the end the movie is nothing more than a Die Hard wannabe set on a ship this time. It still has power and quality on its own but not quite enough to regard this movie as one of the best or most memorable movies out of the genre. The movie is only maybe a little memorable thanks to its three main villains.6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is one of the best Steven Seagal movies but not that that is saying much of course.It's a pretty simple action movie, as action movies are supposed to be.
