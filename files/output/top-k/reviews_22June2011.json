[{"date":"22 June 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Hmm. . .well that was refreshing. I can honestly say that after watching Joe Johnston's October Sky I feel a whole lot better about everything. Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch October Sky, and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. October Sky also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that October Sky is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from &#x96; I know I did.
