[{"date":"20 June 2009","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Lola Rennt is a German thriller about a young girl, Lola, whose boyfriend has lost 100,000 marks. She has 20 minutes to find the money or else he will rob a supermarket. It sounds like a fantastic premise for a thriller, but it is put in the entirely wrong hands.Let me state right now that I never have and never will be a fan of the MTV generation of directors (the only exceptions to date are Ridley Scott and David Fincher). As a result, I just couldn't stand Tom Tykwer's direction. In particular, the endless, long shots of Lola running everywhere become extremely boring.Here is the strangest bit of Lola Rennt for me something goes wrong and the situation does not end happily. Suddenly, the film cuts back to the beginning of Lola's run, and the entire thing repeats itself, but with a twist. I enjoyed the second run far more (mainly because this had the least amount of running in it, and actually delivered a few thrills), but there is positively no logic to this move. It takes away from the film, because the viewer is left wondering WHAT is going on? The question is never answered.When it comes to acting, I couldn't stand Lola (played by Franka Potente). Her sole existence in the film is to run, find money, and scream (in an extremely high-pitched way which hurt my ears). The viewer never gets any background information on Lola or her boyfriend or anyone else for that matter we are left with a film about strangers. The result? No sympathy, no hope for Lola to emerge victorious, no thrills&#x85;The Verdict Currently with 8\/10 stars on IMDb, I am quite surprised at this film's high ranking. It is technically well-done, I guess, but can only be appreciated by those open to the MTV generation of film-making&#x97; which I am not. In the end, Lola Rennt is nothing more than a boring run. A good premise for a thriller, but the direction ruins it.Overall Rating 3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2009","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Lola Rennt is a German thriller about a young girl, Lola, whose boyfriend has lost 100,000 marks.
