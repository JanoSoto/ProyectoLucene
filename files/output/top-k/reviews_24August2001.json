What is it about outlaws that peaks our interest?  What was it about Jesse James that made people love him so much?  Was he really as benevolent as he was made to be in this film?  Was he really as crazy and theological as he was in the Rob Lowe\/Bill Paxton film Frank and Jesse?  I'm not really sure, I would probably have to guess he was somewhere in between.  In American Outlaws Jesse is played rather blandly by Colin Ferrel.  I can honestly say that I wasn't overly interested in Jesse James in this film the way I was in Frank and Jesse.  Rob Lowe had a much more complete interpretation of outlaw Jesse James.  But what may be lacking in the leads is more than made up for in some of the supporting characters, and for that I would say that American Outlaws is almost worth seeing.  Not quite, but if you have nothing better to do with $10.00, go see this film.Gabriel Macht plays Jesse's older brother Frank and Timothy Dalton, of James Bond fame plays Alan Pinkerton, the man responsible for hunting down the James gang.  Macht plays Frank James as the older and much wiser brother.  He calmly solves disputes, writes and plans many of the heists and robberies and helps Jesse court the love of his life.  Yet he is not there to take the spotlight away from his brother or from Cole Younger.  Frank is basically a peacemaker.  I enjoyed Macht's performance and when he was on screen the picture was a lot more interesting.  He adds some needed credibility to a somewhat lame film.  When you have great actresses like Kathy Bates looking disasterous in their small roles, you know you are in trouble.  I don't know if you can attribute all of this to the director, Les Mayfield, but it has to start somewhere.  The actors weren't really allowed to shine and maybe a few more takes should have been filmed before deciding on which one to use.Two other actors stood out as well and one of them was Timothy Dalton.  He seemed a little out of place in this film.  He just looked as though he was one step ahead of everyone else and just seemed to know something that we didn't.  He could make you think that just by a smirk, or a tone of voice or a tip of his black fedora.  He is evil, conniving and yet he has some admiration for the James\/Younger gang.  He can empathize with their situation but his job is to hunt them down and kill them.  I would like to see Dalton in more roles like this, he was fun to watch in this film.  Also intriguing to watch is Will McCormack as Bob Younger.  He is unfamiliar to me but anyone who watches The Sopranos religiously will recognize him from a few episodes.  I thought he was believable in his smaller role as one of the Younger brothers.  At first he comes off as being a little slow, but his character builds towards the end and eventually he turns out to be one of the stronger characters.It's a shame that American Outlaws couldn't build a better script around these three characters because they seemed better than the script they were given.  American Outlaws isn't a bad film, it's not really a great one either but it is worth a look.  If anything, it will make you want to go home and pop in your copy of Tombstone and remember what it is like to have compelling Western characters.6 out of 10--could be better, could be worse.

I will say this  I loved the first one.  Sitting in the theaters, ready for Rush Hour 2 to start, I noticed a lot of Jackie Chan fans.  What a bunch of freaks they were, because when the movie started, they were cheering.  That was what ruined my total experience.  Everytime Jackie did a stunt or made a joke, everyone were clapping their hands and laughing their butts off like it was the Academy Awards.  It didn't help for the fact that my butt was hurting so bad because I was sitting on a broken seat, or the fact that there were ditsy 13 year old girls behind me saying like and totally a lot.  Let me say this It's not that funny!  Well maybe it is, but all the people and situations surrounding me and breaking my nerves were what made it so unfunny.The movie is about Jackie and Chris Tucker, who this time are going after a man who is selling illegal money, and Chris is on vacation.  Sounds funny? It was probably, I just wasn't quite there all the time.  Sometimes I couldn't see the screen because someone that was about 18 years old and 6'2 was sitting right in front of me, and I'm only 5'8 and my butt was killing me!Chris Tucker was just about the only thing good about the film, and that's deffinetly a good thing.
