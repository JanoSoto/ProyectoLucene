[{"date":"21 March 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem for a dream is a pretty much complicated movie.This is so complex you feel like the drugs in the movie might make you dizzy.But its not the drugs but the movie itself.Lot of editing & sound mixing in the movie.Though the plot is good enough.But this could have been much better.The acting of Ellen Burstyn,Jared Leto,Jennifer Connelly & Marlon Wayans is pretty good.But its the way the director presents things that it gets very complicated.Even the ending also i never liked one bit.People take drugs & they land up into a big hole or something.They start dreaming & when the dream is over they remember only the past.The days they were without taking drugs.This is a very much dismal & a sad movie from drug point of you.I never got the hold of this.Forcefully i sat & saw whole of it.The 8.5 rating i think is a bit over-hyped.Another movie like Donnie Darko never was meant to be in Top 250.Though i never liked it,some of you might.Different perceptions.So start dreaming about this movie,then only you might get the hold of this one.
