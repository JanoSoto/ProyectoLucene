[{"date":"14 July 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election is an amusing little trifle about a hard-driving high-school senior determined to be class President and the petty teacher equally determined to stop her. Reese Witherspoon is effectively charming in her character's pushy way of getting what she wants. And I liked the running joke of having her dress virtually in uniform - like a Catholic school girl (ultimately it's the bad girl, the lesbian character who gets shipped off to St. Whozis). I liked Matthew Broderick's performance as the corrupt teacher best. Broderick, now that he's aging and escaping those cheesy boy-toy roles is carving out quite a good niche for himself. Unlike, say, John Cusack, whose acquired age has been subtle and unassuming, who is right for roles that require a quiet manhood, a solemnly reflected life experience, Broderick's age is prepossessing he still has his little boy's face, but with big bags under his eyes like Fred Allen. He's a cartoonish buffoon, The Boy Voted Most Likely To Succeed - But Didn't, wandering through the movie, just doing what he can to get by, then not knowing why. My only knock on the picture, really, is the amount of sexual content. I am no prude (far from it), but with as much sexual gaming as there is in this movie - that was easily disposable, by the way - I wonder what the intended demographic was for this picture. I guess high school kids who slip in under the movie theatre's radar (that's a joke, son). 3 *** out of 4  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 July 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election is an amusing little trifle about a hard-driving high-school senior determined to be class President and the petty teacher equally determined to stop her.
