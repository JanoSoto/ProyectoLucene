Specifically, it gives us a peek into a whole imaginary Universe of supernatural martial arts in an ancient world Giang Hu. It is not an epic movie though for it never gives us a global bird-eye view of it but just enough for the thrilling sensation of peeking through a window into something immensely grand.2) It is set in a magic fairy-tale-like environment reminding us of the warm fuzzy fairy tales most of us have had as kids. This effect is quite subtle and, apparently, very difficult to achieve for overdoing it quickly makes a movie overly specialized. The film does the trick mainly via the flying abilities of the heroes as well as the gorgeous mountain backdrops that look like they were taken straight off old Chinese ink drawings. The closest feature to this film along this dimension might be `The Monkey King' Chinese cartoon.3) Most people appear to enjoy the thoughts of flying (freely like birds but not in airplanes, that is). Children often fantasize about it and adults frequently have it in their night dreams. It is not entirely clear why human beings crave flying (which is accordingly excessively popular in most countries' myths and tales). Regardless of the mechanism, the movie uses it in several ways. First, as pointed out above, the flying abilities emphasize the fairy-taleness of the settings. Second, the brilliant camera-work makes the viewer feel as if they are flying together with the heroes. Third, it takes the viewer through an imaginary quest to some magic hidden areas high in the mountains. In doing so the viewer flies over the trees, above the lakes, waterfalls, etc. Many people seem to have imagined\/dreamt of doing a similar travel at least once in their life.4) The plot uses the `an accident in the middle of normal life' paradigm. In other words, the viewer feels as if they were strolling along with the heroes in their daily routine when suddenly something extraordinary happened and they all got pulled into a whirl of unusual events. This seems to be a more immersive `formula' for it is easier for us to receive magic and supernatural events IF they happen as an exception to the ordinary life RATHER THAN as regular phenomena. The net effect is that we feel more engaged into the supernatural events ourselves. A number of successful movies and stories have used this framework. `Back To The Future', `Terminator - 1,2', `Matrix', `Star Wars' (with respect to Luke's initially `ordinary' life), `Evil Dead - 2,3' are just a few. 5) The movie is philosophically rich. Technically, perhaps, the only direct philosophical scene is the dialog between Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) where Mr. Bai tells her of his failure in reaching the inner eternal peace prescribed by Taoism and other Eastern philosophies. However, this short dialog, together with the rest of the movie subtly supporting his tragedy, probes fundamental philosophical issues more than most of the recent movies have. It does so by addressing one of the deepest cravings of humanity - the inner peace and happiness. Most people's life is a quest for these and yet very few appear successful. Taoism offers a solution further extended into the physical world by Tai Chi and certain martial arts such as Jeet Kune Do. Very crudely speaking, it tells us that the only way to achieve the true happiness is to empty yourself of flittering desires and follow the Tao. The movie questions this postulate through the character of Li Mu Bai who fails to achieve the happiness while supposedly exercising the Taoist approach. This `counter-example', as the movie presents it, can be interpreted in a number of ways. However, it achieves the goal by stirring our imagination and thinking in this area. It makes us want to reflect on our own related experiences on the topics of the utmost interest to most humans. 6) For those interested in romance, the movie seems to offer a subtle love triangle though the ties are delightfully light in their presentation and it is mostly left to the viewer's imagination. That by itself utilizes one of the successful artwork principles summarizable in a bumper-sticker version as `leave some food for the viewer's imagination'. It even makes us want to come back and see the movie again to pick the intricate details that we feel we might have missed on the first viewing.7) For those longing for drama and tragedy, the movie delivers a non-Hollywood ending and some saddening plot developments.8) Finally, a number of people appear to enjoy martial art related sequences. Viewers so inclined will find them in abundance throughout the movie (NB such sequences probably took up most of the filming time...). This, on the other hand, can also be considered as a weakness of the movie since the overly-theatrical appearance of the sequences far-removed from the real life fighting will be obvious to any people in the field. Fortunately, there are fewer of them than the more impressible audience.

Very crudely speaking, it tells us that the only way to achieve the true happiness is to empty yourself of flittering desires and follow the Tao. The movie questions this postulate through the character of Li Mu Bai who fails to achieve the happiness while supposedly exercising the Taoist approach. This `counter-example', as the movie presents it, can be interpreted in a number of ways. However, it achieves the goal by stirring our imagination and thinking in this area. It makes us want to reflect on our own related experiences on the topics of the utmost interest to most humans. 6) For those interested in romance, the movie seems to offer a subtle love triangle though the ties are delightfully light in their presentation and it is mostly left to the viewer's imagination. That by itself utilizes one of the successful artwork principles summarizable in a bumper-sticker version as `leave some food for the viewer's imagination'. It even makes us want to come back and see the movie again to pick the intricate details that we feel we might have missed on the first viewing.7) For those longing for drama and tragedy, the movie delivers a non-Hollywood ending and some saddening plot developments.8) Finally, a number of people appear to enjoy martial art related sequences. Viewers so inclined will find them in abundance throughout the movie (NB such sequences probably took up most of the filming time...). This, on the other hand, can also be considered as a weakness of the movie since the overly-theatrical appearance of the sequences far-removed from the real life fighting will be obvious to any people in the field. Fortunately, there are fewer of them than the more impressible audience.

It is also a marvelous time capsule that should be shown to any literature class transmitting perfectly the soul of pre-war America. I recommend it as a family movie to all.The rest of this review deals with the other reviewers since it has been made clear by what I have read that the IMDB no spoilers rule strangely does not apply to Our Town.  True, the movie was no more Thornton Wilder's play than Yentl was Isaac Bashevis Singer's short story or Educating Rita was Willy Russell's play or Christine was Steven King's book to name just three which were radically changed to accommodate the director's vision of what a movie based on these materials should say to the moviegoing audience.  King has said words to the effect that, (paraphrasing...) My book is my book.  When I sell my rights to the movie-makers to use my book as a platform for a film, it is precisely that which I do.  The movie is not my book any more than How The West Was Won is history. It is merely the participating artists' vision of the source material.  The late James Michener has voiced similar opinions.Admittedly, others like Gore Vidal have felt damaged when three lines were omitted.  They view their text as sacrosanct.  My suggestion to them is to emulate J. D. Salinger.  If you don't want your work changed, do not sell the rights; a movie is not a book or a play; it is a movie. For what it is worth, I had read the play first, was depressed by it, and was personally surprised, delighted, and enraptured by the lyrical ending which, to me, remained more true to the entire spirit of the movie (a la Sam Wood's Goodbye Mr. Chips -- still one of my all-time favorites, also not 100% true to James Hilton's book)than the original bummer ending would have, since the tone had been lightened and lyricized throughout.  But, this is what artistic expression and interpretation is all about.  Different eyes, minds, and hearts see and interpret the same things differently.

This alone makes it one of the greatest animated films ever, at least in a technical aspect.Alot of people complain about the story.  The thing about Akira is that it was originally a 2000 page manga story, which means one second of the film equals about 3 manga pages.  To cram all this information in, the story gets complicated and intricate on many occasions.  Many anime fans are turned off by this because it means they might actually have to watch the film several times or pay close attention.  This isnt Miyazake stuff, this is very complex material, with multifaceted viewpoints and morals, which is common in Katsuhiro Otomo's work. Once one watched it to the point where an understanding is reached, the film can be truly appreciated.  And since the manga has been released stateside, fans can now get a better view on the full story, and can see what Otomo's full vision was intended to be.Frankly, i don't know how Mononoke came to replace this film as greatest anime movie ever.  The undertaking for Akira will never be matched again. The only film to come close, at least in complex moral\/emotional issues was Hideki Anno's End of Evangelion, but that really is a different kind of film that works on a whole different level than Akira does.In my mind, Akira will always be the grandaddy of all Anime films, the pinnacle to be reached, the king that has yet to be toppled off of its hill.

Many anime fans are turned off by this because it means they might actually have to watch the film several times or pay close attention.  This isnt Miyazake stuff, this is very complex material, with multifaceted viewpoints and morals, which is common in Katsuhiro Otomo's work. Once one watched it to the point where an understanding is reached, the film can be truly appreciated.  And since the manga has been released stateside, fans can now get a better view on the full story, and can see what Otomo's full vision was intended to be.Frankly, i don't know how Mononoke came to replace this film as greatest anime movie ever.  The undertaking for Akira will never be matched again. The only film to come close, at least in complex moral\/emotional issues was Hideki Anno's End of Evangelion, but that really is a different kind of film that works on a whole different level than Akira does.In my mind, Akira will always be the grandaddy of all Anime films, the pinnacle to be reached, the king that has yet to be toppled off of its hill.

Also, its re-release is coming down on the heels of Princess Mononoke, so i feel i have to reiterate its importance since many fans have since forgotten it.First off, i'm reviewing the subtitled film.  I feel no film should be appreciated in its dubbed form, for that is not the way the film was intended to be seen.  Subtitles offer accurate dialogue and dramatics, not what the english voice actors and scriptors want you to hear.Akira was one of the greatest undertaking in animation ever. Creating the fluid animation of the film without computer assistance was an achievement alone.  This alone makes it one of the greatest animated films ever, at least in a technical aspect.Alot of people complain about the story.

The retelling of Pearl Harbor is one-sided, one-dimensional and hence utterly false.

Of course, the American side is depicted as heroes and heroines every one...A few examples of this disparity pretty much without exception, every single Japanese character in the film has a grimace, scowl, or look of death on his face; Americans are given all of the 'good' emotions (laughter, happiness, sadness, fear, etc. - but never hatred). Whenever an American dies, we're treated to a display of the humanity of the dying character; whenever a Japanese person dies, we see little if anything.

Almost everything about it reeks of incompetence and even as dumb entertainment, it's still quite insulting.  Only the extremely undemanding sci-fi action fan would enjoy this (or those under the age of 10) and even then they'd probably say it was nothing very good.  Director Roger Christian and John Travolta should just get over it and stop claiming they think it's a genuinely good movie (Now that I've said that, the same goes for George Lucas, who claimed this was a good movie).  So, you have to wonder why my rating for it is above * star.  Well, that's quite plain and simply; Battlefield Earth is unintentionally funny to a high degree.  So was Batman and Robin, but it's to a more absurd effect in this movie since the actors involved actually think it might be pretty good.The story begins in a semi-interesting fashion.  It's the year 3000, and man has long been conquered by the Psychlos, an alien race out to look for gold, and Earth is a prosperous mining site.  What's left of humans reside in small villages, reduced to living like cavemen.  One of them, Jonnie Tyler (Barry Pepper) is dissastisfied with the way he lives, and he leaves his home and mate (Sabine Karsenti) in search of better land.He comes across two hunters, Carlo (Kim Coates) and Rock, and they lead him into the ruins of a city, where they reside for the night in a destroyed mall.  As they're feasting, a Psychlo hunts them down, kills Rock, and takes the other two as prisoners to be used as slaves in the Psychlo center, which is located in Denver.  Simultaneously, the Chief Head of Security, Terl (John Travolta), is upset with the Home Planet because he has been ordered to continue his position on Earth for another 50 cycles.  He discovers a vein of gold in a mountain not far away and schemes to steal it with the help of his partner, Ker (Forest Whitaker), who is mainly to be used as a scapegoat.Terl decides to use man-animals to do the mining and chooses Jonnie because he considers him the most resourceful.  He places Jonnie on a Learning Machine, which gives Jonnie an indefinite amount of knowledge about Psychlo culture, language, and history.  As a result, he and the other humans in captivity connive a plan to rebel and take back the planet.Where do I begin?  Let's start with the actual story.  Dear Lord, I can only imagine if this were a satire or parody of science fiction films in general. I mean, take a look, the movie borrows from Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Star Trek, and The Matrix.  Each element taken from each film is repeated and executed in such an awful manner, I couldn't help but laugh.Take a look at the Psychlos, who are obviously Klingon-rejects.  The first sight of one, especially Travolta and Whitaker, had me giggling uncontrollably.  This was to be Travolta's masterpiece?  You've got to be kidding me.  Of course, I haven't even actually begun to delve into the plot.Now, I've read the first 100 or so pages of the book and I just couldn't get through it so I'm guessing the movie and book are fairly alike. I can't imagine why the novel gets such acclaim.  But, anyway, the Psychlos are such an idiotic alien species it's hard to imagine they could conquer humans, much the less the ability to teleport or transport through space.  They're about 9 feet tall, which makes them pretty ineffective when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.  Sure, they can hit pretty hard, but that's no good when the enemy can shoot them.  Well, sure they have guns, but their aim is worse than any James Bond villain, since the only time they hit their targets is when it's a member of the expendable human cast, which is surprisingly pretty small for a movie called Battlefield Earth (all the fighting's in Denver, by the way).Travolta's Terl is perhaps the biggest idiot of them all.  He actually has a human being put into a learning machine, thus making him accustomed with everything Psychlo (but also teaches him Geometry at no extra cost), and he also leaves him and all his friends alone to mine some gold for two weeks, then never even bothers to question why the gold he gets is perfectly smelt, even though these people never even had the tools capable of doing so.The climax is ludicrous (a couple of moderate spoilers here), and will surely live in major Hollywood infamy just like the conclusion(s) to Jaws the Revenge.  Basically, what we are to understand is that cavemen can learn to fly 1,000 year old harrier jets in less than a week.  Boy, that means I can do the same thing, too!  And since I have  a significantly higher amount of knowledge dealing with technology than these men, I can learn it in all of one day!  And hey, these guys even learned how to fly these ancient machines with the help of a flight simulator that seems to run on a very, very durable battery.The final battle scene is basically a rip-off of the three-way action sequence at the end of Star Wars Phantom Menace, and not done nearly a tenth as well.  Basically, we have some aerial dogfights, some infantry combat, and our hero Jonnie taking on the villain Terl in a one-on-one fight (no lightsabers, just an explosive collar).  The entire sequence, which goes on for approximately fourteen minutes, is badly directed.  Director Christian shoots virtually every scene on a tilted angle and films all the gunfights in slow motion.  Of course, there is that one scene where Jonnie runs down in slow-mo with the Psychlos shooting everywhere, with all the bullets collapsing pillars around him.  An obvious steal from The Matrix, and I laughed hard when I saw it.  How can this not be parody?I have a couple of things to say in the movie's favor.  I did like some of the overhead shots of the Psychlo center and some of the visuals are fairly impressive.  The ruins of Washington, D.C. do have a grand scale to it and the movie's strive to be an epic is somewhat admirable, but all the funnier now that I recall the film's silliness.  I also liked two of the performances, coming from Barry Pepper and Kim Coates, both of whom leave with most of their dignity intact.  Though Coates does end up being the guy who talks in a real archaic manner in the beginning, saying things like I see you have been fortunate in the hunt, I hope you thanked the gods to shouting modern-day phrases by the end of the movie like piece of cake! and Oh, yeah!Who am I kidding?  That brief paragraph is probably all the nice things I have to say.  The other performances are simply terrible.  John Travolta and Forest Whitaker deliver probably their all-time worst performances, acting more like two goof-balls working in an office than the lead Chiefs of the Psychlos on Earth.  Kelly Preston is simply laughable in her 30 second stint.  Sabine Karsenti as Pepper's love interest is pretty bland, and she also looks a bit like Alanis Morrissette.  Oh, yeah, and when Jonnie frees all the slaves and leads the revolt, she says to him, I always knew this was going to be your destiny!  Hmm, anbody care to see what's wrong with that?Battlefield Earth is, simply put, a misguided monstrosity that bombs in almost every conceivable manner.  Like Dune, it takes a perfectly large sum of money and wastes it by churning out a cinematic disaster.  But to Earth's credit, the fact that they seem to just be beggin for the return of MST3K gives me the chance to be slightly more lenient on them, hence the * 1\/2 rating I gave it, not to mention all those unintentional laughs.Travolta still wants to make a sequel, and it looks like Roger Christian is willing, too.  Of course, the idea will probably soon dissipate, since it's unlikely anybody will finance the film or the fact that Barry Pepper would even bother returning.  Though it would be hilarious to think that if a sequel was made without Pepper, the filmmakers would just Speed 2 the whole thing by replacing him with another up-and-coming actor and feature Chrissy acting so upset about the way her previous boyfriend just kept on acting like a wild daredevil.

Well, sure they have guns, but their aim is worse than any James Bond villain, since the only time they hit their targets is when it's a member of the expendable human cast, which is surprisingly pretty small for a movie called Battlefield Earth (all the fighting's in Denver, by the way).Travolta's Terl is perhaps the biggest idiot of them all.  He actually has a human being put into a learning machine, thus making him accustomed with everything Psychlo (but also teaches him Geometry at no extra cost), and he also leaves him and all his friends alone to mine some gold for two weeks, then never even bothers to question why the gold he gets is perfectly smelt, even though these people never even had the tools capable of doing so.The climax is ludicrous (a couple of moderate spoilers here), and will surely live in major Hollywood infamy just like the conclusion(s) to Jaws the Revenge.  Basically, what we are to understand is that cavemen can learn to fly 1,000 year old harrier jets in less than a week.  Boy, that means I can do the same thing, too!  And since I have  a significantly higher amount of knowledge dealing with technology than these men, I can learn it in all of one day!  And hey, these guys even learned how to fly these ancient machines with the help of a flight simulator that seems to run on a very, very durable battery.The final battle scene is basically a rip-off of the three-way action sequence at the end of Star Wars Phantom Menace, and not done nearly a tenth as well.  Basically, we have some aerial dogfights, some infantry combat, and our hero Jonnie taking on the villain Terl in a one-on-one fight (no lightsabers, just an explosive collar).  The entire sequence, which goes on for approximately fourteen minutes, is badly directed.  Director Christian shoots virtually every scene on a tilted angle and films all the gunfights in slow motion.  Of course, there is that one scene where Jonnie runs down in slow-mo with the Psychlos shooting everywhere, with all the bullets collapsing pillars around him.  An obvious steal from The Matrix, and I laughed hard when I saw it.  How can this not be parody?I have a couple of things to say in the movie's favor.  I did like some of the overhead shots of the Psychlo center and some of the visuals are fairly impressive.  The ruins of Washington, D.C. do have a grand scale to it and the movie's strive to be an epic is somewhat admirable, but all the funnier now that I recall the film's silliness.  I also liked two of the performances, coming from Barry Pepper and Kim Coates, both of whom leave with most of their dignity intact.  Though Coates does end up being the guy who talks in a real archaic manner in the beginning, saying things like I see you have been fortunate in the hunt, I hope you thanked the gods to shouting modern-day phrases by the end of the movie like piece of cake! and Oh, yeah!Who am I kidding?  That brief paragraph is probably all the nice things I have to say.  The other performances are simply terrible.  John Travolta and Forest Whitaker deliver probably their all-time worst performances, acting more like two goof-balls working in an office than the lead Chiefs of the Psychlos on Earth.  Kelly Preston is simply laughable in her 30 second stint.  Sabine Karsenti as Pepper's love interest is pretty bland, and she also looks a bit like Alanis Morrissette.  Oh, yeah, and when Jonnie frees all the slaves and leads the revolt, she says to him, I always knew this was going to be your destiny!  Hmm, anbody care to see what's wrong with that?Battlefield Earth is, simply put, a misguided monstrosity that bombs in almost every conceivable manner.  Like Dune, it takes a perfectly large sum of money and wastes it by churning out a cinematic disaster.  But to Earth's credit, the fact that they seem to just be beggin for the return of MST3K gives me the chance to be slightly more lenient on them, hence the * 1\/2 rating I gave it, not to mention all those unintentional laughs.Travolta still wants to make a sequel, and it looks like Roger Christian is willing, too.  Of course, the idea will probably soon dissipate, since it's unlikely anybody will finance the film or the fact that Barry Pepper would even bother returning.  Though it would be hilarious to think that if a sequel was made without Pepper, the filmmakers would just Speed 2 the whole thing by replacing him with another up-and-coming actor and feature Chrissy acting so upset about the way her previous boyfriend just kept on acting like a wild daredevil. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"29 May 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  * 1\/2 out of ****Let's get right down to it; Battlefield Earth is a terrible movie.  Almost everything about it reeks of incompetence and even as dumb entertainment, it's still quite insulting.  Only the extremely undemanding sci-fi action fan would enjoy this (or those under the age of 10) and even then they'd probably say it was nothing very good.  Director Roger Christian and John Travolta should just get over it and stop claiming they think it's a genuinely good movie (Now that I've said that, the same goes for George Lucas, who claimed this was a good movie).  So, you have to wonder why my rating for it is above * star.  Well, that's quite plain and simply; Battlefield Earth is unintentionally funny to a high degree.  So was Batman and Robin, but it's to a more absurd effect in this movie since the actors involved actually think it might be pretty good.The story begins in a semi-interesting fashion.  It's the year 3000, and man has long been conquered by the Psychlos, an alien race out to look for gold, and Earth is a prosperous mining site.  What's left of humans reside in small villages, reduced to living like cavemen.  One of them, Jonnie Tyler (Barry Pepper) is dissastisfied with the way he lives, and he leaves his home and mate (Sabine Karsenti) in search of better land.He comes across two hunters, Carlo (Kim Coates) and Rock, and they lead him into the ruins of a city, where they reside for the night in a destroyed mall.  As they're feasting, a Psychlo hunts them down, kills Rock, and takes the other two as prisoners to be used as slaves in the Psychlo center, which is located in Denver.  Simultaneously, the Chief Head of Security, Terl (John Travolta), is upset with the Home Planet because he has been ordered to continue his position on Earth for another 50 cycles.  He discovers a vein of gold in a mountain not far away and schemes to steal it with the help of his partner, Ker (Forest Whitaker), who is mainly to be used as a scapegoat.Terl decides to use man-animals to do the mining and chooses Jonnie because he considers him the most resourceful.  He places Jonnie on a Learning Machine, which gives Jonnie an indefinite amount of knowledge about Psychlo culture, language, and history.  As a result, he and the other humans in captivity connive a plan to rebel and take back the planet.Where do I begin?  Let's start with the actual story.  Dear Lord, I can only imagine if this were a satire or parody of science fiction films in general. I mean, take a look, the movie borrows from Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Star Trek, and The Matrix.  Each element taken from each film is repeated and executed in such an awful manner, I couldn't help but laugh.Take a look at the Psychlos, who are obviously Klingon-rejects.  The first sight of one, especially Travolta and Whitaker, had me giggling uncontrollably.  This was to be Travolta's masterpiece?  You've got to be kidding me.  Of course, I haven't even actually begun to delve into the plot.Now, I've read the first 100 or so pages of the book and I just couldn't get through it so I'm guessing the movie and book are fairly alike. I can't imagine why the novel gets such acclaim.  But, anyway, the Psychlos are such an idiotic alien species it's hard to imagine they could conquer humans, much the less the ability to teleport or transport through space.  They're about 9 feet tall, which makes them pretty ineffective when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.  Sure, they can hit pretty hard, but that's no good when the enemy can shoot them.
