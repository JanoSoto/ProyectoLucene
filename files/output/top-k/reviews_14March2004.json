It was also  not the last and continues to spawn imitators to this day.  Four years before  Halloween was released, the slasher film Black Christmas came and wentwithout much notice, even though it boasted a more seasoned cast and aslightly better budget.  So why was Halloween more popular than itspredecessor?  I don't know for sure, but I have a few theories.  #1  It has a great,  catchy score going for it.  #2  It didn't take itself quite as dead-serious as Black  Christmas did and provided more than a few laughs, and #3 SEX!!!  Halloweenmay not have been the first slasher film, but, if memory serves me correctly,  Halloween was the first slasher film to suggest a direct correlation between sex  and death.  The point of Halloween seemed to be that young, sexually activegirls die and good, virginal girls live.Michael Meyers, very much like Rhoda in The Bad Seed was just born bad. He is six years old when he commits his first murder, stabbing his sister to death  after she finishes having sex with her boyfriend.  Showing no remorse, or any  other kind of emotion for that matter, Michael is locked away in an insaneasylum to await his 21st birthday, when he will stand trial for his crime.  But on  the eve of the trial, Michael escapes and heads home to Haddonfield. No reason is ever given for Michael's urge to kill, nor is it explained (in the first  movie, anyway) why he chooses the three main targets of the film; Annie, Linda  and Laurie.  Laurie is the good girl, the plain Jane with a brain wallflower played  by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Her two friends, Annie and Linda, are far more popular,  better dressed and more confident, and seem to like having Laurie around ifonly to make themselves look even better.  Both have boyfriends and aresexually active.  Laurie is a little afraid of boys, and this may be what saves her.   She is suspicious of the mysterious man who seems to be following her and her  friends around, but her friends never take the threat seriously.  For them, the  shadowy form of Michael is either a potentially cute guy to flirt with, or a creep  who needs to buzz off.  Linda and Annie never consider the danger.  Lauriedoes, and she is on the alert for the rest of the night.  Annie is the first to die,  after stripping down to her underwear in front of the window and having asexually explicit phone call with her boyfriend, whom she is on her way to pick  up when she is murdered.  Linda drinks beer and has sex with her boyfriend in  the parents bedroom, and even flirts with Michael (thinking he is her boyfriend in  a ghost costume) brazenly baring her breasts.  Her boyfriend is stabbed todeath, she is strangled, and Laurie, left alone across the street, is next. Laurie, shy and afraid of men as she is, cannot seem to fight back at first.  She  runs, screaming for help after finding the dead bodies of her murdered friends.   But when no one will help her, she learns she must help herself if she wants to  live.  Her maternal instincts kick in when the killer invades the house where she  is babysitting two small children.  Laurie screams and whines and doesn'talways use good judgment (and, compared to today's butt-kicking heroines, she  seems pretty wimpy and spineless) but she manages to fend off her attackerlong enough for help (in the form of Dr. Loomis - Donald Pleasance) to arrive.   Laurie has survived, but the boogeyman is not dead.  She will have to bestronger next time.Halloween showed us what happens when young adults engage in premaritalsex, the consumption of alcohol and marijuana and attitudes which suggest that  they are too big for their britches.  But it's also just a good, scary little film to  watch with the lights off, if you're not one to be bothered with pseudo- psychological insights.  Michael Meyers is a dark angel of judgment and death,  making examples of Linda and Annie and pushing Laurie back into her place. Laurie, who chokes and coughs over a joint that Annie has no problem with,now understands; she is not meant to fit in with That Crowd.  She has beensingled out forever, and now sees the danger that awaits her there. Halloween is a classic of the genre and should not be missed by  horror fans.   No excuses you cannot call yourself a true fan of horror until you've seen this  film.  Michael Meyers has indeed achieved immortality, right up there withJason, Freddy, Pinhead and many others.  He will never die, and neither will the  impact this film made on history.

Her scenes with Paul Hendried lighting the two cigarettes is something to cherish by film fans. The chemistry that Bette Davis shared with her leading men was no small accomplishment. She was an actress that knew how to pull the heart strings of the general public. She had such a charisma and power to lose herself in all those strong women she played through the years. The transformation of the plain Charlotte to the smart woman, who embarks on a tour to begin a new life, is something out of a fairy tale, but Ms. Davis pulls it with great panache.The rest of the cast was excellent.

The idea was intriguing enough that I thought the possibilities for comedy and slapstick were endless.  If Pleasantville had been one of those comedy capers churned out by the Disney Studios, I'm sure that is the kind of film I would have seen.  Thanks to direction and writing by Gary Ross, what I got instead was not only film magic of the highest order, but a film with so much more to say, and a film that affected me in ways I never thought possible.  Pleasantville is easily one of the most gratifying film experiences I was privileged to enjoy in the 1990's.Much of the early parts of Pleasantville are as I suspected they would be.  When brother and sister David(Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer(Reese Witherspoon) are sucked into an old black and white sitcom named Pleasantville, courtesy of a TV repairman(Don Knotts), early hilarity ensues as they cope with their situation.  It seems in Pleasantville, everything always has been and always will be Pleasant.  The people of Pleasantville existence remains constant from day to day, never changing, never experiencing sadness, hurt, or anger.  It is a land of Stepford people in a sense, not because the citizens of Pleasantville are robotic, but because they only know the pleasures and joy of the world in which they live.  At first, Bud implores his sister to go along with the program and not to upset the apple cart.  He tells her it could wreck the whole universe of Pleasantville and ruin any chance of them returning to the real world they left behind.  An easy task for the nerdish David(now Bud), who has dealt with the trials and tribulations of the real world by losing himself in the fantasy of the reruns of Pleasantville.  Alas, Jennifer(now Mary Sue), is just the opposite.  In the real world, she is a sluttish boy crazy, cigarette smoking teenager, and the world of Pleasantville is as foreign to her as the clothes she is now forced to wear.  Obviously her resolve to go along with David doesn't last very long.  It is then that, slowly Pleasantville changes from a farce, into a meaningful film experience.As David and Jennifer interact with the people of Pleasantville, the world around them slowly begins to change.  As their classmates and the townspeople learn and experiences things they never dream of, the things around them change from the drabness of black and white to color.  It can be something as small and subtle as a rose blossom or as they find new meaningful changes in their lives some of the inhabitants themselves change from black and white to color.  It is not long before the town is divided into two factions those that have experienced the joys of discovering there is more to life than the every day blandness of living in Pleasantville, and those that wish for Pleasantville to stay exactly as it always has been, never changing, never evolving, forever to remain in the suspended animation of a 50's TV sitcom idea.  There are so many great performances so many well written scenes, so much wonderful cinematography as John Lindley expertly blends together scenes of color and black and white, aided by the most purposeful use of digital effects ever seen in a film.  I could list each acting performance individually be it Maguire or Witherspoon, William H. Macy, or Joan Allan, or Jeff Daniels, but they are all exceptional and there is not enough superlatives to do so.  Add to this a beautifully rendered score by Randy Newman, and you have film perfection.I have viewed Pleasantville a number of times.  With each viewing it holds more fascination for me as I discover little gems one will miss from just having seen it once.  It is one of those films I never tire of watching and for me to run down a list of the wonderful moments encapsulated withing Pleasantville would do nothing more but to spoil those discoveries for yourself.  Much has been written about what Gary Ross may or may not have been trying to say with his film.  For me, Pleasantville says that life is ever changing.  As much as we would like for things always to remain constant, change cannot and will not be held back, nor should it be feared.

Where other films had only touched on the barest suggestion of the link between sex and death, Hellraiser shoves that fact right in your face.Frank Cotton (who starts out the film as the main character) is a soulless man who lives only for life's pleasures. He will go to great lengths to satisfy his lusts, and thinks nothing of who he may be stepping on to get there. He is offered a small, strange puzzle box called The Lament Configuration by a strange man in what looks and sounds to be a Mid Eastern market. The box, he is promised, will open the gates to a world of pleasures that no mortal can possibly imagine. Frank takes the box, but he doesn't understand that the pleasures the box offers are to the demons who live within it. The Cenobites, sadomasochistic creatures who live eternally beyond the gates that the box can open and close, take great pleasure in ensnaring new human victims to toy with, imprisoning them forever in a labyrinth of pain and suffering. Frank disappears, and many months later, his brother and sister-in-law come to live in the abandoned home.The film then switches gears and gives us a new main character Julia. Julia, the wife of Frank Cottons brother Larry, is a cold woman. Beautiful and immaculate, she is icy and distant and seems to derive no pleasure from anything, least of all her husband and his daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty. Julia's only private joy are the memories she has of Frank, with whom she once had an affair. Frank seems to be the only man who was never intimidated by Julia, treating her roughly and breaking down her defenses. Little does Julia know that Frank never left the house; he is upstairs, in the attic, having escaped from the Cenobites and now biding his time until he can return to a world of flesh and blood. When Larry accidentally injures himself and bleeds on the floor of the attic, Frank is brought back, feeding on the fluid and slowly regenerating, growing back bones, muscle and skin. Julia soon discovers the terrible secret in the attic. After her initial shock and disgust, she agrees to help Frank, for whom she still lusts, and begins bringing him men she picks up in bars. She bludgeons them to death and Frank feeds on them, each one helping him in his regeneration.The film then switches points of view once more and Kirsty becomes the main character. Kirsty, who has never liked the pretentious, frigid Julia, becomes suspicious. Her suspicions are soon confirmed when she comes face to face with Uncle Frank and barely escapes his bloody clutches, the Lament Configuration in her hand. She accidentally opens it, and when the demons within, led by the now-famous Pinhead, threaten to take her back with them to their dimension, she makes a deal she will lead them to Frank, and they can have him instead of her. From there on out, it is a countdown; will Kirsty find Frank in time? Can her father be saved from the adulterous couple plotting against him in his own house? Or will it be too late for all of them?This is another sex-equals-death film, but with a slightly updated feel. Julia is Bad; she cheats on her husband and likes her sex rough. Kirsty is Good, but she is no virgin, living with her boyfriend and eagerly engaging in premarital sex. Larry, a dull-as-paste husband who seems to genuinely love his wife but doesn't quite understand how to treat a woman, falls victim to his own blandness. He never sees what's coming because he possesses no imagination, no foresight; he is just the everyday, mundane man mowed under by his own unspectacular existence. Frank is the ultimate Bad; he is a user. He likes sadism, but not when it is turned on him. The Cenobites are the real reason this film was so successful; expressionless zombies in black leather and fetish wear. Led by the majestic Pinhead, they come into our world equipped with chains and hooks and all manner of painful devices, literally ripping their victims apart without batting an eye. They are what Frank wants to be, but Frank is not strong enough. He collapses beneath the weight of his own ego; he wants to think he is a god, but he is only an insect after all.This film received an X rating when it was first released, but seems pretty tame now. The gore effects are only a tad dated, but they're still quite shocking. I think the X rating might have been due more to the films unrelenting sadism than anything else. It's sick and remorseless, but that's not to say it's bad. It's innovative. Nothing like it had been seen up to that time, and it still remains an original. It never imitates; it's all fresh and frighteningly new and should be appreciated for that if nothing else. Followed by one pretty good sequel and a handful of really bad ones, this first installment remains the best. Should be seen at least once.

He collapses beneath the weight of his own ego; he wants to think he is a god, but he is only an insect after all.This film received an X rating when it was first released, but seems pretty tame now. The gore effects are only a tad dated, but they're still quite shocking. I think the X rating might have been due more to the films unrelenting sadism than anything else. It's sick and remorseless, but that's not to say it's bad. It's innovative. Nothing like it had been seen up to that time, and it still remains an original. It never imitates; it's all fresh and frighteningly new and should be appreciated for that if nothing else. Followed by one pretty good sequel and a handful of really bad ones, this first installment remains the best. Should be seen at least once. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"14 March 2004","score":"77 out of 87 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of the sickest and most depraved horror films of its time, and I love every minute of it. Where other films had only touched on the barest suggestion of the link between sex and death, Hellraiser shoves that fact right in your face.Frank Cotton (who starts out the film as the main character) is a soulless man who lives only for life's pleasures. He will go to great lengths to satisfy his lusts, and thinks nothing of who he may be stepping on to get there. He is offered a small, strange puzzle box called The Lament Configuration by a strange man in what looks and sounds to be a Mid Eastern market. The box, he is promised, will open the gates to a world of pleasures that no mortal can possibly imagine. Frank takes the box, but he doesn't understand that the pleasures the box offers are to the demons who live within it. The Cenobites, sadomasochistic creatures who live eternally beyond the gates that the box can open and close, take great pleasure in ensnaring new human victims to toy with, imprisoning them forever in a labyrinth of pain and suffering. Frank disappears, and many months later, his brother and sister-in-law come to live in the abandoned home.The film then switches gears and gives us a new main character Julia. Julia, the wife of Frank Cottons brother Larry, is a cold woman. Beautiful and immaculate, she is icy and distant and seems to derive no pleasure from anything, least of all her husband and his daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty. Julia's only private joy are the memories she has of Frank, with whom she once had an affair. Frank seems to be the only man who was never intimidated by Julia, treating her roughly and breaking down her defenses. Little does Julia know that Frank never left the house; he is upstairs, in the attic, having escaped from the Cenobites and now biding his time until he can return to a world of flesh and blood. When Larry accidentally injures himself and bleeds on the floor of the attic, Frank is brought back, feeding on the fluid and slowly regenerating, growing back bones, muscle and skin. Julia soon discovers the terrible secret in the attic. After her initial shock and disgust, she agrees to help Frank, for whom she still lusts, and begins bringing him men she picks up in bars. She bludgeons them to death and Frank feeds on them, each one helping him in his regeneration.The film then switches points of view once more and Kirsty becomes the main character. Kirsty, who has never liked the pretentious, frigid Julia, becomes suspicious. Her suspicions are soon confirmed when she comes face to face with Uncle Frank and barely escapes his bloody clutches, the Lament Configuration in her hand. She accidentally opens it, and when the demons within, led by the now-famous Pinhead, threaten to take her back with them to their dimension, she makes a deal she will lead them to Frank, and they can have him instead of her. From there on out, it is a countdown; will Kirsty find Frank in time? Can her father be saved from the adulterous couple plotting against him in his own house? Or will it be too late for all of them?This is another sex-equals-death film, but with a slightly updated feel. Julia is Bad; she cheats on her husband and likes her sex rough. Kirsty is Good, but she is no virgin, living with her boyfriend and eagerly engaging in premarital sex. Larry, a dull-as-paste husband who seems to genuinely love his wife but doesn't quite understand how to treat a woman, falls victim to his own blandness. He never sees what's coming because he possesses no imagination, no foresight; he is just the everyday, mundane man mowed under by his own unspectacular existence. Frank is the ultimate Bad; he is a user. He likes sadism, but not when it is turned on him. The Cenobites are the real reason this film was so successful; expressionless zombies in black leather and fetish wear. Led by the majestic Pinhead, they come into our world equipped with chains and hooks and all manner of painful devices, literally ripping their victims apart without batting an eye. They are what Frank wants to be, but Frank is not strong enough.

I am one happy hombre.

I concur. Breathless could be seen as an expansion of his minor role as Diane Keaton's dangerous pretty-boy in Looking for Mr. Goodbar -- transposed from wintery Chicago to sultry L.A.I won't analyze this film. It doesn't hold up under criticism, and certainly there is plenty to dislike, starting with the relentlessly sociopathic behavior of its protagonist. Rather, in the spirit of the film's love-almost-conquers-all theme, here's just a partial list of what I love about Breathless1. Kaprisky in her see-through swimsuit. Rowrrrr! The rest of her wardrobe is pretty damn sexy, too. (The jury's still out on Gere's blue 'soot.')2. The kiss at the diving board. It has to be one of the best in cinema history. Kaprisky is a goner after that.3. Gere's line I think maybe I was rolling dice when I should have been rolling you. Cheesy, sure, but look at her face when he says it.4. The shower scene, together. Kaprisky running hot and cold. Jesse, you're crazy. ... So what? ... It's OK. I like it.5. Gere turning female heads wherever he goes, as he exudes his studly scent.6. Los Angeles as The Place to Be.

McBride and veteran lensman Richard Kline do a superb job of capturing its heat, light (L.A. sunsets put a glow over the whole city), and diversity -- from the downtown hotels and office towers, to the industrial sections, to the Hollywood hills, to upscale West L.A., to the beach communities (where we see what must be every mural in L.A.).7.

In what other movie will you see a dude dancing and singing to his woman while the cops have their guns drawn on him?Breathless is Gere at his best. Maybe Kaprisky, too, for whatever that's worth.

It's aim - to wipe out the virus on earth - man.When Curtis was asked recently if there were any films she regretted making, Virus was top of her list and she named it with almost no hesitation as a `piece of sh*t'!  With this glowing recommendation I decided to watch it for myself (who says I'm not open to advice!).  I expected this to be rubbish but fun - I didn't realise that it would be as laughably bad as it was. The plot is lifted from many other sci-fi films and put together in a messy mix of unoriginal ideas.  If you can watch this film and not recognise at least 5 other films then you have likely not seen any other films of the genre - or you are a dumb son of a b*tch!  The ship idea is Deep Rising, the robots look like the Borg or Terminator even the final scene at the end is right out of Event Horizon.  It is all a bit of a mess - although lack of originality is not that big an issue if it is fun - this is not.The poor effects are annoying for the most part.  Of course they are not bad effects but for $70million I was surprised how corny and silly the robots looked.  I got the impression that they were just copied rather than being well designed.  The worst moment was the lead robot - an incredibly sophisticated technology, using a keyboard to interact with the ship's computer.  Sorry? Run that past me again this massively advanced technology that is connected to everything and is busy making little robots but still uses a keyboard!?  Likewise most of the robots just look clunky and unimaginative - the effects are OK but they just are so badly designed that it doesn't matter how much they cost.The script is bad all the way; although some footballs fans may get a kick out of Sutherland telling the robot `Everton is the superior being'!  The screams come thick and you can guess how long is left by how many characters are left alive on screen - the usual slasher fare.  Reflecting the bad script, pretty much every single actor in the film gives a bad performance. Curtis just runs round screaming and is as bad in it as she says she is - credit to her for being honest!  Sutherland, however, is completely off his t*ts!  He clearly has decided to see how far he can push his performance before his director spots that he is taking the p*ss - and it looks like the director never spotted it!  The worst thing about him is that fact that his accent changes with nearly every scene - Irish, Scottish, Eastern European - was he trying to make a list?  An even more hilarious accent is that of Pacula who starts the film speaking broken English and 40 minutes later is fluent and has an American accent - the fact that nobody even got her to do ADR after the fact shows just how little love was put into this film. Billy Baldwin is poor but that's pretty much par for the course with him.  The only actor that I enjoyed was Augustus - but his character spins out of control as well.Overall this is a piece of junk, but it will do you for a Saturday night if you are smoking or drinking - you really need to be off your head to appreciate this film.

Let me set the record straight TCM2 is a BAD movie, period. But Why? Why is it such a bad movie if its original creator, Tobe Hooper, was behind the cameras again??? It's hard for me to say how bad this movie is, since I like Tobe Hooper, LOVE the original TCM and am a gore hound, fangoria-reading freak myself. But the facts are there and they can't be denied. It's tough to beat the visceral aggression of the original; when I was young and saw TCM, I almost thought that it was really a picture based on a true account (now I know it was loosely based on the Ed Gein case). There is very little actual gore per sé on the original, but the visuals, sounds and convincing acting made it the classic it is...in other words, I actually believed what was going on. In TCM2, Mr.Hooper tried to make a horror comedy, but failed miserably. The dark and deviant humor of the original is NOWHERE to be found this time around. Now it's just dumb humor. Not even make up guru Tom Savini, with his extreme make up fx tricks could save this turkey. The acting is beyond redemption. Even Dennis Hopper looks silly as the hero, looking to avenge some of the first TCM characters. And the stretch character (this sequel's equivalent of Marylin Burns) is just plain unbelievable (it's NOT a compliment). Her acting is not that bad when she is not being chased by leather face, but once she is on the run, her screams and her gestures look totally fake, as if she were in some SCARY MOVIE episode. What's more sad is that, TCM2 actually starts out good; the outlook of the movie was interesting for the 1st 40 minutes. Unfortunately, after those 40 minutes, it all goes downhill with stupid situations and not believable acting. Granted, there's more gore on this one than on the 1st one; Leatherface's first victim gets his head sawed off in half in a very gruesome Savini effect. But even with this, the movie doesn't work. What worked on the 1st one is that you BELIEVED tha characters and the situations were, in some way, believable. Remember the psycho guy in the first one? The one that gets run over by a truck at the end? Well, the guy's ALIVE in TCM2!!!Albeit, with a metal plate as part of his skull. How come he SURVIVED getting run over by a Mack Truck?!?!? The Grandpa guy looks better 13 years later! He must've taken some sort of rejuvenating potion or something! And the ending is just plain atrocious. Get this down TCM2 does not scare, does not make you sick and does not make you laugh. It's a movie that could have been developed into something really sick and frightening, but it didn't. It seems the big budget of this sequel was completely worthless. It seems Tobe Hooper tried to make a black Horror Comedy, in the vein of EVIL DEAD or even RE-ANIMATOR, but failed miserably. Watch this turkey ONLY if you're a Tom Savini fan or want to know how bad a sequel can be. 3* out of 10*.
