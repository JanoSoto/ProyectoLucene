Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there's no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject). Still the photography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever. This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well. And it succeeds. Billy Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune. Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own. Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy. His romantic bravado in the freezing water saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.Most of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom. Evil, decadent rich people. Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.) Cliché followed cliché.But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life. It was strange to see her in the early scenes. She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her. But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.Since the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they're boarding, a guy says, We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world. And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony On Picasso He won't amount to a thing. Trust me. And Freud, who is he?Is he a passenger?My sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the savage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe. Duh. In real life those guys don't celebrate until the gold is in the hand. Cameron's style is to flatter the audience, make them think they're smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent. Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money as she vigorously tightens Rose's confining corset.All right. Why did the Academy vote this best picture? Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves.

Slowly however, its importance and effect on people began to deteriorate, with more and more people finding that it got people's attention the way best never would.  The ultimate blow to its relevance, of course, was Y2K.  It was as if everyone felt that they needed to wrap the past thousand years up with an opinion of their own and so, everybody made their respective lists, declaring the greatest this and the greatest that, never thinking about the consequences of their actions.  And because of this reckless abandon, a perfectly good word paid the price of overexposure.In this new millennium, there have been quite a few good things.  But nothing that can measure up to director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest effort, Magnolia.  I dare anyone to show me something with as much vigor and life in it as Mr. Anderson's sweeping tale of nine people in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, the mistakes they've made, and the measures it will take for them to wise up.Much like the details of this film, the reasons people like Magnolia have been vague from the very beginning.  There's so much to absorb, so much for one to take in, that it's easier to simply call it a masterpiece than it is to explain why it's a masterpiece.  I think the reason people are floored by this film is because of its crescendo.  The subtle crescendo that begins to build so effortlessly with an opening monologue dealing with coincidence, and does not reach its end until after a particularly epic sequence that shall go unrevealed to those who don't like having surprises ruined for them.It's a crescendo that is carried out by a very precise balance.  Aimee Mann's harmonious songs bring the film a unifying voice much the way Simon and Garfunkel did on The Graduate.  Jon Brion's pacing score lets the plot blossom effectively, adding just the right amount of urgency to the flowing plot as is necessary.  Dylan Tichenor's succinct editing cuts us off from each character's unfolding tragedy just when he ought to, even if we don't want him to.  And of course, the wonderful performances from the cast,(including Melora Walters and John C. Reilly as perhaps the most anomalous couple in movie history) gives everyone the dramatic foundation on which to lay their creative bricks.All of these factors are woven in together by P.T. Anderson to tell an absolutely paramount story of what happens when parents aren't nice to their children.

There's so much to absorb, so much for one to take in, that it's easier to simply call it a masterpiece than it is to explain why it's a masterpiece.  I think the reason people are floored by this film is because of its crescendo.  The subtle crescendo that begins to build so effortlessly with an opening monologue dealing with coincidence, and does not reach its end until after a particularly epic sequence that shall go unrevealed to those who don't like having surprises ruined for them.It's a crescendo that is carried out by a very precise balance.  Aimee Mann's harmonious songs bring the film a unifying voice much the way Simon and Garfunkel did on The Graduate.  Jon Brion's pacing score lets the plot blossom effectively, adding just the right amount of urgency to the flowing plot as is necessary.

And of course, the wonderful performances from the cast,(including Melora Walters and John C.

I'm not accusing P T Anderson of fraud, his movie is a totally different movie. I am just merely pointing out that these films have more in common than their length and huge cast. Short Cuts is excellent filmmaking and in my opinion much better than Magnolia. It's definitely lighter and the three hours doesn't ever really drag because each story is fun and leads into the next story.

After seeing it again a few weeks ago, it has not only lost non-of its appeal, but it rewards occasional, repeated viewings. I also realize that its credentials in terms of acting, script, direction, photography are impeccable, but unlike many films that the critics rave about, these are matched by its entertainment value. Connery and Caine play two ex-British army sergeants who attempt to become kings of a small, unknown Asian country, but are eventually betrayed by their own greed and convey a strong sense of vanity to human endeavor as a whole. Yet these weighty themes are perfectly treated by Huston and Hill's script that makes the audience like and admire these two men, in spite of their deep immoralities. Their relationship is comic, but is not just a case of one-liner swapping, but a believable and ultimately moving bond that is enhanced but the perfect casting of Connery and Caine. The result is one the most memorable male screen partnerships ever. Huston as director keeps things moving along at an enjoyable pace and his camera work and visuals create a beautiful and epic scope to the story. In the end film succeeds on every conceivable level as entertainment, as a comedy, as an epic and as a tragic fable.

However, everything in the year that i've seen (and i've seen heavy weight ones, such as the end of the affair and american beauty)paled in comparison to the experience i had with magnolia, both during and after the movie. It is the kind of movie that is personal; you have to relate to the characters and their dilemmas to love the movie with a passion. Otherwise, it's a waste of time, or so i've heard (though i came out of the theatre puzzling how anyone could HATE this movie). With a movie this grand, it is hard to avoid itsy bitsy holes (EVERY movie has flaws if viewed at certain angles) that are stretched unnecessarily large by those who either may not understand the movie EMOTIONALLY and think they're way too smart to succumb to the most ambitious movie of '99, or simply don't care due to personal irrelevance. I think anyone who's into classic psychology, or is interested in the human's mind and its conflicts would really appreciate the movie. The movie brings in many elements of psychical conflicts, ie. denial (the game show host), conflicts between parents and child (Tom's part is brilliantly sketched, and realistic too). There are many layers and a lot of them is surprisingly subtle considering the scale of the movie (ie. Why is Tom a sex guru whose motto is to seduce and destroy woman? there are many takes on that, one of which is he takes on his father's role as a vicious womanizer, may be to justify his father's act, may be to try to pretend that he was connected to his father in his actions so he could tell himself that he was not really abandoned by his father). Then there are also regrets, and guilt, and that forgiveness will not always be granted in life, etc. The most emotionally involving movie of '99. Kudos to Anderson for daring to make magnolia big and bold without lacking substance. p.s. the frogs have biblical reference, and in case anyone who's not aware of it, frog rain actually happened. As one knows, strong storms could pick up a lot of relatively heavy objects and dispose them elsewhere. If anyone would like to find out more about this, you can contact me. p.p.s. for X-files fans, frog rain should be no big deal.  Chris Carter had already used it in one of his episodes.
