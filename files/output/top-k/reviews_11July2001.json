It could be argued that as 18 year olds we were not exactly the target audience, but I had been led to believe that this picture had universal appeal like the excellent Toy Story, and I really could'nt see any of this.I think the major problem with this film is its attempt to be satirical of fairy-tales when it's own narrative is so flimsy and predictable. Whereas some amount of predictability should be expected, Shrek sticks like glue to its pre-defined genre expectations on more than one level. The setting of the story in a land of castles, talking animals, dragons etc is OK, but some other details I really had a problem with. The princess for example is all sweet and pretty and wholesome and then she burps. I got the feeling the audience were meant to laugh or maybe be surprised at this but how many movies\/ TV shows have you seen where the woman shows some girl power and acts all crude\/kicks male butt or whatever. I would either like to see this sort of charecter made impossible weak and pathetic or maybe a psychotic serial killer type, just burping does'nt cut it anymore. I don't know if the people who made Shrek thought they were being wildly original or not, but to me everything in this movie seemed to be stolen from somewhere else, and not in a satirical way either. The other characters are predictable too, the donkey (Eddie Murphy) is annoying, and Shrek (Myers) is slow and boring. Myers also does the Worst Scottish Accent Ever which also slips every couple of scenes. The best role in the film is the evil guy (Lithgow), for once the voiceover is of good quality and suited to the charecter. Its a pity he does'nt get more screen time because the gingerbread man torturing scene was the best in the film, itself far too short though. This is typical of the script's tendency to skip from one gag to the next without trying to take the joke futher or refer back to it to increase comic effect. The story itself is too frail and boring to make up for the cascade of weak, underdeveloped jokes. I had pretty high hopes for this movie, as i'm a big fan of Myers, unfortunately all the best jokes were in the trailer and if you've seen the trailer, you'll know thats not a good thing.

I went to this movie for one reason - it got an A average by the 10 reviewers in Entertainment Weekly who rate movies. I'm now convinced, having been burned on American Beauty, Traffic and Thin Red Line, that critics LOVE these utterly worthless excuses for entertainment because they are (drum roll) utterly worthless excuses for entertainment (UWEFE). By that I mean, the average critic has seen 10 billion movies. The average excellent movie that entertains most of us (say Castaway or Finding Forrester or Gladiator) is simply some form of rehash that the critic has seen a thousand times. So, when some UWEFE comes out, they love it because it is different. Not good, but from their uppity perspective Thank God it is different. And, they superimpose their relief on the rest of us with some idiotic critique justifying it.Here is why I nearly hated this movie1) The book was highly superior, and I not only didn't read it, but don't even know if one was ever written!2) All movies have an obligation to lay out the physical rules - if they are different than the known universe - within which they will operate. There was NEVER one single reference made in any way that the players were not human. We were simply led to believe that they were trained by the greatest master(s) in the world. But, I'm here to tell you something. SPOILER ALERT I don't care if they were trained by JESUS 24\/7 for 100 years, they wouldn't be able to fly and walk on water! At least not if they were human. That was so ludicrous that nearly everyone around me was snickering with embarrassment for paying to watch it. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)3) I HATE SUBTITLES! Now, in fairness, I could have (should have) known going in, but I didn't. The only worthwhile subtitle movie I ever saw as Das Boot many years ago. I am going to a movie to be entertained - not to have to be fearful of looking away for even a second. I do not like to have to go back and forth between the two. Period. It sucks. I hate it. And, I would NEVER do it intentionally. Big negative. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)4) Here are the movie names of the players (just skim to save time). Li Mu Bai, Shu Lien, Jiao Long Yu (Jen), Xiao Hu Luo (Lo), Sir Te, Jade Fox, Bo, Madam Yu, Tsai, Auntie Wu, De Lu, Gou Jun Pei, Gou Jun Sinung, Mi Biao, Fung Machete Chang, Monk Jing. Now, here is the problem. We not only have to remember their names coming at us one after another (when we have no points of reference), but we also have to remember just as many ping pong, ying yang, hop sing places. And, believe me, they don't make it easy on us. I don't go to movies to have to spend half my time trying to remember which Moo Goo Guy Pan is trying to carve up what Chow Mein - if you know what I mean. If it was Bob, Ted, Carol and Alice in Philadelphia and Baltimore, hey, I've got the reference points. No need for wasted brain cells. Ironically, one of the lines in the movie was Who could remember all these long names. (Minus 1.5 points.)5) WAY TOO LONG. IF a movie is good, then 2 hours plus is ok. If it is bad, then it better be 140 or less or it gets a time deduction! (Minus 1\/2 point.)Some aspects of acting, cinematography and fighting were good to very good. Some weren't. Some of the fighting scenes were too long and too ridiculous. However, there were enough positives in these areas to outweigh the negatives, so a net wash.The bottom line is this. I possibly could have given this movie of 7 or 8 if it weren't foreign. Too many problems associated with it - not the least of which was culture.

Perhaps it deserves best foreign film, but best film????!!!! Give me a break! Simply because there is a category for best foreign film, logically (a seriously missing ingredient nowadays) MUST imply that the Oscars are American. This is as far from an American film as it is possible to be! Now, you can call me whatever you want.

And, they superimpose their relief on the rest of us with some idiotic critique justifying it.Here is why I nearly hated this movie1) The book was highly superior, and I not only didn't read it, but don't even know if one was ever written!2) All movies have an obligation to lay out the physical rules - if they are different than the known universe - within which they will operate. There was NEVER one single reference made in any way that the players were not human. We were simply led to believe that they were trained by the greatest master(s) in the world. But, I'm here to tell you something. SPOILER ALERT I don't care if they were trained by JESUS 24\/7 for 100 years, they wouldn't be able to fly and walk on water! At least not if they were human. That was so ludicrous that nearly everyone around me was snickering with embarrassment for paying to watch it. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)3) I HATE SUBTITLES! Now, in fairness, I could have (should have) known going in, but I didn't. The only worthwhile subtitle movie I ever saw as Das Boot many years ago. I am going to a movie to be entertained - not to have to be fearful of looking away for even a second. I do not like to have to go back and forth between the two. Period. It sucks. I hate it. And, I would NEVER do it intentionally. Big negative. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)4) Here are the movie names of the players (just skim to save time). Li Mu Bai, Shu Lien, Jiao Long Yu (Jen), Xiao Hu Luo (Lo), Sir Te, Jade Fox, Bo, Madam Yu, Tsai, Auntie Wu, De Lu, Gou Jun Pei, Gou Jun Sinung, Mi Biao, Fung Machete Chang, Monk Jing. Now, here is the problem. We not only have to remember their names coming at us one after another (when we have no points of reference), but we also have to remember just as many ping pong, ying yang, hop sing places. And, believe me, they don't make it easy on us. I don't go to movies to have to spend half my time trying to remember which Moo Goo Guy Pan is trying to carve up what Chow Mein - if you know what I mean. If it was Bob, Ted, Carol and Alice in Philadelphia and Baltimore, hey, I've got the reference points. No need for wasted brain cells. Ironically, one of the lines in the movie was Who could remember all these long names. (Minus 1.5 points.)5) WAY TOO LONG. IF a movie is good, then 2 hours plus is ok. If it is bad, then it better be 140 or less or it gets a time deduction! (Minus 1\/2 point.)Some aspects of acting, cinematography and fighting were good to very good. Some weren't. Some of the fighting scenes were too long and too ridiculous. However, there were enough positives in these areas to outweigh the negatives, so a net wash.The bottom line is this. I possibly could have given this movie of 7 or 8 if it weren't foreign. Too many problems associated with it - not the least of which was culture. Frankly, beyond all my specific criticisms, I just didn't get it. What the heck is jumping off the cliff all about? And, who the heck cares? And, what on earth does the name Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon have to do with anything? And, who the heck cares?But, back to the foreign issue. Perhaps it deserves best foreign film, but best film????!!!! Give me a break! Simply because there is a category for best foreign film, logically (a seriously missing ingredient nowadays) MUST imply that the Oscars are American. This is as far from an American film as it is possible to be! Now, you can call me whatever you want. But, here are the facts. 1) I rate it a 5! 2) I am an AMERICAN! 3) I went to the movie in the heart of AMERICA! 4) I paid AMERICAN dollars! Conclusion I expect to be entertained as an American!! As far as I know, it may be the greatest Chinese movie ever made. But, then the French like Jerry Lewis and the Japanese like Godzilla too. So, if you think you think like me, then be forewarned. This is one film to avoid!

The film is too imbued with action\/sci-fi cliches, and it borrows heavily from Aliens. The antagonist is particularly weak. They give him a reason for his actions, but I never felt it. That explanation felt more like an excuse that the writers gave him. The main character, Aki, is decently well developed, as well as Dr. Sid and Grey.

The humans look a lot like humans. You can even see the veins on the back of Aki's hand. Unfortunately, the human characters' expressions are nil. They almost don't exist. Only one character ever smiles, and the animators' inability to make the character do this convincingly provides the screenwriters a good excuse to make all the characters dire and depressed. These computer animated characters just cannot express emotion in their faces. I am not sure that they ever will. Anyhow, that has to be the next big step in computer animation. Gestures also have a penchant for being choppy and stiff and, much like the realistic video game computer animation that has been produced in the last couple of years, heads bob unnaturally while speaking.

This is a perfect example of a widespread misunderstanding of the quality of the film. American Beauty is not a satire of the typical American family, as I've often heard it called. Nor is it a childish comedy on the level with Road Trip or American Pie, as I've also been shocked to hear it compared to. It is a film about America's obsession with superficial beauty and, perhaps even more, the complications and problems that come as a result of trying too hard to conform to the norms of modern society &#150; associating happiness with financial success and whatnot.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is one of these people who has gotten the supposed cushy office job, he lives in a nice house in a nice neighborhood, has a beautiful and wealthy wife, and appears to be an all-around successful man. When we see closer into his life, however, we see that even though everything looks stable from the outside, his entire life is meaningless and falling apart. His wife does not respect him, she cheats on him, and their sex life is non-existent, his daughter is embarrassed by him, he realizes that he has a pointless job at which he is wasting his life away, and he knows that if he doesn't do something about all of this, he'll die with a healthy bank account and an empty soul.Lester decides to throw away all of the meaningless crap that he has accumulated in his life and have fun. He quits his office job, which he hates, and gets a job at a fast food restaurant, which he surprisingly enjoys, he smokes pot with the neighbor's son, and he fantasizes about his daughter's friend, curiously named Angela. Is any of this wrong? Clearly, there is some debate about whether or not a 40-year-old man can, in good conscience, fantasize about a high school girl, more than any other of the questionable occurrences in the film. Personally, I think that this moral diversion comes as a result of his poor choices earlier in life which led to his current unhappiness and deviating thoughts. This is just another point that the movie is trying to get across. This is a guy who tried for his whole life to be socially and financially accepted, and look at how miserable and pathetic he is. You can complain all you want about this curious relationship, but keep in mind that at the end of the film, he gets a grip on himself and realizes what he is doing.Clearly, the film revolves around Lester's struggles with himself and his life, but there are several other characters that are not as central but also play significant roles in the film. Lester's neighbor is an ex-marine experiencing anger management problems and difficulty with his sexual orientation, and this man's son Ricky is a strangely observant kid who lives in a difficult household but maintains a clear view of the important thingsin life. Lester's daughter can't stand her family and is struggling with an attraction to Ricky that she initially doesn't understand and doesn't particularly like, and her friend Angela is the blonde cheerleader type who wants nothing more than to be accepted and respected, and she seeks these things through her huge efforts to be sexually attractive.This is a complicated character structure, and it is topped off by the striking character development that takes place in every single character in the movie by the end, and this is really one of the film's strongest points. In American Beauty, we don't see the life of a person as it is changed and affected by the world around him or her, we see the lives of a whole group of people as they interact with each other and change while following the rules set for them by the society that they grew up in. This makes the film much more effective and the message much clearer.(spoilers) Clearly, this is something of a worst-case scenario, but nothing in the film is impossible. Everyone (at least those of us in America, I suppose) is capable of following the rules of society too closely and ending up miserable like Lester Burnham and his family and friends and neighbors, so watch out. Even Lester's terrible ending is not necessarily tragic. He knew when he quit his job and started working at a fast food restaurant, along with all of his other seemingly reckless behaviors, that he was endangering his future, but he was enjoying himself. He was feeling better than he had in years and years, and that mattered - as it should to all of us, to an extent - more than anything else. The only person left unhappy was the neighbor, who killed Lester because he still doesn't understand himself and is ashamed about something that he has discovered. Each character in the film represents a different lesson that can be learned by everyone. They're not all working together to deliver one big message, they're all giving something of their own, adding to the richness and superiority of the film as a whole.

Curry is sinister and charming at the same time, and you kind of like the guy even though he is kinda evil. Which brings up another point. It's always a bad sign in a movie when the villains are more appealing than the heroes. Shouldn't we be rooting for the good guys? Why do they give us pixies that we hate so much, then make the villain a badass?If this film had had a better story it could have been great. I'd watch it again just to see the brilliant imagery. Ridley Scott made Blade Runner, a film in which the visuals were more prominent than the story. But what made that film great was that, even though the story was secondary, it was still interesting and it still supported the film. In Legend the story sucks, so the visuals are all alone.

The special effects are absolutely amazing.  I couldn't help feel that I was watching a piece of cinematic history.  Soon, movies won't even need actors.  You watch; they'll completely replace them with CGI people and fake computer voices.  But, despite that the movie looks beautiful and the action is great, the other points of the movie are weak.  Normally, I can see a weak movie and still love it, but Final Fantasy is flat out, ummm, flat.  First off, I want to explain an idea I had.  This is a Japanese movie.  Just because the cast is American does not make it American.  I know that it was made in Hawaii and everything, but this movie really reminded me of Japanese Animation, or Anime.  Why?  Well, the first thing about it is there is a mass of stuff.  Yea, you heard me.  One of the aliens is just a mass of stuff.  Remember Akira?  Next, the ending really reminded me of Anime.  I don't know why, but it did.  Next, the movie combines elements of science fiction with spirits, ghosts and other supernatural stuff.  I have seen several Japanese cartoon\/movies like this.Okay, I hate Japanese animation because I think it's perverted, unnecessarily gory, and flat out weak.  But that's just my opinion.  Final Fantasy is not Anime, really.  It isn't original, but it isn't Anime either.Okay, there IS a problem with the special effects.  The backgrounds, the objects, the camera motions, and the costumes all look photorealistic.  But, as good as the people look, they are not photorealistic.  Some people are, however.  Dr. Sid is amazing and looks completely real.  But other people just look a little off.  Also, the voices don't match the lips right.

Many people got mad at AI for blending fantasy with science fiction.  But, Final Fantasy does that too well.  Technically, Final Fantasy is just that, fantasy, but it tries to act like it is science fiction which it flat out is not.Overall, I kind of liked the movie.  It has stupid jokes, dumb dialog, stupid characters, a flat out boring and weak plot, and most of all awkwardness.  The movie comes off as weird to me.  I am not a weird movie person.  But, the special effects are BRILLIANT, despite some other problems.  General Hien's leather trench coat is AMAZING.  I did like some of the characters.  I found that Hien (James Woods) was the most complex and interesting.  I did notice how Alec Baldwin's character, Captain Grey, looks too much like Ben Aflack to be a coincidence.  I did enjoy it, but the weak plot and characters are very apparent.  Most of the plot is a little too `out there' for my tastes, and I'm a guy who loves science fiction.  But I did have a good time.Now, does this classify as a game-to-movie movie?  I do not think so.  First of all, all of the Final Fantasy games have nothing to do with each other (that I know of).  They all take place in different times, on different planets, with different characters.  So, this movie, as you can guess, has nothing to do with the games because it isn't a game.

It's just a given. Brendan Fraser plays the part of a painfully geeky guy that gets no respect at the office and has a lonely life because he is so hopelessly nerdy, until one day when he shows up uninvited to the brewery to hang out with his work buddies and runs into the tremendously sexy Devil. She offers to grant him seven wishes (it just seems like a good number) in exchange for his useless little soul. And of course, there is a substantial romantic element to the story, which is universal for movies like this. Anytime you have a total dork like Elliott Richards (Fraser) in a movie, there is ALWAYS a girl that doesn't give him the time of day but with whom he works magic during the film.And now the nonsense begins.Elliott obviously starts off with all of the clichés &#150; I want to be rich, powerful, married to Allison (the girl that doesn't ever notice him), yada yada yada. Being granted by the devious Fallen Angel, of course, all of Elliott's wishes seem great at first but then soon go horribly wrong, which leads to the dumbest thing about the whole film. After returning from each wish (by dialing `666' into a pager that the devil gave him and that has 9 other useless numbers on it), he regroups, comes up with a tremendously over-compensated wish, and then tries again, only to have everything go wrong again.

SO when I finaly rented the movie out, about 2 weeks after that, the years of waiting had come, I popped open the box slid in the movie, pressed play AND...it got stuck in our VCR. Apparently they must've gotten it second hand, and it was about 6 years old. So then we took our VCR in for them to fix, since it was their film's fault. Lots of things happened, and they ended up forgetting to fix it or something like that. So about another 2 weeks went by, and I forget if they paid for a new VCR for us, but whatsoever, we had to get a new VCR because the other one was unfixable. After that I waited for them to get a new copy in, rented it out. I did the same thing as before, and it got stuck. NO OTHER MOVIE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE..ONLY PART 3 TWICE IN A ROW. This time, i was able to pry the movie out, and took it back, explained, again....and they said the film must've been so dirty inside it just got stuck when it started running. After that we tried different video stores, I was now desperate to see this movie. We finaly found another store with it, and this time the movie worked(GASP!). The beginning of the movie was great, but once he was in 1885...All I can say is this film is ok, but it does not live up to it's predecessors. I'll give it 8 out of 10, in the way of a good movie, but in the way of a sequel...no... a CONCLUSION yet..only 6 out of 10 stars. If you disagree with me, all I can say is you must not of enjoyed BTTF part 1 and 2. Because those, my friends are classic storytelling, at it's very best.

It amazes me how far we have come from Tron. Heck in the relatively short amount of time between this and Shrek, it still is quite amazing. The eye at the beginning really looked like an eye. the desolate landscape looked more realistic than any thing in Titan A. E.  But stunning visuals do not make a great movie. Every character in this movie, from the big bear of a black man with a heart of gold to the crazy scientist was cookie cutter from top to bottom.  James Woods did better voice over work in the clerks animated series and so did Alec Baldwin. still if you don't overly analyze this its entertaining enough. Kids will love it, and adults will tolerate it. rating 7 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 July 2001","score":"","review":"  I just got finished watching this movie 2 1\/2 hours ago and I have to admit that the visuals on this movie were great.

Unfortunately I was expecting a wee bit too much. I didn't like the first Mummy, so hoped this Sequel would better it - and it did, C.G.I wise! But the story is so lame, boring and cliche-ridden one must have all brain cells surgically removed (or maybe the whole brain!), or try not to think (and confuse oneself) about the events of the first movie.WARNING! MUMMIFIED SPOILERS!The plot revolves around our two main characters, she being the reincarnation of an Egyptian pharoah's daughter and he being the Saviour of the world (say what??).  This is pretty hard to grasp unless you suspend all disbelief. Question How come Imhotep (the Mummy guy) doesn't recognize her in the first movie??There is so much action scenes they become boringly tedious and the sound (which was cranked up to max in my theater) was absolutely hideous. To hear stuff scream (and there is a LOT of stuff screaming in this flick) at 200 decibels is rather pain-inducing. The anubis army charging over the sand dunes in their thousands is too much like the droid armies in Star Wars T.P.M. We also borrow ideas from Indiana Jones, but this doesn't 'make it', because the overuse of fake C.G.I is SO obviously fake.Hollywood End Acts are becoming mandatory these days.  We have the just-escaped-by-the-skin-of-the-teeth-from-certain-death scene. Not once, but several times!  We are even subjected to the good-guy-dies-but-is-brought-back-to-life cliche. Oh puhleeeeeze!!!! No more brain numbing cliches! But wait - there's more.Dear Hollywood Audiences DO have IQ's above sea level.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with adding a story to truck-loads of C.G.I effects. HONESTLY!!!
