Armed with a $100,000,000 budget and a very mainstream, action-oriented picture - something he had only ever ventured upon with Batman more than a decade prior - he just couldn't get a grip on any aspect of the feature.

Leading a revolt against the apes, he fights for the rights of humanity - becoming a Jesus Christ figure for all the other humans...a savior. The ending throws in an illogical and pointless twist that is just there for the sake of shocking people.

The film opens with three women arriving at Frankie's former manager's office after his death, trying to claim his estate, all claiming to be the legal widow of Lyman and it is during the trial to determine which of these ladies is Lyman's legal widow where Frankie's story unfolds. As with all movie biographies, you never know how much you're watching is based on fact and what has been enhanced or diluted for dramatic effect. In this screenplay, Frankie is a charismatic young singer, who apparently had no problem charming women out of their clothes and their money, the latter of which apparently went to support his drug habit. Frankie's drug use is somewhat glossed over and the screenplay tends to concentrate more on Frankie's manipulative ways with these three women and how he, at one time or another, managed to convince all three of them that there were the only women in the world. Baby-faced Larenz Tate plays Frankie with a sincerity and sexiness that possibly oversells Frankie's real womanizing, but he manages to keep Frankie likable despite some of the slimy things he does. The three women in Frankie's life are well played by Halle Berry, Viveca A. Fox, and Lela Rochon, with Fox a standout in probably the best performance of her career. The musical sequences are troublesome...Tate works hard at lip-syncing authentically, but I never bought the lip-syncing in the film...all of the musical sequences in the film come off sounding canned. Still, Tate and the ladies commit to their roles and do make the movie worth watching. I don't know how accurate the film is as a biography of Frankie Lyman, but it is a very entertaining film that will effortlessly hold interest.

Good concept though. They should remake the movie, and just try to do a better job I think. As far as the plot and stuff goes, and the messages of the movie, it was great, it just needs to be remade, updated, and made more 'real'.Some people apparently seem to think this stuff in the movie couldn't happen, but I hear many prominent military folks say it could, and there really isn't anything wrong with being prepared. A great movie for gun enthusiasts. If you ever had doubts about gun control, you may want to see this. It does the 2nd amendment credit.

A lot of fictitious characters have been added for no apparent reason. The evil and racist policeman (Della Pesca) who prosecutes Carter even since he was a 6 years old child is one of the most silly and useless (if not detrimental) characters I ever saw in a based on a true story movie. The three good Canadian Samaritans literally come from nowhere and the script should give us some ideas about them. Apparently, they succeed, as amateur detectives\/lawyers, where dozens of others had failed, just because they are guided by peace love and unity. The scene in the isolation cell-block, where three different Hurricanes deal one with each other to symbolize the different sides of the character's personality is a mere clichè and, frankly, the similar scene involving Gollum in the Ring's saga had a more realistic touch (enough said, I guess). What remains, in the end an outstanding performance of Denzel Washington, whose personal involvement in the project can be clearly perceived in his acting. Not enough to me, unfortunately. For a boxe&prison movie, one could find a lot more intensity and truth in Walter Hill's Undisputed.
