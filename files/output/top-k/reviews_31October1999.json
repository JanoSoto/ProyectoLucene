Horror movies have never appealed to me much, and I find most of them rather boring.  There are a few horror movies which I do think are excellent, for instance Poltergeist, The Exorcist, and Silence of the Lambs.  In general, however, the appeal of the horror genre is a puzzle to me.With this in mind, I rented Scream with an open mind.  I knew nothing about the movie itself, except that it had gathered good reviews.  I wanted to be scared and entertained.  As it turned out, neither wish came true.Scream is a movie ABOUT movies and the people who watch them. Specifically, Scream is a movie about horror movies and the people who watch horror movies.  I didn't know this beforehand, although it became clear soon itself.  A killer is on the loose, and Neve Campbell appears to be the primary target.  Of course, this isn't what the movie is all about.  The plot is merely a vehicle for the main characters, who all seem to be extremely knowledgeable horror movie fans.  Throughout the film, they endlessly discuss and remark about horror movies, making references to famous films and well-known devices in the horror genre.The satire didn't work for me.  I'm sure this has something to do with the fact I'm not a horror fan.  Or perhaps the satire worked too well.  Within minutes of the first scene, I was certain I was watching a movie within a movie.  When the credits never rolled and the lights never rose on a sea of teenage moviegoers, I realized this was satire.  I sulked and hoped for the best.Unfortunately, even the humor which I understood well seemed heavy-handed and spoon-fed.  Then again, some of the cliches and devices of the horror genre are so glaringly obvious that it might be difficult to satirize them at all, without appearing heavy-handed in the process.The main characters painstakingly point out all the mistakes which the characters in horror movies typically make.  Then, they go on and make the same mistakes themselves.  I suppose this is in keeping in line with the rest of the satire, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining story. When Neve Campbell undresses for her boyfriend, she fails to reveal her top to the camera, and this exception only serves to highlight the rule of how closely the main characters mimic the characters they see.  After all, as is pointed out, there's always a *** shot.Many people describe this as a scary movie.  To be honest, I've been more frightened at the thought of an upcoming topology midterm than I was frightened by this movie.  It was anything but scary.  In order for a movie to be scary, anticipation must be built up.  As Hitchcock said, (modulo a slight paraphrase), Terror is achieved by anticipation of the event, NOT the event itself.  Scream is all event and no anticipation.  There's nothing scary about watching teenagers get chased around and hacked to bits.This is just my opinion, of course.  You should take into account my lack of interest and knowledge in the horror genre in general.  If you're a great horror fan, and you know a lot about horror movies, you may very well like this movie.  Myself, I'm not a horror fan, and I found it quite boring and tedious.  If you're interested in a movie ABOUT the movies, I would recommend The Player, which was far more clever.  If you're interested in being scared out of your wits, watch the original Dutch version of The Vanishing.

The only bad thing I found were some dialogues, that were made for us to laugh but were not appropriated for the moment. But for the rest, all was perfect. Special Effects were so great, I loved them. But I am not a Star Wars fan because of the special effects only, I love the story of the Star Wars Saga. The costumes of Queen Amidala were so beautiful (the movie will win an Oscar for Costume Design for sure!). I liked Jar Jar Binks, I didn't found him a bad character, or a stupid guy or anything bad. And he's form of speaking was cool. Ohh, and the music performance was perfect. I loved it a lot. Dues of the Fates and the Augie's Great Municipal Band were perfect scores. John Williams is the best, he's the King of music scoring. (He deserves the next Oscar for Best Song!) Well, STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE is a great movie, a STAR WARS movie. I really liked it and I enjoyed it a lot. I cried when Anakin went with Qui-Gon and left his mommy, and when Qui-Gon died. Also at the beginning and at the ending. I shall recommend this movie to anyone who loves good movies. I give a 9 out of 10 to the movie. And... May the Force be with us.

I won't bother summarizing because it wouldn't even begin to do the film justice. All I can say is that I was so mesmerized by the concept and the performances that the film could have been 45 hours of John Malkovich brushing his teeth and I still would have been weeping uncontrollably. If you want to indulge your fascinations and get lost in a wild creative ride SEE THIS MOVIE. I only wish I had thought of the idea first, but I probably would have come up with something much less interesting like Being Bob Saget. No offense I think I saw every episode of Full House. Anyway this movie is certainly a must see and will captivate your imagination well after you've left the theatre. If nothing at all it's a blast to sit through.

The movie explores this strange phenomenon. Most scenes in this film are dark and shadowy with the camera moving stealthily through doorways, stairways, cellars and attics.  I was on the edge of my seat most of the time not knowing what to expect next but knowing full well that there was something threatening in the shadows.  Several times I leapt in my seat which says a lot for the development of the spooky atmosphere and fine direction.  At first the story is rather confusing because not everything is revealed in the beginning.  It's a case of mental gymnastics as we sort out the clues concerning the various characters.  Bruce Willis is great and his scenes with the young boy hold our attention as we delve into the various possibilities until finally the truth is revealed.  In the opening scenes with the psychopathic intruder we experience our first shock but there are more to follow.  The psychopath shouts too much thus blurring his speech which makes it difficult to comprehend his words.  I enjoyed the argument with the school-teacher in the room which was once a court-house and the locked in the attic scene which scared everybody including the audience. To sum upit was well acted,well directed, and sets exactly right . \tIt has great entertainment value but like most stories about the supernatural not to be taken too seriously.

It was more tense than scary.
