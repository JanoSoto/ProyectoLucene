It could even be the fight scene that repeats the same sequence to save money hoping that no one notices. There are a million and ten things that are wrong with this film, for starters it's a B film, its plot line is very sketchy, overstretched and has that many plot holes that a hovercraft couldn't move over it. All this being said I loved it, I thought it was one of the best films I had ever watched and indeed still do. Now no doubt you are thinking but surely he just said it was crap, why should he like it, it sounds shoddy even for a B movie? well you're right it is shoddy even for a B movie but the bottom line is its Highlander, and I am a die-hard fan of highlander. Now again I know what you're thinking, highlander one was pretty good and highlander three with a wizard dude trapped in a cave for thousands of years made more sense and was better than Endgame so why endgame out of all the highlanders? Well with endgame it was a film made specifically for fans, not for mainstream, just for people who knew the highlander world in and out and that if it was to be well received they would have to bring in Christopher Lambert. His voice is really hoarse and has an unusual twang, sounds great even though his Scottish isn't that good and his English weird. But then Lambert starred in many of the Highlanders (those worth mentioning at any rate and some that aren't) so why Endgame? Well, you get a real feel with Highlander Endgame that it is what it was supposed to be, a massive build up of two superpowers that will fight and one will win. Whether the winner is the last immortal is irrelevant, he will be that powerful that no other immortal can beat him (until the next film). Also, the films choreography, though clearly staged in many parts was light-years ahead of the earlier films, even Lambert (whose greatest downfall was poor sword work) managed to pull off a few fancy looking moves. But out of all the Highlander films I have watched Endgame related back to the original film and original structure while at the same time melding the series better than any others. No immortals from another planet like in Highlander II (and completely ruining the Highlanders), No magic unlike in Highlander three (though that was pretty cool) and it managed to combat the low budget better than Highlander the Quickening and had special affects better than any of the others. Again I hear what you're saying, just because it is not dated and has a slightly more fluent storyline than the other highlander movies does not make it worthy of recognition. Well I'm afraid it does, and there will always be a highlander that does for one reason, Highlander was a part of my childhood, it is in some of my earliest memories, it inspired my imagination and is probably the main cause for my love of sword fights and the supernatural. So in conclusion Highlander Endgame is cheesy, poorly constructed, massively exploited being stretched out for maximum profit, and partially homo erotic with Jacob uttering those immortal words to Conner what's the matter, don't you want to be inside me? but having watched highlander before I was old enough to see the pitfalls and bad choreography I had a love for it installed which was strong enough to endure despite its shoddiness. I love you highlander and I always will.

I have been interested in the elephant man for a while now (ever since an acquaintance of mine started painting several art pieces on him) but never really knew much about him other than the physical deformity. This movie is very nicely done and really makes you feel for John. It is very sad that he is treated the way that he is and you really root for him to make it in normal society. It is great to see him finally make it to the theater in his nice suit. The movie transitions from the positive theater experience to the horror of the public humiliation quite quickly, but it is a necessary one. It really helped to solidify our feelings for John.The way that he died was really great as well. He had been longing to be normal and had been looking at the photo of a person sleeping on their back for so long, that it was very beautiful that he finally felt normal enough in his last living moments.I have always hated David Lynch and when I found out that he directed this movie I became very worried, but I must say that he did a very good job. My only minor complaint was how many useless transitional shots he used. I get that they help to set the mood, but every one was a bit too long and he seemed to throw one in every few minutes. Things like pictures of elephants, or people working in a factory. Again, it is just a minor complaint and did not take anything away from the film for me, but I think they should have been minimized a bit.I must say that I was a bit disappointed to find out that a large part of this film is not historically accurate.

I have always said that I don't mind with movies if they are not the most historically accurate pieces of footage ever produced, but sometimes I feel like they should be pretty close.

The Cable Guy was an admirable attempt on Carrey's part to try something different that didn't quite come off because it was just the same old shtick in a whole new movie. The Truman Show was a much more successful attempt to flex Carrey's wings as an actor.After a frosty reception greeted The Cable Guy, Jim Carrey returned to what he knew best in Liar Liar. Liar Liar is a film with an interesting premise. A man who lies for a living can only tell the truth. Played with a wider scope of imagination, Liar Liar could have been something akin to Groundhog Day. A single premise put through a rigorous, intensive experiment that scaled greater and greater heights. Or a cruelly hysterical black comedy if made by the Coen Brothers. But in Tom Shadyac's hands, instead it just becomes a one gag vehicle for Jim Carrey's manic mugging.I've never been a fan of Tom Shadyac. His films either collapse into silliness like Ace Ventura, or sink into soft-headed sludge like Patch Adams and Bruce Almighty. The one exception on his resume is the delightful remake of The Nutty Professor. The one film he's ever made where he pulled everything together into a successful package. A film as funny as it is sweet.But Liar Liar sees Shadyac return to his usual weaknesses. The problem I have with the film is it never really knows what to do with its idea. Even at a slim 85 minutes, Liar Liar's one and only joke is stretched. And that's to see Jim Carrey acting like a one-man loony bin. Not for the first (or last) time.Jim Carrey's given some pretty whacked out performances in his day. But the one he gives in Liar Liar almost makes them seem like minimalism. After his son makes a birthday wish that he can only be truthful for a whole day, it springboards Carrey sky high. There are some who no doubt derive amusement from watching him go completely off his head. But I just found all of the shouting and the yelling and the wailing so wearying.He really throws himself into the role with a total reckless abandon. In fact that's what he does a lot of the time. Throwing himself around. Some scenes in the film are just awful. And they go on at embarrassing length. Like when he's holding a blue Biro, and tries to say its red and he can't no matter how much he wants to. But even worse then that is the scene in a men's room when he trashes the place to get out of the courtroom. It all makes you wonder what lunatic asylum Jim Carrey escaped from.The main problem with Liar Liar is that Jim Carrey isn't really the right actor for the role. Since the theme of the film is a dishonest, inattentive father seeing the error of his ways, then what it needed was someone who can play greedy and sarcastic, and then equally downplay it to meet his redemption. Someone like Bill Murray.But because this is Jim Carrey, all we get instead is him yelling the house down from start to finish. That's all he ever seems to do. Whether it be the slick lawyer lying through his teeth. The lawyer forced to tell the truth. Or the changed man who wants to fix things with his son. There's no sense of a man changing into a better one. Just an obnoxious man that seems to know no limits how far over the top he can go. Its an annoying, one-note performance.Because Tom Shadyac refuses to rein in Carrey's excesses, Liar Liar just gets more tedious as it goes on. Even before we're halfway through, the film has become like gristle in between your teeth that you can't dislodge no matter what. And the film arrives at a ridiculous ending. Something that involves Carrey using a stair escalator at an airport to stop his ex-wife and son leaving on a plane. The fact that they get back together is stupidly contrived. And it seemingly just casts aside her relationship with a good man in a ludicrous, cavalier manner.Liar Liar may have been a sizable box-office success, but I just found it irritating to the max. In every way. The comedy. The way Tom Shadyac tries to tack on a false moral at the end. But even worse is watching a potentially good idea wasted on such a lame vehicle. A missed opportunity that could have been so much more.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"13 January 2010","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Jim Carrey has made a career out of rubber faced antics and slapstick gymnastics since becoming a star with Ace Ventura Pet Detective. The Cable Guy was an admirable attempt on Carrey's part to try something different that didn't quite come off because it was just the same old shtick in a whole new movie. The Truman Show was a much more successful attempt to flex Carrey's wings as an actor.After a frosty reception greeted The Cable Guy, Jim Carrey returned to what he knew best in Liar Liar. Liar Liar is a film with an interesting premise. A man who lies for a living can only tell the truth. Played with a wider scope of imagination, Liar Liar could have been something akin to Groundhog Day. A single premise put through a rigorous, intensive experiment that scaled greater and greater heights. Or a cruelly hysterical black comedy if made by the Coen Brothers. But in Tom Shadyac's hands, instead it just becomes a one gag vehicle for Jim Carrey's manic mugging.I've never been a fan of Tom Shadyac. His films either collapse into silliness like Ace Ventura, or sink into soft-headed sludge like Patch Adams and Bruce Almighty. The one exception on his resume is the delightful remake of The Nutty Professor. The one film he's ever made where he pulled everything together into a successful package. A film as funny as it is sweet.But Liar Liar sees Shadyac return to his usual weaknesses. The problem I have with the film is it never really knows what to do with its idea. Even at a slim 85 minutes, Liar Liar's one and only joke is stretched. And that's to see Jim Carrey acting like a one-man loony bin. Not for the first (or last) time.Jim Carrey's given some pretty whacked out performances in his day. But the one he gives in Liar Liar almost makes them seem like minimalism. After his son makes a birthday wish that he can only be truthful for a whole day, it springboards Carrey sky high. There are some who no doubt derive amusement from watching him go completely off his head. But I just found all of the shouting and the yelling and the wailing so wearying.He really throws himself into the role with a total reckless abandon. In fact that's what he does a lot of the time. Throwing himself around. Some scenes in the film are just awful. And they go on at embarrassing length. Like when he's holding a blue Biro, and tries to say its red and he can't no matter how much he wants to. But even worse then that is the scene in a men's room when he trashes the place to get out of the courtroom. It all makes you wonder what lunatic asylum Jim Carrey escaped from.The main problem with Liar Liar is that Jim Carrey isn't really the right actor for the role. Since the theme of the film is a dishonest, inattentive father seeing the error of his ways, then what it needed was someone who can play greedy and sarcastic, and then equally downplay it to meet his redemption. Someone like Bill Murray.But because this is Jim Carrey, all we get instead is him yelling the house down from start to finish. That's all he ever seems to do. Whether it be the slick lawyer lying through his teeth. The lawyer forced to tell the truth. Or the changed man who wants to fix things with his son. There's no sense of a man changing into a better one. Just an obnoxious man that seems to know no limits how far over the top he can go. Its an annoying, one-note performance.Because Tom Shadyac refuses to rein in Carrey's excesses, Liar Liar just gets more tedious as it goes on.

I also love her deadpan answer when she's asked why she downed a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka I had a headache.But first things first - you can hardly comment on this film without commenting on Angelina Jolie's infamous Oscar win. (Remember her smooching her own brother on stage?) She's fun to watch, and she does have a memorable face. Undoubtedly she has charisma. Is it enough to win an Oscar? Well apparently... Though Brittany Murphy is far better in this. She is totally believable as the sexually abused Daisy. I found her character much more disturbing than Angelina Jolie's. In this movie she is still the dark chubby character actress instead the thin blonde lollipop princess she seemed to aspire to be later on. (May she rest in peace now). Ryder's Susanna ends up in a mental institution after the incident with the aspirin and the vodka. She also experiments sexually (she's nineteen already, so it's about time! Although maybe not with your friend's dad). Just imagine you did that and ended up in a place like this. I felt for a lot of the characters, including the girl who seemed to be in just because she was gay.At the mental institution Susanna meets Angelina Jolie's Lisa, who has serious behavioural problems, and has a sinister side (she will drive Daisy to commit suicide then steal her money). Together the out-of-touch teenagers embark on some adventures, until the hardy Lisa breaks down in a little-girl tantrum after a word-off with Susanna, whereas the cleverer Susanna realises the way to get out is to spill the beans in therapy - of course everyone, herself included, knew all along that she wasn't really crazy at all. I don't mind that both Lisa and Susanna are wonderfully self-absorbed and self-serving characters. That's just crazy teenagers for you. What pushes my buttons a little though is the soppy end scene where Susanna says her goodbyes to some of the seriously ill people, as if she'd been one of them and now she's cured and getting out. But then, she never wanted to go there in the first place so maybe I'm being unfair.This film left me feeling sad, but I enjoyed watching it.

Samuel L.

LL Cool J isn't too bad but his character is far too obviously built up beyond what he should be, though there are times when he's fun to watch.So it doesn't have the best script in the world, suffers from some poor acting and has variable FX throughout but that doesn't matter because when all is said and done this is a big bundle of fun about killer sharks and does exactly what it sets out to do. It's a great creature feature and a fun big-budget B-movie for those who can switch their brains off and just enjoy.See this if you like Jaws, Jaws 2, Malibu Shark Attack.

LL Cool J isn't too bad but his character is far too obviously built up beyond what he should be, though there are times when he's fun to watch.So it doesn't have the best script in the world, suffers from some poor acting and has variable FX throughout but that doesn't matter because when all is said and done this is a big bundle of fun about killer sharks and does exactly what it sets out to do.

Well, get ready to disagree once again because here is yet another slice of brainless greatness from the man and it's one of my favourite movies from his fun oeuvre (second only to The Long Kiss Goodnight for sheer amusement).In a deep sea facility, some brainy folk are harvesting protein compounds from the brains of sharks to help find a cure for mentally degenerative diseases. Unfortunately, their work has made the sharks stronger and smarter and those bad boys want to get their revenge, or so it would seem.This movie is just great, great fun. The main plus point here is how the sharks end up in an unusual environment (ie, the flooded facility allows them to end up gliding through corridors, get into elevator shafts and even visit the kitchen. No killer shark movie can really be watched without sitting in the long, long shadow cast by Jaws and Harlin acknowledges this with a few nice touches (e.g. the licence plate taken from the jaws of one shark, the methods used in trying to kill the sharks) which, for me, is absolutely the way to do things as opposed to trying to ignore this obvious fact.The movie is really only let down in the acting stakes. Okay, the visual effects aren't always top notch but there are many moments that get by with sheer enthusiasm and additional practical effects so that is not a major issue.

Some said I may as well complete the trilogy, whilst others said it would ruin the first two masterpieces. In the end I decided to watch it to judge for myself after watching The Godfather Part I and Part II again.Set 20 years after the events of The Godfather Part II, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has made moved back to New York and is made a Commander of St. Sebastain by the Catholic Church for his charity work. He has been a legitimate business man, with a few a links to the Mafia. He is suffering guilt from his ruthless raise to power, the murder of brother and the death of his first wife in Silicy. His daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) is still close to him, running the Vito Corleone Foundation for him, whilst his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has turned his back on the family business to focus on a music career. In the middle of a ceremony to celebrate Michael's deels to the church, Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garica) shows his face. He is a low-level hood who is in the middle of conflict with a Mafia Don, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna (Fat Tony from the Simpsons)). Michael offers to show the young hot the ropes of the business. After a devastating hit that wipes out most of the Mafia Dons, a power vacuum happens the world of crime. Michael is forced back into the Mafia because of it. The second plot involves Michael attempting to buy Immobiliare, the real estate sector of the Vactican Bank. The deal is meant to save the Vactican's troubled finances and Michael is encouraged by Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly), the head of the Vactican bank to invest $600 Million in Bonds. But this ends up being a scam by dodgy elements of the Bank and forces Michael into Vactican politics.The Godfather Part III has often been derided by fans for being inferior and insulting to the first two films. But there is a sector who do still like this film. They is a long gap between this film and the preceder, which is never a good sign. It means that a lot of chances are forced appond the film and gaps have to be expanded. It is also normally a sign of cashing in on a popular title. There are problems with characterisation in the film. The first two films are about Michael's moral decline and becoming a ruthless and cunning Mafia boss. But in this film the filmmakers are trying to make him a good guy and forced back into the business. It weakens the message. The rise of Vincent also felt unrealistic and less organic compared to the rise of Vito and Michael. However, I do like that Connie (Talia Shire) as an adviser.The plot itself should have been really interesting, dealings between the Mafia and the Vactican. That in itself could have made a really good thriller\/drama, and showing the international nature of both organisations. As well the power vacuum in the Mafia, and forced change could have lead to a good film, particularly more in the context of the first two. But the Godfather Part III seem to be trying to put too much in one film which was shorten, because it also has the added family drama that was key to all three films. As a stand alone film it could have worked, but as a Godfather film, not so much.Acting wise, it was hit and miss. Of course Al Pacino was excellent, Michael Corleone was the role that made him into a star. Andy Garcia is also a good actor, and most of the actors returning were good. The big problem was the casting of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. Sofia has a good look, and lovely long hair, but she was so wooden and weak that it was a struggle for the other actors. Her expression on her face was so distance that it looked like she wasn't really interested. Luckily she moved into directing where she shows her real talent.Francis Ford Coppola does a fine job directing, having some good set-pieces like the hit on the Mafia (even though it could have been simpler). He keeps the tone the same as with the first two films, have the slow burning atmosphere that made the first two films great. But this film did feels a little too slow and distance compared to the first two. Some of the music also did not fit as well as the first two films. However there are good scenes, like the intercutting between the opera and the outside events.Overall, its no where near as good as the first two films and should have been a stand alone film. But it still has entertaining moments. 3 out of 5.

He is a low-level hood who is in the middle of conflict with a Mafia Don, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna (Fat Tony from the Simpsons)). Michael offers to show the young hot the ropes of the business.

The second plot involves Michael attempting to buy Immobiliare, the real estate sector of the Vactican Bank. The deal is meant to save the Vactican's troubled finances and Michael is encouraged by Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly), the head of the Vactican bank to invest $600 Million in Bonds. But this ends up being a scam by dodgy elements of the Bank and forces Michael into Vactican politics.The Godfather Part III has often been derided by fans for being inferior and insulting to the first two films. But there is a sector who do still like this film. They is a long gap between this film and the preceder, which is never a good sign. It means that a lot of chances are forced appond the film and gaps have to be expanded. It is also normally a sign of cashing in on a popular title. There are problems with characterisation in the film. The first two films are about Michael's moral decline and becoming a ruthless and cunning Mafia boss. But in this film the filmmakers are trying to make him a good guy and forced back into the business. It weakens the message. The rise of Vincent also felt unrealistic and less organic compared to the rise of Vito and Michael. However, I do like that Connie (Talia Shire) as an adviser.The plot itself should have been really interesting, dealings between the Mafia and the Vactican. That in itself could have made a really good thriller\/drama, and showing the international nature of both organisations. As well the power vacuum in the Mafia, and forced change could have lead to a good film, particularly more in the context of the first two. But the Godfather Part III seem to be trying to put too much in one film which was shorten, because it also has the added family drama that was key to all three films. As a stand alone film it could have worked, but as a Godfather film, not so much.Acting wise, it was hit and miss. Of course Al Pacino was excellent, Michael Corleone was the role that made him into a star. Andy Garcia is also a good actor, and most of the actors returning were good. The big problem was the casting of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. Sofia has a good look, and lovely long hair, but she was so wooden and weak that it was a struggle for the other actors. Her expression on her face was so distance that it looked like she wasn't really interested. Luckily she moved into directing where she shows her real talent.Francis Ford Coppola does a fine job directing, having some good set-pieces like the hit on the Mafia (even though it could have been simpler). He keeps the tone the same as with the first two films, have the slow burning atmosphere that made the first two films great. But this film did feels a little too slow and distance compared to the first two. Some of the music also did not fit as well as the first two films. However there are good scenes, like the intercutting between the opera and the outside events.Overall, its no where near as good as the first two films and should have been a stand alone film.

Some said I may as well complete the trilogy, whilst others said it would ruin the first two masterpieces. In the end I decided to watch it to judge for myself after watching The Godfather Part I and Part II again.Set 20 years after the events of The Godfather Part II, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has made moved back to New York and is made a Commander of St. Sebastain by the Catholic Church for his charity work. He has been a legitimate business man, with a few a links to the Mafia. He is suffering guilt from his ruthless raise to power, the murder of brother and the death of his first wife in Silicy. His daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) is still close to him, running the Vito Corleone Foundation for him, whilst his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has turned his back on the family business to focus on a music career.

The so-called 'American Dream' is all about somebody trying to get out of the little world they're living in and make something of themselves, to be more than they are. In this case we have a filmmaker, very independent minded and determined through years of trial and tribulation, who wants to get his dream somehow. Which is not easy since the guy, Mark Borchardt, is an beer-guzzling factory\/cemetery worker who has three kids with an ex-wife he barely sees, a mountain of debt, an executive producer Uncle who is half-senile and half never supportive (despite giving up the thousands for the film-making), and, obviously, gets very depressed. But it's a story, in spite of everything that happens, funny or tragic, is hopeful and inspiring about the future for Mark.And it's also about something else, how making a movie takes time, and money, sometimes both in equal measure. Borchardt's movie he's planning is a feature-length exploration of his life and times in Minnesota, Northwestern, but he's having trouble getting it off the ground not ready to direct, not ready with the script, no locations or a solid cast. So instead he goes back to a short film he started years ago, a psychological horror called 'Coven' (or CO-ven as he points out), which is a mere 40 minute movie that takes him more than three years of production. As he's making this movie we get to know who Borchardt is- or at least what Chris Smith gets to know him as or reveals- and his family and friends, including his old and not-all-there Uncle Bill, his friend Mike who is an ex drug addict turned gambling addict, and his colleagues and girlfriend who all comment about Mark's ways as an artist and as a human being.A marker of a truly knowing and superb documentary is how close a filmmaker can get to the subject and make it into a story, make it into a story that is absorbing and true to something in the human condition, and can be just told well through the usual means of film-making itself. As Smith's film is about such a subject that he's making, one might think back to other documentaries on directors with a super (and I mean SUPER) passion for the story they're telling, almost to the point where they might not know when to let go (Herzog and Coppola docs come to mind like Burden of Dreams or Hearts of Darkness). But here we see a man who is a decent guy, though never truly professional. As one says, he's instinctual and primal, he knows his stuff, but whether he can finish his movie, and maybe finally get a catharsis from it (if only financially) remains to be seen.His struggle isn't just one of being an artist and after something he needs time and money to find, but about the ways that a person goes about finding it his own way, and that's a big key to the success of the movie. We care about this guy, even if some of the things he does or comes across are, frankly, quite funny in the way that Borchardt goes about filming Coven, or directs (or mis-directs) his actors, or says he'll ship out 3,000 copies of his short film without a clear idea who his audience is. And Smith really captures the other people around him with a precise but tender accuracy we understand who they are at first, but then that understanding deepens based on the circumstances they live in (i.e. the method of alcoholism among Mark and his friends over the years, vodka being a big component), such as his Uncle's disillusioned feeling about Mark's lack of success, despite his backing of the project and what he does. Watch the scene where Mark directs his Uncle in the ADR recording of a certain few lines and one gets a key moment Mark will stop at nothing to get what he's after, even if all hope might be lost.American Movie is a bittersweet experience. We want to root for this guy even if he is hapless and whose troubles might hit close to home for some, or may seem pathetic to others. He's not born into Hollywood royalty and didn't go to film school, but he'll keep on what he's doing just because, if nothing else, there is nothing else really except for the toilet at the cemetery full of feces. It's an entertaining parable, and a revealing portrait of truly independent film-making. Speaking of which, make sure to watch Borchardt's movie Coven on the DVD of American Movie - ultimately, when all is said and done, despite what the few clips in the documentary might suggest, he's a really good director.
