You know, before he sold his soul and started to make not so good films like '2012'. Well, as part of a season of 'Movies you never got round to watching but always wanted to see' on one of the movie channels, this film came up. Well, I'd seen all the others they were showing and so I thought I'd better give it a viewing. Here's a short summary followed by my thoughts.Martin Blank is a hit man, he works freelance with his assistant Marcella doing the office work for him. One day Marcella tells him he's been invited to his ten year school reunion. Martin is at first reluctant to go, but agrees when a job comes up in the area and his therapist, Dr. Oatman, tells him it would be a good idea. Unfortunately Martin has upset one of his rivals, Grocer, who is now stalking him using two government agents as a screen. Whilst in town for the reunion, Martin looks up his high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry, who works at the local radio station. After a bit of an awkward start the Debi agrees to go with him despite the fact the he didn't turn up on their prom night ten years earlier. Throw in another assassin with a contract on Martin and we've got us a movie!First of all, a really great soundtrack, The Clash, Motorhead, Queen, lots of great songs littered throughout. Pretty well made, but showing its age now just form the fact the mobile phones (or cell phones) have got so much smaller nowadays. Decent performances from all of the leading cast; John Cusack as Martin Q. Blank, Minnie Driver as Debi Newberry, Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Dan Aykroyd as Grocer and Joan Cusack as Marcella.This is a bit of an awkward one to assess; it starts out as a comedy, and then becomes a love story and then back to an action comedy for the grand finale. For me it works best as a comedy, I found the somewhat schmaltzy love story a bit of a distraction. I also kind of wasn't all that convinced that Debi would have trusted Martin after what he did on prom night. But that may just be me. Over all, as I just said, I think it works better as a comedy than a love story, and it's worth seeing for the satire alone.

Toy Story 2 is a far superior sequel to its 1995 predecessor, Toy Story, a film that I will admit I loved watching growing up during the mid '90s, so you could expect my hesitation in viewing a sequel. My fears subsided within the first five minutes of Toy Story 2. You can comment forever about the significantly improved Pixar animation, the increased human-like appearances of the toys, and the high-soaring story (that has many laugh-out-loud nods to past movie epics including National Lampoon's Animal House, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, and The Empire Strikes Back). But Toy Story 2's real charm lies in its underlying message. Toy Story 2 involves beloved cowboy toy Woody's (voiced by Tom Hanks) theft by a greedy toy collector named Al (Wayne Knight). So it's up to Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to mount a gallant rescue attempt for his best friend. At the apartment of Al, Woody learns that he is actually a rare doll from a 1950's children cartoon and Al is intent on selling Woody and other members from the so-called Roundup Gang - Jessie (newcomer Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar), and steed Bullseye - to a Japanese toy collector. This was an excellent animated family film from director John Lasseter (who also worked on the first film). Like its predecessor, Toy Story 2 captures what it means to be a child and eventually out-growing your youth, love, and friendship. Does Woody really care about about his friends back in Andy's (John Morris) bedroom and living a good life and being loved in the present, or does he care about living forever as a rare collector's item? Toy Story 2 really has a high nostalgia factor for its viewers, as some have pointed out, and that is probably what makes this movie just as important - arguably more important - than Toy Story. Most of us do have toys that we love as children, but eventually out-grow as we get older (just imagine the rather heart-breaking flashback sequence explaining Cowgirl Jessie's history). I had a collection of stuffed animals as a child and I used to take them everywhere with me because I loved being home so much and they reminded me of being home. I'm 24 now; I didn't get rid of them - I'm not sure I could ever bring myself to do such a thing - but I do keep them on a shelf in my bedroom closet. See what I mean? This is the sort of nostalgia factor that Toy Story 2 elicits from the viewer and makes it a more personal and heart-warming experience than the first film, in addition to simply being action-packed and more entertaining. Toy Story 2, as I explained, is a vastly improved sequel to its predecessor, the original Toy Story. The story soars, the animation soars and the voice-acting performances, as you would expect, soar, but its message and nostalgia factor seal the deal and make this movie one of the greatest movie sequels ever made.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2010","score":"","review":" 1999's Toy Story 2 is a fine example of one of those rare movie sequels that far surpasses the original.

I don't think there's room for too many other opinions. Some people, like many fans of Monty Python, swear by this film, while others, also like many people regarding Monty Python, just regard it as bizarre.Personally I found it very entertaining. There are lots of fantastic comic performances here, from Janeane Garofalo to Molly Shannon, from Paul Rudd to David Hyde Pierce, and from Christopher Meloni as you've never seen him, to Michael Showalter. Garofalo, for my money, deserves the greatest props. Her depiction of geeky camp director Beth is excellent and captures the disinterestedness, passion, yearning, and tenderness which her character, who falls for a nerdy and slightly maladjusted astro-physicist named Henry Newman, played with such comic agility by David Hyde Pierce, suggests. Christopher Meloni as a Vietnam vet named Gene serving as camp cook steals every scene with his fixation on his wartime experiences. Michael Showalter is great as a nice, nerdy boy who doesn't appreciate just how much his niceness is limiting him from attracting girls. His scenes with Meloni are hilarious. Paul Rudd is great as Andy, a good looking, shallow guy who is focused on one thing and one thing only and is a complete azz. Kate (Marguerite Moreau) is his female counterpart, a sixteen-year-old girl who knows that she's being shallow but really doesn't care and just wants to get laid. Molly Shannon is quite funny as a woman who has recently broken up with her ex and is trying to resist the urge to abase herself and crawl back to him. She is helped hilariously by some of her camping wards.There are lots of funny scenes here. If you enjoyed The State-well, you've probably seen it because this film came out nine years ago and The State was on TV around that time-but if you somehow missed it in '01, you'd probably enjoy it. The humor is somewhat nerdy-this is humor for nerds who like humor-and I say that with no shame, but it is what it is. The film takes on stereotypes from '80s camping films (the ditzy easy girl, the buff brain-dead boy, the nerdy camp director, all the now goofy-looking fashion, the casual drug use, and the campers' ability to solve pressing problems with great ease) and wildly mocks them. Most I found quite funny, as a humor nerd myself, although a couple (the drug use parody just didn't strike me as funny and Gene's attempt to face who he was also didn't particularly tickle me) I thought came up short.That said, this is an awful lot of fun.

Garofalo, for my money, deserves the greatest props. Her depiction of geeky camp director Beth is excellent and captures the disinterestedness, passion, yearning, and tenderness which her character, who falls for a nerdy and slightly maladjusted astro-physicist named Henry Newman, played with such comic agility by David Hyde Pierce, suggests. Christopher Meloni as a Vietnam vet named Gene serving as camp cook steals every scene with his fixation on his wartime experiences. Michael Showalter is great as a nice, nerdy boy who doesn't appreciate just how much his niceness is limiting him from attracting girls. His scenes with Meloni are hilarious. Paul Rudd is great as Andy, a good looking, shallow guy who is focused on one thing and one thing only and is a complete azz. Kate (Marguerite Moreau) is his female counterpart, a sixteen-year-old girl who knows that she's being shallow but really doesn't care and just wants to get laid. Molly Shannon is quite funny as a woman who has recently broken up with her ex and is trying to resist the urge to abase herself and crawl back to him. She is helped hilariously by some of her camping wards.There are lots of funny scenes here. If you enjoyed The State-well, you've probably seen it because this film came out nine years ago and The State was on TV around that time-but if you somehow missed it in '01, you'd probably enjoy it. The humor is somewhat nerdy-this is humor for nerds who like humor-and I say that with no shame, but it is what it is. The film takes on stereotypes from '80s camping films (the ditzy easy girl, the buff brain-dead boy, the nerdy camp director, all the now goofy-looking fashion, the casual drug use, and the campers' ability to solve pressing problems with great ease) and wildly mocks them. Most I found quite funny, as a humor nerd myself, although a couple (the drug use parody just didn't strike me as funny and Gene's attempt to face who he was also didn't particularly tickle me) I thought came up short.That said, this is an awful lot of fun. The ensemble cast is very talented, it's obvious that the cast is not in this film for the paycheck, and they have a lot of fun mocking the old summer camp chestnuts.

Honey I Shrunk the Kids was one of the most creative movies I have ever seen. Who would think of a shrinking machine that accidentally shrinks the children and gives the audience a much better view of a regular backyard? And the special effects and set was top notch. I can't believe that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar for those two categories. But if you liked that movie, you need to see Honey I Blew Up the Kid. Wayne Szalinsky is at it again, but this time, he's created a machine that makes things grow and he accidentally made his toddler son, Adam, grow until he's the size of a skyscraper! The cast is the same, but now Lloyd Bridges, John Shea, and Keri Russell have been added into the mix. The acting was good, the special effects were even better than the first movie, and there's laughs and plot twists around every corner! To the people who don't think that this movie was good, sometimes you just have to pretend your a kid again in order to get the whole gist of the movie. And I don't say that with every kid's movie (especially not ones with mediocre CGI animation and potty jokes\/language, like the crap we have nowadays), but this one is free of all of those nasty movie plagues, making this movie a rare treasure and one of the best sequels I have ever seen! I never get tired of watching it, and I hope that once you see it, you won't either! This movie deserves an applauding 9\/10, and the only thing keeping it from being a perfect score are the few corny jokes placed in the movie, but aside from that, don't wait!

He's the typical guy that can't catch a break, which makes it incredibly fulfilling to me when he actually manages to tell some people of. He's always wished things would have turned out better for him, but they didn't so he works out and buys a sports car. But in the end, he can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of his stupid little life. If that's not beautiful, I really don't know what is. The side characters are all so well-written, so fitting. I particularly like the actress playing Ricky's mom, a character that's just kinda waiting until she can finally die. The climax of the movie featuring Ricky's dad is also a great example of a thorough character study. Not to mention that it's just really funny in a weird way.

Top-drawer actors and well-crafted flashy effects are used to gloss over a meaningless plot and a wasted opportunity, for 'Event Horizon' explores some intriguing concepts and has several elements of a decent film.Since I first saw it on the big screen, one thing that had always stuck in my mind about 'Event Horizon' was that eerie atmosphere. Director Paul Anderson should certainly explore the horror genre, being adept at building a climate of tension and foreboding. This accentuates the story's central premise that the ship 'Event Horizon' itself has somehow become affected by the forces it encountered in another dimension. Anderson does a good job of actualising these indelible phenomena on the big screen, keeping the characters and the viewer on edge we know all hell is going to break loose, but not why or how. He is helped in this goal by the tried and tested talents of an experienced visual effects team that includes department supervisor Richard Yuricich, who earlier proved himself in such greats as '2001' and 'Star Trek The Motion Picture'. The result earned 'Event Horizon' the description 'weird' when it first came out and the viewers' inability to qualify what they were seeing was one of the film's greatest strengths - no one was entirely sure how real the unexplained anomalies were, which the ending capitalizes upon.Unfortunately, these efforts are severely undermined by a script that has no interest in exploring the incredible scientific concepts behind the conflict, rendering all the unanswered questions and 'Shining'-style sequences meaningless. It's rather like launching into an intelligent conversation with someone who suddenly decides things are getting too 'heavy' before retreating to the safer topic of whether or not Simon Cowell deserves a knighthood. This has the knock-on effect of ensuring that much of the characters' dialogue is as two-dimensional as their characterisation if there's a scientist aboard, the chances of him still being sane by the closing credits are about as likely as any military characters present exploring the Kip Thorne ruminations on wormhole theory. The point is not to suggest that anyone should have lapsed into a Carl Sagan lecture on the nature of the universe - those who have sat through the works of Dan Brown will, if still awake, be all too familiar with storytellers more interested in being didactic than genuinely entertaining. Rather, it's the usual desire by the studios not to alienate the meat-heads in the audience with too much of this thing we call 'thinking'. This doubtless also explains the choice of music for the beginning and end credits, which hurriedly promises don't worry - there's gonna be shootin' 'n killin' - although Michael Kamen's incidental score is thankfully more in tune with his usual standard.Still, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are no strangers to film work held together by more money than brains, the Matrix sequels and pointless 'Under The Mountain' remake being more recent examples. Both are capable of giving so much more, with Neill as usual the best-served out of a modest banquet. Once remembered for playing the son of Satan, this is a man who can convey a great deal without ever saying a word. His Dr Weir alter ego, however, needed far more development if we were to be sympathetic with his plight. Fishburne is never allowed to explore any facial expression other than serious concern, although this might have something to do with his polar opposite in the form of Cooper, as played by Richard T. Nelson, whom I really want to believe is not simply there to be the token 'Funny Black Man', but Cooper is really convincing in the role. Other luminaries worthy of mention include Katherine Quinlan and Jason Isaacs, but only because we've seen them act elsewhere, and Sean Pertwee follows his father into sci-fi for the first time to lesser acclaim, though he is hardly provided with much of a challenge.Much of my annoyance at the lack of effort put into 'Event Horizon' stems from the fact that I am the right demographic for sci-fi\/horror. It's frustrating to see a film that in some ways explores themes and story lines I enjoy, but stops short, terrified that it might actually become something truly decent. On the one hand, I could argue that later successes like Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine' raised the bar for the genre, leaving half-baked efforts such as this dancing the limbo beneath it with miles of clear headway up top. Yet precursors like 'The Black Hole' and 'Alien', which, while not necessarily exploring more intelligent story lines, were constructed with greater maturity by genuine film-makers like Ridley Scott, not interested in assembling a film with the help of a marketing team and interested in proper scripting over cheap thrills. Funnily enough, those are the films people still remember today.As such, 'Event Horizon' bears up well in appearance, but falls short once you take a closer peek. It feels like a very emblematic Hollywood blockbuster, half-filled with genuinely-talented artistes, but driven by a studio anxiously matching their box-office winning formula with audience demographics. Closer inspection reveals that its high aims are in fact the shadow of a much shorter arm outstretched in front of the wall where the puppetry is being performed for short-term gain only. Do yourself a favour and dig up the classics or watch considered efforts like 'Sunlight' instead. If like me, you haven't seen 'Event Horizon' since its original release and its spooky atmosphere left you with fond memories, keep it that way.

His true specialty is mob movies. Goodfella, though most people call it his best, isn't my favorite of his. But it is a great film, filled with great performances, and many memorable things about it. Goodfellas is the true story of Henry Hill(played by Ray Liotta)and how he brings himself up to the higher mob levels. Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro plays some wise guys too. The film also shows his marriage and how it falls down.Scorsese is a master with mob movies. I mean this is the man who did Casino, The Departed, Gangs of New York, and I think there are others.

In the end, good triumphs over evil and Freeze even helps cure Alfred, who had and early stage of the same disease his wife does.There are so many bad things about this movie that I feel the need to list them. So here goes Mr. Freeze only speaks in ice and cold related puns, which wears thin after about five minutes; Batman and Robin have nipples on their suits. We don't know why; Poison Ivy comes off as a murderous Jessica Rabbit, thanks to Uma Thurman's performance; Gotham City has become some kind of neon nightmare with giant statues of muscular men scattered about; Alicia Silverstone, as Batgirl, is terrible. On top of that, they completely botched the origin of her character; Batman has a Bat-American Express card; Batman comes off as possible being in the closet (George Clooney later admitted he played the character as being gay); Right before the final battle, Batman, Robin and Batgirl rush off, as time is short. Yet they still take time to change into entirely new suits and get new vehicles while Freeze starts to ice the city; there are so many big flashy vehicles that it feels much like a toy commercial; in an early sequence, Batman and Robin sky surf; in another early sequence, Batman and Robin somehow have ice skates that appear from the bottom of their boots; Bane, a brilliant criminal mastermind in the comics, is reduced to a giant oaf who works as Poison Ivy's thug; I don't feel the need to go on.Despite the lashing I just gave this movie, you may have noticed I gave it a 2.

But the longer I watched the more I became fascinated with the many layers going on in the production. This is definitely one of those movies that you could watch a few times and come away with different information and perspectives than previously.The casting was totally a power house line up. I'm guessing the script along with Tim Robins fame probably got these powerful actors and actresses to work on this for lower than their usual price because this just wasn't a script that would make mega millions at the box office so there must have been some sacrificing to get that many great performers on here. I wont go over all the big stars because others on here already have done a good job of that. But the actor who played the young Orson Wells (From around the Citizen Kane era) was practically a ringer for Wells. So much that it was almost like they imported him back in time from the Citizen Kane movie.The only disappointment I actually had here was that in the beginning of the film this is listed as a Mostly True Story, but then at the end there wasn't some post script that sort of tied up the loose ends to let us know what finally happened to the individual primary characters and the play production after the opening night. It would have been nice to have some mention....Otherwise this was a very interesting and thought provoking movie.

I'm guessing the script along with Tim Robins fame probably got these powerful actors and actresses to work on this for lower than their usual price because this just wasn't a script that would make mega millions at the box office so there must have been some sacrificing to get that many great performers on here.

The story has so much heart that it moves you and I agree with another reviewer that this film indeed does mirror life at times.Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lead the great voice cast (surely the best voice cast ever)and their parts fit them like a glove.All the supporting cast that you loved first time round all return and unlike many Disney sequels are all voiced by the same actors.As with the first film Toy Story 2 can be enjoyed by all ages with the jokes coming at a fast pace. The Toy Story films will always be special to me and I can't separate the two as to which is better. Roll on Toy Story 3.

Don't go into it expecting the first film. That's a mistake. This is more of an 80s cheese-fest, deliberately campy and entirely insane. The same family of murderers and cannibals returns. They now live in an abandoned amusement park and are occasionally slaughtering victims for decoration\/meat purposes. One of their murders (of two '80s-style douchebags) is captured live on the radio by a late-night DJ (Caroline Williams). A police lieutenant who has been on the chainsaw massacre case (Dennis Hopper) hooks up with her in order to fish for the murderers. Despite the film's general lack of acclaim, Hooper has a lot to be proud of with this movie. It's so crazy and over-the-top that I found it hard not to love. I mean, come on don't tell me you couldn't watch Dennis Hopper go nuts with a chainsaw. There does come a point near the end when all the screaming and chainsawing started to give me a bit of a headache, but otherwise I enjoyed the Hell out of this.
