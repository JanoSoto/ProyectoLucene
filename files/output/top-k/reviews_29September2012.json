[{"date":"29 September 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Teachers at a high become infected by an alien parasite and soon target the local town.Only a rag tag team of students know what is going on, the adults don't believe them because it's so absurd, and no one mentioned that Invasion of the Bodysnatchers was just on the other day....1999 was a really strange year for film. The most anticipated film of the year was a huge disappointment, The Matrix was a real Phantom Menace, and little surprises like this came out of nowhere and really made going to the movies worth while.Because of the posters, you instantly think that this will be another Scream, and the beginning really does hark of Casey and Ghostface, but this is so much more.Its the most 'un-Rodriguez' Rodriguez movie there is, really the only trait of his here is Salma Hayek, who gets infected, and you never see her again.The film feels fresh still as it did back then, and although some of the effects are a little dodgy now (just what was that flying out of Zekes car), the cast look they are having a lot of fun with their respective roles.Of the teachers, Patrick is the one having the most fun, and you know toward the end of the film Janssen will turn into an extraordinary beauty.The college kids differ slightly, watching it now, you think of a few of them ( i wonder where they are now?) but they are all great, especially Hartnett and Duvall.The film never takes itself seriously, and despite the many references to The Thing, it's original enough for you to forgive the over the top ending.Well worth seeing for B movie fun.
