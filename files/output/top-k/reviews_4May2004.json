Therefore, I waited until all three movies were released before I submitted this review.  As background on my perspective, I first read The Lord of the Rings as a boy of 13 and I was awed by the power and imagination of the story.  I read it again during my college years. I still loved it.  The innumerable characters, the thrilling battle scenes, and the huge scope of the story still impressed me. The idea that this could be turned into a movie did not even enter my mind.  Since 1998, when reports of the making of the film trilogy hit the internet I became increasingly excited about the prospect. \tSome of my initial thoughts after viewing the film in December of 2001 were the following   Fellowship of the Ring is a great film. It is a film of a battle between good and evil, which has both thrilling fight scenes and quiet, beautiful moments.  The opening introduction briefly portrays a battle in as large scale as anything portrayed on film up to that time.  However the filmmakers did the little things right as well, from the small round doors of the Hobbit homes to wrist straps bearing the White tree, symbol of the Kings of Gondor. It is a blockbuster that does not give you a Hollywood ending (as Empire Strikes Back, the best of the Star Wars trilogy).  The reaction of the audience I went to see it with is telling; most were smiling knowing they had seen something worthwhile but almost in disbelief of the realization of how much more the characters have to endure before they reach the end of their quest.  The acting is great&#133;.   Now that I have seen the entire trilogy and multiple viewings of the Fellowship in particular, I am still greatly impressed by the movie.  Peter Jackson and company should be praised for not overwhelming the first film with action to grab the casual viewer. They were confident enough of the story and the viewers to give us a slow but picturesque beginning in the Shire. This first film has a lovely episodic quality as our heroes pass though various realms of Middle Earth.  The action included was exceptional especially the scenes in the Mines of Moria.  The battle in Balin's Tomb immediately followed by the Bridge of Khazad Dum was a thrilling set piece that still moves you even after several viewings.  I think only because it was topped by Helm's Deep in Two Towers and the Fields of Pelennor in Return of the King that the Moria scenes are not spoken of more often. The acting was superb by the whole cast.  Of course, Ian McKellan became Gandalf in the film.  However, special kudos should go to Viggo Mortensen.  Viggo and the writers made Aragorn a real person, not a stereotypical perfect hero.I feel pity for those because of their limited imagination can not appreciate the heart of this film because it is of the fantasy genre.  On the other end of the spectrum, there are some extreme Tolkien loyalists who can not accept a single change in the story.  I think other reviewers have expressed well the concept that books and films are different forms of art and changes had to made to make the story work as a film.  Now that the Rings hype is over, I wish that this small minority of people will take a fresh look at the movie and appreciate it for what it is a classic movie epic with tremendous production values, superb acting, and above all a great story.

The obvious that Taxi Driver is great, it is. That it is a masterpiece, it is. What sets this film apart from so many other films, including great films, is that it is an enigma. Every time I watch this film I see something else, I notice something else, I feel something else, I wonder something else. And I am, clearly, not the only one who reacts to the film this way that is why it lends itself to endless speculation and discussion.Since so many positive reviews have been made, rather than add my own red hot glowing review I thought I would address those people who have written that they don't like Taxi Driver because, they say, they find it dull and boring, hard to follow, etc. These people miss some important points about the film.ONE, Taxi Driver is NOT an action film. If you want an action film watch Die Hard and its numerous sequels, or Lethal Weapon and its sequels, not to mention Rambo and thousands of other action flicks.  Nothing wrong with them, per se. Nothing wrong with liking them either. But is wrong to put down Taxi Driver because of what it is not.TWO, Taxi Driver is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring, hardly anything happens to him and that is what Taxi Driver shows - Bickle's pathetic life.THREE, some people say that they don't understand the plot, Bickle's attitudes and behaviour, etc. But that is because Taxi Driver is about a man who is profoundly emotionally disturbed although he (and his buddies) don't seem to know it. His actions aren't rational because he isn't rational. His actions make no sense because he makes no sense. Offhand, I can't think of any other film that has depicted mental illness as well as Taxi Driver and no film that attempts to show the world as seen by someone like Travis Bickle.There you go three reasons to address the most common criticisms of the film with one notable exception, its controversial ending, but THAT is a whole topic in itself which is just more proof of why Taxi Driver is so worthwhile - when viewers aren't sure what actually happens in the end (Is Travis hallucinating as he is dying? Is that what the slow moving overhead tracking shot suggests? Or does he really become a hero in the media and get realeased back into the world with his buddies? Etc, etc.) The questions and issues raised by Taxi Driver just go one and on.Now if after reading the above you still don't think Taxi Driver is a great film, I can't help you. I am NOT saying you have to like (or love) Taxi Driver just appreciate it or at least acknowledge its greatness even if it isn't your cup of tea. Actually, I don't love Taxi Driver because it doesn't lend itself to love. It is too disturbing a picture precisely because it is way too close to reality, it cuts too close to the bone for my comfort (or rather, discomfort). It is not comfortable to watch because it isn't supposed to be. So if Taxi Driver makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy it should because real life is uncomfortable and uneasy (unless you are born rich or something).Finally, after watching it again for the nth time I have begun to notice (and feel) just how smooth Taxi Driver is. The overall feel and flow of the film is incredibly smooth in which not only each scene but each and every movement and gesture flows into the other imperceptibly. Sometimes I play back scences and sequences over and over to catch how it happens. In fact, I see it happening and still can't quite figure out how it is done but I have a hunch - DeNiro. DeNiro is just amazing in this film. If you haven't done it already, watch it with the remote in your hand and play some of the scenes in slow motion and you will SEE what I am talking about. Only DeNiro could do what he does. The sheer minimalism of his performance is just stunning. How he gets so much from so little never ceases to amaze me.

Offhand, I can't think of any other film that has depicted mental illness as well as Taxi Driver and no film that attempts to show the world as seen by someone like Travis Bickle.There you go three reasons to address the most common criticisms of the film with one notable exception, its controversial ending, but THAT is a whole topic in itself which is just more proof of why Taxi Driver is so worthwhile - when viewers aren't sure what actually happens in the end (Is Travis hallucinating as he is dying? Is that what the slow moving overhead tracking shot suggests? Or does he really become a hero in the media and get realeased back into the world with his buddies? Etc, etc.) The questions and issues raised by Taxi Driver just go one and on.Now if after reading the above you still don't think Taxi Driver is a great film, I can't help you. I am NOT saying you have to like (or love) Taxi Driver just appreciate it or at least acknowledge its greatness even if it isn't your cup of tea. Actually, I don't love Taxi Driver because it doesn't lend itself to love. It is too disturbing a picture precisely because it is way too close to reality, it cuts too close to the bone for my comfort (or rather, discomfort). It is not comfortable to watch because it isn't supposed to be. So if Taxi Driver makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy it should because real life is uncomfortable and uneasy (unless you are born rich or something).Finally, after watching it again for the nth time I have begun to notice (and feel) just how smooth Taxi Driver is. The overall feel and flow of the film is incredibly smooth in which not only each scene but each and every movement and gesture flows into the other imperceptibly. Sometimes I play back scences and sequences over and over to catch how it happens. In fact, I see it happening and still can't quite figure out how it is done but I have a hunch - DeNiro. DeNiro is just amazing in this film. If you haven't done it already, watch it with the remote in your hand and play some of the scenes in slow motion and you will SEE what I am talking about. Only DeNiro could do what he does. The sheer minimalism of his performance is just stunning. How he gets so much from so little never ceases to amaze me. DeNiro's performance in Taxi Driver only reminds me of what sports announcer Curt Gowdy exclaimed after one of Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson's incredible plays in the 1970 World Series,This guy is another world!

Scott.  Scott captures the essence of Patton in his performance, from his furious seething rages, to his cocky battlefield demeanor, to his depression at his low moments.  Scott also displays the many paradoxes of Patton with near perfection.  Patton was both a gentleman and rogue, a warrior and intellectual, a villain and hero, all traits wonderfully displayed by Scott.Also, there is the underrated performance of Karl Malden as General Omar N. Bradley, Patton's friend and rival.  Malden serves as the perfect foil to Scott, much in the same way Bradley did to Patton.The directing of Franklin J. Shafer plays an importan role in the enjoyability as well.  Most notable is his use of distance to provide perspective on many of the scenes, most poigniantly in the ending sequence. Add to this an excellent script which, though written by Francis Ford Coppola, owes most of the best lines to Patton himself.  Another great quality of the film is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, which fits the scenes almost flawlessly.iPatton\/i was a movie that was not only powerful for its time, but is still powerful today.

Even at the time of it's release I thought this film, while better than the first one, was over-rated and boring with only 4 notable scenes; the rest of the time you can fast-forward. 1) I wish the producers could have stuck with the facts. Why couldn't they have picked an actual character from the series to have been the mother of Kirk's son? Even Yeoman Rand could have changed careers and she would have been recognizable enough but the arbitrary creation of Carol and David Marcus was an unnecesary distraction. David comes across as pouty and I couldn't have cared less about this character even at the end. Also, everyone knows about the Chekhov mistake as Khan regonizes him when he wasn't even in the original episode. It would've been more interesting if it were Spock who had the animal implanted in him to see how he would've fought the power of suggestion and to see what Kirk would've done.2) Too much time is spent dwelling on the Kobyashi Maru. Who cares? I understand it sets up Kirk's desire not to lose but couldn't this have been done in a more interesting way? That way you don't need Lt. Saavik as much, a mistake nearly repeated in VI with the introduction of Lt. Valeris but at least she is put to much better use. 3) For all Spock's talk about Khan's intelligence, where is the evidence? Anybody could've captured the Reliant but the fact that he doesn't change the Reliant's access code, can't steer in the Nebula and can't fire a torpedo straight during the big fight scene doesn't support this. After the attack on the Enterprise when Kirk manages to lower Reliant's shields, who cares? Khan must surely know where the bridge of the Enterprise is from his study of the engineering charts (from Space Seed)so why waste time looking for the override? Just fire. He comes off as one-dimensional. What a waste of a good performance by Montalban. Maybe having Chippendale dancers as Khan's crew wasn't a bright idea after all. A note on Captain Terrell. A wasted performance by the late great Paul Winfield. He is nothing to Kirk so why does all of a sudden, he doesn't want to shoot Kirk? I understand Chekhov's reluctance since he served with him but who's Kirk to Terrell? Just another officer. Waste him and everyone gets bumped up in rank.

Why couldn't they have picked an actual character from the series to have been the mother of Kirk's son? Even Yeoman Rand could have changed careers and she would have been recognizable enough but the arbitrary creation of Carol and David Marcus was an unnecesary distraction.

Anybody could've captured the Reliant but the fact that he doesn't change the Reliant's access code, can't steer in the Nebula and can't fire a torpedo straight during the big fight scene doesn't support this. After the attack on the Enterprise when Kirk manages to lower Reliant's shields, who cares? Khan must surely know where the bridge of the Enterprise is from his study of the engineering charts (from Space Seed)so why waste time looking for the override? Just fire. He comes off as one-dimensional. What a waste of a good performance by Montalban. Maybe having Chippendale dancers as Khan's crew wasn't a bright idea after all. A note on Captain Terrell. A wasted performance by the late great Paul Winfield. He is nothing to Kirk so why does all of a sudden, he doesn't want to shoot Kirk? I understand Chekhov's reluctance since he served with him but who's Kirk to Terrell? Just another officer. Waste him and everyone gets bumped up in rank.

It's modern, it's sinister, it's tense.  Listening to it with eyes closed, you can imagine a frantic chasing scene a cold quiet killer running after a frightened sweating guy in any sleazy areas of any big city.  Running, yes there must be some running.Watching stalwart Sir Alan Parker's movie, viewers need to be psychologically prepared for the dark elements he often employs on the, to some degree, shocking scenes.  I still cannot stomach Bob Geldof's suicide pool (Pink Floyd The Wall).Crime and punishment, humanitarianism, use of drugs, liberal and repressed societies etc can all be discussed after one has seen the movie.  I watched this one when I was about 15.  When the Turkish jailers wanted to rape Billy, I was so silly to ask my brother (who is five years younger than I am) what they were doing and he told me their intention.  Shocked.  And I more or less have very little interest in prison movie afterwards.  Later I have a chance to read a little of the book, not a very well-written one, more like a report.  The movie, at my viewing, somehow reminded me of Papillon, another escape from a foreign land.  That one is less nauseating.Seeing west Turkey some ten years ago, I talked with some Turks about the movie.  Quite a number of them watched it outside the country.  The truth is that they don't mind how ugly the west portrays their prison or even their country because the movie only told partial truth, and this has already confirmed by B Hayes himself.  According those Turks, the Turkish jailers would rather have women than men because they are not that easily available.  The west still conquers the world mass media.  Viewers have to keep their heads clear.

It's modern, it's sinister, it's tense.  Listening to it with eyes closed, you can imagine a frantic chasing scene a cold quiet killer running after a frightened sweating guy in any sleazy areas of any big city.  Running, yes there must be some running.Watching stalwart Sir Alan Parker's movie, viewers need to be psychologically prepared for the dark elements he often employs on the, to some degree, shocking scenes.  I still cannot stomach Bob Geldof's suicide pool (Pink Floyd The Wall).Crime and punishment, humanitarianism, use of drugs, liberal and repressed societies etc can all be discussed after one has seen the movie.  I watched this one when I was about 15.  When the Turkish jailers wanted to rape Billy, I was so silly to ask my brother (who is five years younger than I am) what they were doing and he told me their intention.  Shocked.  And I more or less have very little interest in prison movie afterwards.  Later I have a chance to read a little of the book, not a very well-written one, more like a report.  The movie, at my viewing, somehow reminded me of Papillon, another escape from a foreign land.  That one is less nauseating.Seeing west Turkey some ten years ago, I talked with some Turks about the movie.  Quite a number of them watched it outside the country.  The truth is that they don't mind how ugly the west portrays their prison or even their country because the movie only told partial truth, and this has already confirmed by B Hayes himself.  According those Turks, the Turkish jailers would rather have women than men because they are not that easily available.  The west still conquers the world mass media.  Viewers have to keep their heads clear.
