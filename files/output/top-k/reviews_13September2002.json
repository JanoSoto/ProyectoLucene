A cinematic tornado, this little movie, budgeted at 5 million dollars, has already earned 1 hundred million dollars and is still going strong.The Cinderella story of a Greek- American woman's ties (and binds) to her family and her quest to meet and marry the man of her dreams is the brain child of Nia Vardalos , a Second City alumnus who only a short time ago was performing stand-up comedy routines and a one-woman show based on her Greek family and upbringing. On one fateful night actress Rita Wilson caught Vardalos' show, went backstage to express her enthusiasm ( Wilson is of Greek descent ) and urged husband Tom Hanks to see the show the next night...the rest, they say, is history. Wilson and Hanks urged Vardalos to write a screenplay based on her stage comedy, whereupon the aspiring actress presented the couple with an already written script ; thus came into being what is undoubtedly the most successful rags to riches story since a down-on -his-luck actor named Sylvester Stallone penned a little number called Rocky over 25 years ago. Hanks and Wilson signed on as co-producers ; veteran t.v. director Joel Zwick assumed directorial chores and a number of terrific actors were cast to flesh out a movie with family members and other characters only alluded to on the stage. The resultant movie is a warm, mildly caustic but ultimately loving look at family dysfunction. Foutoula Portokalos ( Vadalos ) is a hostess at her father's Greek diner ; a seeming wallflower, poor Tula has seated too many parties and poured way too many coffees in her life. Bound by some invisible chain, her parents, siblings and assorted aunts, uncles and cousins (all named Nick, by the way) are resigned to the fact that always reliable stay -at -home Tula will forever pour the coffee and never leave the nest. When a drop dead handsome customer enters the restaurant one night to join a colleague for dinner, Tula is thunderstruck. Completely stymied by the man's presence, Tula can't even pour coffee into the man's cup and quickly makes a beeline for the hostess station. When the two men leave the diner, Tula is left with a lovely vision and the all-too-real prospect of living out the rest of her life as a lonely spinster in Diner purgatory. That is as much of the story as I'll reveal, because this movie is too funny to ruin with a long-winded rundown of the plot ; not that the viewer won't be able to surmise very quickly where the screenplay is heading. MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING is very broadly played but in the finest sitcom tradition. There is much ethnic humor, some of it repeated a little too often and some of the jokes fall flat. But most of the time this is a hilarious comedy that everyone should be able to identify with. Nia Vardalos invites you into her family's world and although it is specifically a Greek one, the universal problem of parental control and children wanting to live their own lives is an instantly recognizable one. Tula's parents are played to perfection by Michael Constantine ( from Room 222) and Lanie Kazan, a wonderful singer and character actress who has graced many a movie in the past. Andrea Martin , another brilliant Second City performer, is priceless as Tula's opinionated but lovable Aunt Voula. Louis Mandylor as Tula's overly protective brother steal's every scene he's in. As to what happened to that handsome man in the diner....well, you'll have to see the movie.

Not at all. There's a part of me that thinks it just had to have been sappy, derivative and manipulative.  Yet, from it's opening sequence- in which mentally retarded Sam is left on the street corner to care for his newborn daughter on his own- this thing grabbed me.  The whole mentally retarded shtick has been done so to death in movies we sometimes forget what a good performance looks like. Sean Penn plays Sam as a real person, not a caricature, very much disappearing into the role. Surprisingly Michelle Pfeifer is almost equally good in her own.  I am Sam in many ways becomes about Pfeifer's character, Rita and her feelings of inadequacy as a parent.  Pfeifer and Penn are clearly parallels of the same person. It's like Director and co-writer Jessie Nelson is using Sam like a metaphor- he looks and acts how Rita (and many parents) feel most times.  The plot concerns Rita fighting to help Sam keep custody of his daughter because as the state sees it foster care is better than a mentally retarded father. The acting all around is top notch. Richard Schiff also appears to just do what he always does, as does Laura Dern (a fantastic actress who just will not step into the spotlight- continually taking these near-cameo small roles at the peripheral of the stories).  Little Dakota Fanning makes a huge impression as intelligent, spunky Lucy. She has some of the most memorable moments in the film.    The Beetles music is perfectly suited, but I'm split on the visuals.  On one hand it's nice for Nelson to do what she can to go the extra mile and jazz up the cinematography in a film that clearly doesn't need it.  On the other hand the glossy camera work is sometimes distracting- pulling you out of the film to try to figure out what your looking at. She clearly wanted that documentary look, but this movie is about emotions, not celluloid. For better or worse, it looks like Traffic.   This movie is, by no means, a profound drama. It's melodrama, which is not a bad thing at all just a matter of taste. But it is just made so incredibly well. It isn't the typical Lifetime Movie dreck. It is genuinely funny at times and tear jerking others. While it's courtroom scenes are fairly standard, there are also some pretty imaginative sequences in here. The best of which is the finale- a low key, but adorable montage involving Lucy- it comes up on us when we least suspect and is the perfect way to end a movie like this. The characters are all wholly lovable, the moral is completely resonant and, while the pace occasionally drags, it's pitch is just perfect (it's crowd-pleasing but never quite panders). The dialogue is intelligent and seems honest. Most importantly it kept a cynical and jaded moviegoer like myself entertained for it's entire long length. A virtually flawless film for fans of the genera and non-fans might give it a chance and be pleasantly surprised.

Now, after viewing it for a second time with a more open mind (and lack of remembrance of the King story), I am much more accepting of 'Apt Pupil'.  Bryan Singer has created a movie that effectively succeeds in displaying mental games and the resulting horrors and anxieties.  Much of the film is dedicated to an intense back-and-forth psychological battle between the two main characters, played beautifully by Brad Renfro and Ian McKellan.  But much of the greatness of 'Apt Pupil' lies in the depiction of a curious youth during his most crucial stage in the maturity process.  A stage where one boy's single decision has the possibility of changing the face of his whole life.  Also, it is a stage where evil tendencies and curiosities have the steady ground to solidify within one's personality.

And this film definitely lives up to the hopes and dreams of Tolkien fans for its visual splendor. Technology has advanced to the point to make an attempt at bringing Middle-Earth to life plausible. This film does so quite valiantly and with very few visual flaws.There were many things that I thought were done very well.  The battle with the Balrog was perfect.  Galadriel's tempting by the ring was also very good.  The times that Frodo puts on the ring, the dark fury that envelops him was a superb interpretation.  The glimpses we get of Gollum are fantastic - I can't wait for the Two Towers to see him in all his slimy glory.  And when Bilbo sees the ring and wants it back and for an instant turns Gollum-like himself was disturbingly perfect.But unfortunately as Mr. Tolkien is no longer with us, he could not at least have been a technical consultant on the project.  I was moderately disappointed in the screenplay (read adaptation for that's what this is - an adaptation).  If they were to bring the story contained in the Fellowship of the Ring to the screen completely, this film could easily have been six hours long.  I understand removing elements that do not carry the plot along, but I cannot fathom why so many character development elements were left out.  And I am sorry to see certain plot elements now occurring for completely different reasons and certain minor elements that come into play later in the story omitted and glossed over.And the verses were left out.  Many of the characters in the story used verse to tell the others about various pieces of the back-story.  The magical element of 'legends coming to life' is not allowed to appear.  And so much of the emotion was left out.  The development of the relationships between many of the characters is gone and I can understand why many that have written reviews claim that the characters are 2-dimensional.  And the whole thing with Lurtz (the Uruk-Hai archer) was weird.But one of the changes that I thought was well done from an emotional standpoint was Peter Jackson's \/ Sean Bean's version of Booramir.  In the books, Booramir was pretty much a jerk to his last breath.  But the fall of Booramir that we see on the screen was fantastic.  The whole scene in slow motion as he keeps getting struck with arrows, one after another, and each time has to fight to regain his strength to defend the half lings still stuns me.  I sat in the theater with my mouth hanging open and have had a similar reaction every time I have seen it on DVD since.  The Booramir we see at the end is a valliant man, truly sorry for his failing, and his reconcilement with Aragorn were much better than originally presented in the book.If you are new to the world of Middle-Earth, you will definitely want to see this film as it is truly a technical achievement.  But do so with an interpreter (someone well versed in Tolkien lore).  I went to see it with my wife and ended up explaining the film for several hours after it ended.If you are a Tolkien fanatic as I am, you must see this film.

This complex, engaging work functions on many levels - as future prophecy, social commentary, political satire and anthropological philosophy.***Spoilers***The machinations of the amoral Alex centre around random acts of violence, perpetrated not out of malice but simply for the sheer thrill. 'Alex' (which in Greek means 'without law') embodies the irrepressible human spirit at its best, in his love of Beethoven, and its worst, in his penchant for rape and the old ultra-violence. Alexander De Large, an obvious play on Alexander The Great,  represents the 'delightful orange' as it is had in Burgess' book, unspoilt by regulation.The similarities to Alexander The Great are shown when Alex' leadership of the droogs is put to the test - faced with the Gordian (`George-ian'?) knot of dissent among the ranks,  Alex responds with the Alexandrian solution of beating the two into submission. But this first-seen attempt at enforcing order fails, as will occur again in the film... and Alex is left, betrayed by his droogs, to be picked up by the police.A key point much glossed over by detractors of the film is the remorse Alex shows when he learns that he has murdered the cat woman. This may be seen in two lights on the one hand, if he shows remorse, he cannot be viewed as a total monster, on the other if he knows what he does is wrong, he must face responsibility for his actions. This dichotomy is central to the film - the conflict between the optimistic and pessimistic views of humanity.Also of note is the rank hypocrisy of the police and Alex' Corrections Officer. The police brutalise Alex, and Deltoid spits in his face. They are in reality no more inherently decent than the droogs themselves - they merely work for the other side.In prison, Alex is subjected to total dehumanisation, becoming Prisoner #655321, and is treated like a child. However, as humanity has always done, Alex adapts himself to the new regime, currying favour with the prison chaplain, performing duties and studying the bible. But it is palpably false - he enjoys the bible, yes, but mostly the Old Testament, which features more violence. The only part of the New Testament he really enjoys is the crucifixion, seeing himself `helping in like, and even taking charge... dressed in the height of Roman fashion.'Once volunteered for the Ludovico technique, Alex is injected with drugs and forced to view violent films scored with the very music he loves. An interesting thing to note is the eye-drops being put in Alex' eyes to prevent his retinas from scratching - the net effect is that Dr Brodsky is forcing Alex to watch violent films, and putting tears in his eyes. Facing the prospect of prolonged sessions, Alex pleads for mercy, calling the methodology a 'sin', to which Brodsky responds `What's all this about sin?' Again, those in control of Alex are shown to be no more moral than he.Alex then claims to be reformed, seeing that what he has done in the past is wrong, `terribly wrong! It's wrong because it's like against society.' This is an obvious feint, but it is significant that a voluntary confession of wrongdoing is rejected in favour of enforced morality.When Alex' complete passivity is demonstrated, his tormentor embodies repulsive Middle-England toadishness. Clearly the Ludovico technique will render the  common criminal as putty in the hands of the  professional (the jackbooted, heel-clicking prison officer approves). Hilariously the actor, when bowing to applause for his performance, generously acknowledges Alex - politics has been replaced by show business. And a more sinister aspect of the treatment is revealed Alex is unable to feel lustful thoughts he experiences the same feelings of horror as when exposed to violence. The chaplain's objections are swiftly shouted down by the Minister of the Interior 'The point is that it works!'Released into society, Alex is rejected by his parents - again the society against which he has rebelled is lacking only when Alex is really helpless and genuinely needs his parents do they abandon him. The irrepressible human spirit strikes out truly alone for the first time.The sense of justice felt at the scene in which Alex is attacked by vengeful septuagenarian tramps is quickly replaced by a feeling of uncertainty - since Alex is truly helpless, how can revenge be morally justified? Willingly or no, he has changed. And it feels horribly wrong for Georgie and Dim to not only escape punishment, but to become enforcers of the law. But as Alex approaches the 'HOME' he ransacked earlier in the film, we sense that a full circle is being described.That it is Alex' newly-returned sense of carefree well-being that allows the writer to identify Alex as his wife's rapist is a wonderful irony - th e same carefree spirit caused such horror and mayhem the last time we heard 'Singin' In The Rain'.Clearly F. Alexander is no more for 'the people' than the oppressive Government he opposes 'Not the people, they'd exchange freedom for a quieter life.' Again hypocrisy is shown at every hand's turn. Alex is again tortured by those who claim to wish him well.Once at the hospital, it quickly becomes clear that Alex has been changed back to his old self again, in the hilarious scene with the pictures for him to supply words for. The rather heavy-handed satire of the now-apologetic Minister literally spoon-feeding Alex is something that has perhaps not aged well, but the overall idea is conveyed excellently. Again PR is substituted for politics, and we learn that F. Alexander has been arrested ('for his own protection', according to the Minister, but we can't help remembering the 'political offenders' of whom he spoke earlier).
