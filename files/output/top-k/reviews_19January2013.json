I was scanning through the IMDb top 250 as I often do when I spotted a movie from 1942, Casablanca. I didn't know anything about it except the description. The reason I stopped was because of the extremely high score it had. How could a movie this old be as good as my many favorites? Weeks later I spotted it at the thrift store for fifty cents. I thought I might as well give it a shot for that. I'm glad that I did. Yet another old movie that sheds its age simply because of the compelling story telling.The story takes place in a city named Casablanca. The Germans are trying to arrest two men; Ugarte and Victor Laszlo. They suspect Ugarte has two letters of transit which allow the holder to move freely through German controlled countries so they can get to America. He plans on selling them to Victor Laszlo. Ugarte and Laszlo plan on meeting at Rick's Café Américain a night club of sorts. When they arrive to make the exchange is when the story really takes off. The owner of Rick's Café, Rick Blane, is a very interesting character. You can't quite tell what he's going to do next. He's played by Humphrey Bogart, who does an amazing job playing the cool customer from New York. You don't know whose side he's on, as he says I stick my neck out for no one The other characters all have great performances as well. Laszlo, Isls Lund and the French captain all add a lot of character to the movie. One person that I loved was the piano player at the club. He didn't have many lines, but with what he did say I found him to have excellent character. You could tell that he's a great friend of Rick's. The French Captain Louis Renault was great. You'll hate him, love him, and back again. He had a great acting dynamic with Rick; they played off each other so well you would think they actually knew each other for a long time. Conrad Veidt, the German leader was more of a political threat than a physical one. He was always bothering the heroes of the story, always trying his best to make their lives miserable. One of the best scenes was when Veidt was leading a sort of pub song with his men at the nightclub and Laszlo leads a chorus of his own overpowering the German's voice. I thought that scene was particularly funny.The storyline is what really shines in this one. Movies made this long ago couldn't rely on special effects. The dialog and script really are delivered perfectly. If you like a story where you can try to figure out how everything all fits together than you'll like this. One aspect of the story involves a love triangle. As you might know I'm not too big on love stories, but this one actually makes sense. A lot of movies have a love story shoe horned in just because; in this one the story truly is interesting. I was honestly wondering what was going to happen with this love triangle believe it or not. My only gripe with it was in the execution. Sometimes it had a small cheese factor. The eye rolls weren't as prevalent as most films for sure. I also want to mention the ending of the film. It tied everything together perfectly. We got closure on all the major plot points. The major characters get their subplots closed. In the end, I felt like everything ended the way I wanted it to end and I felt satisfied.There isn't much to say about the technical aspects of the film. Basically since it's so old all I was hoping for was that graphics wouldn't subtract from the movie. For the most part it's not too distracting. A few of the gunshots looked really unrealistic. Hey, in the end it was more about the story anyway.If you're looking for an old movie that will surprise you with its complex story and great acting you won't be disappointed with this one.

In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure.Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen\/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine.As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha.The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith.Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the Whistle While You Work, Heigh-Ho, I'm wishing or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one.The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters.

The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character.The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel.Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong.The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission.For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!

He plays a leader of a group of people doing scientific expedition in the Antarctic. I think it's safe to say that there is some Thing on the loose. A monster that can imitate the form of any person or animal. This ability is reason why the film is so amazing. At any moment you don't know who is a thing or who is human.

By the end I was holding my breath to see what would happen to the main character. The gruesome deaths and the monster might be too much for some people. The Thing is essentially a giant pile of gore with tentacles. The special effects still hold up today. I was cringing in a couple of the scenes. This is one of the goriest films I've ever watched.

Or is it his sudden love for wild-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette, who did a mini-run of playing women who fell only for comic-book\/movie geeks with more guts than attention to detail; see the film Ed Wood, from the following year) that makes him stand up to possessive pimps, and skip to Hollywood to sell stolen cocaine? Clarence's charisma seems at first a bit implausible; his adeptness at surviving lethal situations would better suit a guy who has stolen drugs and call-girl from gangsters every other day. But Clarence is that much more charming as we realize he is simply unleashing the superman who has been waiting inside him for just such a chance to battle his way past anything that wants to spill his entrails. Clarence and Alabama are too likable for a viewer to want them any other way; the more they run from impending torture and death and gangster smart-aleckiness as only Tarantino can write such stuff, the more it seems like just a trick to lure various creeps into their clutches. The lowlifes never quite see what hits them--if Clarence and Alabama are good at one thing, it's being underestimated. Sometimes this even compensates for Clarence constantly leaving a trail that Wrongway Feldman could follow.One of the best scenes involves a cadre of gunsels, led by Christopher Walken, getting led to Clarence's father, played Dennis Hopper, thanks to Clarence's carelessness. The gangsters want the father to lead them to the son and his new girl. Walken using scare tactics on Dennis Hopper--I mean, you could flip the roles around and have just as terrific a scene...and heck, it takes a Walken to scare a Hopper. Anyway, once that bit of ugly words and deeds comes to its conclusion, James Gandolfini gets sent off on his own to get the cocaine and bury our brave couple. Full marks to a superb Gandolfini, who corners Alabama\/Patricia Arquette while Clarence is off in some washroom reading a book--ack!, no wait, he's off getting munchies. Now, ahem, James Gandolfini versus Patricia Arquette seems more of an easy bet than sorting out odds on Walken versus Hopper. That said, the scene contains a few surprises, and where it looked as if any later scene involving Clarence selling a monster bag of coke to a sleazy movie producer would be minus an Alabama, our wild, plucky heroine with the cocaine shows her hidden side too.Tony Scott would later riff on his own finale to this movie by essentially borrowing it for another fun movie, Enemy Of The State, but both versions demonstrate that the bigger the crowd present for a drug buy (at least in the case of True Romance), the more rewarding for anyone who gets to watch it from a safe vantage point. The kitchen sink is not present for the final stand-off, but everyone else with a gun and an ego shows up. Perhaps Clarence and Alabama's dreams of flying to some tropical paradise with a couple hundred grand have finally led to a situation they can't charm their way out of conflagration incarnate.This is a cool, slick crime movie starring a loving couple who, though they are doing bad things to get their own slice of the pie, are not doing unspeakably horrendous things for more than their slice, while enjoying some nasty slicing. This separates our lovable anti- heroes from most of the other characters, and gives a fun, bubbly duo to cheer for, while the rats follow the cheese. Swiss cheese.

That's not to say that Henry isn't disturbing because it is, it really is! It's style reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a grainy documentary kind of feel to it. It gives gritty realism and makes all the disgraceful images on show look even more depraved than they actually are. Henry is truly a film like no other and it's amazing that even after 25 years it still has the power to shock.The opening of Henry sets the tone perfectly so if you don't like the look of it, get out of there! (Or should that be get that disc out of your player?) A series of graphic images of people Henry has murdered with some horrible sound effects over the top of the victims dying, almost giving the bodies a sense of life, just showing the extent to how much empathy Henry has. Which isn't a lot. Sice this is a sort of case study or biography it's essential that the main character is interesting and he really is! The chat between Henry and Becky at the start is completely gripping and involving, and I found myself being transfixed throughout the film.The characters of Otis and Becky are also quite interesting with Otis being (in many respects) more psychotic than Henry is. Otis is definitely the fool of the film but that doesn't make him any less terrifying. Michael Rooker's performance of Henry is pretty outstanding. He's completely chilling and gives a haunting portrayal that will certainly leave an imprint on you. I also liked the way the film sort of gave us reason to understand why Henry commits such acts, but never does it condone his behaviour.Henry goes out of its why to de-glamorise violence. It's certainly not entertaining in the slightest and some scenes leave you spitting in disgust (metaphorically I hope!) The home invasion scene is disturbing on so many levels and is definitely the most shocking scene in the film and one of the most shocking moments I've seen on any film. It's also cleverly done though, making us horror fans question why we watch violence and how it really isn't as entertaining when done in real life. It's scenes like this that propels Henry into being one of the best serial killer films of all time.Although the film does feel directionless at times, it does carry a certain unpredictability that gets lost in some films today. It's a truly engrossing film but one not made for entertainment purposes. It gives a fascinating insight into the day in the life of a serial killer, yet it doesn't alienate us with psychological explanations, instead his actions are left ambiguous allowing audiences to make there own minds up as to why Henry is so depraved. It's an extremely brave film and one that you're sure not forget in a short while. My score of 8 is incredibly solid and almost verging onto a 9. Check it out!

It's a truly engrossing film but one not made for entertainment purposes. It gives a fascinating insight into the day in the life of a serial killer, yet it doesn't alienate us with psychological explanations, instead his actions are left ambiguous allowing audiences to make there own minds up as to why Henry is so depraved.

The way people were going on about it I was wondering whether or not to give it a chance! But after all the critical acclaim this film was getting I had to seek it out. That's not to say that Henry isn't disturbing because it is, it really is! It's style reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a grainy documentary kind of feel to it. It gives gritty realism and makes all the disgraceful images on show look even more depraved than they actually are. Henry is truly a film like no other and it's amazing that even after 25 years it still has the power to shock.The opening of Henry sets the tone perfectly so if you don't like the look of it, get out of there! (Or should that be get that disc out of your player?) A series of graphic images of people Henry has murdered with some horrible sound effects over the top of the victims dying, almost giving the bodies a sense of life, just showing the extent to how much empathy Henry has. Which isn't a lot. Sice this is a sort of case study or biography it's essential that the main character is interesting and he really is! The chat between Henry and Becky at the start is completely gripping and involving, and I found myself being transfixed throughout the film.The characters of Otis and Becky are also quite interesting with Otis being (in many respects) more psychotic than Henry is. Otis is definitely the fool of the film but that doesn't make him any less terrifying. Michael Rooker's performance of Henry is pretty outstanding. He's completely chilling and gives a haunting portrayal that will certainly leave an imprint on you. I also liked the way the film sort of gave us reason to understand why Henry commits such acts, but never does it condone his behaviour.Henry goes out of its why to de-glamorise violence. It's certainly not entertaining in the slightest and some scenes leave you spitting in disgust (metaphorically I hope!) The home invasion scene is disturbing on so many levels and is definitely the most shocking scene in the film and one of the most shocking moments I've seen on any film.

Even if the path traveled by writer and director Kevin Reynolds isn't one so original and very reminder of memorable classics from the 1970's (there's so much of The Deer Hunter and American Graffiti in this), it's still a great film to be seen time and time again.In 1971, a bunch of good friends is trying to have one last blast before going to Vietnam and deal with the unknown that surrounds their lives, not only when it comes to go to a war but also with their relationships, their friendship, and the hardest transition of growing up, leave college and the crazy days of parties behind, facing responsibilities and set a goal for themselves. Led by the wild and rebellion Gardner (Kevin Costner, in one his earliest leading roles), the group - composed with the serious Philip (Judd Nelson), Kenneth (Sam Robards), Dorman (Chuck Bush) and the stoned\/practically absent Lester (Brian Cesak) - heads down to Mexico where it was decided that at least two of them will desert from their military duties.

I dislike films that spoon-fed the audience and telegraph their punches, but there were so many elements that needed further exploration.For example, the character of Carla left me feeling disturbed, not because of her behaviour but because her character was so under-developed. All we know of her background is that her father is a suicidal inmate of a mental institution and that she is sleeping with her mother's boyfriend. Why is this girl so damaged? Her behaviour is alarming - as a viewer, I need something in order to see her as a person rather than a freakish collection of traits. Daniel wants to save her life desperately in the end - why? The film does not show there to be any genuine connection between the two of them - it seems she's increasingly seduced by Judaism and he's increasingly disinterested in her.This flaw is present in every aspect of the film - we see Danny as perhaps a 13 year old intelligent student with controversial thoughts on Judaism, and next as a twenty-something neo-nazi. Why? Perhaps the writer\/director could say that it's more interesting to leave this open but to me this is a cop-out since it's a difficult journey to chart in such a short time. I believe this arc is more than possible, but the details of his journey are important. Perhaps they could explain away other flaws such as why he is willing to blow up a synagogue but cries when his fellow Nazis desecrate the Torah. There are issues like this throughout - he is clearly conflicted, but neither the writing nor the direction let us in to his mind.One thing that is clear throughout is that Judaism is deeply entrenched within him - his hatred and anger is towards the Jewish people for what he perceives to be their weakness. From the start of the film, he is desperate for them to fight back, to take a stand against their repeated and constant persecution. His desire to kill a Jew is another interesting point - does he want to kill Jews or put them into a scenario where they can fight back? It's interesting that he sees them as weak when the Jews within the film are frequently portrayed as being strong for precisely the same reasons, especially in the scene with the holocaust survivors. This scene, along with the opening and the initial synagogue scene were enormously unsettling the film provoked a strong physical reaction in me, leaving me sickened by much of the dialogue and action. However, I did not feel mentally challenged as, without elaborating on many important issues, it felt somehow vacuous. The ending fulfils two of Danny's prophecies that he will kill a Jew, and that he will kill himself if his background is publicly revealed. Danny kills only himself and directs his hatred to its ultimate source himself. This would be far more powerful if we understood his reasons for hating his religion and himself. As it stands, the only reason I felt anything was Gosling's exceptional performance which manages to strike a balance between vitriol and deep sadness.I can only conclude, or hope, that the film has been heavily cut. The meat of an excellent film is here, but it's missing the skeleton that would make it great. There are many comparisons here to American History X - The Believer is perhaps a more honest, and certainly a more complex, film in that it avoids the easy resolution (Danny does not reject his entire ideology but succumbs to his own confusion). However, it's not the better film - this is a shame, as it could have been, with improvements to the script. Gosling's performance is powerful and believable, the content is intelligent and thoroughly researched, the outlook is risky and unflinching. The problem is, we don't ever get to really understand the protagonist as we must in order to be deeply affected.Therefore, this film - which could have been a 10 with some attention - barely scrapes a 6, and I'd say Gosling is responsible for the majority of that, alongside an interesting premise and some excellent, highly intelligent dialogue. It's definitely worth watching, but be prepared for some problems.

All we know of her background is that her father is a suicidal inmate of a mental institution and that she is sleeping with her mother's boyfriend. Why is this girl so damaged? Her behaviour is alarming - as a viewer, I need something in order to see her as a person rather than a freakish collection of traits. Daniel wants to save her life desperately in the end - why? The film does not show there to be any genuine connection between the two of them - it seems she's increasingly seduced by Judaism and he's increasingly disinterested in her.This flaw is present in every aspect of the film - we see Danny as perhaps a 13 year old intelligent student with controversial thoughts on Judaism, and next as a twenty-something neo-nazi. Why? Perhaps the writer\/director could say that it's more interesting to leave this open but to me this is a cop-out since it's a difficult journey to chart in such a short time. I believe this arc is more than possible, but the details of his journey are important. Perhaps they could explain away other flaws such as why he is willing to blow up a synagogue but cries when his fellow Nazis desecrate the Torah. There are issues like this throughout - he is clearly conflicted, but neither the writing nor the direction let us in to his mind.One thing that is clear throughout is that Judaism is deeply entrenched within him - his hatred and anger is towards the Jewish people for what he perceives to be their weakness. From the start of the film, he is desperate for them to fight back, to take a stand against their repeated and constant persecution. His desire to kill a Jew is another interesting point - does he want to kill Jews or put them into a scenario where they can fight back? It's interesting that he sees them as weak when the Jews within the film are frequently portrayed as being strong for precisely the same reasons, especially in the scene with the holocaust survivors. This scene, along with the opening and the initial synagogue scene were enormously unsettling the film provoked a strong physical reaction in me, leaving me sickened by much of the dialogue and action. However, I did not feel mentally challenged as, without elaborating on many important issues, it felt somehow vacuous. The ending fulfils two of Danny's prophecies that he will kill a Jew, and that he will kill himself if his background is publicly revealed. Danny kills only himself and directs his hatred to its ultimate source himself. This would be far more powerful if we understood his reasons for hating his religion and himself. As it stands, the only reason I felt anything was Gosling's exceptional performance which manages to strike a balance between vitriol and deep sadness.I can only conclude, or hope, that the film has been heavily cut. The meat of an excellent film is here, but it's missing the skeleton that would make it great. There are many comparisons here to American History X - The Believer is perhaps a more honest, and certainly a more complex, film in that it avoids the easy resolution (Danny does not reject his entire ideology but succumbs to his own confusion). However, it's not the better film - this is a shame, as it could have been, with improvements to the script. Gosling's performance is powerful and believable, the content is intelligent and thoroughly researched, the outlook is risky and unflinching. The problem is, we don't ever get to really understand the protagonist as we must in order to be deeply affected.Therefore, this film - which could have been a 10 with some attention - barely scrapes a 6, and I'd say Gosling is responsible for the majority of that, alongside an interesting premise and some excellent, highly intelligent dialogue. It's definitely worth watching, but be prepared for some problems.

It had it's flaws, but it was enjoyable and had some cool dream sequences. While this one isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, it still isn't good. This movie really wasn't scary. The only parts that managed to scare me was the kids singing Freddy's song (Although that always scares me.) and the shower scene was kind of scary. Most of the dream scenes were weird and not in a good way like the dinner scene and some of them were unintentionally funny like the driving scene. I'm usually not the guy to complain about pacing, but I thought it was really off in this movie and it made the movie feel longer than it actually was. I also thought that Freddy Kreuger was a laughing stock in this movie. His wisecracks worked much better in the previous movie. You might think my rating is kind from someone who is a fan of the series, but it never really crosses the line of bad. The special effects weren't bad and it at least tries to be creative although the most creative scene was the comic book one and I still laughed at that one. Also the unintentional humor made me keep my rating. I would actually recommend this to fans of the series because it is so weird that you just have to see for yourself.

Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic.The acting is very good, considering the story evolves around 3 kids and an alien friend. They are all energetic, excited and simply have passion for their roles.The story itself is simply brilliant. When I first watched E.T, I expected it to be one boy, who must by himself venture to return his alien friend home, simply due to the fact that no-one believes him nor will they assist him. Every time I would guess this will be next, the plot completely takes an unexpected turn, making the film all the better. The story itself is very touching and simply a joy to watch! Nothing went wrong with this film. It was funny, it was sad, it was exciting and simply a treat to the watch! All the characters are extremely brilliant in this film. We got the little sisters, Gerly. She's awesome. She has some touching moments with E.T, such as when she teaches him to speak. She is funny and simply a great addition to the story. Then we have Mike, Elliot's older brother who seems like a bully but ends up growing a heart due to this little alien friend. His character was the most unexpected to me as I expected him to go spreading rumors about everything and bail out on Elliot.Steven Spielberg's directing for the film is brilliant. Though the film takes a while to get going, in fact over an hour, this film is packed with excitement, humor, emotion that its purely great, unlike other classics such as 2001 A Space Odyssey where nothing happens.Even though this isn't even worth mentioning, John Williams soundtrack for the movie is absolutely amazing! It kills on every scene, especially when played more intensely! The film is made all the more better as this soundtrack not only makes you love the movie more, it also makes you imagine soundtracks such as Williams' classic Star Wars and Indiana Jones soundtrack.Overall, E.T The Extra Terrestrial is directed by one of the greatest, if not the greatest movie director of all time who brought to us one of his finest movies, making this one of the greatest movies.

But Hell On Earth made me sick, and I'm not blaming the gore. The acting was horrendous, the designs on the new Cenobites looked completely half- assed and looked like something from a MadTV parody sketch of Hellraiser, rather than a REAL installment to the one of the most imaginative and interesting horror franchises of all time.Pinhead, who used to be a calm, intelligent and somewhat wise villain that loosely acted as an anti-hero helping Kirsty suck her sick-minded uncle and love-struck step-mother back into the box (as seen in the first two films). But in Hell On Earth, he is morphed into a dull, one-sided slasher villain who just randomly kills whenever he feels like it (aka what the Pinhead character is the EXACT OPPOSITE of). Even in the audio commentary included on the DVD, Doug Bradley (Pinhead) displayed his displeasure of his performance in HOE.Overall, there are some FEW interesting ideas wandering around the dull story and the score is great too. But the horrible acting, the lazy designs on the new Cenobites, the dull approach on Pinhead and the poor script killed this film for me and is, in my opinion and hopefully everyone else's, the worst installment in the Hellraiser franchise...
