No, seriously, that was just supposed to be a joke. The ONLY movie I know The Hotel New Hampshire can be compared to is The World According to Garp - as this one based on a novel by John Irving.Sometimes this movie makes you think that it's a mediocre and senseless one. That it's gross and abnormal. But that is John Irving! Like in Garp, sex plays a central role in New Hampshire - and it's turned upside down. In Garp, Glenn Close *raped* a dying man. In this movie, Jodie Foster is raped, she and her brother (Rob Lowe) want to make love and know that they will eventually - and they tell each other. They also tell each other everything about their sexual relationships, they talk about whom they fancy and how they should make love with them. Sex is always present in the development of the characters, but at another level as normally, i.e. as the most normal thing of the world, basically.The main reason why that strange movie works is that the characters are very interesting. They are grotesque, alright, but something makes them real. The point is, that the characters in this movie are allowed to dream and even to be really mad. However, there are frontiers to their freedom, it's just not the same frontiers as we know. They make the frontiers themselves. Their frontiers allow the siblings to make love - on ONE single looong afternoon. And that scene is not as disturbing as it is kind of beautiful and touching, because THESE characters CAN do this! It's the *radicals* in Vienna who bring us back to the real world - still in a grotesque way. Well, and there are sooo many important characters in this movie - that makes it!The actors are fabulous. Jodie Foster can never be bad, Rob Lowe is believeable and Amanda Plummer is as good as always. A real stand-out is young Jennie Dundas. About twelve or how old she was then, she looks so adult in terms. She does not have to hide opposite stars of Jodie Foster's kind here, she is really great. What she does is make a quite unreal character come to life - quietly but impressive and likeable. Well, it's no normal movie and there should not be many more of its kind. But, though confusing and gross, there are so many things that you must see. The characters, the actors, the freedom to be mad. Almost as good as Garp; there may be worse movies that I rated 8 out of 10.

In 1975, Jaws was a film with better special effects overall than anyone had seen before, and when Star Wars was released two years later, it took these latest advancements of special effects into space, where it would change the way people looked at special effects.  Obviously it wasn't exactly as real as it would look if it were actually happening, and it may have had some noticeable flaws, but it did take the first step towards the realistic special effects we see today. If not for Star Wars, people would have continued using the special effects that were just enough to give you the gist of what was supposedly happening.  Because of the fact that these effects, though cutting-edge at the time, would be dated now, the Special Edition was released in 1997 in order to maintain its impressiveness, with updated special effects that are as impressive by today's standards as the originals were in 1977.  Although some people thought the story itself was pretty corny, I think it appealed to people with open minds.  After all, that has always been the basic purpose of science fiction.  The force is the reason for the most part that some people feel this way, but I don't think it is as out there as some people do.  One thing the force can supposedly be made to do is telekinesis, which has obviously been thought of before because there's a word for it.  Not that anyone really takes the force seriously in real life, but I doubt anyone can go out and prove conclusively that it doesn't exist in any form, so it doesn't suspend THAT much disbelief.  There is some really good acting in the film, such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), but I believe the most notable performance is Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  Vader is one of not very many movie villains that has been remembered for so long, and he is one that can really scare an audience with his presence.  John Williams' music for him does a good job of representing how ruthless he is, although the famous Imperial March wasn't introduced until The Empire Strikes Back (1980).  Star Wars, although it was the first to be released in the series, is actually part four of a six chapter saga.  The reason this was the first film to be released is because it is really the only one that starts out in such a way that you can get away with not already knowing the story so far, and also has a happy ending with relatively few loose ends. It was because writer\/director George Lucas was not sure how well it would do in the box-office or if he'd be allowed by 20th Century Fox to complete the trilogy since it was new ground for filmmaking that he made this decision.  He did, however, leave enough loose ends that could be expanded into the rest of his already conceived saga just in case the film was as successful as his friend Steven Spielberg was confident it would be.  As it turned out, despite the setback of having a pretty small budget, it was more successful than Lucas imagined.  I don't understand the fact that so many people are obsessed with every little detail of Star Wars and know every little trivial fact about these films, nor do I with all the Star Trek fans, but I did think the movie was great, as well as the movies that followed it.  It's too bad that a science fiction movie this spectacular will never win an academy award (or be nominated, for that matter) for best picture, but it seems no science fiction or horror film ever will just because too many people consider such films automatically unworthy just because of its genre (especially horror), but if ever a science fiction film deserved one, it would be Star Wars A New Hope.  If you're someone who doesn't like science fiction, then this film might not make much of an impression on you but if you are one of the few sci-fi fans who hasn't seen this film, then although you may have missed it in the theater where it was much more amazing than it could be on video, you'd better see this film, then the others if you want to know what science fiction has been all about all these years.

The reason this was the first film to be released is because it is really the only one that starts out in such a way that you can get away with not already knowing the story so far, and also has a happy ending with relatively few loose ends. It was because writer\/director George Lucas was not sure how well it would do in the box-office or if he'd be allowed by 20th Century Fox to complete the trilogy since it was new ground for filmmaking that he made this decision.  He did, however, leave enough loose ends that could be expanded into the rest of his already conceived saga just in case the film was as successful as his friend Steven Spielberg was confident it would be.  As it turned out, despite the setback of having a pretty small budget, it was more successful than Lucas imagined.  I don't understand the fact that so many people are obsessed with every little detail of Star Wars and know every little trivial fact about these films, nor do I with all the Star Trek fans, but I did think the movie was great, as well as the movies that followed it.  It's too bad that a science fiction movie this spectacular will never win an academy award (or be nominated, for that matter) for best picture, but it seems no science fiction or horror film ever will just because too many people consider such films automatically unworthy just because of its genre (especially horror), but if ever a science fiction film deserved one, it would be Star Wars A New Hope.  If you're someone who doesn't like science fiction, then this film might not make much of an impression on you but if you are one of the few sci-fi fans who hasn't seen this film, then although you may have missed it in the theater where it was much more amazing than it could be on video, you'd better see this film, then the others if you want to know what science fiction has been all about all these years.

In 1975, Jaws was a film with better special effects overall than anyone had seen before, and when Star Wars was released two years later, it took these latest advancements of special effects into space, where it would change the way people looked at special effects.  Obviously it wasn't exactly as real as it would look if it were actually happening, and it may have had some noticeable flaws, but it did take the first step towards the realistic special effects we see today. If not for Star Wars, people would have continued using the special effects that were just enough to give you the gist of what was supposedly happening.  Because of the fact that these effects, though cutting-edge at the time, would be dated now, the Special Edition was released in 1997 in order to maintain its impressiveness, with updated special effects that are as impressive by today's standards as the originals were in 1977.  Although some people thought the story itself was pretty corny, I think it appealed to people with open minds.  After all, that has always been the basic purpose of science fiction.  The force is the reason for the most part that some people feel this way, but I don't think it is as out there as some people do.  One thing the force can supposedly be made to do is telekinesis, which has obviously been thought of before because there's a word for it.  Not that anyone really takes the force seriously in real life, but I doubt anyone can go out and prove conclusively that it doesn't exist in any form, so it doesn't suspend THAT much disbelief.  There is some really good acting in the film, such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), but I believe the most notable performance is Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  Vader is one of not very many movie villains that has been remembered for so long, and he is one that can really scare an audience with his presence.  John Williams' music for him does a good job of representing how ruthless he is, although the famous Imperial March wasn't introduced until The Empire Strikes Back (1980).
