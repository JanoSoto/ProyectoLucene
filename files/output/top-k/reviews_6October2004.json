The opening scene between Frodo and Gandalf had a lot of personality; thematic without being preachy, and setting up ideas without giving too much of the plot away. Gandalf and Bilbo played off each other brilliantly. The special effects (especially with demonstrating the size difference of the various species) was impressive, without being distracting. And Bilbo's birthday was fun and lighthearted, but still with the sinister undertone foreboding the future turmoil. At this stage in the story, I was well on my way to putting the series in my top 100 list; but subsequent scenes and the later movies caused me to lower my rating a fraction. Still - the trilogy overall gets an 8\/10 from me.I am very impressed by Peter Jackson with his effective mixture of humor and suspense\/horror. I rank the dinner scene between Pippin and Merry as one of the best comic relief moments in a non-comic story ever. And Sean Astin's Samwise had the same serio-comic mixture, spot on perfect. (I always knew Sean had a good knack for doing both comedy and drama - he's always demonstrated it).A few minor quibbles I had with this movie were Frodo's gratuitous cameo shot in the party scene - which I felt looked staged and forced; and the very heavy-handed thematic speeches in the climactic discussion between Frodo and Boromir (premonition to the way-too-much moralizing in the city scene of THE TWO TOWERS).Yeah, I know this is a serious fantasy, and it's very important for characters to make thematic statements in order for the intelligentsia to justify telling a fictional story (apparently); but really, do you have to be so bleedin' obvious about it?! Can't you give the viewers a little credit for working out the underlying themes for themselves, without totally spoon-feeding us on every psychological nuance with the subtlety of a sledgehammer? Honestly, most summer blockbusters can get away with the barest minimum of character development, and a lot of viewers still follow the storyline pretty closely anyway. Not all of us are dumb popcorn-munching idiots!Anyway, griping aside; this is still great epic storytelling. The casting, the art direction and the pacing are (in the main) top quality. It was great intelligent entertainment! After all, this is the most critically-acclaimed popularly entertaining film trilogy of all time - and deservedly so!!!

The town is upset by the school boards decision to let Coach Boone take over the team, because he has a different color of skin than them. Coach Boone makes all of the players go off to camp and room with a person of different race. There ends up being conflict between the players. When the boys return home from camp, they are all getting along and end up having one of the greatest seasons that this small town has ever seen.The main idea in this story is how the players and both coaches overcame their differences. This movie lets us see how much rivalry blacks and whites had back in the 1970s. The Titans helped to show that if we just give somebody a chance it may all work out in the end. There was no black and white by the end of this movie. They were all the same, no matter who they were. This movie shows how we can overcome anything in life as long as we put our minds to it. The thing that really touched me was the way these two different races were so against each other; but when it came down to a game of football, the boys could all learn to get along with one another. This movie is very intense and makes viewers stay interested in it with all of its action and drama. This one single football team changed the opinions of all of the townspeople.

Happy Gilmore is a failed Hockey player who cannot skate and has a lack of any self-discipline. His life seems to be a complete failure until he finds out he can hit a golf ball over 400 yards. At first you might feel little empathy for Happy as he obviously deserves all the bad luck he gets from the way he treats his friends. But the introduction of Shooter to the screen suddenly makes you root for the underdog. The plot is thrown together to get the most out of Sandler and his antics on screen. Some of the scenes are totally unbelievable particularly when a car is driven on to the golf course to run down Happy! But no matter how many times I see the film it can still make me laugh.

But then again this movie is too great of a film for you to even miss.I said Somerset is the protag of this movie. He is. You'll see his arc during his VO, the last line said in the film.You may find the ending of SE7EN hard to comprehend, but it is something you will remember and can not ever deny.Grade A+  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"6 October 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Directed by David Fincher.If this film had a clear-cut protagonist, I'd say it would have to be Somerset. The characters come to the surface as Mills (Pitt) is paired with Somerset (Freeman), Mills being an overconfident, cocky Detective and Somerset being the more laid back, methodical and wise.Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely as Tracy Mills, who hides her being pregnant to her husband but seeks advice from Somerset. What's interesting is to see how vile the city was portrayed in SE7EN. Somerset quits because he can't take it anymore. Paltrow doesn't want it here, but she couldn't tell David to have them go back home because she doesn't want to be a burden. It is the perfect symettry of the underlying theme of isin\/i, and how the killer uses capital punishment and how he uses his work to preach.If you haven't seen this movie and haven't been spoiled, mind you there is almost nothing that is gonna prepare you for it. The ending is not for the squeamish... Fincher portrays the final scenes with ominous nuance and beautifully photographs them. Wonderful early-morning scenery in that deserted setting.Fincher, as a former music video director uses his technical expertise on cinematography, editing and he does it very well, as every shot of this movie is brilliantly crafted and edited in. That low-angle worms eye view shot of Doe pointing his gun on Mills's head. The temporal snippet of the shot of the slide of Mills's pistol snapping back as he fires it in the final scenes, the taut editing of Mills kicking the door to Doe's apartment. Reminds me of Forest Whitaker opening the safe in PANIC ROOM, right when he pulls it open, the movie cuts RIGHT INTO the safe. And many other beautiful shots in this movie...This is NOT a feel-good movie, so if those kinds of movies are your bread and butter, you might want to pass on this one.
