Well, that and the fact that it takes place in Shanghai in the 1930s. Gong Li plays Xiao Jingbao (Bijou) the moll, a self-centered, vain, mean, slutty songstress kept by the Boss (Baotian Li) of Shanghai's underworld. As usual with director Zhang Yimou every set is gorgeous and artfully planned, the story compelling, and the human psychology veracious.We see the events through the eyes of Shuisheng (Wang Xiaoxiao) a 14-year-old boy from the country who, because he is a member of the trusted Tang family, is brought to the city to be a servant to Bijou. She treats him and everybody else like dirt while she plays the Boss for a fool. We can guess that her comeuppance will be severe. Oh, but HOW severe? In this Zhang Yimou goes beyond what one has seen in American gangster movies and gives us something from Machiavelli and Genghis Kahn.The film is a little slow in parts and Gong Li plays her role so well that she is most disagreeable&#x97;that is, until what I might call the turn. This occurs when she is forced to go with the Boss to the country after a rival has attempted to kill him. Bijou is bored. There is nothing for her to do so she goes to the house of a country widow named Cuihua (Baoying Jiang) with a nine year old daughter Ah Jiao (Yang Qianquan) to lord it over her and to amuse herself with these country bumpkins. But the surprise is that in the process she is returned to her childhood when she herself was a country bumpkin. Zhang Yimou plays this part of the film masterfully as we slowly realize that Bijou is jealous of Cuihua and her poor but idyllic life. But that is something she can never admit to herself as she spies on Cuihua with her lover. One almost gets the sense that Bijou would like to be in Cuihua's place with that crude country lover.At one point Bijou makes Cuihua loan her some of her peasant clothes and then takes delight in wearing them. We can see that Bijou is in denial about how much of a slave to the master she really is and how unsatisfying is the life of a kept woman regardless of how well kept. She realizes that her life is empty. And now we see a certain generosity of spirit she gives the boy some silver coins; she tells the boss to spare the woman, but it is too late. Because you talked to her she knows too much, he says. He adds, you see, it is your fault again.This film sits well with the current communist government of China despite or perhaps partly because the Boss with his small round eyeglasses looks a little like a Chinese Trotsky. But more importantly Zhang Yimou's depiction of the criminal decadence of China in the 30s before the rise of communism is exactly what Maoists like to see. Communism freed the Chinese from all that, is perhaps the idea.This is not the only film of Zhang Yimou's to play to communist sensibilities. His Raise the Red Lantern (1991) also shows in a different way the moral corruption of what might be called the ancient regime. But Zhang Yimou can be forgiven for playing to the powers that be because he does it with subtle irony and for a purpose, the purpose being to give himself the celebrity and an international reputation so that he is able to make films that might in some way criticize the communist state while he maintains a position of loyalty to that state. Working from within, it might be said. We see this in his To Live (Huozhe) from 1994 in which the hardships under communism are not euphemized. To be more exact it might be said that Zhang Yimou sees the excesses of Mao's regime but realizes that Mao was a stage through which China had to pass; and at any rate, who would want to go back to the time of the capitalist gangsters? The airy, white tops of the reeds wave in the breeze. The colors are straw and the cottage on the island is neat and holds out against the rain. Inside Cuihua cooks and weaves a basket. She is content. Bijou, in her red dress and her red lips, wearing her jewelry and her superior manner, is not. She recalls the mulberry trees of her childhood and how she would climb the trees and eat the tree-ripened fruit. All the riches in the world cannot bring back those days, nor can she return to them.She would like to take nine year old Ah Jiao with her back to Shanghai. Ironically Ah Jiao in her innocence wants to be like Miss, which is Bijou's title. Ironically, however, it is the Boss who takes the little girl back so that she can grow into the next Bijou.The ending of the film is as brutal as anything you might expect to see, and yet there is a kind of poetic justice in what happens. In part. Zhang Yimou is always about politics, even though the politics are sometimes just domestic politics, as in Raise the Red Lantern. But he does the politics in a way that leaves no doubt justice or what comes to pass is shaped by those who hold the power, whether it is the power of the state, or the power of the gangster boss, or the power of the master of the house, not by those who do not hold power. And that is the trenchant reality behind the great beauty of any Zhang Yimou film.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Sometimes the Humour outweighs the love so much it becomes intolerable, sometimes the love aspect is so heavy you are forced to vomit. Then many movies make the mistake of mixing love with lust or even replacing them. That does not go for romantic in my opinion.

It's also a good idea to have him come back to NN-land years later, after having abandoned the Lost Boys in pursuit of that boring quest to fulfill his budding teenage urges. You know the drill Pan grows up to be Robin Williams (it's a sad day for anyone who grows up to be that), who goes by the subtley changed name Peter Panning and is a lawyer-suit jerk who marries Wendy's granddaughter\/niece or whatever (the point is it's a blood-relative, despite the implied long-standing relationship between Pan and Wendy)and ignores his kids.There are some slick sequences at the beginning, like when Hook reappears in Pan's adult life. Dustin Hoffman steals the show and drives the movie playing Captain Hook. He has some great lines and demonstrates real acting chops, as opposed to Robin Williams who is just playing himself, albeit slightly toned down. 'Twould be interesting to see someone else have done this Pan role. Jim Carrey? Gary Oldman? Hell, we should just cast Gary Oldman as every character in every movie. (Gary Oldman) for some, miniature American flags for others. Frankly, the only things keeping this from being a masterpiece are some random unexplainable circumstances in Never-Neverland's time-line, and the overemphasis on kids and how great they are. The underlying message of the movie becomes a Robin Williams pro-children schmooze-fest. What's the message, guys? Adopted children (i.e. the Lost Boys) are not as endearing or important as one's biological offspring? Also, Pan's son kinda sucked.

However those doubts were soon put to bed as the film progressed. The first half was very enjoyable for a fan of the music. A great sound track and the songs of Steel Dragon had a good 80s rock vibe about them.The first hour of the film basically takes the story of what happened to Judas Priest in the early 90s they're singer leaves and they hire a new singer who was previously in a Judas Priest tribute band. However come the second half of the film they really mess things up with the plot. We are somehow supposed to believe that Mark Walhberg's character is obsessed with Steel Dragon and actually singing for them is the ultimate dream come true but then when he actually achieves this dream he is just gonna walk out on it so he can be with his girlfriend who doesn't even support his dream and suddenly get over the band.I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it. To me it basically said that Heavy Metal is just a phase that you'll one day grow out of. Well any true fan will tell you that this music stays with you for life. To me this movie was not written for fans of the genre because they totally copped out on the ending.However, I was pleasantly surprised with Mark Walhberg. I still think he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood today, but I thought he handled the role very well. Also, as I said before, the soundtrack was also cool. It was also great to see Steel Dragon made up of actual musicians Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black label Society), Jeff Pilson (Dokken)and Jason Bonham (son of late Led Zepplin drummer John Bonham).A film of two halves so I'm gonna give 5\/10 a wasted a potentially good film messed up by ridiculous plot holes.

Here is a genuine science-fiction story, as opposed to science fantasy. But it's got a lot more that that.The movie prognoses a future in which our lives and careers are defined by our genetic quality. If you're top-drawer, then the chances are you're the product of carefully controlled IVF. If you ain't, then you were probably conceived by some other, more disreputable way, like sex.All the good things open before the right people. The wrong types, however, find themselves sweeping floors and clearing rubbish and other menial chores. That's the system. There's no bunking it. It's a genetic apartheid. No bad thing, some might say. It's only an extension of Darwinism after all.The story centres upon an also-ran with ideas above his DNA. He wants to fly a spaceship, not push a trash-truck. And there are ways...Jude Law plays a top-drawer who has been accidentally crippled. He and the second-grade dreamer - played by Ethan Hawke - do a deal. They swap identities.They share their home and their lives completely. Law's character supplies whatever his alter-ego needs for medical tests - skin, blood, urine anything. Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated and intense as their identities begin to merge. At the same time, there is an equally complex and exciting drama played out as Hawke's character so often risks discovery. In fact he's highly intelligent and extremely athletic and is almost the right stuff. But almost isn't good enough. He has eye and heart problems.The two concepts run side by side and are really quite stunning in their execution. Law and Hawke were of the new breed of Hollywood leading-men. Not toughies from the traditional mould like John Wayne or Bruce Willis, flawed in character but morally sound. Instead, these were the pretty boys. Slim, and handsome in a rather effeminate way, ego-centric and not entirely reliable. 'Metro-sexual' is the term, I believe. To allay any suspicions that they might be gay, Uma Thurman is cast as a love interest for Hawke. As such, hers is the easiest role imaginable, being little more than a series of rolled eyes and coquettish smirks. But the quality of acting between the male leads is quite outstanding. They bicker and feud in a way that seems perfectly natural.Astonishingly, that old-time Hollywood heavyweight Ernest Borgnine appears as little more than an occasional cameo in the role of foreman cleaner. That an Oscar-winning actor of yesteryear is seen doing menial chores and cravenly offering to dispose of Hawke's empty coffee-cup, seems deliberately scripted to emphasise the draconian and ruthless nature of the regime. Despite spades of talent, his sterling career was almost always that of a supporting actor simply on account of his rather brutal looks. The message seems to be that only leading men (and women) matter. Supporting stars, and past success count for nothing. Security systems and tests are also extremely well thought out. The only test not made manifest so far as I could tell was a retinal-scan, which struck me as rather odd as it is fast becoming an identity standard today. Their fraud goes more or less to plan until - there's a murder. This brings in the police and a review of security.The idea that humans will be designed and evaluated according to their genetic constitution is a very plausible pitch.

He would have had to explain all the nuances to the actors because so much is accomplished without words. Tom, the Horse Whisperer, gifted in the art of re-bonding, has to decide whether he can bring healing to only the horse (all that he is asked to do) or extend his therapeutic touch to the three humans as well. How does he achieve emotional mending for each member? By careful listening and observation, he gleans the signals until he knows the interlinking dynamics between all the wounded members. You can do the same if you practice the skill to understand the internal driving forces.Tom knows the pain of lost love and is magnetically drawn to the mother. But not until the father arrived could he know how his daughter loved him or that he cared for his girls. I believe Tom made a conscious decision to stop his bonding with the mother. The moment of decision was watching the bedroom light go out in his creek house across the meadow when the dad came to visit. He early achieved healing for the horse but he knew he could never achieve wholeness for the daughter if he wounded her again by replacing her father.He faced the excruciating challenge of healing the mother by opening her up to new bonding with her husband. After several touching moments, he did that finally at the dance by drawing her into his love then leaving her a soft place to fall into her husband's love again. He executed a delicate, deliberate maneuver so she didn't stay bonded to him marvelously done without rejecting her). He did that by leaving the dance (when he could have driven a wedge between her and her husband right then.) A man of few words, he had kept her back to her husband drinking at the dance, covertly expressed his love, then left before he damaged their bonding. The sacrifice of true love! He had always spoken so honestly and clearly to each one. In the barn, he didn't soften the reality of how she would hurt her husband and daughter if she chose him. He signaled to her what she should do by saying your love&#151;that I will always have with me. And by saying I wanted to be here when you left. He taught her the value of relationships above careers. He was refreshingly grounded in knowing who he was. He also understood that you could deeply love someone and it not be right to marry them.

This young protagonist starts out by living the muggle life with his aunt, uncle, and annoyance of a cousin Dudley, knowing very little of his mysterious and mystical past. It was his twelfth birthday when he started to receive letters from Hogwarts, inviting him to spend the next term as a new student of the wizard and witches academy. Hagrid, a wizard friend, comes and retrieves Harry from his horrific living arrangements to take him away. By this point in the 2001 film, director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job of drawing the viewer into the movie, though compared to the book doesn't do quite as fair in introducing Harry's background. Overall, Columbus does a great job in taking Rowling's work and turning it into an animated film, but there are minor differences in the plot that are left out that many might feel should not have been. Included are background, dialogue, and some scenes from the story that did a fantastic job in building a great story. Daniel Radcliff, the actor portraying Potter, makes a wonderful role for the part. He really gives a sense of character and admiration to the heroic role he plays. From his accent to his appearance, he characterizes is the perfect picture from the imagination. Robbie Coltrane, on the other hand, seems to be cheated out of a good part. The 6'1'' actor does a magnificent job portraying the enormous bearded Hagrid. He plays the dim giant very well, and certainly makes one see the Hagrid they imagine, thick accent included; but when it comes to dialog, Hagrid's character in the film is just lack-luster. The novel is perfect in personifying him, while the film leaves out lines and cuts out scenes that help make Hagrid as good as Coltrane could have potentially made him. Overall the acting and casting of the movie was excellently done and there are very few changes that could have been made to make it any better. The special effects in this film were superb. When looking at the time this movie was made, and seeing how realistic the flying and quidditch matches, the magical spells, and even the mystical creatures, it is hard to believe how great they turned out. The lighting in the film was a little dark and bothersome, but when looking at the setting and mysterious feel the film was going for, it is completely acceptable and understandable. The film work was well done. Though it could have used some work, Columbus did a great job in finding the best way to film these witches and wizards. Overall I rate the film a 7 out of 10 for a fun and exciting story, for kids and adults alike. Great acting, dialogue, and filming, and special effects that keeps the action feeling real.

Exploring the potential future world of robots is something that can be very entertaining. Frankly, I think it's difficult to miss with a subject like that. There are a hundred different directions you could go. But A.I. fails. Despite Spielberg's presence, despite the strength of the actors involved, it just doesn't work. David (Osment) is a state of the art child robot designed to mimic a real child. He is basically a replacement for the sick child Martin, trapped in suspended animation. The parents Henry (Robards) and Monica (O'Connor) are offered the latest in experimental mecha technology, as a perverse way to deal with their sons likely eternal sleep. Monica quickly becomes frightened of the new child, but that fright softens into love as the movie advances at least until a cure is found for Martin. From that point on, all of David's actions are interpreted in the most negative light possible by Henry. Every action, often antagonized by Martin, is viewed as a threat to the family. That's the first sign of the countless inconsistencies that are fast approaching. Wasn't Henry the one who encouraged the replacement child? Henry asserts at one point that if David is capable of love, he may also be capable of hate. Yet in the next breath he's suggesting David isn't real, and is easily disposable for the sake of the family. He seems to both recognize David is capable of human feelings, yet has an irrational hatred and assumption that David is inhuman. And getting David was his idea to boot. I realize that a movie is going to have inconsistencies, and I'm normally okay with that, but it gets worse.(As an aside, it's never made clear in this movie whether robots are even capable of hurting humans. David's robot guide (see below) in the movie is assumed to be the murderer of a human. But no humans are actually harmed by robots during the movie. Heck, the murderer was at the scene of the crime, and the police assume it is the robot? I doubt even the most ardent robot hater wouldn't at least, I don't know, investigate? Can't they look at a robot's memory?) It is finally decided David must be put down, but instead his mother releases him into the wild. So begins David's adventure.As the movie advances, David meets many characters in this new world. One of the most memorable is the anti-robot group that tears the mechas apart for the entertainment of crowds that look perfectly suited for a monster truck rally (I say that sarcastically, as I'm not a big fan of stereotypes). These anti-robot haters are fully willing to kill countless robots, but one of what I can only assume are the event directors insists David is too well-built to simply be killed. I assume he wasn't a true believer.Fast forward many adventures later, and David meets his maker. In the process, David discovers he's not that special. He is one of many Davids ( one of which he murders) and throws himself into the ocean in despair. I realize why they did this. David needs to experience the range of human experiences love, hate, depression, joy, etc. But something just seems off about David's sudden burst of rage and subsequent leap into the ocean. Anyway, as he sinks, he at last finds the Blue Fairy in the underwater graveyard that was once Coney Island. He begs the fairy to make him a real boy for the next two thousand years. Because he's talking to a statue, David simply repeats his request until he apparently shuts down. The movie should have stopped there. I think the ending would have salvaged it, if the message of the movie had been how wrong it was to create a being stuck between two worlds. If the final scene had been the eternal plea of David beneath the sea, I probably still would be here complaining, but I'd be whining less. But the movie continues.We soon see the future is populated by super-advanced androids. All humans have died after the world froze (Future people don't have central heating). Yes, I know that the world freezing over would be devastating, but with all the technology available no humans survived? I think a nuclear war, a deadly disease, anything else would have been more believable. Anyway, the robots wake David up and at last give him his dream. His mother loves him and they spend one final day together, just the two of them. Because in the future, robots can bring people back with all of their memories, but only for one day. It's explained away with the cliché space-time continuum explanation, used in the most unbelievable manner I've ever seen. I know some have suggested the creatures David encounters are aliens, but I don't think there's much doubt they are robots. Jude Law's character implies robots will inherit the Earth someday and the creatures suggest they are not capable of the same level of creativity as humans. I don't see why an alien race would be incapable of emotion and creativity.Overall, the movie had some strong points. The visuals are stunning, as expected. The questions it raises are provocative. But the execution is way off, especially for Spielberg. The continuous leaps we have to make are just too much. I know I, Robot wasn't the critic darling of A.I., but I think it gave a much more believable treatment of the same questions A.I. raises. It was much more consistent as well. I don't expect science fiction to give me complete realism, but it has to be consistent within the universe it creates. A.I. failed at that way too many times.

From that point on, all of David's actions are interpreted in the most negative light possible by Henry. Every action, often antagonized by Martin, is viewed as a threat to the family. That's the first sign of the countless inconsistencies that are fast approaching. Wasn't Henry the one who encouraged the replacement child? Henry asserts at one point that if David is capable of love, he may also be capable of hate. Yet in the next breath he's suggesting David isn't real, and is easily disposable for the sake of the family. He seems to both recognize David is capable of human feelings, yet has an irrational hatred and assumption that David is inhuman. And getting David was his idea to boot. I realize that a movie is going to have inconsistencies, and I'm normally okay with that, but it gets worse.(As an aside, it's never made clear in this movie whether robots are even capable of hurting humans. David's robot guide (see below) in the movie is assumed to be the murderer of a human. But no humans are actually harmed by robots during the movie. Heck, the murderer was at the scene of the crime, and the police assume it is the robot? I doubt even the most ardent robot hater wouldn't at least, I don't know, investigate? Can't they look at a robot's memory?) It is finally decided David must be put down, but instead his mother releases him into the wild. So begins David's adventure.As the movie advances, David meets many characters in this new world. One of the most memorable is the anti-robot group that tears the mechas apart for the entertainment of crowds that look perfectly suited for a monster truck rally (I say that sarcastically, as I'm not a big fan of stereotypes). These anti-robot haters are fully willing to kill countless robots, but one of what I can only assume are the event directors insists David is too well-built to simply be killed. I assume he wasn't a true believer.Fast forward many adventures later, and David meets his maker. In the process, David discovers he's not that special. He is one of many Davids ( one of which he murders) and throws himself into the ocean in despair. I realize why they did this. David needs to experience the range of human experiences love, hate, depression, joy, etc. But something just seems off about David's sudden burst of rage and subsequent leap into the ocean. Anyway, as he sinks, he at last finds the Blue Fairy in the underwater graveyard that was once Coney Island. He begs the fairy to make him a real boy for the next two thousand years. Because he's talking to a statue, David simply repeats his request until he apparently shuts down. The movie should have stopped there. I think the ending would have salvaged it, if the message of the movie had been how wrong it was to create a being stuck between two worlds. If the final scene had been the eternal plea of David beneath the sea, I probably still would be here complaining, but I'd be whining less. But the movie continues.We soon see the future is populated by super-advanced androids. All humans have died after the world froze (Future people don't have central heating). Yes, I know that the world freezing over would be devastating, but with all the technology available no humans survived? I think a nuclear war, a deadly disease, anything else would have been more believable. Anyway, the robots wake David up and at last give him his dream. His mother loves him and they spend one final day together, just the two of them. Because in the future, robots can bring people back with all of their memories, but only for one day. It's explained away with the cliché space-time continuum explanation, used in the most unbelievable manner I've ever seen. I know some have suggested the creatures David encounters are aliens, but I don't think there's much doubt they are robots. Jude Law's character implies robots will inherit the Earth someday and the creatures suggest they are not capable of the same level of creativity as humans. I don't see why an alien race would be incapable of emotion and creativity.Overall, the movie had some strong points. The visuals are stunning, as expected. The questions it raises are provocative. But the execution is way off, especially for Spielberg. The continuous leaps we have to make are just too much. I know I, Robot wasn't the critic darling of A.I., but I think it gave a much more believable treatment of the same questions A.I. raises. It was much more consistent as well. I don't expect science fiction to give me complete realism, but it has to be consistent within the universe it creates. A.I. failed at that way too many times. I, Robot may not be Ebert's favorite, but if you want to see a compelling look into the difficult questions of artificial intelligence, look there.

To the extent that in the movies of suspense nowadays, guessing that the chief of police is the one who did it; is mostly right ! It overstepped the phase of good satires to the phase of ridiculous potboilers.(Harry) of all the people is the one who must appreciate the efforts of the killers in here. Or understand well their motives, statement, and nobility more than others. And why not ? Since he is dirty Harry himself, the cop who's against the dirtiness of a city and its stupid deficient laws. I liked when he was at one moment in question (Maybe Harry did it ? said by his black partner). The enemy this time was the dark sides of Harry, yet in its extremist. He was facing his worst nightmare of himself; however it eventually proved that he wasn't THAT dirty. Harry managed to meet his loose dark side in that idealistic gang of killers, to beat it cleverly, so he could assure that he was pure, rational, however as violent as all the madness around him whether has the word evil or good on its intentions.The perusal of the new character continues, but with some repetition. Look at the scene of the airport, it began with Harry eating his lunch in a hurry, and just while he was chewing it, he found himself in the middle of stopping a running crime. It's the same situation from the first one; which &#x96; however &#x96; took place in a street. Maybe because the people liked it, because it presents the character for the ones whom didn't see it before, or because it assures how crime became the daily meal of character like Harry. In part 4 (Sudden Impact) they would put him in the same situation again, yet in a diner while he was getting his coffee. And in part 5 (The Dead Pool) he pretends like he's having his lunch in a Japanese restaurant to do the same. Speaking about repetition but in a good way; remember how every time Harry has a partner from the minorities to confirm that he's NOT hating everybody, so you see him with a Mexican (Part 1), a black man (Part 2), a woman (Part 3); considering the way of appreciating women's rights or working at the time, they were minority ! And a Japanese (Part 5), regarding that part 4 was an adventure for Harry out of the city as a lone ranger. Another lovely repetition  (Albert Popwell) as a different character in the first 4 movies. I think they considered him a lucky charm since Do you feel lucky you punk ? fame, where he was the punk !Everyone knows (Eastwood) as a director must easily notice how a lot of scenes were having him in front of the camera and in its back too. I could swear that the scene of his first meeting with the 4 young perfect shooters was part of his uncredited directorial job. There are small yet nice touches like Harry's ghost of a smile while the 4 young cops were leaving the shooting's room. Harry there was consoling himself; whether because they were nearly half of his age and quite like his cleverness, or had each others and he just came in that late time to be alone.. As always. I think they put the love scene to approve how Harry is a human being, and that he needs to be loved. Or to make what they didn't in the first one !(Eastwood) carries on establishing himself greatly as a cold-blooded, crudely stubborn, good man with his own sense of humor. It's the Eastwood Force's special foundation for heroism Trade Mark. However, I deemed casting (Hal Holbrook) as (Lt. Briggs) as the best thing in the movie. He could convince you that he was another executive, more than police officer; being nagging, rules' freak, and sadistically enjoying hindering the hero.

However, since we're on the subject, let me talk a little about Jar Jar. First off, yes, there is way too much Jar Jar in this movie and the fact remains that they could have easily cut most of his pointless antics out of the film. However, I don't feel that Jar Jar's character was pointless or that he should have been cut out of the movie altogether. Jar Jar represents one of the only archetypes that George hadn't used in the original trilogy - the joker. It totally understand George's intent in putting Jar Jar in this movie as its probably the only one with a plot line that would suit that archetype and if you think about it, not every character in his saga has a real purpose for being there, sometimes there just there for pure enjoyment's sake, and unfortunately Jar Jar's character falls flat where characters like Chewie and Lobot for example were just plain cool. Oh well, I still bought his action figure anyways ... and it came with this stupid staff thing that he never uses in the movie. Anwyways, off of my rant and back to the movie. Flaw #1 Medichloreans - What the hell? Am I honestly supposed to believe that the force is controlled by biology? Jeez, George! Way to kill the mystery of something that was once cool because it was mysterious. Medichloreans are the worst example of the prequels over-explaining everything. Flaw #327 (What, you thought I was actually going to keep count?) bad plot. The plot of this movie is really lackluster, especially compared to the originals, and it really doesn't have much to do with the other Star Wars movies, so it's kind of a waste of screen time except that it introduces us to the really young versions of some of the sagas main heroes and sets up some really boring political subplot. Once again, I understand why George included it, to basically show the Emperor's rise to power through playing both sides against each other, but it doesn't change the fact that it's boring. Anyways, on to the movies strengths which pretty much balance out the weaknesses in my opinion. First off, I love the look of this film. The bright soaring clean quality definitely depicts the galaxy in the height of its economical prowess, before the dark times of the original trilogy. It really captured the big screen essence of the original trilogy in a lot of ways in my opinion. George did what he did best and went BIG with this one. Everything is so over the top and full of eye candy that it works in the same way that the originals did, at least visual-wise. George Lucas is a brilliant man when it comes to visuals, but the story is where he really falls short here. Fortunately, he makes up for his failures in storytelling with incredible visuals and stunning fight scenes with a climactic fight scene that really blew my mind and not to mention that amazing podrace. Great moments like that really require a theater for proper viewing. So, all in all, George did what he set out to do with this one, he introduced the characters, got them all together and depicted the beginning stages of Palpatine's rise to power with a plot that definitely gives you lots to look at (including a completely pointless, yet somewhat enjoyable underwater chase sequence with giant fish), but it fails to do much else and the story isn't layered enough to offer much more than eye candy upon repeated viewings.

So, all in all, George did what he set out to do with this one, he introduced the characters, got them all together and depicted the beginning stages of Palpatine's rise to power with a plot that definitely gives you lots to look at (including a completely pointless, yet somewhat enjoyable underwater chase sequence with giant fish), but it fails to do much else and the story isn't layered enough to offer much more than eye candy upon repeated viewings. Oh well, despite its flaws it'll still be the first movie I watch the next time I have a Star-Wars-a-thon.

Upon Harry's twelfth birthday his life begins to change; wild unexpected occurrences begin to frazzle Harry's aunt and uncle, but the result of the change is a whole new life of which Harry could not have dreamed.The movie in my opinion was pretty well done. Visually I think the CGI was great. Some of the action scenes &#150; the ones on broomsticks in particular &#150; were a bit cartoonish, but the overall visual experience was good. I think that the director did a good job of choosing the actors for this film. Dumbledore, the three protagonists, the Weasley twins, etc. were all great. Hagrid's character, on the other hand, was not as great, but I do not think it was the fault of the actor. First, his accent was impeccable. Second, he is visually a true match to Rowling's Hagrid. Where his character fails is in the lines that he was asked to memorize. Simple and repetitive. Rowling gave him many great lines and allowed us to get to know him. Why, script writers, did you not refer to Rowling's book when you asked the question What should Hagrid say? In general I thought the writing for the film was OK, but Hagrid's dialogue was at best mediocre.The flow of the movie was good &#150; it didn't drag at all.

That's a marked contrast to all other films of Kurosawa's I've seen (Zoku Sugata Sanshiro, Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Throne of blood, The Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran, Dreams, and Madadayo), all of which make greater use of open spaces and, in many cases, much larger casts and more intricate plots. In all other respects, though, Sanjuro is classic Kurosawa excellent photography, crisp editing, wonderfully choreographed sword fights, exquisite detail and a great story.So, while I was enjoying the cunning and cleverness of Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) as he manipulated a bunch of lesser mortals once again &#150; as in Yojimbo (1961) &#150; I was puzzling why Kurosawa had made such simple story into such a grand film. Because the story can be quickly summarized thus Sanjuro, a ronin, assists a group of young samurai to fight the corruption of local authorities and secure the release of the Chamberlain, held hostage by those corrupt officials. In doing so, Sanjuro once again kills many young samurai and even one for whom he has grudging respect, Muroto (Tatsuya Nakadai), the superintendent. When the dirty job is done, Sanjuro once again sets off, alone, as the wandering ronin.If that sounds familiar, consider the story and setting of Shane (1952), the definitive western about another type of expert in death, and just as powerful. Notably also, there are only three or four set pieces in Shane the Starret farm, Ryker's bar, the grocery store&#133;and the muddy road where Stonewall dies.In addition, the Sanjuro of this film is markedly different to the character shown in Yojimbo where the action is against thugs and criminals, many of whom Sanjuro dispatches with speed and even contempt &#150; and all for money. In this story, however, Sanjuro accepts only food, mostly, and publicly regrets &#150; even agonizes about &#150; the death of so many young samurai at his own hands. Significantly also, Sanjuro reveals that his name means, essentially, 'thirty something' - going on forty. And, finally, when the last scene fades as Sanjuro walks away and over the hill, the last scene from Shane is again an obvious comparison.Considering the fact that Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford and the American western genre, it's possible that Kurosawa was influenced by Stevens also.What consumed Kurosawa more, however, was something else, I think the nature and purpose of the samurai and, no doubt, the history that included the greatest samurai of all, Musashi Miyamoto &#150; the one who retired from active dueling at age thirty or so, having killed over sixty others in duels, and who then roamed the Japanese countryside as a ronin seeking enlightenment. In the last two years of his life, he composed and wrote the definitive guide to kendo, The Book of Five Rings.Hence, just as Musashi sought wisdom through introspection, so also I think Kurosawa wanted to show Sanjuro as finally pursuing a path to enlightenment and a similar release from the material world. Therefore, I don't think it's coincidence there are no further exploits of Sanjuro from Kurosawa.
