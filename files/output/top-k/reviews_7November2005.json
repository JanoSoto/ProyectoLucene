A line from one of the best films of the year, Secuestro Express, sums up perfectly all these people's common problem.Half the world suffers from malnutrition, the other half from obesity. Even though it was made 65 years ago, The Grapes of Wrath is still relevant today, for the grinding poverty depicted in this film and the struggle to overcome it --in some cases just to survive it --remains today the all consuming battle for a large portion of the world's population.We should not forget just how controversial John Steinbeck's novel was when it was first published all those years ago. Called socialist propaganda by politicians and branded a pack of lies by the big California farmers, the book went on to achieve great acclaim. Yet it and stories like it will always be lightning rods for controversy because they dare to suggest that what separates the halves and have not's is not always just how hard people are willing to work. Some of those who work the hardest --and there may be no harder work than stoop labor --wind up with the least.Plenty of good hard work went into the motion picture version of this story of Dust Bowl immigrants of the 1930s trying to start a new life in California.The film, of course, was the work of some of the best in Hollywood. Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, one of the industry's greatest producers, adapted for the screen by Nunally Johnson (Jesse James), photographed by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane); staring one of the screen's greatest actors, Henry Fonda, backed by a remarkable cast of character actors including Jane Darwell and John Carradine, and helmed by a candidate for the honor of Hollywood's greatest director, John Ford, this film was assembled like a fine Swiss watch, which is probably why it continues to tick today, well over half a century later.Ford was at the top of his game when he undertook the project and its brimming with his unmatched visuals, thanks to the camera-work of Gregg Toland. From the opening shot of a solitary figure walking down a highway towards a diner, to shots of the Joad family, piled in their jalopy truck, passing through an Indian reservation in New Mexico, to the film's signature shot, as they wind their way through a transient camp outside Bakersfield, California, Ford and Toland use the camera to advance the idea that these are people on an odyssey, a search for a better life in a sometimes beautiful, but often hostile environment. Many directors are capable of making pretty pictures. Ford proves in Grapes of Wrath that you can tell a compelling story without a word being spoken.But like all great movies, from Murnau's Sunrise to Coppola's Godfather, this film is about a lot more than pretty pictures. The movie's words are powerful and haunting and resonate today. When John Qualen, playing the deranged sharecropper, Muley, describes how the Oakies have been pushed off their land by the banks; or when David Hughes playing a discouraged immigrant coming back from California empty handed, gives his dire warning about the perils the travelers face, you cannot help but be moved. And of course, there is Henry Fonda, who delivers his now legendary speech at the movie's end, as he sets out on his own to see what can be done about the plight of the poor. The screen may have never produced a better piece of dialog.The Grapes of Wrath continues to stand today as a landmark of American movie making and a film well worth the time of anyone who wants to try to understand what for much of mankind remains the most important struggle --the struggle for survival..

The film follows the fateful battles of American forces in the plans to take Guadalcanal and two soldiers especially. Private Witt is played by James Caveizel and First Sergeant Edward Welsh is played by Sean Penn. Caviezel's character isn't really developed enough for my liking. Every time I saw him, I felt that he was just there for the thrill. He does show humanity to the Japanese prisoners and is brought around as the good soldier. Caviezel does give a fine performance even with the few lines he has. He helps you to understand the life of an innocent soldier, a kid in the war there because his country told him to go. Sean Penn's character is my personal favorite. Penn's character is the only man who is actually realizing the horrors of war and how much devastation they are causing. Malick should have given Penn more screen time because of the way his character and Caviezel's worked so well together.My favorite part of this film is the way nature is woven with the battle scenes. The battle scenes are unsettling and horribly graphic. But while the war rages on, Malick shows that there is a world beyond the battle. He works animals into the battles like I've never seen. The scene that struck me most was when the baby bird is shown with its feathers charred off and it's dying. It shows the true horror and devastation war has on everyone. The battles will shake you in a way you never thought possible. The scene in the village is one of the most heart-pounding and emotional battle scenes I've ever viewed.The lead characters are introduced with V.O. (Voice Overs) and in my opinion, is a fresh and interesting way to do so. For a WWII film, The Thin Red Line succeeds. The battles are brutal, the drama is solid, and the characters are somewhat believable unlike other WWII films (coughWindtalkerscough). The film is a step below Saving Private Ryan but still should not be missed. Nick Nolte gives a powerful performance as the commanding officer and some other supporting roles work well with the film. It is a shame the movie was cut back so much. A war film such as this should have been lengthened a little more, possibly to three hours or even more run-time. In the end, The Thin Red Line is excellent. The Thin Red Line. Starring James Caviezel, Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, and Adrien Brody.4 out of 5 Stars.

It has an intriguing plot line full of wonderfully philosophical brain fodder that keeps you pondering and considering to the very end in true James Cameron style. The film is totally and unabashedly committed to its story, which is really the only way one can buy into this type of film and it approaches tough, controversial and serious subjects uninhibitedly in a raw, visceral, and emotional way. There is also some very fine acting here Ralph Fiennes as always is superb and adds an unexpected gritty realism to such a fresh, wonderful character. Angela Bassett is exemplary as well and gives you a strong female hero to connect with and root for. Despite some of its great strengths, the movie has some very inherent flaws as well. Despite the interesting plot, the script seems not to delve quite deep enough into the essential themes of the film, it entices you with some excellent moments and backs off as if it is afraid of being too thoughtful of a film. The ending (which I will not reveal) is played up to be extremely mind-blowing, while in reality it is quite predictable. The artistic direction is also boring, offering nothing new and exciting for the viewer just giving you the same old violent fiery urban wasteland that has become so clichéd over the years. Juliette Lewis is notably underwhelming as well, not up to her usual par, she gives us a distinctly 2d character. Despite these flaws the film remains an intriguing success.

The rest of the employees are some of the craziest people; it would be awesome to work at empire records.This was such a surprise watch. It doesn't really try to be anything prolific about teen life; instead is a honest comedy about a group of odd characters trying to set their lives on course. The jokes are perfectly timed; just before it seems to drop the ball and go flat, it quickly catches it and your attention is brought back.

The trouble is, her celluloid tastes differ wildly from mine. Alive, The Green Mile and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang are all well and good but I'm afraid I have no desire to see them. The same goes with Jackie Brown, a DVD I bought some time ago and still have little impetus to sit down and watch. Then I stumbled across this, a bizarre addition to her collection next to The Horse Whisperer (*shudders*). Finally finding a movie with some testosterone, we sat down to watch this typically flash-bang Bruckheimer movie in each others arms. Aaaaah!

The Women is ostensibly Norma Shearer's picture. She's terrific. She's perfectly cast as a wealthy mother whose husband leaves her for another woman (Crawford). Shearer was a good film actor and her slight star affectations (see the final shot of The Women) suit her character. She could also be down-to-earth and genuinely moving.So could Crawford (see Grand Hotel). Crawford also had a spectacularly photogenic face, which she'd already learned to control like a virtuoso by 1939. As Crystal, Crawford is a sexy, striking shopgirl with ambitions (female ambition, in those days, meaning snagging a rich husband not becoming a neurosurgeon or senator). Not really predatory (she doesn't stalk rich men so much as take advantage when the situation presents itself), her character could have come across as utterly unsympathetic and heartless. Thanks to Crawford's relaxed and confident playing, she doesn't.Crawford walks off with the picture. She's thoroughly believable in every scene. She's sexy and voracious enough to capture any man she wants. She's common enough to be believable as a perfume clerk in a department store and pretentious enough to be believed as a would-be diva in that transparent bubble bath scene.Rosalind Russell was certainly the better actor of the three (Shearer and Crawford and Russell) and had nearly as long a career as Crawford. But not here.The Women demonstrates an interesting fact about Crawford in relation to the other actors in the picture and to film history itself.Crawford and Russell were on their way up. Shearer was about to retire. Their acting styles and techniques were completely different. And Russell proved the most versatile actor of the three, over many film and stage performances.Yet in The Women, one is constantly aware that both Russell and Shearer are acting. As wonderful and impressive as their performances are, one keeps thinking, Damn, she's good. With Crawford, on the other hand, one forgets about the actor (her) until long after the picture's over, so convincingly does she inhabit Crystal.The same is true with Grand Hotel, where one keeps admiring Garbo and John Barrymore's technique, yet forgets that Flaemmchen is actually being played by Crawford until after The End. That Flaemmchen and Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) affectingly walk off into the sunset together at the conclusion of Grand Hotel seems fitting. Not only were their characters meant for each other at that moment in their lives, but they were by far the two best actors on the screen.So it is with The Women. Rosalind Russell is wonderful. She's over-the-top. Nobody in real life, then or now, could get by with that sort of obnoxious self-centered behavior and last five minutes in those social circles.Russell's performance is great fun. But it's still a performance and lacks the depth of a real human being. Which is why Russell sticks out like a sore thumb in The Women. All the other actors embody some heart and soul to slightly greater or lesser degrees. Russell is all surface schtick. Quality schtick, but still . . . .It's easy to say, Well, that's Sylvia Foster's character. But it's not. Sylvia Foster's actually a woman who's desperate to fit in with the other women, but knows she doesn't. All she has to offer as her reason for being is gossip. And to get it, she has to meddle. There are moments throughout the role where Russell could have given a flicker of Sylvia's desperation and feelings of inferiority, but she doesn't. Her instinct in 1939 was to go broad -- even slapstick. So she does.Fun. But not in the same league with Crawford's Crystal.Same for Shearer. She can be effective, and is a good actor. Yet her range is limited. It's impossible, really, to separate Shearer's movie-star mannerisms from her characters'. With the final scene, all her good work in The Women is erased in what looks like a vanity closeup with arms outstretched and Shearer's face overemoting as she rushes to welcome her errant (off-camera) ex-husband back.Not that it's a bad ending. But Director George Cukor might have had the professionalism to keep shooting it until Shearer had toned down her gesticular and facial histrionics to something resembling real life.Because it's Crawford's real life approach to this film and this character that distinguishes her from the other leads and succeeds in making Crystal the most likable and enjoyable of The Women despite the script's perspective on her character.After The Women, Crawford didn't have to steal any more films. She had stolen Grand Hotel from Garbo and the Barrymores (in cahoots with Lionel), and now absconded with The Women. From 1939 on, CRAWFORD was THE star and everybody else a bit player in all her films. Up to and including Trog. Russell went on to hone her craft spectacularly in both drama and comedy, both stage and film.Shearer went on to discover both Janet Leigh and Robert Evans, and to marry a ski instructor twenty years her junior.Crawford went on -- and on -- to Baby Jane and, finally, Trog. Crawford, alone of the three in The Women, went on to become a film Legend.Shearer and Russell are loved and admired and appreciated.But Legends? No.Crawford still provokes arguments.

She's over-the-top. Nobody in real life, then or now, could get by with that sort of obnoxious self-centered behavior and last five minutes in those social circles.Russell's performance is great fun. But it's still a performance and lacks the depth of a real human being. Which is why Russell sticks out like a sore thumb in The Women. All the other actors embody some heart and soul to slightly greater or lesser degrees. Russell is all surface schtick. Quality schtick, but still . . . .It's easy to say, Well, that's Sylvia Foster's character. But it's not. Sylvia Foster's actually a woman who's desperate to fit in with the other women, but knows she doesn't. All she has to offer as her reason for being is gossip. And to get it, she has to meddle. There are moments throughout the role where Russell could have given a flicker of Sylvia's desperation and feelings of inferiority, but she doesn't. Her instinct in 1939 was to go broad -- even slapstick. So she does.Fun. But not in the same league with Crawford's Crystal.Same for Shearer. She can be effective, and is a good actor. Yet her range is limited. It's impossible, really, to separate Shearer's movie-star mannerisms from her characters'. With the final scene, all her good work in The Women is erased in what looks like a vanity closeup with arms outstretched and Shearer's face overemoting as she rushes to welcome her errant (off-camera) ex-husband back.Not that it's a bad ending. But Director George Cukor might have had the professionalism to keep shooting it until Shearer had toned down her gesticular and facial histrionics to something resembling real life.Because it's Crawford's real life approach to this film and this character that distinguishes her from the other leads and succeeds in making Crystal the most likable and enjoyable of The Women despite the script's perspective on her character.After The Women, Crawford didn't have to steal any more films. She had stolen Grand Hotel from Garbo and the Barrymores (in cahoots with Lionel), and now absconded with The Women. From 1939 on, CRAWFORD was THE star and everybody else a bit player in all her films. Up to and including Trog. Russell went on to hone her craft spectacularly in both drama and comedy, both stage and film.Shearer went on to discover both Janet Leigh and Robert Evans, and to marry a ski instructor twenty years her junior.Crawford went on -- and on -- to Baby Jane and, finally, Trog.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"7 November 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Just as she did in Grand Hotel some seven years earlier, Joan Crawford steals this picture too -- from an equally formidable cast.For some, Crawford is the Hollywood Star they love to hate.For others, she was an impressive screen actor and (especially early) spectacular beauty and legendary face on par with Garbo. The Women is ostensibly Norma Shearer's picture. She's terrific. She's perfectly cast as a wealthy mother whose husband leaves her for another woman (Crawford). Shearer was a good film actor and her slight star affectations (see the final shot of The Women) suit her character. She could also be down-to-earth and genuinely moving.So could Crawford (see Grand Hotel). Crawford also had a spectacularly photogenic face, which she'd already learned to control like a virtuoso by 1939. As Crystal, Crawford is a sexy, striking shopgirl with ambitions (female ambition, in those days, meaning snagging a rich husband not becoming a neurosurgeon or senator). Not really predatory (she doesn't stalk rich men so much as take advantage when the situation presents itself), her character could have come across as utterly unsympathetic and heartless. Thanks to Crawford's relaxed and confident playing, she doesn't.Crawford walks off with the picture. She's thoroughly believable in every scene. She's sexy and voracious enough to capture any man she wants. She's common enough to be believable as a perfume clerk in a department store and pretentious enough to be believed as a would-be diva in that transparent bubble bath scene.Rosalind Russell was certainly the better actor of the three (Shearer and Crawford and Russell) and had nearly as long a career as Crawford. But not here.The Women demonstrates an interesting fact about Crawford in relation to the other actors in the picture and to film history itself.Crawford and Russell were on their way up. Shearer was about to retire. Their acting styles and techniques were completely different. And Russell proved the most versatile actor of the three, over many film and stage performances.Yet in The Women, one is constantly aware that both Russell and Shearer are acting. As wonderful and impressive as their performances are, one keeps thinking, Damn, she's good. With Crawford, on the other hand, one forgets about the actor (her) until long after the picture's over, so convincingly does she inhabit Crystal.The same is true with Grand Hotel, where one keeps admiring Garbo and John Barrymore's technique, yet forgets that Flaemmchen is actually being played by Crawford until after The End. That Flaemmchen and Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) affectingly walk off into the sunset together at the conclusion of Grand Hotel seems fitting.

I would really like to watch this movie with good quality and in it's original aspect ratio as I can say this is a really good movie and I think maybe the bad circumstances clouded my impression a bit.Broder William of Baskerwille and his novice Adso of Melk, two Franciscan monks, have come to a Benedictine Abbey to attend a meeting with a representative of the Pope. When they arrive they learn that an unexplained death has occurred and more are soon to follow. While the other monks believe it's the work of anti-Christ, Broder William is not so sure. He and his novice start to investigate and they soon discover that there are secrets within the walls of the abbey.The story is set in 1327 and gives a pretty scary, yet true picture of life in those days. It's a well written film with a good puzzle. If you pay attention it's not hard to understand and it's not hard to keep track of the story. The characters are good. A little mysterious, but that only makes them more interesting. The voice-over are a nice touch that makes it all more personal and you get to know the character better.Sean Connery is good as William of Baskerwille. His style of and his figure as a sophisticated and wise man fits this role very good. A young Christian Slater also does a rather good job and Ron Perlman's performance is very good. His character is very special, but Perlman handle this very well. The rest of the cast is over all good.The cinematography is good.

Well worth the time for pretty much any horror fan, and especially, any TCM fan. As a side note, this can be found in Wal-Mart's $5 bin--and it's one of the best values one is likely to find in that whole pile. I'm going to highly recommend this one, despite the fact that often, opinions of it are very poor. It's one of the most solid films in the franchise and is acted pretty well. It's slight lack of originality is it's only real downfall--but that's what you get with sequels.www.ResidentHazard.com ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre IIIThis film, basically, revolves around a bunch of people who, by chance, all end up being chased through the Texas wilderness in the middle of the night by Leatherface and his lunatic family.

That's about it. A lot of this movie was stolen and directly planted in the TCM Next Generation movie, and that movie pretty much sucked. And since the second film wasn't very good, I wasn't expecting much from this one. Luckily, I spent my 89 or so minutes being pleasantly entertainedHere's the breakdownThe Good--Much, much better than TCM2.--Decent acting, go figure. The movie that followed this one was just putrid.--Genuinely creepy moments--and for this franchise, rather refreshing.--Good looking blood when we have it.--Leatherface's fancy new saw.--Pretty good atmosphere.--The overt cheesiness of the second movie almost completely gone here.--Nice opening to the film. Reminiscent of one or two of the Nightmare on Elm Street films.... but I don't remember which one!Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help--Leatherface has a new mask. I didn't care too much for it, but granted, one would expect him to change his skin once in a while. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer Leatherface's old mask from the 70's.--Average music for the most part. The 80's horror cliché of bringing in some wicked Heavy Metal tunes was present here, luckily, it was instrumental and not invasive. Also, it didn't feel as dated or cheesy as a lot of older horror films with Metal music in them.

But neither do I condone vigilante-style justice. This author of the book and the makers of this film seem to be of the opinion that sexual predators deserve to die a violent death, and that their killers should be allowed to get away with it. The picture disturbed me greatly for its lack of a sense of true justice, as well as the cheap exploitation and ignorance that the script espoused. I couldn't have been more shocked if this film had condoned mob lynching, genocide, serial killing &#150; or child abuse, for that matter. Morally wrong is morally wrong, and the defense of vigilantism is morally wrong.Some people continue to insist that this film is based on a true story even though the author has never presented credible evidence that it's based on fact. Some have suggested that this was a matter of publicity seeking, but I believe that his insistence that it's based on truth is merely a way of lending its unbelievable plot line more credibility. In this film, Kevin Bacon plays a low-life security guard in a Catholic reform school. He and two other guards routinely victimize and intimidate their young charges, forcing themselves on teenage boys in horrendous acts of sexual abuse. Years later, one of their victims spots the Kevin Bacon character in a restaurant and shoots him dead in cold blood. Unfortunately, there's nothing unbelievable about the plot up to this point. Child abusers do exist, and people do kill for revenge. It's what follows next that is so incredible.The murder is followed by a cover-up at all levels to protect the murderer. We are asked to believe that, in order to exonerate a killer &#150; a GUILTY killer - a Catholic priest would lie under oath and a prosecutor would throw a capitol murder case, all on the basis of the idea that the fag child molester got what was coming to him. Of course, most well-read and enlightened people know that sexual predators who victimize children are almost always heterosexual. And although there is no indication in the film that the Kevin Bacon character is homosexual, many people (probably a majority of people in the US) still wrongly believe that most gay men are child abusers and most child abusers are gay. I believe that this homophobic reasoning underlies the author's conviction that the murderer is justified in his actions; this opinion is further underscored by the fact that the mood of the film when the killer is acquitted is nothing less than celebratory. I also believe that it's one reason why so many people think that a movie in which someone literally gets away with murder is a great film.For me, this picture was bad in a dozen different ways that I found offensive &#150; the storyline reflects bad logic, bad judgment, bad justice, bad morals, bad lessons and bad drama. All combined, this film annoyed me from the first scene forward. The conclusion that murder can be justified struck me as absolutely barbarian, and I was flabbergasted at the fact that such a distinguished group of fine actors would lend their skills to this bigoted, puerile garbage. The more I watched, the more I got the impression that this film, and the book it was based on, was created only to please homophobic adolescents. If you are the sort of ignorant Neanderthal who would think it's OK to commit murder as long as you're blowing away a sexual deviate, then this film is for you. If you further believe that murder in the name of revenge is not only defensible but perfectly just, then you will find this film rewarding.With all the talk in the news these days about sex abuse victims coming forward to accuse their tormentors, I would have liked this film much more if the boys had simply banded together and accused Bacon and the other guards of the abuse, bringing charges in adulthood for what they suffered as adolescents. Surely if real life victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests can find relief though genuine legal means and have their accusations believed (as so many have done) why not the teens depicted here? A far more satisfying ending would have been for Kevin Bacon (and his cohorts, who escaped any retribution at all, including the vigilante killing) to receive exposure and proper legal punishment.

The more I watched, the more I got the impression that this film, and the book it was based on, was created only to please homophobic adolescents. If you are the sort of ignorant Neanderthal who would think it's OK to commit murder as long as you're blowing away a sexual deviate, then this film is for you. If you further believe that murder in the name of revenge is not only defensible but perfectly just, then you will find this film rewarding.With all the talk in the news these days about sex abuse victims coming forward to accuse their tormentors, I would have liked this film much more if the boys had simply banded together and accused Bacon and the other guards of the abuse, bringing charges in adulthood for what they suffered as adolescents. Surely if real life victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests can find relief though genuine legal means and have their accusations believed (as so many have done) why not the teens depicted here? A far more satisfying ending would have been for Kevin Bacon (and his cohorts, who escaped any retribution at all, including the vigilante killing) to receive exposure and proper legal punishment.

But neither do I condone vigilante-style justice. This author of the book and the makers of this film seem to be of the opinion that sexual predators deserve to die a violent death, and that their killers should be allowed to get away with it. The picture disturbed me greatly for its lack of a sense of true justice, as well as the cheap exploitation and ignorance that the script espoused. I couldn't have been more shocked if this film had condoned mob lynching, genocide, serial killing &#150; or child abuse, for that matter. Morally wrong is morally wrong, and the defense of vigilantism is morally wrong.Some people continue to insist that this film is based on a true story even though the author has never presented credible evidence that it's based on fact. Some have suggested that this was a matter of publicity seeking, but I believe that his insistence that it's based on truth is merely a way of lending its unbelievable plot line more credibility. In this film, Kevin Bacon plays a low-life security guard in a Catholic reform school. He and two other guards routinely victimize and intimidate their young charges, forcing themselves on teenage boys in horrendous acts of sexual abuse. Years later, one of their victims spots the Kevin Bacon character in a restaurant and shoots him dead in cold blood. Unfortunately, there's nothing unbelievable about the plot up to this point. Child abusers do exist, and people do kill for revenge. It's what follows next that is so incredible.The murder is followed by a cover-up at all levels to protect the murderer. We are asked to believe that, in order to exonerate a killer &#150; a GUILTY killer - a Catholic priest would lie under oath and a prosecutor would throw a capitol murder case, all on the basis of the idea that the fag child molester got what was coming to him. Of course, most well-read and enlightened people know that sexual predators who victimize children are almost always heterosexual. And although there is no indication in the film that the Kevin Bacon character is homosexual, many people (probably a majority of people in the US) still wrongly believe that most gay men are child abusers and most child abusers are gay. I believe that this homophobic reasoning underlies the author's conviction that the murderer is justified in his actions; this opinion is further underscored by the fact that the mood of the film when the killer is acquitted is nothing less than celebratory. I also believe that it's one reason why so many people think that a movie in which someone literally gets away with murder is a great film.For me, this picture was bad in a dozen different ways that I found offensive &#150; the storyline reflects bad logic, bad judgment, bad justice, bad morals, bad lessons and bad drama. All combined, this film annoyed me from the first scene forward.

He did that bob-hairdo as William Blake, an accountant in this movie. Directed by Jim Jarmusch, who did Coffee and Cigarettes, and Broken Flowers (starring Bill Murray in a role written for him), this is a black-and-white western tale about one man's extraordinary journey starting from the town of Machine.The introduction is queer, with seemingly endless and repetitive shots of Blake on a train from Cleveland to Machine, interspersed by scenes of the train wheels chugging along. He arrives in a strange town and discovered that the job which was waiting for him, had been filled. Lost, he wanders about town and got a one night stand with a lady.Alas, his life goes downhill from that point on, when the lady's ex-boyfriend arrives and a shootout occurs. Pinned with the blame of a double murder, Blake escapes to the wild west, and got rescued by Nobody, a native Indian, who is equally surprised at how Blake survived having a bullet so close to his heart. And still lodged.Hence an uneasy friendship between the two men is forged as they hold off bounty hunters after Blake (from a bounty of 200 to 2000 dollars), but Blake has to put up with Nobody's mumbo-jumbo and quoting of poetry. Indeed, the words of wisdom spewed is simply hilarious at times, as they just don't make sense.It's shot in black and white, and deliberately slow paced, so this might not appeal to everyone. However, the number of stars in this show will probably raise your interest level, like Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Robert Mitchum, Gabriel Byrne, Lance Henrikson, Michael Wincott, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thorton, Alfred Molina and Steve Buscemi.But what's beautiful about the film is the awesome soundtrack from the rocksy\/folksy guitars riffs of Neil Young. Which without, the movie would just not work. It's pretty violent in some of the shootouts, but nothing is made too outrageous. Keep your ears peeled at the dialogues and conversations too.So if you're a fan of Depp, why not give this movie a watch?
