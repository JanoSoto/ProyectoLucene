It sheds some lights on some for '60's standards controversial subjects but it does this in a light enjoyable way, without making the movie too preachy, though its message still comes over perfectly.I wasn't too sure what to expect when watching this movie. Guess I expected another silly over-the-top British comedy but the movie turned out to be a light movie about some serious matters. Sounds like a weird combination but it works out perfectly.This is probably the definitive Michael Caine role. It's the role most people shall always remember him for and he had a hard time getting rid of his Cockney-image after this movie. The main character is rude, self-centered and over-confident. Yet the character intrigues and you never start to hate him. I think this says a lot about the way Michael Caine portrays him. He delivers one of his best, if not best performances, that you have to see to believe. He carries the entire movie and lifts it to a level of true excellence.It really is the main character that makes the movie and its story work out so fine. It sorts of even makes you forget that also the great Shelley Winters is in the movie, giving away a fine performance. Also Denholm Elliott shows up in a small but really great role.For its time Alfie is a quite daring movie. The subject of self-centered lady-killers isn't a much lighted subject. He messes around with married women, even women of men that he knows and even manages to get a married woman pregnant. Which brings us to the most controversial subject of the movie; abortion. He doesn't ever get emotional involved with any of them and drops them as soon as he gets bored of them or when they're becoming too difficult to handle or maintain a relationship with. It's a rude movie but the style it is made in makes sure that its more of a fun and light one to watch. This doesn't mean that the message about self behavior doesn't come across. Through the performances and style of movie-making the message still comes across perfectly and effective, in a non-forced way.The main character in the movie slowly begins to realize that this is not the right way to live. He's starting to age and his health is also starting to decline. He gets a couple of setbacks in the movie which are needed to make him aware of his own behavior. HE tries to change and settle down but is it possible to still set things straight and start living a new life after all those years of not caring? The movie subtle handles these questions and many more. It's all the more reason why Alfie is such a powerful and effective movie to watch.The movie is very style-fully directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later went on directed some fan-favorite James Bond movies. The constant talking-right-into-the-camera of the main character works great in an original narrative way and makes lots of things clear without wasting to much time on the images or dialog of a sequences. It helps to make Alfie a fast paced movie that is over before you know it. It also helps you to get involved deeper- and more easy with the main character.The movie also gives us an excellent realistic view in the '60's and the social life of the period. It sort of makes this an essential '60's viewing.An excellent, amusing and powerful mix of drama and comedy, with an intriguing main character and story filled with controversial subjects, without ever trying to shock or preach.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 November 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is an excellent character study and period study of the '60's.

But don't be scared off by thinking Casablanca has coasted by all these years on its hefty reputation - even now, more than 60 years down the road, this film stands the test of time as one of the most influential, inspiring, quotable and just plain well made creations Hollywood has ever come up with. But one could go on all day listing different adjectives detailing Casablanca's classic status, so I'll try to bite them back and give a bit more of an analysis of the film. Director Michael Curtiz brings the film together with a touch which is daring, yet steady as a rock, presenting a powerful yet entertaining portrait of the days of Nazi occupied France, a message of hope shining through and the tumultuous love affair which grew in the midst of them - in short, the perfect period piece. The cinematography is excellent for the time, sporting a simply beautiful, film noire sheen. The movie's high point (if one could be selected) is its wonderful screenplay, which is without a doubt, one of the single best of all time - both witty, bitingly political, classy, and filled with too many endlessly quoted lines to count. (Here's looking at you kid I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship and Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she had to walk into mine only being the tip of the iceberg) The endlessly referenced ending actually comes as surprising, but fits the tone of unrequited love perfectly, and shows how daring and unique this wonderful movie must have been in its time. Humphrey Bogart is at his stoically iconic best here, creating a touching portrait of an infinitely complex and flawed man with layer upon layer of exquisitely written characterisation (what's your nationality? I'm a drunkard) to peel away. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman also gives a timeless performance as Bogart's mysterious past lover, and Paul Henreid makes a wonderful addition to the most classic love triangle of all time. The movie also manages to include several incredibly entertaining character roles, including the superb Claude Rains as a sympathetic police officer, Sydney Greenstreet as a corrupt club owner, and the deliciously creepy Peter Lorre in a far too brief supporting role. Suffice to say, Casablanca is one of those films one can shamelessly say they have enjoyed time and time and time again - there are far too many subtle nuances to be caught and enjoyed in a single viewing, and the movie has a replay value next to none, making them easy to catch. Casablanca is billed as the most classic love story of all time, yes, but there is ultimately so much more to it than that. Safe to say, the term must see applies here if you have yet to do so, and if you are among those who have already experienced the classic, there's not the least bit of shame of wanting to play it again, and live the magic one more time. -10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 November 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" One would be hard pressed to find a list of Best films ever made without Casablanca included on it - indeed, if any movie was to be singled out as the most laudable and classic picture of all time, there is no doubt that Casablanca would be right up there in the running, if not bestowed the title itself.

Got to the first cassette eventually and then realized when the credits started to roll what a dufuss I was. Anyway, I watched it and was impressed.A few days ago I bought the special 25'th anniversary edition on DVD at Costco and last night I completed watching it. I was just knocked out. I do not recall the original film having interviews with the survivors of that era spliced into the film (like it is done a bit in Band of Brothers) but in this new edition we have cutaways to recent interviews with very old survivors of that time - to great effect.The print is crystal clear, highlighting one of the best lit and staged films in recent memory. It reminds me of the luminous colors of Heavens Gate and Carrington. The cinematography by Vittoria Storaro is simply divine. The editing is very good with just a few moments that cut very rapidly and are a bit jarring; but I will give Beatty the benefit of doubt - perhaps it was meant to be sharp at that moment. The music is wonderful, not too distracting, always supporting the drama or humor of the moment.This is a true story and although I only know of John Reed's life through this movie, I do not know how much liberty was taken or how many facts were manipulated, if any. I grew up hearing of how important Ten days that shook the world was but have yet to read it. I am also aware that most American's still harbor a pathological loathing of anything to do with the word Communist; as such Reed's life was full of a struggle between his own social conscience and his lack of acceptance of the reality that to his fellow American's his vision was far too radical and at the end, poisonous. Reed strikes me as a man bursting at the seams with creative energy that is slowly but surely fastened to the plight of the working men and women, to blue collar suffering, finally to the emancipation of all the working class in the overcharged updraft of early Marxist Bolshevism. As an idealist at heart and a deeply concerned but ferocious activist and overall political troublemaker, he relished nothing more than to push his shoulders into the friction of debate, the center of which eventually took him to the Russian peasant revolution, the rise of Lenin and the modern Communist Russian states. He might just have spent more time in the political dog pit than was warranted and in the film he is reminded over and over again by his long suffering wife, Louise Bryant, that his efforts were best directed to writing rather than getting arrested for political activism.Beatty, as legend has it, was consumed and obsessed with the telling of Reed's story, of creating a film on a very large scale in order to match the enormity of the story as it unfolded in America and even more in Russia. After having watched this new edition I can happily say that Beatty should be more engrossed in many more projects this is a remarkably adult, mature, insightful, talented, beautiful telling of a great history, one that touched the lives of so many people. It is a sad story that Reed is not well known today; I have heard that he is the ONLY American buried in the Kremlin. Even after the collapse of the Soviet empire and the falling of the Berlin wall, this is still a very important film and it involved huge personal risk for Beatty.The cast is outstanding. Diane Keaton is young and pretty. She is not the most beautiful woman but she does look attractive and her acting is terrific. Jack Nicholson does what he does best embody characters with all his self and in this case the great play-write Eugene O'Neil. His brooding and broiling inner self does not overwhelm but simmers at a constant hot temperature. Jack holds in check his killer smile but the glare from his eyes is powerful and full of passion.In summary this is a film that has only improved with age, the acting, directing, script, cinematography and continuity are all excellent. Beatty took the risk of reaching further than his grasp but we are blessed with a sure hand, a clear eye and a total devotion to his craft. A great achievement and one he should be proud of. Not to be missed.

Jack Nicholson does what he does best embody characters with all his self and in this case the great play-write Eugene O'Neil. His brooding and broiling inner self does not overwhelm but simmers at a constant hot temperature. Jack holds in check his killer smile but the glare from his eyes is powerful and full of passion.In summary this is a film that has only improved with age, the acting, directing, script, cinematography and continuity are all excellent. Beatty took the risk of reaching further than his grasp but we are blessed with a sure hand, a clear eye and a total devotion to his craft. A great achievement and one he should be proud of. Not to be missed.

Got to the first cassette eventually and then realized when the credits started to roll what a dufuss I was. Anyway, I watched it and was impressed.A few days ago I bought the special 25'th anniversary edition on DVD at Costco and last night I completed watching it. I was just knocked out. I do not recall the original film having interviews with the survivors of that era spliced into the film (like it is done a bit in Band of Brothers) but in this new edition we have cutaways to recent interviews with very old survivors of that time - to great effect.The print is crystal clear, highlighting one of the best lit and staged films in recent memory. It reminds me of the luminous colors of Heavens Gate and Carrington. The cinematography by Vittoria Storaro is simply divine. The editing is very good with just a few moments that cut very rapidly and are a bit jarring; but I will give Beatty the benefit of doubt - perhaps it was meant to be sharp at that moment. The music is wonderful, not too distracting, always supporting the drama or humor of the moment.This is a true story and although I only know of John Reed's life through this movie, I do not know how much liberty was taken or how many facts were manipulated, if any. I grew up hearing of how important Ten days that shook the world was but have yet to read it. I am also aware that most American's still harbor a pathological loathing of anything to do with the word Communist; as such Reed's life was full of a struggle between his own social conscience and his lack of acceptance of the reality that to his fellow American's his vision was far too radical and at the end, poisonous. Reed strikes me as a man bursting at the seams with creative energy that is slowly but surely fastened to the plight of the working men and women, to blue collar suffering, finally to the emancipation of all the working class in the overcharged updraft of early Marxist Bolshevism. As an idealist at heart and a deeply concerned but ferocious activist and overall political troublemaker, he relished nothing more than to push his shoulders into the friction of debate, the center of which eventually took him to the Russian peasant revolution, the rise of Lenin and the modern Communist Russian states. He might just have spent more time in the political dog pit than was warranted and in the film he is reminded over and over again by his long suffering wife, Louise Bryant, that his efforts were best directed to writing rather than getting arrested for political activism.Beatty, as legend has it, was consumed and obsessed with the telling of Reed's story, of creating a film on a very large scale in order to match the enormity of the story as it unfolded in America and even more in Russia. After having watched this new edition I can happily say that Beatty should be more engrossed in many more projects this is a remarkably adult, mature, insightful, talented, beautiful telling of a great history, one that touched the lives of so many people. It is a sad story that Reed is not well known today; I have heard that he is the ONLY American buried in the Kremlin. Even after the collapse of the Soviet empire and the falling of the Berlin wall, this is still a very important film and it involved huge personal risk for Beatty.The cast is outstanding.

Brian de Palma gets a fine entertaining product with a meticulous direction and a well created atmosphere of the 20's and early 30's in Chicago when Capone was at his peak. The film has tension, the action sequences are well handled and the musical score -though somewhat odd- fits enough.Kevin Costner is correct as Elliot Ness but the acting coup de force is between Sean Connery (as Malone) and Robert de Niro (as Capone), both outstanding in their characters; de Niro is perhaps the best in a role that has had excellent performers in pictures such as Rod Steiger, Ben Gazzara and Jason Robards. Good jobs too from Andy Garcìa and Charles Martin Smith as Costner's sidekick lawmen. Billy Drago looks mean enough as Frank Nitti.The famous sequence at the train station (baby and stairs included) is not a highlight to me for I found it definitely too slow and long and the same with the sequence when Ness goes after Nitti at he Court House. Clear overrunning of some particular sequences is a usual characteristic in de Palma's films and no one knows why (Craig Wasson following Deborah Shelton through a mall in Body Double and Angie Dickinson and the man at the art museum in Dressed to Kill, both being perfect examples).But all in all The Untouchables is a fine and enjoyable crime and gangsters movie. Worth watching indeed.
