The Super Mario Bros. games were so much fun because of the original thought that went into the story and characters. Players are immersed in a colorful, strange, and silly world where they are in control of a pair of plumber brothers from Brooklyn that find themselves in a place called the Mushroom Kingdom where they must save the the Mushroom Kingdom princess from a giant turtle-like creature named Bowser and his minions. The movie (very) vaguely sticks to the storyline, but replaces all the interesting creatures in the video game with human representations (Dennis Hopper's Bowser is a particular stretch) and replaces the whimsical Mushroom Kingdom we're used to with a dull, uninteresting, dismal world that doesn't even remotely resemble anything in any Mario Bros. video game.Anyway, besides my problem with the movie's inability to stick to the plot of the video game, the movie as a whole is an incredible waste of time that fails to satisfy. I'm not quite sure what the target audience was for the movie, but it doesn't seem to appeal to any one age group, while the video games are timeless classics that all can enjoy.

It was just to unrealistic, with the characters breaking into song at every given opportunity it was just to hard to get involved in the film & actually believe that it was real life. A few years after I first saw the film I sat down & watched it again. This time I loved it. I know many people who can't stand the film & would never watch it again, I know many others who adore it & watch it again & again & again. This is not one of those films that you like a little bit, this is one of those films that you either love or hate, but you have to watch it. This film is written, directed & produced by Baz Luhrmann. Unlike other directors & producers he uses different techniques to remind the viewer that this isn't real life it is just a story, in 'Moulin Rouge' the songs. These techniques are what make his films so distinctive; these techniques are what made me hate the film at first. Once you get used to his different style of film making, you can actually enjoy the film without getting too involved.The story is set in Paris in the late 1800's, Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, comes to the capital of Bohemian life, to live a penniless existence as a writer, much to his father's disappointment. Christian came to Paris to write a story about that which all bohemians believed in-truth, beauty, freedom & love. Unfortunately for Christian though, he had never been in love. 'Luckily right at that moment an unconscious Argentinean fell through my roof, he was followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun&#133;' From here onwards the story develops. Christian goes on to write a musical play to be performed at the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld club in Paris. When at the club, Christian meets the chief courtesan of the Moulin Rouge-Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. He falls head over heels in love with her & eventually she falls for him too. The clubs owner Harold Ziddler, played by Jim Broadbent, persuades a wealthy Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, to donate some money to the club, but only on the condition that Satine becomes his wife. This story develops into a crazy love triangle, it's unpredictable from start to finish but will Christian have his happy ever after? The story starts & ends with Christian narrating it, he has written his story, his story is the book he has been longing to write for so long, the film tells his story & the story of his writing his story.Ewan McGregor & Nicole Kidman work well together & in fact the most remarkable part of the whole film is probably that all of their songs were actually sung by them. The others actors credit the film & fit the characters perfectly, the only criticism I would give is a slightly pointless scene featuring Kylie Minogue. A heart-warming story with the main theme 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love & be loved in return'. A story of a love that will never end, no matter what obstacles stand in its way. A film that will have you in fits of laughter one minute & floods of tears the next. A guaranteed tearjerker, with a great soundtrack, talented actors & actresses & a good storyline. Love it or hate it, it's an experience you won't forget.

We also know the Farrelly brothers, who've done a lot of R-rated crude comedies lately, and who directed Carrey earlier in Dumb & Dumber. Now, imagine that these meet, in a movie that's typical for the Farrelly's, with Jim acting the way he always does(which is usually funny, even in bad movies). Sounds great, right? Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. The film has virtually no laughs at all, as it's taken to the extremes and beyond... constantly. The humor tries far too hard to be funny and shocking, and winds up being disgusting and embarrassing. The only laughs come from the three black teens in the film, one of whom being the nearly always funny Anthony Anderson, probably better known from Scary Movie 3. Their characters talk like black rappers or kids from the ghetto(swear words, yelling) but are very intelligent, at the same time. This has a bit of a comedic effect, even though it's just a gimmick and it does wind up getting old, about half-way through the film. Carrey himself has some funny bits, but too much of it is just not him; he's supposed to make funny faces, say funny noises and jump around. That's him at his best. The first Ace Ventura film is a good example of this, as is Liar Liar. However, in this film he doesn't get to use his talent for physical comedy all that much. Half of the physical comedy is just him being beaten up... it was good to see him fight himself, but there was too little of it. And why does half of the humor center around Carrey being humiliated? The director of Ace Ventura 2(Steve Oedekerk) made the same mistake, and look how (un)popular that film was. In conclusion, the only right director for Carrey is Tom Shadyac(Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty), at least in my opinion. The plot is daft and poorly paced. The acting is nothing special. The characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes. The dialog holds very few memorable quotes, though there are a few. All in all, the film is just bad, by Carrey's and the Farrelly's standards(and all other standards, for that matter).

This film is considered one of the best imitators, primarily because of its tongue-in-cheek approach and it's deliberately campy writing and casting. Menzies is a hotshot missing persons expert who goes in search of two young hikers who have disappeared. She enlists the aid of hermit-like Dillman who lives near an abandoned government testing facility where the hikers were last suspected to have been. When they come upon a murky tank and believe the bodies could be at the bottom, Menzies releases the contents, unwittingly unleashing a school of vicious, genetically-altered piranha onto an unsuspecting river full of camp kids and park revelers. From there, it's a race against the clock to get to Dillman's young daughter who is about to enter a camp relay race in the water downstream. The film is deliberately peppered with actors who've made their mark in either horror or suspense films and it makes no pretenses about its lack of originality (though it does manage to come up with some despite itself!) Dillman (sporting an atrocious come-and-go Southern accent) and Menzies have a surprisingly decent rapport with each other with a few amusing scenes tossed in amongst all the panic. McCarthy pops up as a terrified scientist who knows his plans have gone awry. Wynn has a cameo as a gruff, but likable neighbor of Dillman's. Steele plays an ominous scientist in cahoots with Army colonel Gordon to keep the whole situation under wraps. Bartel is the persnickety camp counselor and Miller is the smarmy amusement park owner, both of whom disbelieve that there's any danger. Despite it's minuscule budget and rather homemade effects, the film does generate a bit of eye-opening gore and more than a little discomfort as these tiny fish nibble away at anything in the water. If Jaws caused people to avoid the ocean, this film could make people think twice about cloudy rivers and lakes! The murkiness of the water only adds to the horror of it all as the bikini-clad tourists and innertube-wielding kids can't begin to see what's coming. It's just a sting, then a nibble, then blood everywhere! Some of the effects are tacky and amusing, but there's a certain level of true fear as well. If one likes this genre to begin with, it will probably be a pleasure to watch. Others may be less enthralled.

She enlists the aid of hermit-like Dillman who lives near an abandoned government testing facility where the hikers were last suspected to have been. When they come upon a murky tank and believe the bodies could be at the bottom, Menzies releases the contents, unwittingly unleashing a school of vicious, genetically-altered piranha onto an unsuspecting river full of camp kids and park revelers. From there, it's a race against the clock to get to Dillman's young daughter who is about to enter a camp relay race in the water downstream. The film is deliberately peppered with actors who've made their mark in either horror or suspense films and it makes no pretenses about its lack of originality (though it does manage to come up with some despite itself!) Dillman (sporting an atrocious come-and-go Southern accent) and Menzies have a surprisingly decent rapport with each other with a few amusing scenes tossed in amongst all the panic. McCarthy pops up as a terrified scientist who knows his plans have gone awry. Wynn has a cameo as a gruff, but likable neighbor of Dillman's. Steele plays an ominous scientist in cahoots with Army colonel Gordon to keep the whole situation under wraps. Bartel is the persnickety camp counselor and Miller is the smarmy amusement park owner, both of whom disbelieve that there's any danger. Despite it's minuscule budget and rather homemade effects, the film does generate a bit of eye-opening gore and more than a little discomfort as these tiny fish nibble away at anything in the water. If Jaws caused people to avoid the ocean, this film could make people think twice about cloudy rivers and lakes! The murkiness of the water only adds to the horror of it all as the bikini-clad tourists and innertube-wielding kids can't begin to see what's coming. It's just a sting, then a nibble, then blood everywhere! Some of the effects are tacky and amusing, but there's a certain level of true fear as well. If one likes this genre to begin with, it will probably be a pleasure to watch. Others may be less enthralled.

You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists, it is incredibly, deeply, romantic and at the same time terrifying, and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action, mystery, horror, and at the heart is the pure, simplistic romance of it all.The story is about an investment banker played by Patrick Swayze and his girlfriend, played by Demi Moore. Sam and Molly are deeply in love, planning for the future and happier in their lives than ever before. Until Sam discovers laundered money in investment accounts. He is robbed and subsequently murdered for his password to the computer in order to empty the laundered money from the accounts. But Sam doesn't go the other side. He is kept on earth in spirit form because of his unfinished business both with Molly and to discover his murderer. He must learn the ropes of being a ghost and nobody else can hear him until he runs into a so called psychic who scams people into believing she can contact their dearly departed. However it turns out, Oda Mae Brown played in her academy award winning role by Whoopie Goldberg can actually hear Sam. Together the unlikely team must help each other uncover the horrible murder plot and save Molly.Swayze and Moore make an incredible couple..hot on screen. Their careers have perhaps slipped since then one might say but this was them at their best. Swayze was indeed at the top of his game coming out of Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse and Moore was young and a new hot commodity which made them undeniably perfect together. Their roles fit them perfectly. Whoopie Goldberg was hilarious and believable as Oda Mae and her character was such an integral part of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays a great villain as the betrayer of the film. In a short time director Jerry Zucker establishes a best friendship between Goldwyn and Swayze, a deeply loving relationship between Swayze and Moore, and a plot line that goes far beneath the movie. Obviously Goldwyn's character is being used by a much higher up criminal to launder money although we never see him. Is he being blackmailed? Paid off? Something held over his head? Maybe he's not the bad guy but rather forced to commit these acts? It's a big job because we also know Willie Lopez played by Rick Aviles is involved in this as well. And deeper than that we have the theology in the film. The light brings good people to the afterlife and the dark shadowy beings torture the evil. This film is one of a few that is endlessly watchable meaning you can sit down any time and watch it through over and over and over again which is exactly what makes it a classic. It has it's holes, it has to with a plot like that. And it has it's disturbing moments, a gratituous death scene, a make out scene which although features Swayze and Moore is actually Demi and Whoopi...you have to see it to understand it. Also if Sam Wheat must learn how to physically touch things in his ghost form...how does he sit, walk, etc before he learns that? And his first experience with walking through a door happens days after his death. I'm sure sometime between then and that point he would have had to have walked through something. Perhaps those are minor points but they are things that will come up especially if you have seen it as many times as I have. The film is a must see and if you haven't seen it, go watch it right now!!

Wes Craven, a hack scare-film director if there ever was one, returns to the sinister icon that made him famous, Freddy Krueger, in this weird in-joke featuring Heather Langenkamp, the heroine of the original NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, as herself. She's now a wife and mother, living somewhere in Hollywood and keeping house. She's approached to make another Freddy film, but can't shake the feeling that it's a bad idea. Long story short, Freddy has decided to cross over from movie reality to our reality, so he can unleash his evil on the world in a much more direct way. Of course, this means that a lot of people have to die, and somewhere along the way her son becomes possessed by the evil man's spirit (or some such nonsense). Craven has always had a hard time scaring me, and while I can acknowledge the power (if not the greatness) of a LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or the originality of SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW, I have to say that I think his is one of the most undistinguished careers in Hollywood. I so disliked this movie that I couldn't believe it had actually been released... to be fair, the concept isn't at all bad; the execution is my problem. IT SIMPLY ISN'T SCARY!!!!!!!! In any case, NEW NIGHTMARE is in the end nothing less than a rationalization for cashing in a little more on the Freddy franchise (remember all that crap when the film was released about Craven admonishing those who referred to it as a sequel to the other NIGHTMARE films?

There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute.

A surprisingly good performance by Bruce Willis. He's performance is very solid that you actually believe him. His contribution to the genre won't be forgotten, believe me. Hailey Joel Osment steals the show and gives probably the second best performance by a child actor in a horror movie (Linda Blair is still the best). The boy can make the audience feel his fears. Toni Collete also gives a touching performance. Solid performances this time.DIRECTION. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is stylish, classy, and creepy. The man knew how to create a scary atmosphere with dark settings and situations when not expected. Creative shots and camera angles support the good direction. The correct use of lightning and darkness is wonderful. This is a ghostly direction. Great job.F\/X, SCORE, CINEMATOGRAPHY. -The f\/x are pretty good. The dead people look scary. Shyamalan perfectly knew how a big part of the audience visualizes dead people. -Great score. -The cinematography is very Hollywood. It's perfect but very stylish for a horror movie. The Hollywood look doesn't helps the Sixth Sense in being 100% scary. Still it's pretty good.*SPOILERS* The Sixth Sense has made great contributions to the genre. Positive and negative contributions. First, it brought back the ghost sub-genre and in the best way possible. The story is solid and very well crafted. The events are connected perfectly and that's the main reason that the ending is that shocking. Many people say that this movie isn't scary, that the audience can guess the ending at the first half of the movie, that the plot twists do not impress, blah, blah. You know there's a lot of people like that...I bet that 99% of these people, if they watched the movie OBJECTIVELY; were actually shocked by the movie's ending and goings. The so called experts in the genre (most of them are obsessed with the 70's horror movies) can't accept the movie's originality and success. I'm not a big fan of these kind of movies but I accept it's an original horror movie with a great ending. The bad thing about the movie is that it served as model for many horror movies that try to create a shocking ending but fail miserably and disturb the audience. The ending in this movie is carefully planned, it connects all the situations perfectly with the scare factor. Unlike other movies that abruptly come up with a shocking ending that angers the audience (a la The Village).The truth is that the movie is very original and offers something that no other horror movie had before (or at least it wasn't very popular and in the reach of the fans of the genre). The movie is not only about horror or scares; there's drama (a mother worried about her son), a message of respect to the phenomenons that science can't explain, and a message of life (the whole Bruce Willis situation with his wife). The movie is by no means scarier than the brilliant Exorcist but it's a movie that commands the new generation of horror movies. It's the reference to the late 90's horror and that's something that will forever mark the genre. It was about time for evolution.8.5\/10 One of the best horror movies that catches the attention of the viewer since minute 1. Not many big budget horror movies can accomplish something like that.

Usually it's Hitchcock that comes under De Palma's 'list of things to tribute', but on this occasion it's the classic tales of 'Phantom of the Opera' and the German legend, 'Faust' that get the honours. De Palma has managed to fuse the two stories into one...very, very weird film. Winslow Leach is a musician who has his lyrics stolen by the megalomaniac record producer known as 'Swan'. Winslow doesn't take this lightly, and much less so when he gets framed by Swan and sent to Sing-Sing. However, he gets out and while attempting to avenge himself, he ends up falling into a record press, which disfigures his face...ouch. The plot thickens due to the fact that Swan is planning to open up a new rock club known as 'The Paradise', and it's Winslow's lyrics that he wants to use for the opening. However, now scarred and with nowhere to go; Winslow decides to haunt The Paradise with the help of a silly plastic mask...becoming known as 'The Phantom'. But wait! The fun doesn't stop there, as De Palma, not content with an already thick plot has decided to complete the Phantom of the Opera side of the story by adding a girl singer for the phantom to obsess over - here played by Jessica Harper.This is an important film for Jessica Harper, as it is with this performance that she impressed Dario Argento into giving her a role in her career highlight - 'Suspiria'. It's a shame that Harper didn't make more films, as she has a very cute look that bodes well with the euro-horror feel that is abundant in both this film and, obviously, Suspiria. I'm not sure what Brian De Palma was trying to achieve with this film...there's no real point to it, and the plot is anything but coherent a lot of the time, leading me to believe that he simply wanted to make a flamboyant musical with horror elements, and if that is the case; I dare say he succeeded. Phantom of the Paradise is a lot of fun; the musical numbers are hilariously entertaining, and the movie is very fun overall. Some people won't be able to appreciate it, just because it is so surreal and absurdly weird; but if you're a fan of that type of film, you've come to the right place.While not as well done as 'Dressed to Kill' or some of De Palma's other tributes, and although the plot can get a little messy at times; Phantom of the Paradise stands out because it's so different to almost anything else ever made, and it comes with a recommendation for that reason.

De Palma has managed to fuse the two stories into one...very, very weird film. Winslow Leach is a musician who has his lyrics stolen by the megalomaniac record producer known as 'Swan'. Winslow doesn't take this lightly, and much less so when he gets framed by Swan and sent to Sing-Sing. However, he gets out and while attempting to avenge himself, he ends up falling into a record press, which disfigures his face...ouch. The plot thickens due to the fact that Swan is planning to open up a new rock club known as 'The Paradise', and it's Winslow's lyrics that he wants to use for the opening. However, now scarred and with nowhere to go; Winslow decides to haunt The Paradise with the help of a silly plastic mask...becoming known as 'The Phantom'. But wait! The fun doesn't stop there, as De Palma, not content with an already thick plot has decided to complete the Phantom of the Opera side of the story by adding a girl singer for the phantom to obsess over - here played by Jessica Harper.This is an important film for Jessica Harper, as it is with this performance that she impressed Dario Argento into giving her a role in her career highlight - 'Suspiria'. It's a shame that Harper didn't make more films, as she has a very cute look that bodes well with the euro-horror feel that is abundant in both this film and, obviously, Suspiria. I'm not sure what Brian De Palma was trying to achieve with this film...there's no real point to it, and the plot is anything but coherent a lot of the time, leading me to believe that he simply wanted to make a flamboyant musical with horror elements, and if that is the case; I dare say he succeeded. Phantom of the Paradise is a lot of fun; the musical numbers are hilariously entertaining, and the movie is very fun overall. Some people won't be able to appreciate it, just because it is so surreal and absurdly weird; but if you're a fan of that type of film, you've come to the right place.While not as well done as 'Dressed to Kill' or some of De Palma's other tributes, and although the plot can get a little messy at times; Phantom of the Paradise stands out because it's so different to almost anything else ever made, and it comes with a recommendation for that reason.

Once the generation of maturity retarded losers that praise this film comes into power, civilization as we know it will cease to be. Watching this film (home movie?) is like sitting in a junior high school locker room listening to 11 year old boys play grab ass. Seriously, if this film is entertaining to you, all I can say is you have had the bar set so low in your life that it is unlikely anything good will ever come out of it, save being really good at Limbo. I have read here many people praise this film for its brilliant script. All I can say about that is Don't Bogart that joint, my friend! To the sober minded, the script is simply stupid. In one scene dope dealer Jay sets clerk Dante straight with a diatribe about how selling soda for 78 cents more than a supermarket is tantamount to pushing drugs. Excellent point, ... DUDE, WHO SMOKED THE LAST OF MY 'METH?! If this script speaks to you all I can say is stay away from neighborhood dogs.Forget the horrendous acting, forget the crappy camera work, the unintelligible dialogue, the murky sound work, the fact that it didn't really have a plot of any kind, forget, even, that all of this is agreed upon by even the fans of this film, (in other words, forget the fact that this is a crappy film), can anyone quote me any memorable lines that a person over the age of 12 would find interesting, let alone brilliant? The script is pedestrian at best. Some have praised this film as being one of the funniest of the 90's. I suppose if you consider predictable bathroom humor and dick jokes, delivered with the finesse of an drunk uncle, funny then this is a masterpiece. I found it pathetic. I don't mind crude comedy if it is done well, as in Animal House, Caddyshack, Bevis and Butthead, et. al., this film has none of that. It is hack. Bevis and Butthead mocked the idiots they portrayed, this film celebrates them. The slight (very slight, I never laughed once) amount of comedy provided by Jay and Silent Bob and sometimes Randal, are never enough to save the movie, let alone their scenes, and even these are presented with such stumbling insecurity it feels like watching a really bad stand up on amateur night at The Apollo. In that regard one might say a joke or two were kind of funny, but how could you say that amateur had one of the best sets you have ever seen? Looking over the user comments here on the IMDb it appears many of the fans of this film do not have the capacity to do anything other than presume those who didn't like the film just didn't get it. I got it, you are the one who does not get it. Unfortunately, by the time you realize that you will be sucked so far into the vortex of the downward spiral you call your life you will be doomed to emulate the losers of this film. From the generation that made popular Jerry Springer, eating vomitous putrefactions for a prize and wearing pants around your thighs, comes the hallmark movie for losers Clerks. As Butthead would say Stop, in the name of all that which does not suck!
