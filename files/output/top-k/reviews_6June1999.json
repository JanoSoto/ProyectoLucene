[{"date":"6 June 1999","score":"","review":"  Ambitious Reese Witherspoon stops at nothing to win the high school student council presidency in Omaha, Nebraska, while Matthew Broderick is a history teacher with a grudge who throws obstacles in her way--namely, a dough-headed jock (Chris Klein) and miscounting of votes--and is sidetracked by an awkward affair and bee-sting to the eyelid which end up destroying his marriage and career until he meets his fate as museum tour guide in NYC. Very funny at times.  MTV Production's best film.  Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne (CITIZEN RUTH, 1996).  Okay tunes, including Donovan, The Commodores, Mandy Barnett, Patience and Prudence, April March, and The Damnations TX, who seem to be all over the soundtrack world.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"6 June 1999","score":"","review":"  The makers of Antz gave themselves a pat on the back for making a more adult animated movie much the way the makers on Contact patted themselves on the back for making an intellectual mainstream science fiction. They may be ambitious but both movies suffer from familiar cliches. Antz is really little more than any other union or what about my needs? movie. The first half hour I was knocked out by the design of the movie and some of the clever in-jokes, but the movie quickly settles into a pleasant routine of other battle for world domination films. The movie makes a point of individual thinking but the ants are all still sheep who will follow anyone who's not out to destroy them. The fact that the Gene Hackman ant is a mass murdering dictator makes it easy to promote the free-thinking dogma in Antz but if there were actually Woody Allen ants the insect world would probably collapse. When the (boring) Sharon Stone ant tells the Woody ant that he talks too much a kid sitting behind me in the theater said, no kidding. I couldn't agree more. And the when ants chant out Give Z a chance I knew this was a real baby-boomer-butt-kissing movie.Still, the movie is very entertaining as long as you don't think about it too much. The animation is amazing and it has some great jokes, my favorites involving the Danny Glover ant (even the insect world the black character dies nobly while protecting the white character) and the wasps. *** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 1999","score":"","review":"  The makers of Antz gave themselves a pat on the back for making a more adult animated movie much the way the makers on Contact patted themselves on the back for making an intellectual mainstream science fiction.
