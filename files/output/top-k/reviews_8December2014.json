There she also lived with one Duncan North, a kindergarten teacher the film is based on. Goodman could not believe how North was able to seduce so many women, given the fact that he was overweight and did not fit the mold of a typical Lothario. She decided to create 'The Tao of Steve' based on North's life, including how he utilized Taoist philosophy and combined it with American pop culture's embrace of a trinity of 'machismo' TV characters including Steve Austin (The Six Million Dollar Man), Steve McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O) and, above all, the ultimate 'bad boy' actor, Steve McQueen.Duncan North is dubbed 'Dex' in the film and is played by Donal Logue, an Irish actor who gained significant weight for the role. Logue is perfectly cast as the unlikely seducer of women and the philosophy his character imparts, is a textbook method for being successful with women. The best part of the film involves how he attempts to coach one of his slacker buddies, Dave, who is completely inept when it comes to finding a girlfriend. Dave believes that if he's simply a 'nice guy', women will be immediately drawn to him. Dex makes it clear that 'nice guys finish last' when it comes to seducing women. He introduces this three part plan of action with women (which Dave initially rejects) 1) suppress your desire to get her into bed; 2) be 'excellent' in her presence and 3) Just when things appear to be going good&#x97;retreat!What's great about 'Dex' is that he first has developed a skill that many men would like to have (the art of seduction) but are unable to follow through on. Dex is so good at what he does, that he eventually seduces a married woman who becomes infatuated with him. Unfortunately for Dex, the woman is married to his best friend, who ends up slugging him in the face when he finds out about his wife's infidelity.Dex finally meets his match in Syd, a set designer who was one of Dex's conquests back in their college days. The fact that Dex can't even remember that he bedded Syd way back then, becomes a sore point in their relationship. Nonetheless, love conquers all after Dex realizes that a deeper relationship with a woman beats simply seducing them, ad infinitum.'The Tao of Steve' is a rare example of an 'indie' film that works! The dialogue is on a high intellectual level (replete with literary references) and the plot is not only entertaining, but educational for clueless males. Greer Goodman, Jenniphr's sister, who plays Syd, is an excellent foil to the cad, Dex. Special mention must go to James 'Kimo' Wills, who plays the 'in the dark' Dave. Tao's ending is a bit sentimental and I wonder if Duncan North actually ended up with a 'love of his life', but you'll nonetheless be impressed with what first time feature director Jenniphr Goodman has done, fashioning a narrative that is both fanciful and decidedly true to life.

Despite its ridiculously far-fetched story, it mesmerizes even after dozens of screenings. As great as Hitchcock's form is here, Bernard Hermann﻿'s beautiful, symphonic score is also essential to the experience. It would be nice if some of the growing numbers of young head-down-and-texters would venture over to the revival theater showing this cinematic landmark in order to understand how much farther great culture can lift a soul than a QWERTY keyboard can. Vertigo opens with an enigma How does San Francisco Detective John Scotty Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) survive hanging from a rain gutter from a great height? No hint is provided. The murder plot is similarly perplexing. For example, how could a murderer risk easy exposure if the intended witness manages to overcome acrophobia and climb the stairs of a steep tower? We toss away plausibility when experiencing Hitchcock's universe, but the payoff here is huge.The famous reveal in 'Vertigo' is the subject of much scholarly discussion. (The film's twist is revealed about 25 minutes before it might have used as a surprise.) According to legend, every leading figure involved in the production disagreed with Hitchcock on the reveal, including Mrs. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had to fend them off. In his subsequent interview with François Truffaut﻿, he explains his preference for suspense, not surprise.There are several very widely-read biographies of Alfred Hitchcock with co-workers all saying he was impossible to like on a personal level. In Vertigo, the two leads have a strong argument. Despite how effortlessly the very gifted Jimmy Stewart﻿ plays Scotty, Hitchcock is said to have blamed Stewart's premature aging for Vertigo's box office failure. Hitchcock never worked with Stewart again, breaking up a legendary collaboration (of four superlative films). In addition, Hitchcock was unhappy with Kim Novak﻿, and is said to have publicly criticized her after 'Vertigo' was released. (Novak maintained a dignified silence.) I don't know what Hitchcock said about Novak, but it seems that Hitchcock has some thin department-store models showing off female clothing to Scotty and Madeleine. Also, when one of the sales women tells Scotty that Judy can wear a particular woman's suit after alterations, perhaps the comment and the slender models are both knocks on Novak's weight.Still, Hitchcock's characters show tremendous depth. Scotty's former love interest Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) is uniquely endearing. The scene where Midge tearfully destroys her witty painting (a spoof on Scotty's obsession) is really heart-wrenching. So is Midge's final appearance, the somber walk down the hallway in the sanitarium. Hitchcock really connects with lonely hearts through Midge. It is ironic that an artist as universally disliked by the people who worked with him could produce such profound moments with common people as we see him portray Scotty's forgotten ex-girlfriend. People tend to forget this when teeing off on Alfred Hitchcock, the man.If you have watched 'Vertigo' a few time notice how Hitchcock manipulates point of view. For example, when we first see Scotty after the opening predicament, he is in Midge's apartment. Seated but physically diminished, Scotty is balancing a cane when he says, ouch. The background is particularly busy. There is visual chaos all around Stewart's outline. It looks as if the background objects just fell from a height, not Scotty. Scotty is being under-appreciated. It is also interesting when another point of view (besides Scotty's) is being represented. For example, we see the floating petals from Madeleine's flower just before she jumps into San Francisco Bay. Another example is when Madeleine revisits the murder with her flashback. It lasts a few seconds but her side of the story is clearly identified. (That is, it appears filmed in a manner that conveys her as a reluctant pawn in a larger conspiracy.) Hitchcock is never just pointing a camera at a set where some action is taking place. He plans every visual detail before filming begins. Cinephiles already know what a great film 'Vertigo' is. It is a perennial pleasure that never gets stale. However, please don't take any ill-advised leaps across rooftops getting to the revival theater showing it.

A range of emotions were experienced. The man missing a leg was heartbroken that his wife would have to deal with him for the rest of her life and didn't want her to go through it, only to find that she was overjoyed to see him again regardless of what had happened. Anger and resent was felt from Alyosha as he discovered an unfaithful wife still living in her husband's home. Anger and resent soon switched to hopefulness by the father of the soldier Alyosha met upon leaving the front. But the most powerful presence in the film was the constant fear in the back of your mind that time was quickly running out for Alyosha to see his mother, missing a train here, dealing with a transport soldier there, having to deal with the German attack on the train. All of the anxiety and time crunch came to a head when Alyosha could only hug his mother and speak with briefly just to have to get back onto a truck and go back. Imaging the pain of a mother not seeing her son for months on end, not knowing if he's dead, alive, wounded, or captured just to see him for a few fleeting moments is heartbreaking.

However, I feel it is necessary to tell people that the novel written by Alex Haley with the help of Malcolm X is even more important than Lee's spectacular movie. In Lee's film, Malcolm never reaches the level of honesty that he does in the novel. Instead, Lee uses everything else in his arsenal to tell this compelling story. He tells most of Malcolm young life through flashbacks that just don't seem authentic and they feel rushed, but at the same time his use of color, lighting, and sound is phenomenal. The first third or so of the movie it runs through Malcolm's life as a hustler and during this time Lee uses very bright lighting and colors to give this part of the film a feeling of joy and it almost feels like it is to good to be true. However, in the novel there is a completely different feeling when reading it. You feel sorry for everything Malcolm had to go through as a child and reading about him making bad choices never really feels happy at all. Along with the color, Lee does an amazing job in large crowds. There is a scene when Malcolm arrives in New York and there is a huge gathering in the street and the camera zooms out but you never lose sight of Malcolm because he is the only one wearing somewhat bright clothes. Lee take on Malcolm being this beacon of light perhaps? If you are thinking about watching this movie I highly recommend it and it shouldn't be missed, but you shouldn't miss out on the novel as well. Each are very important stories told in different, but honest, ways.

He tells most of Malcolm young life through flashbacks that just don't seem authentic and they feel rushed, but at the same time his use of color, lighting, and sound is phenomenal. The first third or so of the movie it runs through Malcolm's life as a hustler and during this time Lee uses very bright lighting and colors to give this part of the film a feeling of joy and it almost feels like it is to good to be true. However, in the novel there is a completely different feeling when reading it. You feel sorry for everything Malcolm had to go through as a child and reading about him making bad choices never really feels happy at all. Along with the color, Lee does an amazing job in large crowds. There is a scene when Malcolm arrives in New York and there is a huge gathering in the street and the camera zooms out but you never lose sight of Malcolm because he is the only one wearing somewhat bright clothes. Lee take on Malcolm being this beacon of light perhaps? If you are thinking about watching this movie I highly recommend it and it shouldn't be missed, but you shouldn't miss out on the novel as well.

He spends his days picking up young girls and bringing them home for sex and spends his nights as a street thug. Roaming the streets of Britain with his band of droogies and fueled on a substance called Milk Plus, which they acquire from the local milk bar, he is nothing less than a thug who beats innocent citizens to a bloody pulp, rapes, robs and pillages whenever he isn't in a bloody street fight with other gangs.The Droogs random acts of violence bring them to the home of Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee) whom they beat senseless while raping his wife. We never see the act itself, but Alex prepares for this violation with a song and dance rendition of Singin' in the Rain. Later they invade the home of an artist whom Alex accidentally kills with a sculpture. The Droogies, tired of Alex constantly beating and berating them, double-cross him and leave him at the scene of the crime. He goes to jail.Alex becomes a test subject in an experiment in mind control whereby he is injected with a drug, then strapped to a chair with his eyes forced open while he watches a film footage of the exact kinds of crimes that he commits. But the drug alters his mind and he becomes violently ill. Afterwards, the effects linger and he is overwhelmed by nausea at the very thought of rape or murder or even the strains of Beethoven.Cast out into the world once again, he learns that what goes around comes around. He runs into his old Droogie buddies who have now become cops and they beat him unmercifully. Through an odd bout of karma, he ends up back in the home of Mr. Alexander. The man doesn't recognize him at first until he hears him singing, so he locks him in a room and plays Beethoven very loudly until Alex attempts suicide by jumping out the window. Waking up in the hospital, he is visited by several officials and is informed that the experiments were deemed unethical and so they begin a treatment to break him of his conditioning.What makes Alex so fascinating is how specifically Kubrick presents him. He is a nasty little man, hell-bent on violence and mayhem. What is so unsettling is his pure joy. He isn't one of those angry youths who is striking back at society. He loves what he is doing. He is a man who loves life, loves to get out of bed in the morning and lives for every carnal lust he can propagate. He carries the demeanor and the curled smile of an unapologetic pervert (which he is) and we in the audience become conditioned to want to like him, to like his laughing demeanor, his bold song and dance even when he's committing unspeakable acts. His lust for life is infectious.In the second half of the film, we are pulled in the other direction. We, as the viewer, are rational enough to know that he is committing acts of pure evil and so when he goes through experiments that make him sickened by his actions, we can't disagree. What makes Alex so interesting are his quirks his cain and smoking jacket, his lust for Beethoven, his lust for young girls and his joy at beating his droogie underlings senseless. The film is unapologetically misogynistic, Kubrick surrounds him with phallic imagery from his codpiece to his pet snake to his cain, seemingly driven by his own testosterone. What I appreciate most is that Kubrick never gives Alex a reason for doing what he does. In most films like this, the villain is supplied with a childhood trauma, but Alex does what he does because he likes doing it.

I specifically was someone who had always been turned off to church and faith because I had grown up in a place where often times churches were charismatic, a style that never interested me very much. When I was nineteen I started attending a Presbyterian church that was a whole different atmosphere than what I had always known. The service was very structured and organized, and a long story short I found myself at home in a place with a much more reserved style of worship experience.But with that going on in my personal life at the time, it made it difficult for me to want to see The Apostle, a film that to me looked like it was promoting the style of religion that I had struggled with all my life. So I never saw the film when it was in theaters or while it was still popular.Fast forward to 2014, and I've matured a fair bit. I still have my own preferences about church and religion, but I am not as judgmental as I once was. And so with that in mind, I sat down to watch this film on Netflix a couple of weeks ago.What I found in The Apostle was a delightful film, one that is evangelical in its own way, and one that certainly does portray the charismatic church style that I struggled with so much in my youth. But whereas in 1997 I might have had a visceral reaction to that, in 2014 I was able to sit down and watch the film and view it as art. And boy am I glad that I did.Robert Duvall gives a dynamic performance in this movie. It's impossible to see him as himself, because he completely becomes the character. As the movie progresses Duvall has several extended scenes where he's preaching in church, and the performance is amazing. Regardless of whether one appreciates the Christian faith or the charismatic movement, Duvall makes the viewer believe that he is the preacher. It's a bit eerie in a sense, and some might find it uncomfortable given the subject matter--but then you realize that this is the same guy from The Godfather movies, and that's when it hits you that this is an amazing feat of acting in a well made film.All that said, The Apostle may be a bit foreign and hard to watch for some people who have an averse reaction to matters of faith or who are uncomfortable with Christianity. But even those folks should be able to appreciate the film for its artistic expression, if they can just get past the religious element (which is of course the dominant theme of the film).If you are able to appreciate the film, either as a work of art or as an evangelical film in its own right, then you may agree that it deserves a high rating.

Thus my 9\/10 stars. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 December 2014","score":"","review":" Spike Lee does a good job with this film. He uses different techniques to show different moods in the film such as the use of different colors. In the opening scene when Spike Lee is walking down the street and into the barber show the viewer can see a variety of bright, vibrant colors by making the sky bright, his clothing vivid and gives a soft focus to the lens. He does this to show the good times and the happy feelings that are going on in Boston without actually saying it. Also during the movie he uses different camera filters to film the same action by using black and white, like a TV would show. He does this to give whats going on a more real feel to the event in the movie to make it seem like it is more an actual event rather than just a film. However, my only concerns are that he hardly gives an exposition of his earlier life. Yes, he does touch on Malcolm's childhood but he doesn't really explain how his dad died or what he did during his teen years as a hustler. I understand that this movie is very long as it is however that period in his life had a large impact on his life going forward and what he believed in when he was an adult. This film mostly focuses on his life as an adult and an active member of the Nation of Islam. Other than skipping the first part of the book for the most part, he does a fine job at getting most of the details in the latter half of his life.

It covers one of the most controversial figures in U.S history and tells his story bravely. Although it does it very differently from the book, I would say it does a better job. The book is honest and helps you get to know Malcolm and understand his point of view, and why he is who he is. While the movie captures the emotion and shows what an inspirational figure Malcolm X really is. Spike Lee does a great job of staying true to the story, but at the same time you like Malcolm more in the movie. Lee uses a lot of Lowkey lighting in the first half of the movie and filters to give this Hollywood-Esq feel to the movie. Personally I did not find this effective and thought the movie lacked a lot of content at the beginning. The way his childhood flashbacks were showed was not effective as well. Quick transitions into them and very fast pacing during them. Its not until Malcolm goes to jail when the movie becomes alive. The intense natural lighting with the darks, reflects Malcolm's mood as he is lost in life and wonders what is next in life for him. Spike Lee's most noticeable technique is his very long movement shots. The shot were brother Bane is talking to the inmates in Jail outside was one of the best shots in the whole movie in my opinion. Its a long tracking shot going left to right, as he speaks to them. Its a medium shot that views only their face and some of their body language. It is very effective as you view how Bane's words affect these inmates. Although the first half was questionable, the second half of the movie does a spectacular job of recovering and I think you can easily look past it.

Filled with ideas, oozing with style, relevant to societies (like the US today) on the verge of total collapse and richly satisfying, Bernardo Bertolucci﻿'s eye-opener invites passionate discussion on its meaning.Set during the rise and fall of Mussolini, The Conformist follows a young Italian man Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant﻿, who is actually French), who aspires to become a made-man with the Fascists. To get in, Marcello must enable the assassination of his former philosophy professor, now a prominent democracy-activist. The narrative is non-linear, and we soon realize that Marcello is repressed. He has strong homosexual tendencies. He is particularly haunted by a major incident in his childhood; i.e., thirteen-year-old Marcello has his first sexual encounter with a man and it leads to a violent conclusion. As an adult Marcello is determined to be regarded as normal, so he marries the extremely pretty and sensual Giulia ( Stefania Sandrelli﻿), even though he hates her lack of intellectual depth. When the couple are honeymooning, he makes arrangements to meet up with Professor Quadri (Enzo Tarascio). He is instantly floored by Quadri's beautiful, bisexual wife, Anna (Dominique Sanda). Although Marcello quickly makes a pass with her, it seems he is more attracted by her liberation. As Marcello, Giulia, the Professor and Anna become more intimately acquainted with each other the more the very awake Anna reveals herself as the most compelling character of all. Will Marcello go through with it? Visually it looks amazing. The combination of Bertolucci and famed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro﻿ is dazzling. Bertolucci really chooses color well.

Instead, Bertolucci focuses on the troubled, unreliable Marcello for point of view. There are many examples where Bertolucci suggests a peculiar mindset. For example, Marcello has a thug beat up his drug-addicted Mother's chauffeur and lover. Curiously, the man taking the beating does not resist. (In other words, victims are not really being victimized.) When Marcello meets his father in a sanitarium, it appears like the father's agitation is being directed in opposition to Marcello's obvious connection with the Fascists. (That is, resisting the Fascists is a crazy thing to do.) When Marcello is announcing his intention to marry Giulia to be perceived as normal, he is in a nightclub with singers performing in the background. (So the distracted audience fails to notice Marcel is repressed or strange in any way.) However, perhaps the most visually identifying moment for Marcello follows a very erotic dance between Anna and Giulia in a nightclub. Their dancing arouses all the other patrons. Eventually all the patrons are dancing in one large circle clockwise around Marcello. At the center of the storm, Marcello is turning counter-clockwise, refusing to be pulled in with the senseless pleasure experienced by those around him.

And make no mistake; LA Confidential is a great cop movie. Entertaining and surprisingly complex, this is not only a good movie in its own right, but a nostalgic tribute to cop shows and film noirs of old.The plot of this film is first rate, which should come as no surprise seeing as the screenplay is adapted on the bestselling novel of the same name by James Ellroy. The story it tells of corruption, murder, and LA's seedy underbelly contains more twists, turns, and revelations than any other cop movie in recent memory. This is one of those films where for every answer there's another question, and every time a break is made, it only reveals another layer of mystery. Fortunately, it's still fairly easy to follow, thanks to screenwriter Brian Helgeland's decision to cut out large sections of the novel, leaving only material that directly relate to the three main characters.This is also a wise choice because as important and well done as the story is, it's the characters that really drive LA Confidential. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a hardworking, foul tempered patrol cop whose greatest pleasure in life is tearing into wife beaters. His physique, temperament, and recent involvement in the Bloody Christmas brutality scandal make him the department's go to guy for quietly roughing up suspects. He doesn't give a damn about things like rules and proper procedure, and after the murder of his partner, he's out for blood.His opposite in nearly every respect, Edward Exley (Guy Pearce) is young, ambitious, and a master of department politics. He's one of the brightest men on the force, but he's also a stickler for the rules, and something of a self righteous prick, whose fixation on advancing his own career and willingness to testify against his fellow officers does little to endear him to old hands like White.Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is very much the public face of the LAPD. As the golden boy of the narcotics department, technical adviser to the hit TV series Badge of Honor, and number one inside source for Hush-Hush magazine, he relishes the fame and attention his job brings him. Now, stuck on the vice beat after being caught up in the Bloody Christmas scandal, he's desperate to make the big break that will get him back in the spotlight. The three don't have much in common, and don't particularly like each other, but as their cases begin to intertwine into something much larger, they form an unlikely alliance.LA Confidential is unique among cop movies for how far it delves into each character's personality and motivations. From the beginning, we learn what makes these three tick. The film explores in great depth their differing philosophies of law enforcement, their relations with their fellow officers, their reasons for becoming cops in the first place, and their growing dissatisfaction and disillusionment with their jobs. It also probes just what it means to be a good cop. Is it the number of arrests an officer makes and the prestige that he brings to the department that makes him a good officer? His dedication to his duty and unwavering resolve not to compromise himself? Or is it his willingness to do whatever it takes to see justice done? I also admired the attention paid to the dichotomy between the contemporary image of Los Angeles and the reality that lay beneath it. Nowhere is this better captured than in the opining narration by Danny DeVito, which starts out like one of those sappy promotional real estate videos from the fifties, then effortlessly pivots into a delicious take on muckraking tabloid journalism. Come to think of it, that's a pretty good description of DeVito's character, Hush Hush Magazine publisher Sid Hudgens. Cynical, amoral, and with an uncanny ability to sense a juicy story from a mile away, he has contacts throughout the department, and isn't above manufacturing a scandal when none presents itself. He's as sleazy as they come, and right from the start I couldn't help liking him.The period touches were also done well, capturing the look and feel of 1950's Los Angeles and adding an occasionally humorous subtext without becoming distracting or overpowering. And of course there's a good deal of violence, all done with a gritty realism that evokes the noirs of old. Another parallel to classic noir is the film's moral ambiguity. Both Bud White and Jack Vincennes engage in behavior that is clearly illegal, but neither man is portrayed as dirty or corrupt for doing so. The movie's female lead (Kim Basinger) is a prostitute, yet she is perhaps the person viewers will feel the most sympathy for. And at the end, one of the main players makes a decision that is entirely contrary to the ideals he held at the beginning of the film, but which based on the results is undoubtedly the right thing to do.LA Confidential is not a film that places its narrative in a simple frame of black and white. Nor is it a mindless celebration of blazing guns and blaring sirens. Rather it's a movie that embraces depth, complexity, and character development without slowing or losing its focus. It's hard hitting, exciting, often cerebral, and very dark.

And make no mistake; LA Confidential is a great cop movie. Entertaining and surprisingly complex, this is not only a good movie in its own right, but a nostalgic tribute to cop shows and film noirs of old.The plot of this film is first rate, which should come as no surprise seeing as the screenplay is adapted on the bestselling novel of the same name by James Ellroy. The story it tells of corruption, murder, and LA's seedy underbelly contains more twists, turns, and revelations than any other cop movie in recent memory. This is one of those films where for every answer there's another question, and every time a break is made, it only reveals another layer of mystery. Fortunately, it's still fairly easy to follow, thanks to screenwriter Brian Helgeland's decision to cut out large sections of the novel, leaving only material that directly relate to the three main characters.This is also a wise choice because as important and well done as the story is, it's the characters that really drive LA Confidential. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a hardworking, foul tempered patrol cop whose greatest pleasure in life is tearing into wife beaters. His physique, temperament, and recent involvement in the Bloody Christmas brutality scandal make him the department's go to guy for quietly roughing up suspects. He doesn't give a damn about things like rules and proper procedure, and after the murder of his partner, he's out for blood.His opposite in nearly every respect, Edward Exley (Guy Pearce) is young, ambitious, and a master of department politics. He's one of the brightest men on the force, but he's also a stickler for the rules, and something of a self righteous prick, whose fixation on advancing his own career and willingness to testify against his fellow officers does little to endear him to old hands like White.Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is very much the public face of the LAPD. As the golden boy of the narcotics department, technical adviser to the hit TV series Badge of Honor, and number one inside source for Hush-Hush magazine, he relishes the fame and attention his job brings him. Now, stuck on the vice beat after being caught up in the Bloody Christmas scandal, he's desperate to make the big break that will get him back in the spotlight. The three don't have much in common, and don't particularly like each other, but as their cases begin to intertwine into something much larger, they form an unlikely alliance.LA Confidential is unique among cop movies for how far it delves into each character's personality and motivations. From the beginning, we learn what makes these three tick. The film explores in great depth their differing philosophies of law enforcement, their relations with their fellow officers, their reasons for becoming cops in the first place, and their growing dissatisfaction and disillusionment with their jobs. It also probes just what it means to be a good cop. Is it the number of arrests an officer makes and the prestige that he brings to the department that makes him a good officer? His dedication to his duty and unwavering resolve not to compromise himself? Or is it his willingness to do whatever it takes to see justice done? I also admired the attention paid to the dichotomy between the contemporary image of Los Angeles and the reality that lay beneath it. Nowhere is this better captured than in the opining narration by Danny DeVito, which starts out like one of those sappy promotional real estate videos from the fifties, then effortlessly pivots into a delicious take on muckraking tabloid journalism.

Using lighting techniques such as soft focus and low light creates this mysterious feel. Personally, I had no idea about Malcolm's hustling past. The film does focus on his hustling past for most of the movie and explains how he wound up becoming a Muslim. The film emphasizes the feel of Malcolm's hustling life very well. Dull\/darker colors, up- tempo jazz music in the background are just to name a few. While you follow Malcolm through his hustling life, Spike Lee does a great job of trying to intrigue you and bring you into the movie physically and emotionally. In one scene, Malcolm sits in with West Indian Archie. Spike Lee does a great job of showing both Malcolm's progression and the progression through the times. Brighter suits began to stand out more and darker, neutral suits began to be the standard. Malcolm sports his bright red suit and Archie's henchman begin to mock him for it. Malcolm's transformation into a Muslim is very intriguing through the movie. Lee integrates Malcolm X's real speeches into Denzel Washington's speeches and they just turn out beautiful. Denzel really sells his part and just pulls you into his emotions and thoughts. Because Lee focuses on Malcolm's hustling past a little more than Malcolm's Muslim life, you begin to feel very connected with Malcolm. It just leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. You want to know what happens next. Overall, Malcolm was a great movie. The only downfall of the movie was that it could've been made a little bit shorter. But if you're willing to sit through and watch all of it, it'll be worth it. Lee's use of lighting, color, and camera positions immerse you in the film.

I've taken it upon myself to investigate his filmography to see if there's any great films in their midst, and if The Pawnbroker remains my favourite of them all I'll stay satisfied. Lumet has evidently had a close relationship with New York and this is his bleakest portrait of it so far seen through the eyes of his most tragic character. A Jewish pawnbroker, Sol, suffering from PTSD who's constantly under the weight of money issues from every angle. A true anti-hero here, he doesn't even offer a hand to a young pregnant woman in need. His view is nihilistic, but due to his spiritual death at concentration camps where his soul was sucked dry. Now he's resigned to the prison of his pawn shop.Despite his death of spirit and desire for peace and quiet, all walks of life enter his shop, sometimes contrasted together, and they're often vibrantly desperate. Everyone is under the boot of someone here, Sol and his customers and Sol and the people he owes money to. The film keeps hold of its novelistic approach from the source material, perhaps to its detriment as it feels bloated with extraneous characters that could have been shredded. Its best for its stark 'New Wave'-esque photography with dramatic zooms and push ins and harsh black and white lighting. Some of its images feel like they burst off the screen. It utilises very abrasive editing that borrows concepts from Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour where memories appear on screen in short bursts. It's not as well handled, often feeling clumsy in its pacing, but the effect is often powerful.Paired with the bombastic score, it's often an overwhelming blend of visuals and sound that the characters feel disorientated by too. Rod Steiger holds the film on his shoulders like a bull. Often sensitive, often reserved, but when he rants in a monologue, his words hit hard. He's especially astounding in the film's closing moments. Not all the performances meet his match, some are too high strung. It is a blessing and a curse that Lumet films run a little long as the film takes too long to set itself up. It would be a favourite worthy film if I connected to haunted past narratives a little more. I feel like what it's trying to say is fascinating, and although it has the drive it needed a tiny bit more focus and balance. Perhaps The Pawnbroker is a relic of its time in post-war mourning, but it's still an admirable and arresting film. Only a handful of minor shortcomings hold it back from the level of his more obvious greats.

Spike Lee's use of filter changes and diegetic sound through the course of the film portrays Malcolm's change in consciousness and the direction of his life. In the first part of the movie we see Malcolm's life as a young man and later a hustler. Colors are seen as bright and vivid which adds to a cartoonish sense of his actions in this part of his life. The conking and zoots suits all seem surreal as to portray Malcolm's reflection of his past. Behind these scenes, jazz music is constantly playing as if the backdrop of a cartoon. In the novel, Malcolm explains that he now knows how such things were all apart of the white man's power over blacks and sees his past as childish. Spike lee later illustrates the dramatic change of Malcolm's life when he is sent to prison, by changing the filter and making shots longer and a darker contrast. Spike Lee shows this darkness at a peak when Malcolm is locked in solitary confinement. The pitch black scene is frighting and the blinding that follows when the door is opened seems divine. Soon after he is brought out of the darkness, he finds Islam with the help of a fellow inmate. Spike Lee, with this use of dark and light contrast, as well as the removal of the diegetic jazz music, shows Malcolm X's change in his life and his path to Islam being his escape from the white man's oppression. I really appreciated this use of contrast to the previous scenes of his life as a hustler. Spike Lee through this contrast was able to present Malcolm's transformation more personally to the viewer than they would have if they had only read the autobiography. As the film progresses from then on, it is a more biographical, informative, representation of Malcolm's life but keeps the personal connection Spike Lee created in the first half intact with many close up shots of Malcolm X. When you reach the final death scene in the film, you truly feel the loss of an important man. The connection that Spike Lee creates with his film can not be overlooked and is only a part of what makes this film an amazing piece of art.

Spike Lee through this contrast was able to present Malcolm's transformation more personally to the viewer than they would have if they had only read the autobiography. As the film progresses from then on, it is a more biographical, informative, representation of Malcolm's life but keeps the personal connection Spike Lee created in the first half intact with many close up shots of Malcolm X. When you reach the final death scene in the film, you truly feel the loss of an important man. The connection that Spike Lee creates with his film can not be overlooked and is only a part of what makes this film an amazing piece of art.

He made the film an inmate experience, with slow moments, suspension, and room for intellectual thought all through the personal individual experience of Alyosha. Alyosha was young solider, from the country-side who managed to take down two enemy tanks. As his reward instead of a medal he received leave to visit his mother and fix her leaky roof. We begin the film with this scene and the knowledge that Alyosha would be leaving on his last leave, for he would die in the war. From his realistic heroism, his simple desire to see his mother again, and his death we know we are following the last days of a journey chalk full with all the experiences of young life and love. When we hear of war on the TV or a friend who knows someone who has died in a war we don't think of that individual life that was lost, but rather about the death toll or big picture. Ballad of a solider takes you away from all of that to see the faces that make up the military force. In this case the lives that Russia lost were so much like Alyosha young and kind, not a killing machine.

Enter the Fist is not your average martial arts flick. For one thing, it stars a white guy- with a face on his tongue. Plus there's a dastardly villain called Betty, a climactic fight with a cow, and a mysterious one-breasted woman who shows up in one scene and is never seen again. And no, I am not on crack as I write this, just Mountain Dew and gratuitous amounts of AC\/DC.Anyways, as you've probably guessed, Kung-Pow is intended as a send up of all those campy, poorly dubbed kung-fu movies from the Far East. Those of you who are Woody Allen fans or have particularly long memories may remember a film called What's Up, Tiger Lilly, in which Allen took two low budget Japanese spy movies, moved some of the scenes around, and completely re-dubbed it to create an entirely new, entirely nonsensical plot. Here, writer\/director\/producer\/leading man Steve Oedekerk takes things a step further, digitally replacing the original film's star with himself, and adding completely new scenes, like the aforementioned one with the cow.Like What's Up, Tiger Lilly, Kung Pow! Is utterly ridiculous, and makes little if any sense, which is the whole point. Exhibit A is the dialogue. As stated before, all original lines have been replaced by new, hilariously nonsensical ones. Seriously, half the lines in this movie have nothing to do with anything. Ling, the Chosen One's love interest seems to be voiced by the same actress who does Miss Piggy. And in a nod to the usual quality of dubbing in Asian films, many characters sound just like fifth-graders reading from a Chinese-to-English dictionary. There's even a part where the guy's mouth keeps moving forever, and all he says is no. And this is far from the only aspect of traditional martial arts movies that gets lampooned. The training sequences, the requisite close up of each fighter's face accompanied by dramatic music, the dramatic last words of the hero's dying sensei, and many more clichés are stretched well beyond their logical limits. Just for good measure, they even threw in parodies of the Lion King and the Matrix.And just in case the ludicrous re-dubbing and slaying of clichés weren't enough, Oedekerk goes for further laughs by suspending all attempts at believability and adding whatever random ideas popped into his head. One suspects that much of the story for this movie was fleshed out by guys sitting around a table taking bong hits, which if true makes this one of the best things ever created as a result of drugs. Besides the fight with the cow, there's also a fight between the bad guy and a baby, and several fights set to hip-hop. And there's that tongue-face, who has lines of his own and proves key to defeating the Council of Evil. Add an intermission straight out of Monty Python and a trailer for a fictional sequel, and you get one of the most oddball productions in many years.From this review it may sound like the filmmaker is desperately trying to inject humor any way he can, which may be why most critics panned Kung Pow! upon its release. But I personally could not stop laughing. This movie is simply to oddball and too original not to like. Even its flaws, like the sub-par CGI, only add to the campy feel. It may not engage your intellect, broaden your horizons, or make much sense, but if you have any experience with its source material, Kung Pow! Enter the Fist will have you laughing too hard to care.
