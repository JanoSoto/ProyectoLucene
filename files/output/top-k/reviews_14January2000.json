That is not to say that it is a failure as a story or an entertainment. Quite the contrary in fact, for I found myself often mesmerized by the dizzying pace and imagery with which P.T. Anderson constantly bombards his audience. The length, at 3+ hours, flew by with only an occasional complaint from my backside. There are moments of great pain and revelation played with, at times, expert depth by a very fine cast that includes standout performances by Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melora Walters, William H. Macy and Tom Cruise. Richard Elswit's camera work is rich with texture and sheen as we travel through either the money saturated or financially bereft homes and lives of a panorama of interrelated characters living in LA. The current of the story flows with the turbulence of an estuary, twisting in eddies of plot and character examination that turn back in on themselves several times, before leaving us, somewhat shaken, deposited on the silted shore of redemption.This movie travels in much the same territory as Robert Altman's 1993 masterpiece Short Cuts. Both films examine the lives of a disparate group of Los Angelino's and the way that fate and a unifying natural disaster can ultimately link people in the strangest of ways (the event in Short Cuts was an earthquake. I won't reveal the event in this film, except to say that any Cajuns watching this movie might have to seriously reconsider their taste for frog's legs!). Yet what separates the two films, and keeps Magnolia from being cast in the same brilliant light as Short Cuts is the restraint that a much older (and perhaps wiser) Altman used in dealing with his sprawling cast (22 characters) and story. Anderson pulls out all the stops, right from the beginning of this movie, and never (not for a minute) lets up. In musical terms this movie plays as one big three-hour crescendo of visually arresting imagery and emotionally charged performances. There are no adagio's here; no quiet moments of reflection or subtle exposition. It's as if Anderson keeps playing the last three minutes of the 1812 Overture over and over, without giving his audience or his actors a chance to catch their breath. The actors here try their best, and deliver some very rewarding (if somewhat too actor-ish) performances. . Julianne Moore is the formerly gold-digging wife of a dying television producer (Jason Robards) who now faces the grueling pangs of guilt as she watches her husband wither away from cancer. Tom Cruise plays the misogynistic, self-help guru son of said producer who, estranged from his father, channels his misguided rage into an empire built upon the degradation of women. William H. Macy is a former child prodigy who, having been robbed of his quiz-show kid fortune by his parents, seeks only to find a source of love and fulfillment in his failed life. Melora Walters plays a frazzled junkie whose miserable family experience has delivered her into the arms of drugs. The lives of these people, and several other maladjusted or mistreated souls, are all in the midst of one fracturing crisis or another. They sustain the plot on a seemingly endless crest of emotion that plays out over a 24-hr. span of confrontation and semi-redemption. Perhaps that's the problem. In merely focusing in on such a short span of time, Anderson forces us to see only what is germane to the actual events of the picture. When examining something so closely, one needs a great deal of light to see. In this case, we are bathed in a dazzling light of intense storytelling that unfortunately, by the end of the picture, has washed out much of the subtlety and definition of these characters.Take Moore's character, Linda Partridge for example. As the guilt riddled wife of a dying man, Linda careers from one confrontation to another, challenging her doctors, lawyers, pharmacists and ultimately herself to explain and alleviate the pain she feels for the man that she knows she married for all of the wrong reasons.  Moore's performance is a tour-de-force; she is electric in her rage and anguish. Yet what Anderson's script never does is give us a clear picture of who she is when she's not in crisis. Where did this woman come from and what has made her who she is? The characters in this film seem to have no underpinnings. They are all spinning wildly as tops, never stopping for a moment to let those of us watching get a steady glimpse of what they look like still. The filmmaking too left me with a sense of being twirled around at great speed. Anderson's camera never seems to stop moving, swooping in and out of rooms and situations, following one character and then the next. The editing is swift and at times unfocused, leaving us hanging in the middle of one story line and jumping to the next with neither preamble nor explanation. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but the cumulative effect of all this showmanship is exhaustion. I felt worn out by the end of the film, not by its message or impact, but rather by the sheer breadth of the filmmaking and Anderson's attempt to cram as much as possible into the movie. Ultimately the film suffers for this excess. By the climactic moment of the film, when the aforementioned natural disaster takes place, what should have been an emotional and spiritual epiphany, turns into a very funny, but rather hollow summation of the film's message. Anderson wants us to feel enlightened but I merely felt depleted and disappointed. This could have been a great film, with a firmer hand on the performances and the cinematic trickery. What is left, however, is still very rewarding and at times as brilliant and shimmering as any film in recent memory.

It's a  brilliant characterization of a 'bad guy' who is not stereotypical and has intelligence. How do you hold your own when acting with a genius like Jackson? Just ask Robert Forster, who gave life to Max Cherry and was equally as phenomenal. Either one of them could and should have won an Oscar for their performances, in a better world where awards are given for quality and not media blitzes and popularity.  Keaton, De Niro, and Fonda have less to do, but they knew that going in and do similarly fantastic jobs, while never showing off in their understated roles. Grier, on the other hand, while demonstrating that she can hold her own amongst such heavyweights, simply can't handle the grilling scenes in the ATF offices. She doesn't have the acting skill to get it on with Keaton in an believable manner. Overall, she did fine, and didn't embarrass herself. This is one of the most enjoyable movies in the last 20 years, with a wonderful soundtrack whcih contributes to the genuine 70's feel. It's flawless, unless you're of the opinion that these characters are generally uninteresting losers, but with this kind of acting it just doesn't matter. My favorite scene is the one near the end in which Ordell tells Max a few important things in the car before heading into the bond office for the final rendezvous. This scene is two of the best in full gear..and no voices are ever raised in that fake, unbelievable 'I'm a great actor so I'm gonna yell my lines!' style. I've seen some negative comments here on IMDB for this flick, most poorly written and comparing it negatively to Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown is the better movie, but Pulp will always be a favorite with the Tarantino fans because of not only it's brilliance but also the graphic violence and shocking scenes. People who crave this sort of stuff, and consequently put down a relatively quiet film like Jackie, are merely conditioned products of society. They thrive on fodder and garbage, and they have no idea how to interpret a movie without extremely graphic violence, especially from a director known for those qualities. It bores their tiny minds and they trip all over themselves to shout how unsuccessful the film was. Apparently, once a director makes a successful film, he is supposed to repeat himself infinitely to satisfy these mental midgets, and cannot do anything in a different style. I would venture to say that someone who disses Jackie Brown (or Eyes Wide Shut) is not worth your time arguing with; they wouldn't know quality in a film if it bit them in a certain place.

They were brought along for the ride once again, same as Scottie and Bones were for the 19th time in the way too many Trek sequels. And you can't say Brigette got anywheres in Hollywood on her talent, ya know? Just can't see it.

You don't for a second actually Believe that Stallone could kayo Lundgren(Dolph is 6-5-220 plus, a kick boxing champ-Sly 5-9ish, 190) but who cares?! It was great to watch them whale away at one another in Russia like that, surrounded by 10,000 Red Guards, a Gorby lookalike and Brigette Neilson there....Stallone really took to the MTV style of editing in III and does it again here, with the training montages, Survivor\/James Brown\/Robert Tepper tunes, etc. very well.

That's it.  I'm sorry, but it's true.  Paul Thomas Anderson's paramount masterpiece is the tip of Mount Everest when it comes to filmmaking, in both technical and storytelling aspects; he delivers a three hour saga about the relationships between varying parents and children, the messes they've created, and the measures it will take to make amends.The plot has been kept in shrouded secrecy for many reasons, namely one of them that it would take about fifteen minutes to give even the briefest of synopsi.  There is so much going on, so much to look at, to feel, that a jaded reviewer would be damning himself and the reader if he even attempted to lay down the story.  But it does concern  nine people in the San Fernando Valley on a particularly dank (and particularly apocalyptic) day.  But you already knew that.One of the many things that makes Magnolia flawfree is the incredible crescendo it manages to maintain for its entire running time.  Scene by scene, second by second, Jon Brion's score and Aimee Mann's songs interact in perfect synchronicity with the rising emotions in the film, more and more with each following frame.  Whether the situation be tense, happy, tragic, sad, mean, or something in between, the entire thing piles on more and more clumps of cinematic clay, propelling the story into the next region of genius.  And with the cast, PT leaves nothing to chance.  Everyone (EVERYONE!) in this picture gives 110% and more at all times.  While most people will single out Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, or Bill Macy as the stars of this movie, the ones who stole MY heart were the anomalous couple of John C. Reilly and Melora Goddess of All Things Acting Walters.  Never before have two people seemed so equally desparate for love in such different roles.  Walters not only stole my heart, but the whole f***ing movie as well.  Her turn as an abused, lonely, good-hearted cokehead is one of the best female characters of the last twenty years.  But, I digress . ..Magnolia is a painting with colors your mind can't decipher right away, feelings that aren't easily labeled.  This is why, I think, many patrons of the film have left it in bad will, because in an age of eighty-five minute Christmas gifts (not too much to think about, wrapped nicely, and pretty much predictable), filmgoers as a mass have been spoiled and cheated of films that make them *FEEL* something.  Magnolia doesn't get you with clever ploys or snarky editing.  It's wonder doesn't lie in its irony or one-liners.  You won't find any overt sarcasm here.  No, Magnolia hooks you because it makes you feel something.  Its sincerity is so raw, and so spot on, that a usually sarcastic, skewered moviegoer doesn't have anything to latch on to other than its unflinching brilliance.  It doesn't give any room for people to criticize it for its quality (or lack thereof), so people end up complaining about the length, the lack of immediacy, or the unconvential symbolism (ahem!).In the end though, Magnolia is nothing more than Paul Thomas Anderson's love letter to people like him.

An important line spoken in the very ambitious and heady film Magnolia that just tries a little too hard and test even the limits of the most patient moviegoers.  P. T. Anderson, also known as Paul Thomas Anderson, the talented director of one of 1997's best films, Boogie Nights has done an amazing job of juggling this large talented cast and weaving them in and out of nine different, but somehow interconnected plotlines.  That he is able to make sense out of all of this proves that Boogie Nights just was not a fluke.  Mr. Anderson has the talent of a great director; he just overshoots too much on this powerful, intriguing, but way overlong film that loses some momentum in its three hours.In their search for happiness, many of the characters realize that hiding from the past just hinders the progression of a fulfilled life and that no matter what we think, life is a series of events that are all somehow connected with each other and effect all of us.  The various plotlines include a lonely, good-hearted police officer, Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) who falls for a major cokehead, Claudia (Melora Walters), whose father is game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) who is dying of cancer. Then there is Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), the rich dying man, who has been estranged from his self-help guru son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), plus Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), former wunderkid, who is now one screwed up adult.  These characters and others are searching for some happiness in their lives one way or another, but for some reason it eludes them.Anderson has put together a most amazing cast as he did with Boogie Nights and his first feature, Hard Eight.  He has not only assembled this great cast, but has also pulled some wonderful performances from all of them. Everyone is terrific and has their moments, but four individuals standout big time.  Julianne Moore as the depressed wife of dying Earl Partridge gives another great performance (is she capable of a bad one, I don't think so).  John C. Reilly, who has appeared in all three of Anderson's movies is excellent as the lovelorn cop, who just wants to do right in this world and meet someone to share his life.  It is a focused and subtle performance that is so real.  As the coke addicted Claudia, Melora Walters is magnificent as a bundle of nerves, insecurities and anger all combined.  It is worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Speaking of Oscar nomination, Tom Cruise as the macho self-help guru, gives his best performance since Born on the Fourth of July.  Cruise, who I usually find somewhat bland and limited in his range, is unbelievable here.  What an amazing performance, maybe he should take more supporting roles, because he is terrific and shows not only great range, but also a pretty buff body that rivals his peer, Brad Pitt.  For the first time Cruise, who I always find lacking sex appeal of any kind, actually sizzles on screen.Kudos to P.T. Anderson for managing to pull this picture off.  Even though it is far from perfect, never the less there is no denying its powerful impact.  Accolades also to Aimee Mann (former lead singer of the group Till Tuesday) for a great soundtrack, what a voice.  Recommended. × × × 1\/2 out of 5.

Well then he was fired, quite, or as they say had creative diffrences and Walter (48hrs.,Last man Standing) Hill was directing, well Hill directed i think every shot you see in the movie but wanted to do some reshoots that were denied so he left during the editing and Jack (The Hidden, Nightmare on elm street 2, Wishmaster 2) Sholder took over, well i don't know what happened to him but THEN Francis Ford Copolla came in to do the editing (he must really be slumming to take over editing chores on a movie he didn't direct...or was offered a nice check).  Well from there i don't know what happened but Walter Hill took the name of Thomas Lee for the director credit.  So the movie was......GOOD not great but good.  It did feel kinda rushed (due to the editing i'm sure) and there were scenes in the previews that were not in the film (like a cool looking scene of a deformed looking person telling Angela Bassett to help him\/it) and i cannot believe Robert Forster was in the movie for only what 5 minutes he's not a big actor but i thought he was on a come back after Jackie Brown (he probably had more scenes that were cut out).  The last two issues of Fangoria also show an autopsy scene that looked nice and gory where Angela Bassett was cutting into a body which is'nt in the movie and Peter Facinelli's character Troy mutates into a hairless creature resembling the clones at the end of the Judge Dredd movie is shown in the same two issues but is not in the movie. So why all the trouble I don't know but MGM has butchered other Sci-fi\/horror movies (remember Disturbing Behavior) for hopes of gaining a wider audience when all they end up doing is HURTING their movie and as much as i like them space ship movies have not did so well lately (Alienresurrection, Event Horizon both didn't do well) so MGM probably spent more money in the long run and even though i liked Supernova and want it to do good it probably won't so they lost more money in the long run i'm sure (congratulations MGM guys, in the long run you screwed yourselves).

Well then he was fired, quite, or as they say had creative diffrences and Walter (48hrs.,Last man Standing) Hill was directing, well Hill directed i think every shot you see in the movie but wanted to do some reshoots that were denied so he left during the editing and Jack (The Hidden, Nightmare on elm street 2, Wishmaster 2) Sholder took over, well i don't know what happened to him but THEN Francis Ford Copolla came in to do the editing (he must really be slumming to take over editing chores on a movie he didn't direct...or was offered a nice check).  Well from there i don't know what happened but Walter Hill took the name of Thomas Lee for the director credit.  So the movie was......GOOD not great but good.  It did feel kinda rushed (due to the editing i'm sure) and there were scenes in the previews that were not in the film (like a cool looking scene of a deformed looking person telling Angela Bassett to help him\/it) and i cannot believe Robert Forster was in the movie for only what 5 minutes he's not a big actor but i thought he was on a come back after Jackie Brown (he probably had more scenes that were cut out).  The last two issues of Fangoria also show an autopsy scene that looked nice and gory where Angela Bassett was cutting into a body which is'nt in the movie and Peter Facinelli's character Troy mutates into a hairless creature resembling the clones at the end of the Judge Dredd movie is shown in the same two issues but is not in the movie. So why all the trouble I don't know but MGM has butchered other Sci-fi\/horror movies (remember Disturbing Behavior) for hopes of gaining a wider audience when all they end up doing is HURTING their movie and as much as i like them space ship movies have not did so well lately (Alienresurrection, Event Horizon both didn't do well) so MGM probably spent more money in the long run and even though i liked Supernova and want it to do good it probably won't so they lost more money in the long run i'm sure (congratulations MGM guys, in the long run you screwed yourselves). But for all the trouble the movie made sense and it was a fun movie with really good special effects.

Creating the essence of the actual event is the toughest.  Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge.

It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS.  These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind-splitting film at us, much like the sport itself.  This is why I liked it.Oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK, evident in its editing style.  Fast-paced, black and white mixed with color, documentary-like methods ensued in NATURAL BORN KILLERS, NIXON, and the ghastly U-TURN.  Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does.  Even the most ardent fans of the sport do not really know what it is like for a quarterback to drop back and get rid of a piece of pigskin before 11 players maul him.  You certainly get the idea watching this.  Al Pacino is the dried up head coach of the fictional Miami Sharks and he barks out the usual coaching cliches you hear in press conferences after real games.  Pacino also seems to be sleep-walking through the picture.  At times, he appears drunk even when he is not supposed to be.  Cameron Diaz's character, a young chick owner, (yeah right) destroys any credibility the film may have had going in (Even the NFL would have nothing to do with this movie). Her constant bickering is so over-done, you almost feel like hurling much the way Jamie Foxx does every time he enters a game as the team's 3rd string quarterback.  Realisticly speaking, this is not a very sane film about football.  It is a maniacal celebration of the game.  The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished.  Beware of the locker room or domestic sequences.No one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before.  He definitely had some good consultants.  There are some comical cameos - Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus play opposing coaches.  Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar.  Stone tries to show us how the game has changed.  He resonates past glory with quotes from Lombardi, dissolves showing Red the Galloping Ghost Grange, and even Unitas handing off to Ameche.  TV has changed everything, says the coach, and he is right.  It seems to be all about the money nowadays.That is the message, but you'll find yourself losing that idea in the lunacy of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY and the bone-crushing, ear-damaging football scenes.  They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity, you feel like playing afterwards.  This is definitely a film for football fans only unless you like big, sweaty men.  Is there a big game at the end that needs to be won?  Yes, and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is.  Basically, surrender your senses and thought process to Stone's most entertaining film in quite some time.RATING ***   ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2000","score":"45 out of 67 people found the following review useful","review":"  Sports movies are tough to make.

Set in the late seventies and early eighties, Boogie Nights is the story of Jack Horner, a director of adult films who, with his cast of characters, dreams of creating the first legitimate porn film. Horner's cast of players each brings to the story their own unique baggage, suggesting that their past is what brought them into the sex trade.  Juliane Moore is a coke addicted mother who mourns for a child that was taken from her.  Heather Graham is a roller skating teen who could never fit in with kids her own age.  And Thomas Jane is Todd Parker, in his own mind the studio stud.And of course, the crew have their own dramas.  William H. Macey is the lighting director who can't control his sex starved wife.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the sound guy, a social misfit who hides his lustful thoughts.  And Robert Ridgley is Colonel Parker, the financier for all of Jack Horner's films, who is just as much a victim in the vile world that he creates, as he is a villain.And naturally, while the porn industry becomes a haven for all of these tragic figures, it eventually becomes their downfall.  Their lives are first impacted by the discovery of Dirk Diggler.  Dirk, played by Mark Wahlburg, is a keen, but troubled kid, blessed with an extra special endowment.  It's this endowment that makes him an instant hit in the porn industry, taking him right to the top, eventually setting him up for the biggest downfall of all.Anderson directs a brilliant picture, ironically creating the kind of film that his character Jack Horner could only dream of; a pornographic film with top notch acting and a compelling story line.  While Boogie Nights never delivers the money shot, there are graphic sexual depictions that suggest that this one was made for (not just about) the porn industry.  Scenes with characters having casual sex, taking obscene amounts of drugs and basically throwing their dignity away serve to make this one of the most shocking films of the decade.     Burt Reynolds stands out in an Oscar nominated performance, playing a pervert with a heart of gold.  While Reynolds sometimes gets caught up in his own mannerisms he does manage to  pull it off.  I suspect that this part tailor made itself for Burt, more so than Burt for the part.  In fact it has become Hollywood folklore, and perhaps proof that Reynolds is himself trapped in the seventies, the fact that he fired his agent when he saw the finished product.  It's funny he couldn't even see that this was his best work in an otherwise dopey career.Mark Wahlburg is good as Dirk Diggler.  Again, Anderson makes a natural casting choice.  The performances that truly stand out in my mind were those of Juliane Moore and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  As Amber, den mother to the cast, Moore is dead on.  I found her most brilliant work to be when her character is actually required to act.  Anyone who has ever seen a pornographic film will recognize this card board performance and probably laugh out loud.  Hoffman, on the other hand, lusting after Dirk, is wonderfully pathetic.  In a sea of low life characters, here is the one we least want to be.The direction in this film is often overwhelming, and for me that is a good thing.  Anderson uses the camera to his advantage, sometimes allowing it to float through the crowd at various parties, and at other times providing quick flashes of truth.Boogie Nights does not condemn the porn industry, nor does it praise it.  At the time when sex films were transferred from 8 millimeter film and onto video tape, they somehow became legitimate.  This film simply documents that time.

There's rage in the lines that he  provides his wised-up juvenile-delinquent creation  Dee Dee Truitt that is so acid that it sizzles when  it hits your ear.  She's not nice; she doesn't trust  anyone; she considers it useless to care about  anything; and she doesn't care who knows it.  This  is usually the sort of girl any wised-up adult would  know better than to pity, but Roos creates something  I cannot remember seeing in a movie since Paul  Winfield in Mike's Murder--a gay man dazed with  grief over the death of his lover--who takes Dee Dee  in.  She's pregnant and his half-sister, and he's a  high-school teacher living with someone who is not  sure about himself and whom she soon seduces.  They  run away, and, between a whole slough of dead-on verbal slapstick, the movie involves following them and deciding who's to care for her baby.  When you reach the end of the last wisecrack, you can't  help but laugh at yourself for being taken in by Dee Dee's bold blankness when it turns out to be the  catalyst by which all the people she meets find the  very things she says she despises--friendship,  commitment, family, love.  This is a movie that wears its heart under its  sleeve.  Roos is sly, but the laughs he offers don't catch in your throat.  He makes you want to follow  Dee Dee like the rest of the cast and see what ride  she's taking you on.  I can't say what Christina  Ricci does is acting, exactly, but with a role like  this, how can you not be captivated--even when  you're repelled at the same time?  And Martin  Donovan does act--he wears the pain of loss on his  face like a shroud.  You can understand why his dead lover's sister is so taken by him.  Donovan molds  this man of substance and makes of him a wonderful  comic mess.I very much enjoyed the brash gaudiness of Romy and Michelle's High-School Reunion, and Lisa Kudrow's  Michelle turned out to be the most with-it person  in the movie.  Yet as Lucia Delury, Kudrow shows a  different side--a serious rendering of a smart,  educated woman who's balled herself up over an  attraction to a man who doesn't love her.  Not since Kate Jackson in Making Love do I recall a  change in an actress of this magnitude.  I agree with the New York Film Critics Circle; this was the best supporting actress performance of 1998.Even the lesser roles are fetching from Lyle Lovett  who has probably the best line in the movie to Ivan  Sergei as Bill's bee-stung-lipped bedpartner Matt to William Lee Scott as the birthfather.  Randy may be  a hypocrite--the butt of Roos' joke about Christians--but Scott plays him with such feeling  that he transcends the joke.

There's rage in the lines that he  provides his wised-up juvenile-delinquent creation  Dee Dee Truitt that is so acid that it sizzles when  it hits your ear.  She's not nice; she doesn't trust  anyone; she considers it useless to care about  anything; and she doesn't care who knows it.  This  is usually the sort of girl any wised-up adult would  know better than to pity, but Roos creates something  I cannot remember seeing in a movie since Paul  Winfield in Mike's Murder--a gay man dazed with  grief over the death of his lover--who takes Dee Dee  in.  She's pregnant and his half-sister, and he's a  high-school teacher living with someone who is not  sure about himself and whom she soon seduces.  They  run away, and, between a whole slough of dead-on verbal slapstick, the movie involves following them and deciding who's to care for her baby.  When you reach the end of the last wisecrack, you can't  help but laugh at yourself for being taken in by Dee Dee's bold blankness when it turns out to be the  catalyst by which all the people she meets find the  very things she says she despises--friendship,  commitment, family, love.  This is a movie that wears its heart under its  sleeve.  Roos is sly, but the laughs he offers don't catch in your throat.  He makes you want to follow  Dee Dee like the rest of the cast and see what ride  she's taking you on.  I can't say what Christina  Ricci does is acting, exactly, but with a role like  this, how can you not be captivated--even when  you're repelled at the same time?  And Martin  Donovan does act--he wears the pain of loss on his  face like a shroud.  You can understand why his dead lover's sister is so taken by him.  Donovan molds  this man of substance and makes of him a wonderful  comic mess.I very much enjoyed the brash gaudiness of Romy and Michelle's High-School Reunion, and Lisa Kudrow's  Michelle turned out to be the most with-it person  in the movie.  Yet as Lucia Delury, Kudrow shows a  different side--a serious rendering of a smart,  educated woman who's balled herself up over an  attraction to a man who doesn't love her.  Not since Kate Jackson in Making Love do I recall a  change in an actress of this magnitude.  I agree with the New York Film Critics Circle; this was the best supporting actress performance of 1998.Even the lesser roles are fetching from Lyle Lovett  who has probably the best line in the movie to Ivan  Sergei as Bill's bee-stung-lipped bedpartner Matt to William Lee Scott as the birthfather.  Randy may be  a hypocrite--the butt of Roos' joke about Christians--but Scott plays him with such feeling  that he transcends the joke.

Myself, I prefer the earlier Woodman (Bananas, Take the Money and Run, Love and Death, Annie Hall) as opposed to the post Mia Farrow Allen.  He was a hell of a lot funnier back then and more entertaining.  While Sweet and Lowdown does not fit in the later angry Allen category (it resembles more of his earlier period), it is definitely not primo Woody.  For me the last great Woody Allen picture was 1977's brilliant and hilarious Annie Hall, no doubt his best work ever.Sweet and Lowdown boasts a great performance from Sean Penn, looks great and has a great jazz score, but the film for the most part is pretty lightweight and hammers the continuous concept of  genius musician cannot be intimate with another throughout the entire picture.  Underneath it is really not much substance.  This mock documentary centers on the fictitious 1930's obscure jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) who lives somewhat in the shadow of the real life jazz player, Django Reinhardt, Ray's idol.  Although Ray is a brilliant guitar player, he just doesn't have his act together.  He drinks too much, gambles, is irresponsible, lives beyond his means and has major commitment and intimacy problems (hell, sounds a lot like myself and every other male on the planet).  He eventually meets a mute, Hattie (Samantha Morton) that he falls for and eventually leaves for a socialite writer (Uma Thurman) and then begins his trip to self-destruction and obscurity.Sean Penn, one of the top ten great actors working today, gives a wonderful and winning comedic and moving performance as Emmet, whose eccentricities and ego put him over the edge and hinder his musical career and personal life.  Penn as always immerses himself deep within the character to create a role that a lesser actor would have made into a caricature.  Now this is the actor who should have played the title character in The Talented Mr. Ripley, what a different and much better picture that would have been.  Samantha Morton as Hattie is also wonderful in a supporting role. Without any dialogue she conveys so much through her body language and facial expressions.  It is a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination, the kind that the Academy loves.  Uma Thurman, who is a hit or miss with me, seems out of place in this picture.  First off, I don't think it is that good of a performance and second, I found her, not the character, annoying.Sweet and Lowdown is being characterized as a comedy, and while there are some funny lines, I did not find myself laughing that much (at least I laughed more than once as compared to the unfunny Being John Malkovich).  I expected much more wit from Woody Allen and much more period.  I guess you could call this Wood-lite.  The picture just does not have much substance to it nor does it really go anywhere.  If it were not for Sean Penn's bravura performance, there would not be really anything here.  After all these years and personal turmoil, maybe the Woodman has finally run out of steam, I hope not.

Some did not live up to these expectations (Man on the Moon, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Being John Malkovich), others did (American Beauty, The Insider).  One particular film though entered very quietly with little fanfare and turned out to be a gem and is maintaining its stay at theaters along with the big guns.  That film is the wonderful, intelligent and funny Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth in his Baltimore series (Diner, Tin Men, Avalon).  Like those films Levinson relies on great dialogue, real characters and good actors to bring it all to life (again its amazing how that works).Liberty Heights explores the issues of race, class and religion mainly through the eyes and experiences of two Jewish brothers, college student Van Kurtzman (Adrien Brody) and his younger brother, Ben (Ben Foster) during 1954.  They live in the predominately Jewish community of Forest Park with their parents (Mantegna and Neuwirth) along with their grandmother.  Their father owns a burlesque house and runs the local numbers business.  They are a relatively normal loving middle class family.  But both brothers are beginning to explore the outside world of their Jewish circle and the changes that are taking place within the world.  While eldest brother Van is breaking class barriers by pursing a rich upper class socialite, Ben is knocking down the color barrier by starting a relationship with a pretty black classmate.  Eventually all their worlds collide to varying degrees and both boys learn and grow along the way.  This is a wonderful heartfelt picture with none of the sentimentality that marred The Green Mile.  It is honest with its emotions and does not force them or any message onto the audience.  Liberty Heights is a true delight and a must see for those who are pursuing all those big guns in the theaters now.Levinson has created such a rich and wonderful universe that is so real and has chosen a near perfect cast to pull it off.  The always-reliable Joe Mantegna as Nate gives a good, solid performance as the patriarch of the Kurtzman family.  He is a strong and loving figure for his family and Mantegna does a good job of it.  The very talented Neuwirth also does fine work and Richard Kline who was awful as Jack's buddy in the TV show Three's Company does an outstanding job as Nat's business partner Charlie, but this picture belongs to the brothers (Brody and especially the young Foster).  Brody who has proven himself to be an up-and-coming actor (The Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) should have a long shelf life compared to some of his flash in the pan contemporaries.  His performance shows a very focused and compelling character.  But the acting of Ben Foster is pure joy and he carries the picture and lights up the screen every time he appears with his very natural and charismatic performance.  This is one talented actor who I hope to see more of in the future.  Although both Brody and Foster do not have the so called movie star good looks they are in a league of their own as far as talent is concerned.  We need less pretty faces that can't act and more of their kind.Although Liberty Heights does not have any of the hype of the other pictures and the acting and directing do not have Oscar written all over them, it is still a great picture that stands tall and can go head to head with all the major contenders out there.  Do yourself a favor and check out this wonderful picture, you will not be disappointed.

Some did not live up to these expectations (Man on the Moon, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Being John Malkovich), others did (American Beauty, The Insider).  One particular film though entered very quietly with little fanfare and turned out to be a gem and is maintaining its stay at theaters along with the big guns.  That film is the wonderful, intelligent and funny Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth in his Baltimore series (Diner, Tin Men, Avalon).  Like those films Levinson relies on great dialogue, real characters and good actors to bring it all to life (again its amazing how that works).Liberty Heights explores the issues of race, class and religion mainly through the eyes and experiences of two Jewish brothers, college student Van Kurtzman (Adrien Brody) and his younger brother, Ben (Ben Foster) during 1954.  They live in the predominately Jewish community of Forest Park with their parents (Mantegna and Neuwirth) along with their grandmother.  Their father owns a burlesque house and runs the local numbers business.  They are a relatively normal loving middle class family.  But both brothers are beginning to explore the outside world of their Jewish circle and the changes that are taking place within the world.  While eldest brother Van is breaking class barriers by pursing a rich upper class socialite, Ben is knocking down the color barrier by starting a relationship with a pretty black classmate.  Eventually all their worlds collide to varying degrees and both boys learn and grow along the way.  This is a wonderful heartfelt picture with none of the sentimentality that marred The Green Mile.  It is honest with its emotions and does not force them or any message onto the audience.  Liberty Heights is a true delight and a must see for those who are pursuing all those big guns in the theaters now.Levinson has created such a rich and wonderful universe that is so real and has chosen a near perfect cast to pull it off.  The always-reliable Joe Mantegna as Nate gives a good, solid performance as the patriarch of the Kurtzman family.  He is a strong and loving figure for his family and Mantegna does a good job of it.  The very talented Neuwirth also does fine work and Richard Kline who was awful as Jack's buddy in the TV show Three's Company does an outstanding job as Nat's business partner Charlie, but this picture belongs to the brothers (Brody and especially the young Foster).  Brody who has proven himself to be an up-and-coming actor (The Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) should have a long shelf life compared to some of his flash in the pan contemporaries.  His performance shows a very focused and compelling character.  But the acting of Ben Foster is pure joy and he carries the picture and lights up the screen every time he appears with his very natural and charismatic performance.  This is one talented actor who I hope to see more of in the future.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"14 January 2000","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Crash is about people who get not only excited but even sexually aroused by car accidents. The film's theme is highly dared, no wonder that many of its viewers will be annoyed, disgusted or even shocked by it. Watching Crash is not at all a delightful experience, but it is nevertheless an experience which is worth having it. The film does not provide simple answers to what it is about, it leaves room for numerous speculations and that makes it difficult to judge what it is really about. In my opinion the film is about several human beings who are alienated from their organic self. In this respect Crash is about a future society in which the body is no longer inhabitable for the soul. We already live in an extremely designed environment, in a reality largely constructed by our mind. Flesh is unclean, it is a dirty and clumsy thing and not worth containing something as pure and beautiful as our spiritual essence. We are therefore obliged to search new vessels for our psychic self, we crave to be transformed into machines of steel. The first steep in this process would then be to violently crush our bodies into the steering wheel of a car.The film's cinematography is outstanding, a flawless achievement which truly deserves admiration. Right from the beginning we enter a world where everything is infected by cold and unfriendly colors. There are hardly any bright, warm or charming images in this film, instead everything looks sterile as if nothing could grow or prosper there. The film's look is quite realistic and the car crashes seem as if they were taken from authentic sources. There are no spectacular camera movements, no slow-motion sequences and no extreme close-ups either. The simple and honest visual style documents a reality where sensational events do no longer occur, it depicts a society which has abolished the extraordinary. The film's whole imagery roots in the concept of understatement, and exactly this kind of outward modesty exposes every single latent obsession lurking beneath its cold an indifferent surface.The editor has done a great job as well. Although the film moves at a relatively slow pace it never gets boring. On the contrary, its slow but intense rhythm only adds to the hypnotising atmosphere and a gradual awareness that there is no escape from the world of Crash. The manner in which sequences are combined and put together supports the impressive images of barren, lifeless and almost suffocating environments. All the various explicit sex scenes are performed in a cold and mechanical way. The abstract and stylish choreography of those scenes clearly reveals copulation as an artificial and functional act. Organic reproduction does not require any degree of emotional involvement, the concept of love may therefore no longer be applied to a future relationship. It seems strange that despite such a cruel atmosphere without room for love there is also something very sensual, very attractive in Crash. I think that this ambiguity is a visionary quality of most of Cronenberg's films, we are often introduced to a new kind of aesthetics which are captivating and repulsive at once.All the well-chosen actors give memorable performances. They play their roles in a dramatic, fanatical and self-abandoning manner without ever having doubts about the strange nature of their characters. None of them seems afraid of pushing things to the limit. It is this uncompromising way of acting which makes an otherwise unlikely desire for car accidents believable and gives the story credibility. Their restless, torn and hunting performances hidden by a mechanical almost absent-minded outward appearance add even more to the obsessive tone of the film. What is remarkable about Crash is that during the whole film there is virtually no character development. Every character we get to know in the course of the story stays more or less the same, from beginning to the end they all go through various emotional roller coaster rides but they are not capable of changing their attitude or behavior in order to dissolve their pathological state of being. This technique has a claustrophobic effect on the audience, it creates the impression of being trapped inside a world where every attempt to escape is paralysed by utter despair.The film relies mainly on static description rather than providing a huge amount of successive events, its message is merely conveyed by atmosphere rather than action or unexpected plot twists. The plot itself is best described as impotent, it does not give birth to anything new or surprising. In my opinion it is this frigid story line that makes Crash a real work of genius, because it perfectly fits the portrayed characters who themselves live in constant danger of sexual failure and emotional breakdown. Their unreliable bodies do no longer provide a chance for organic satisfaction, their passions can no longer be expressed through the interaction of flesh. Love is still felt and still there but it cannot be articulated any more, the organic way proves to be a dead end. Life has to find new ways in order to fulfill itself. The characters in the story do exactly this, they try to reshape their flesh bound existence, they seek redemption in the ultimate head-on collision of flesh and steel although its result is physical death. However, there is no turning back and the only alternative consists of a life captured inside the heart of a machine.Crash is certainly not a movie for all tastes and its strong sexual content has earned him quite a bad reputation, nevertheless it is a unique film experience and a rare example for grand film making. I consider Crash a very inspiring piece of art and a real alternative to Hollywood's countless mainstream productions. As I have already said the film has a visionary quality, its prophetic voice may not be heard or fully understood yet, but I think that Cronenberg's masterpiece (so far) has the potential of becoming a cult classic.
