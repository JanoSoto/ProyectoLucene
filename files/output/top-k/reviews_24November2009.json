I thought more exposure should be given to the circumstances of Lewis in prison, the initial trial, and some scenes of him being taken to prison. As the story unfold, I understood that the movie is not so much about Lewis, but more of the inter-play of emotions of Sheriff and Tony, as well as the effort of Beth to convince them to return to Malaysia, to save the life of Lewis.Very straight forward story line, with a little twist towards the end. Overall a good lesson for the young and reckless about the consequence of taking it easy with drugs, especially in a foreign country.No justice done about the conditions in Malaysia, however. The opening scenes are done in Thailand, with bits done with Malaysian actors. The prison looks real shabby, broken down and filthy. The prison guards and the Ministry of Interior would be up for prosecution here in Malaysia if they let the conditions to be that bad.First of all, the guards do speak English, most Malaysians do. The court scene were done in Malay because that's the standard procedure. If the person on trial does not understand Malay, an interpreter would be provided.Secondly, the legal system here would allow appeals and stay of execution if there are new evidence produced. If this is real, Lewis' case would probably be thrown on technical grounds, as there are doubt that the drugs are not entirely his, and not within his control.Treatment of prisoners in Malaysia is far better than that of the common citizen sometimes. A person facing death penalty would be in a special cell, given the best treatment to ensure their calm state of mind. Regular service by the prison priest would be done to help the prisoner come to terms with the inevitable, and to counsel the prisoner. Hanging would NEVER be done in the open, prisoners would be given time to pray, say their goodbyes, meet relatives or friends in a calm manner. Malaysian prison guards are trained to ensure the welfare of the prisoners, prisons well lighted, and clean.I'm sure that if the producers approached the Ministry officials with the proper storyline and intentions, the government would be glad to help get them.

The first half was pretty well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets up with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. There are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now. After that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but ultimately the film is not great. For a better, similar film, try Heaven Can Wait. Decent, but I really kind of wish I hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.*** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 2009","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like Chances Are, but I wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons.

I think they should have made the most of the confusion that the daughter of Damaskinos was going through at that very moment that is the turmoil from the growing gratitude & appreciation she started to feel for Eric her savior though her established enemy and the fresh discovery of her father's betrayal and mercilessness towards his own flesh & blood.

In terms of popularity, this third installment comes somewhere in between its two predecessors. I saw a bit of Last Crusade on TV, starting near the end of the film, as a kid. I think this was around 1993, but I didn't know what I was seeing at the time. After all these years, I've finally found out that it was this 1989 action adventure I was seeing. While it didn't do much for me years ago, and I was too young for it at the time (one MIGHT wonder why it didn't really frighten me), watching it from start to finish twenty years after its release was not an experience to forget.In 1938, Indiana Jones is informed by a wealthy businessman named Walter Donovan that the leader of an expedition for the Holy Grail has mysteriously disappeared, and that leader happens to be Indy's estranged father, Professor Henry Jones, Sr.! Indy has received a package in the mail from Italy, which turns out to be his father's diary. This diary contains clues and a nameless map to find the Grail! The archaeologist flies to Venice with Marcus Brody, and there they meet Dr. Elsa Schneider. She takes them to the library where Henry Jones, Sr. was last seen. This library used to be a church, and it turns out that there are catacombs underneath the building! Indy and Elsa go down through the floor, and after facing several life-threatening situations, Indy learns that his father is being held captive in a castle on the German-Austrian border! He goes there with Dr. Schneider to find the senior Jones, and soon does, but then learns the truth about Elsa and Walter. Both of them actually work for the Nazis, and are helping them find the Holy Grail to use for their evil!The movie starts with a prologue, featuring a young Indiana Jones in 1912, played by the late River Phoenix. Phoenix' performance may not be good as that of Harrison Ford, but it's not bad. The beginning of the movie is no match for the beginning of Raiders, and the part with the grave robbers digging during the prologue is a bit silly, but the suspense quickly begins. There's much more suspense after the film skips to 1938, as usual for the Indiana Jones franchise. We once again see our hero in different types of danger in different places, making for some great, intense action! There may be some lacklustre moments, such as the bedroom scene with Indy and Elsa, but for the most part, the movie is steady. The Last Crusade introduces Indy's father, and Sean Connery shines in this role. There's definitely some humour, and Henry Jones, Sr. contributes a lot to it. Connery does a better job with the humour in this role than Kate Capshaw did as Willie Scott in Temple of Doom, that's for sure. Like its two predecessors, this third installment also has some nice visuals and sets.Some have more criticisms of Temple of Doom than I do, but my main problem with that second Indiana Jones film is the brutality, which doesn't start until the second half of the film, but really brings it down in quality. Fortunately, they took the original trilogy back in the right direction with The Last Crusade, as the kind of brutality featured in the second movie is nowhere to be found here. This one remains an entertaining action adventure throughout, much like the original. There are parts that could scare younger viewers, and the film is rated PG-13 (a rating that Temple of Doom apparently helped lead to the creation of), but it certainly never gets as disturbing as the middle film in the 80's trilogy eventually does. Last Crusade may not be quite as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but if not, it comes very close! For fans of the classic film that introduced the Indiana Jones character who were disappointed by its first successor, I would say this 1989 summer blockbuster was a return to form.

Past the controversial message that some argue that this promotes, is one so banal and predictable that it ought to no longer need be campaigned for. The editing and cinematography are relatively standard. There is violence and disturbing content in this, and the latter is verbally described in detail. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it and\/or of thrillers. 7\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"24 November 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Roger Ebert once said that his definition of a classic is a film which one cannot bear the thought of never being able to see again.

Though not Kubrick's best, I think it is the best example of his style.

Something about the place is starting to have an affect on Jack mindset. The isolation and frustration with his work, makes him delusional and he starts having hallucinations of friends and hotel staff who are telling him to kill his family. It is all in his mind or is it real. With nobody around for miles, and bad weather approaching, how will Wendy keep herself and Danny safe from impending doom?Kubricks mise-en-scene is quite distinctive. He strikes me as a detailed set designer, and a director intent on making his environment weird elaborate or complex. Just look at the neon clubs in Clockwork Orange or the masked ball in Eyes Wide Shut. The Overlook hotel is also a great piece of production design. In fact it may be the biggest hotel I have seen in a movie. (shot from the inside that is). The photography is highly evocative, and features a handful of memorable shots and camera tricks. Kubrick likes long duration.For the most part the film is a pretty honourable adaptation of the novel, except for the climax, which Kubrick completely rewrites. I guess he found King's approach too conventional and 'happy ending' like. King's approach was better. Climax of the movie involves a chase scene that feels highly uninventive, rather over the top, and dragging on for a little too long. I've never liked Jack Nicholson much, but for the sloppy performance he gives here, I give equal blame to Kubrick. The way I see it, he probably gave Nicholson only two words of direction...'go nuts'. This is exactly what happens. Never before has Nicholson been so far over the top. Shelley Duvall is equally poor, and for about three quarters of the movie, she delivers her lines with the same ridiculous expression on her face.Aside from these problems, I would call the Shining an impressive piece of horror movie making. Is it a great movie? not quite but it is one worth wathcing, although I would recommend the book first.

I acknowledged that although I liked the movie&#x97;mind you as a guilty pleasure&#x97;it is not a particularly good motion picture. It's a no-brainer; the perfect kind of movie for people who don't look for logic in their films. It's a quintessential Saturday matinée. It's also the movie responsible for the kickoff of Tom Cruise's career. And it's been the target for many spoofs, rip-offs, and parodies such as the hit comedy Hot Shots! (1991) with Charlie Sheen. So although Top Gun is not a good movie, it is a decidedly influential movie and it is guilty pleasure entertainment at its best.Tom Cruise plays 'Maverick' a hot shot fighter pilot who becomes selected to take part in Top Gun, an elite school for flying aces. He's got a lot of pride and a brain full of recklessness, but he's also a very good pilot. Yeah, we know the type. Amidst and in his schooling, he faces competition from another hotshot played by Val Kilmer and a romantic attachment from one of his instructors, played by Kelly McGillis.What really saves this movie from sinking (or pummeling from the sky, I guess we should say) is not the harebrained script, but the performances. After all, Tom Cruise's career launched off not merely because he was in a hit movie, but because he played, like Harrison Ford in his kickoff, a cocky character that the audience went for. Cruise, with his schmuck hotshot attitude and chirpy grin is precisely the sort of protagonist that a no-brainer audience goes for. He started off playing cocky characters and he played them well. Kelly McGillis, although having no character depth, does also manage to pull off a very interesting performance and that is why, for me anyway, the relationship between her and Cruise remains a little interesting even though this love subplot, like many, is completely unnecessary.But the high point for me was a very spectacular action scene toward the end of the picture where Cruise and others engage with enemy fighters while flying over the ocean. This scene was explosive, kinetic, fast-moving, and yet stretched a great length of time and was just the jarring motion we needed after the middle of the movie really began to run slow.Top Gun is one of those movies that is hard to praise for a long time, because there's a lot more to complain about than there is to praise. In the end, I enjoyed the picture because of some sweet action scenes, strong performances, and just a kind of steady guilty pleasure atmosphere that surrounded the whole ordeal. Now if your brain refuses to let down its sophisticated guards at any time, this will not be the picture to suit your day. It's a harebrained story with harebrained characters. But if you drop your standards for just a little while, kick back, relax, and try not to take it too seriously, you will find some primal low-key entertainment.

Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great Hitchcocks. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and SuperbabiesBaby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.What makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks.The direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, shattering his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge.All in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema.

The first storyline centers around Jules and Vincent (Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta), who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). The second story line focuses on Vincent taking Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) to dinner, and the final storyline is about Wallace bribing a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) to take the fall is a boxing match. Of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order, but going through everything that happens would take a while. Tarantino won a Best Screenplay Oscar, but the movie should have won many more awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson), and Best Supporting Actress (Uma Thurman). In most years, I would say that John Travolta should have won the Best Actor Oscar, but I give the nod to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. The acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere. Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, Rhames, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvy Keitel and Eric Stoltz are all terrific. The only sub par performance is that of Tarantino himself. The style of direction that Tarantino uses is one of those love it or hate it kinds. If you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character, then you will like Tarantino's style of direction. In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is the best movie made in the 90's. I was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time, but after sitting through it, there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out.

I never thought too much of his shtick, Latka after all was a very pandering character who succeeded very well at precisely what it was supposed to do, namely appealing to warm and fuzzy instinctive maternality on a banal level, a television staple. His stage routines are also just vignettes of the fantasies of a lonely boy who grew up to be a textbook neurotic nebbish. Nothing very original, mostly just an updated riff on Cab Calloway, more pandering with Elvis and some lip-syncing interspersed with again, the puerile Foreign Man\/Latka providing some schizoid emceeing. What gets my attention, is the negative (and in my opinion hilarious) energy exuded by his bits as Tony Clifton. This is truly a hoot and is some of the best show business satire around though I think even this was derived from Bill Kirchenbauer's hilarious turn as Tony Rolletti on Fernwood 2-Nite. It is also a tribute to the old borscht belt tradition of the tummler whose job it was to disquiet an audience in advance of a headliner (think Jack E. Leonard, Don Rickles etc.) This is where it all gets quite weird with Kaufman insisting on two plane tickets when he traveled etc. Kaufman was merely thumbing his nose at everyone (mostly the establishment, I hope). He even got away with it for a time until people wised up and voted him off SNL. As for Jim Carrey, you won't see any better acting, and the Milos Forman film is wonderful with many of the victims and co-conspirators in the cast. It seems the last laugh was on Andy because few people went to see a great movie about a man who did little to hide his contempt for the audience, milk and cookies notwithstanding.

Leonard, Don Rickles etc.) This is where it all gets quite weird with Kaufman insisting on two plane tickets when he traveled etc. Kaufman was merely thumbing his nose at everyone (mostly the establishment, I hope). He even got away with it for a time until people wised up and voted him off SNL. As for Jim Carrey, you won't see any better acting, and the Milos Forman film is wonderful with many of the victims and co-conspirators in the cast.

I never thought too much of his shtick, Latka after all was a very pandering character who succeeded very well at precisely what it was supposed to do, namely appealing to warm and fuzzy instinctive maternality on a banal level, a television staple. His stage routines are also just vignettes of the fantasies of a lonely boy who grew up to be a textbook neurotic nebbish. Nothing very original, mostly just an updated riff on Cab Calloway, more pandering with Elvis and some lip-syncing interspersed with again, the puerile Foreign Man\/Latka providing some schizoid emceeing. What gets my attention, is the negative (and in my opinion hilarious) energy exuded by his bits as Tony Clifton.

On a train from continental Europe to Britain, Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) discovers that her friend Ms. Froy (Dame May Witty) has disappeared. She joins with musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to attempt to find the woman, and in the process becomes involved in a plot involving spies and foreign intrigue. Although the end is a bit far-fetched, there are still a number of memorable scenes. Of course Charters and Caldicott are two of the funniest characters you will find anywhere (I still crack up when Charters smugly says A thing like cricket, even though I've seen it half a dozen times), but the others are all interesting to watch. One skill of Hitch's that always goes under the radar is his affinity for simply letting the characters interact in an environment. Even though we know him best for the suspense scenes, like the shootout between the Brits on board the train and enemy soldiers outside, Hitch proves in The Lady Vanishes that he is far more than simply a director of action. This film is truly a must see. After Vertigo, Rear Window, and Psycho it's his best, and being the fourth best film made by a guy who turned out two dozen of the best of all time isn't anything to feel bad about.

I will agree that it is very silly, and certainly not Oscar worthy. Don't expect a sophisticated plot, and a superlative script. Expect a harmless and fun Christmas comedy, that way you are in for a good time.While very predictable in plotting and rather repetitive and slow in the middle half; especially in the first thirty minutes Ernest Saves Christmas does have its funny moments. And I must say the scene with the magic sleigh was uproariously funny. Amongst the humour, is an in general heart-warming story about Santa and his attempts to find a successor.The camera-work may be a tad dated, but the music is very nice indeed. And I actually thought the acting is above decent, with the late (and talented) Jim Varney wonderfully spirited as Ernest and Douglas Seale is simply great as Santa. The opening credits with the collage of Christmas carols were a delight.Ernest Saves Christmas is an above average seasonal comedy about the power of belief and the dignity of an individual. It is far from a masterpiece, but seriously I wasn't expecting it to be. I got exactly what I wanted, a fun film that while predictable and silly is lots of fun too. I do also think it is underrated; there are much worse movies out there, namely any of the Friedberg-Seltzer movies, Home Alone 4 and SuperbabiesBaby Geniuses 2. 7\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 2009","score":"10 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Ernest Saves Christmas is a very underrated Christmas holiday flick.

There are two things happening in this film one that Kubrick inherited from Burgess' writing, and another that is endemic to the cinematic medium.The first role of 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)' is as a rather vicious political satire, dryly mocking the hypocrisy of the government and its policies on institutionalisation and criminal rehabilitation. In the film, the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp) is depicted as opportunistic and self-serving, latching onto the unproven Ludovico technique in a bid to stem his party's failing popularity with voters. When public opinion turns against the therapy, the Minister very swiftly back-peddles, reversing the treatment so that Alex may return to his former ultra-violent ways I was cured alright!The UK edition of Burgess' novel contained a final chapter in which Alex sees the error of his former ways, and vows to reform into a productive member of society. Kubrick was unaware of this addition until he had almost completed the screenplay, and never considered using it in the film. This was, I think, a good decision. Burgess' ending shies away from the problem by letting human nature run its course, he seems to be implying that the problem of juvenile delinquency will sort itself out. Kubrick, admittedly, doesn't offer any solutions of his own, but the corrupt manner in which he ends the film leaves a sour taste.The Ludovico technique involves the screening of movies, which also allows Kubrick room for a degree of self-referentiality. It is in the audiences' nature to recoil from acts of sex and violence, and Kubrick's hard-nosed, deliberately-subversive approach (utilising the perspective of its biased protagonist and narrator) only encourages this response. Just as Alex is exposed to the Ludovico aversion therapy, Kubrick is exposing his audience to the same treatment. Does it work?
