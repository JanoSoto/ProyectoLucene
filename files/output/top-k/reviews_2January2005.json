(The story concerns a professor of phonology who accepts a bet that he can teach a Cockney flower-seller to speak like a duchess.) This makes it a curious basis for a Broadway musical, given that most Americans have little interest in the linguistic aspects of the British class system and little ability to distinguish British accents. It is therefore hardly surprising that Audrey Hepburn does not sound much like a native of Lisson Grove (a predominantly working-class district of North-WestLondon with an accent slightly different to the better-known East End Cockney). She was clearly under instructions to exaggerate her accent to such an extent that even an American audience could not fail to appreciate the contrast with the accents of the posh characters.Despite its unlikely subject-matter,My Fair Lady was a great success, both as a stage musical and as a film. There are a number of reasons for this. Shaw was able to create witty dialogue and interesting characters, even when he was writing a didactic piece (which most of his plays are). The songs are unfailingly tuneful. In my opinion, however, the main reason for the success of the film version is due to one factor; the casting of Audrey Hepburn. Although Hepburn held British citizenship she was, on her mother's side, a member of the Dutch aristocracy, and had spent much of her youth abroad, so she might not have seemed the most likely choice as a London flower-girl. (She was also in her mid thirties, considerably older than the character she plays). At the time, many felt that the role should have gone to Julie Andrews, who had played the part in the stage version. Hepburn was, however, the most beautiful, elegant and charismatic actress of her generation, with an uncanny ability to make a film by her presence alone. Try imagining Breakfast at Tiffany's or Roman Holiday with any other actress in the lead. Or Sabrina.(Actually, someone obviously did try imagining Sabrina with another actress,which is why we ended up with that embarrassing Julia Ormond remake).My Fair Lady is another example of Audrey's gift at work. Although to British ears she might not seem entirely convincing as a Cockney in the earlier scenes, she dominates the latter part of the film when Eliza has been transformed into a gracious society lady.I have never heard the versions of the songs that Audrey recorded herself, so I cannot say whether the decision to have her singing dubbed was the right one. Certainly, Marni Nixon does a fine job, although, on the evidence of Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffanys, Hepburn had a better voice than popular belief has given her credit for. Of the other characters I particularly liked Stanley Holloway\u2019s comic turn as Alfred Dolittle, Elizas old reprobate of a father. (In an inversion of the normal generation gap, the teetotal, virginal Eliza is far more puritanical than her father). Rex Harrison makes an amusing Professor Higgins, even though he was obviously no singer and was rather older than I had imagined Shaws character.When I first saw the film, I disliked the decision to change Shaw\u2019s ending, which I saw as a surrender to Hollywood sentimentality. Having seen it again, I am inclined to change my mind. A romance, of sorts, between Eliza and Higgins is by no means inconceivable. Higgins may be a sexist and a snob, but he is certainly not gay, as some have speculated. Why Cant a Woman be More Like a Man is quite a common sentiment among male heterosexuals. Higgins reminded me of those representatives of modern British lad culture who choose potential wives and girlfriends on the basis of male rather than female attributes. A woman is valued less for her personality or sex appeal than for her interest in such matters as alcohol and sport. It is the same with Higgins, except that he will expect Eliza to be able to discuss not lager and the offside rule but labiodental fricatives and the First Great Sound Shift. Eliza might be a beauty, but far more important to Higgins is the fact that she is the first woman he has ever met who shares his interest in linguistics. If Eliza can adapt to Higgins expectations (there is no indication that he will ever adapt to hers), there is no reason why their union should not be a happy one.This is also a very attractive film visually, especially the two famous showpiece scenes at Royal Ascot and the Embassy Ball. The former is particularly striking, with the black and white costumes creating a remarkable stylised look. Cecil Beaton well deserved his Oscar; seldom can costume design have contributed so much to the success of a film. On the subject of Oscars, the great scandal, of course, is that Audrey was not even nominated; perhaps the Academy felt embarrassed by the number of leading ladies in musicals who did not do their own singing. I felt that Harrison was a rather fortunate winner against some very strong opposition, but the Best Picture award was well deserved. This is perhaps my favourite musical of the sixties. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 2005","score":"9 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" Shaw's Pygmalion was written in support of its author's controversial thesis that class divisions in British society could be overcome by encouraging the use of Received Pronunciation (supported by reformed spelling in a phonetic alphabet)in place of regional and class accents.

Who REALLY did the writing for this last installment of the Godfather saga? Probably the same staff who does As the World Turns. This flick doesn't deserve the title Godfather at all. Let's call this one The Cosas of Our Nostras or All My Capos. As someone who's encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life, I can say without exception, that I've never met any mobster as inwardly-conflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone. Let's face it, these guys are in the Mafia solely because they're greedy, nothing more. In this film, Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future, perhaps even the Afterlife, then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is, deep down. Then, there's his failed marriage. After the break-up scenes in G2, we may hope that Michael & Kay will reunite as man and wife, but here they seem to just become very good, platonic friends who can laugh & cry & share intimate thoughts about their lives. It's as if the screenwriters try to make Michael into a woman. It's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years. There's some miscasting here and there, or perhaps they're sins of authorship. Poor, old-country-beautiful Sophia Coppola is saddled with a hopeless role, with too many short lines in the film that don't fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations - was given remarks rather than lines to emote. Her 'passionate' lovemaking scene with Andy Garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open-mouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes...scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by Glenn Close and Michael Douglas, but it's just laughable here. Then, there's Andy's character, Vinnie Mancini, who's also given a difficult & thankless role to play. He's expected, I guess, to be the new, new Don Corleone, but he's almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position, unlike Michael's simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1. This hand-me-down process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a Mafia Family, but why is so much made of this boring routine? Certainly, Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday, but there's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man, sadly. Puzo did such a fine job of quickly & concisely developing Michael's character in G1. But, G3 has no economy in it's story-telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze. Thirdly, George Hamilton was also handed a thankless task, in taking over as family lawyer after Robt Duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as Tom Hagen. George wisely underplayed his role, so it came off without damage to the actor. The development of Connie Corleone's character is interesting, but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands (she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos, if this were the real world). But, it's not all bad. The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty! Also, they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line. And, we recover some old-country feel as we get to go back to Sicily, even if it's all done in 1989 and they've got modern cars & haircuts. The plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the Catholic Church are pretty interesting, since it's based on some actual financial shenanigans at Banco Vaticani in the 1980's, but it's brought too far, again, with the too-spectacular death scenes, etc. The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed. But, the death scene of Mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional-manipulation, at best. All screenwriters need to learn that we don't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion. You feel sorry for Kay that her daughter is dead, she plays her grief so well, but Michael's reaction is hammy, hammy, hammy. Then, Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century, in Sicily, alone on a grand estate, of heart-failure...no grandson to play with before his demise, no wife to grieve for him. What SHOULD have happened in the last 1\/2 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani, put on trial, all his dirty family's sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day, Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life...then he can keel over dead from heart-failure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH. That's how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80's and early 90's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved.

That's how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80's and early 90's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved.

He's not your typical man because most of his friends are women and he does live with his sister. Also Lloyd doesn't have any career plans except kick-boxing. His dreams all lie in a honor student, Diane Court(played by Ione Skye). Diane is a Straight A student with a scholarship to a university in England.

Her father, later in this movie, will come upon hard times as he will have to deal with the IRS and being incarcerated. Lloyd and Diane eventually begin seeing each other and do fall in love but when Diane's father tells her not to have any attachments or distractions going to England, Diane breaks up with Lloyd in his own car.

His character is so sincere we fall in love with him. We hope and pray during the second half of the movie that both of them will get back together.

But that's damning with faint praise. We've got Earthquake and Poseidon Adventure. Earthquake is just bad - Charlton Heston is the worst of the big-budget disaster actor-leads. Cruddy subplots, Marjoe Gortner as a sex-crazed National Guardsman, Walter Matthau embarrassing himself, and Victoria Principal in the worst 'fro in screen history. Poseidon - Gene Hackman in one of the worst portrayals of a man of the cloth in screen history, Eric Shea (arrgh), and Shelley Winter's death scene.So Inferno is a classic by compare. Steve McQueen remains pretty much unscathed, Paul Newman seems only mildly embarrassed (what blackmail material did Irwin Allen have on him? - Paul ended up in Krakatoa, East of Java too), and Fred Astaire is charming. On the other hand, Robert Wagner gets the most embarrassing death in scene history (I ran the 100 meter in college - *snap crackle pop*) after trying to hide from a fire. Be very very quiet - maybe it won't find us. And Richard Chamberlain is inexplicably made up to look like an Auton (that's for you Doctor Who fans). Sadly, the likes of Faye Dunaway and William Windom are reduced to non-entities, and O.J. remains a non-entity. And cripes, how many shots can Irwin Allen put his wife Sheila into? There's some shoddy blue-screening - usually in the mid-shots - the longer shots look okay but watch when Robert Vaughn and party go up the elevator, or McQueen holds on to the firefighter on the elevator. But the fire F\/X sequences are good and there's decent miniature work. The plot is kinda non-linear - people wander in and out of the penthouse and you kinda lose track of how the firemen get in there, and Chamberlain leaves and comes back, and Newman and Mike Lookinland (who never says his dad is a better architect - one for you Brady Bunch fans) get up there. The setting has some potential for both claustrophobia and expanded outdoor\/height stuff (unlike Poseidon Adventure) but sometimes it's a bit too open.

I have watched this every year for the past 25 years and I still laugh out loud. This is a great collage of the best comics of the time and of history. What other movie ever had a lineup like this? I don't know what these other reviewers are thinking! The acting is so real and the chemistry is so great it is unbelievable. The opening scene at the car accident is priceless as dying driver Jimmy Durante rambles about hidden dough to the five accident witnesses (Berle, Winters, Hackett, Rooney, Ceasar) that are standing by him. His thoughts become murky and calls Sid Ceasar his Aunt. Then Durante takes one last breath and kicks a bucket down the ravine. Jonathan Winters stands up and says, That guy's dead!. Detective (Norman Fell) comes onto the scene and asks if Durante had anything to say before he died. (Silence). Then Fell asks if Durante was dead when the others arrived on the scene. The five men can't come up with words because they don't want to let the secret out of the bag. Then Buddy Hackett answers his question and says, Practically. They team up a few miles later along the side of the road to figure out how to split the money up between them when they find it in Santa Rosita. Sid Ceasar proposes different ways to split the money up which are so hilariously unreasonable and ridiculous that it comes off like an Abbott & Costello routine. The others are completely confused and offended (especially Winters) and finally agree to Every man for himself!!!. There are many stories in this movie that are hilarious! Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett stuck up in the air not knowing how to fly a plane (after pilot Backus is knocked out cold while mixing a drink in the cabin) and not knowing how to use the radio! The punch lines are a scream! Rooney (hysterical on the radio) Hey, you on the ground! We're up here in the air! Benjy, say something..., Hackett Help! Ceasar and his wife trying to charter a plane at an airport in the desert and end up with a broken-down 1920's biplane which has a maximum speed of about 50 mph. Ceasar with a hesitant look (to his wife) They don't make 'em like this anymore! Tried and true! (The woman starting the prop ends up blessing the plane before takeoff). Ethel Merman, Milton Berle in Terry Thomas' truck Ethel Merman annoyed (to Terry Thomas) Where'd you get that funny accent? From Harvard? Thomas I'm from England. Merman Sounds so foreign. The auto garage scene is classic Jonathan Winters. Phil Silvers is great as a money-hungry con-artist who dupes Jonathan Winters but ends up getting duped himself as he tries to find a shortcut through the desert. He runs across an Indian who needs a lift to get some medication. Silvers eventually finds himself down some dirt road in the middle of nowhere and relies on a little boy who wants some money to get him back to the main road but he's led to a road which is buried by a river. Silvers portrays his frustration hilariously! Don Knotts puts in a small role as a nervous driver who picks up Phil Silvers on the side of the road. Sid Ceasar is in excellent form when he and his wife get locked in a hardware basement while they're looking for a pick and shovel. Then Ceasar destroys the hardware store with fireworks and a sledge hammer while trying to break out of the basement. Ethel Merman and Dick Shawn are great as a hysterical mother and son. Terry Thomas is hilarious. As for the sexist accusations all of this was tongue in cheek, harmless and was standard in the 1960-1970's. (Making fun of the country's preoccupation with busoms can hardly be called discriminatory.) This movie is good clean fun no matter how you slice it. The great thing about this is that the secondary actors are big names (Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, Jim Backus, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Peter Faulk) and put in big jokes as well, they're not just standbys. The producers pulled out all the stops in this movie, the writing is fantastic. This is a non-stop journey and non-stop entertainment (but the ending was always a little slow for me).

When Todd starts black mailing him the old man stays friendly and helps Todd, I got the feeling there that he regrets his past and that he has changed. When Todd gives him his costume he is filled with anger, so it only adds to my feeling of his regret. Minutes later I really got disappointed for the scene with the cat ... it just proves that no one can make a Nazi become human, they always have to be described as pure evil ... What they did is awful but I guess many of them did things because they had no choice and they were drilled into doing stuff like that.

When Todd starts black mailing him the old man stays friendly and helps Todd, I got the feeling there that he regrets his past and that he has changed. When Todd gives him his costume he is filled with anger, so it only adds to my feeling of his regret. Minutes later I really got disappointed for the scene with the cat ... it just proves that no one can make a Nazi become human, they always have to be described as pure evil ... What they did is awful but I guess many of them did things because they had no choice and they were drilled into doing stuff like that.

Broccoli to cast a new leading man. This would be difficult, as Moore had already held onto the role for 12 years straight and Cubby was unsure how the public would react to a new Bond after getting used to Sir Roger's more light-hearted portrayal. So when it was revealed that Timothy Dalton had been chosen as the new 007 (over future Bond Pierce Brosnan), people were uncertain of which direction the films would take. Thankfully, the finished result proved that a more serious look into the world of James Bond could work when the humour finds a balance. Combined with Dalton's stirring (or was that shaken?) performance, the film ranks up there as one of the best in the series.So why does Dalton stand out? Even though he only did two films (the other being the excellent but under appreciated Licence To Kill), he put his mark on the series by attempting to bring Ian Fleming's Bond straight from the original novels. The outcome is a more hard-edged Bond who doesn't care for bureaucratic politics and similar distractions. He gets the job done quickly and efficiently, though he still finds the time to act the suave gentleman when the occasion calls for it. But make no mistake--he means business when he's on the job.The film opens in a typically grand way Bond is on a training mission with two other 00-agents when an enemy comes in and sabotages the exercise. Bond gives chase in a thrilling sequence where the only thing that matters is clinging on to dear life. For the first time in a while, an action scene is not obviously populated by stuntmen (Dalton did some of his own stunts) and we feel an attachment to Bond. Really, however, it's a slam-bang way to introduce the new 007 and works perfectly, even managing to stand on its own.After the surprisingly routine title sequence, the movie picks up again in a sequence inspired, appropriately, by Fleming's short story The Living Daylights, where Bond has to help general Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbé) get across the street without getting shot. The mission succeeds and Koskov is smuggled out of the country in an ingenious way. Unfortunately, things are not what they seem and eventually Bond is chasing after gun runners and diamond smugglers while hanging onto the back of a cargo plane in mid-air and tangling with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. When you look at it that way, it's as if nothing's changed for our favourite secret agent! I'm not even going to try to summarize the plot because it would take too long. This isn't a fault--screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson create a story full of twists that causes the audience to think. While the Afghanistan elements of the film have dated, I credit them for at least trying to stay current with what was going on at the time, even though the intrigue is sometimes convoluted. Other elements of the script are noteworthy the limited use of gadgets heightens the sense of realism, and there's the danger of Bond having to rely on his skills, rather than Q's inventions, to get through the film. The key chain is a brilliant example that Bond doesn't need lasers or explosive pens to defeat his enemies.Speaking of the cast, the actors are fantastic. Maryam d'Abo brings innocence to Kara Milovy, one of the better of the Bond girls. John Rhys-Davies is in top form as the tough and assured General Puskin. He and Dalton have an intense confrontation in a hotel room that's surely one of the best scenes in the franchise. Meanwhile, Art Malik and Thomas Wheatley create top tier allies that are instantly memorable. The only miscasts are Caroline Bliss and John Terry, who don't leave that much of a mark on their long-running characters, Miss Moneypenny and Felix Leiter. On the villainous side, Koskov is too flamboyant, while Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker, who would return to the world of Bond as CIA contact Jack Wade) doesn't do much of anything. The only stand out is Andreas Wisniewski as Soviet assassin Necros, the best henchman since Jaws.While director John Glen has the movie running 10 minutes too long, he manages to keep the story flowing and recovers from the creative misfire of A View To A Kill. The action scenes (including a kitchen fight that doesn't even involve Bond) are impressively staged and have a definite flair to them. Glen also uses the films exotic locations to maximum effect. The Rock of Gibraltar, Tangier, Vienna, and Afghanistan are all beautifully photographed, and aren't just used as background scenery for Bond to pass through. He also takes time to develop the relationship between 007 and Kara. The Living Daylights would also mark the last time that composer John Barry would score a Bond film, and he goes out in a bang. Using the great songs by A-ha and The Pretenders as a template (as well as the classic Bond theme), Barry crafts a soundtrack that fits the film like a glove.If Moore had called it quits with Octopussy, Tim would have probably been chosen to do Moore's swansong, and maybe this reinvention of Bond could have happened sooner and the public might have reacted more warmly to Dalton. As it is, by the time The Living Daylights was made, other action heroes were starting to dominate the arena. Coupled with the AIDS scare going around at the time, interest in Bond was fading, even though the movie was by no means a failure. In the long run, the movie was a strong debut for Dalton, and even though it was already his second last, it reestablished James Bond as relevant and dangerous. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" After Roger Moore (wisely) decided to quit playing James Bond in Eon productions official series of films, it was up to producer Albert R.

Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret still hasn't lost it - this lady is a true babe. Don't look at the rate of this film. I really don't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film. You will enjoy it, that's a promise. Recommended A+.

In a salute to WALTZ'S director Martin Scorsese, the film aired on TCM over the New Year's weekend. I hadn't seen it or thought about it in 25 years. And all I can say is that it hasn't lost any of its power. (And this from someone who's never been to a live rock concert.) The stars of the film- the all-purpose backup and touring band called 'The Band-' give a simple but enlightening insight to the mechanics of their 16 years on the road and how their Thanksgiving Day final concert in San Francisco turned into a revival-like celebration. Even though I grew up on jazz music more so than rock, I can fully appreciate The Band's intense, immense music background- influenced by everything from blues to country to folk music. As for the concert itself you have the likes of Neil Young, Ron Wood, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters, and Dr. John (who gives a standout, honky-tonk performance of Such A Night,) kickin' it on stage before it's all over. And if these live performances weren't enough, there are additional performances done on a sound stage with artists that weren't part of the live show woven into the 117-minute film a fabulous folk\/gospel jam session of the song The Weight teamed with the Staples Singers (lead by Mavis Staples, who sounds very Gladys Knight-like) and about thirty minutes later shifting gears into the lovely folk ballad Evangeline, replete with fiddle, mandolin, and acoustic guitar from Emmylou Harris. Also cool is Muddy Waters bluesing on Ain't that a Man, and the finale with all the artists of I Shall Be Released. You just might be.

Unfortunately for Eddie, it doesn't happen the easy way due to Eddie's self-destructive character. The film's strongest part is definitely the acting by every actor involved.

I loved it. The soundtrack is hauntingly superior (Sir Paul?!) Cruise provided a familiar harbor to which I moored my suspension of disbelief long enough to give this flick a chance. Cameron Diaz was simultaneously f***able and despicable. Cruz plays a vision with whom I would spend an eternity exploring her every virtual nook and cranny.The original, 'Abre', did a wonderful job of weaving the dizzying sci-fi rooted plot wefts into a modern Madrilenian tapestry -- sacrilegious Spanish curse-words, seemingly untranslatable Spanish names (Pelayo!), boxy 70's architecture-decor and all. As with all sci-fi masterpieces (for which this film unarguably qualifies) the viewer is captured by the characters and their plight (ah, how we love to see the pretty rich ones suffer!) This happens well before we even realize this is a sci-fi flick. Too, bad it is only the pretty ones (e.g. Cruz & Banderas) that translate into Hollywood material, as it was so very refreshing to watch Penelope in bed with a realistically good looking man, rather than an untouchable Hollywood icon as is Cruise.Director Amenabar, gives us both a taste of Madrid and its faux-nihilist undertones along with a vertigo-inducing sci-fi\/fantasy flick -- an intoxicating blend of Almodovar with a twist of Serling. The abrupt end, however, left me wondering whether a sequel was being accommodated. Nevertheless, as with many memorable dreams, this one certainly ended with a jolt. The cinematography did well by not over-relying on special effects to carry the plot-line, but rather on competent lighting and angles to complement, not overwhelm, the story.To summarize, I liked 'Vanilla Sky' for introducing me to 'Abre Los Ojos' and I liked 'Abre Los Ojos' for introducing me to Amenabar -- both of which I will be viewing more of this coming year.
