At  their best, these great war films made me commiserate with the plight of  the common soldier, see the futility and the waste of war, and understand  the sacrifices made to preserve the world I live in today.All of them, however, were observed by me.  They moved me, but they were  still somehow distant.Not so with Saving Private Ryan.  From the opening frame, I was *there*.   I wasn't watching a moving tribute, I was being shot at, watching comrades  die horribly, and running for my life.  This movie will make those who've  never been to war say, My God, that's what it was really like  and any  veteran say, My God, they've finally shown the truth.  If you aren't  moved by this film, I'd venture to guess you are either cold-hearted, or a  film student who can't get past examining camera angles in order to  experience what's going on in front of your face.It was, without a doubt, the most powerful war film I've ever seen, perhaps  the most powerful *film* I've ever seen.People gripe about the plot.  Those who do, don't know much about military  protocol.  Yes, eight men might be sent to risk their lives to return one  home.  After all, it sounds like a far easier mission than it actually  turns out to be...until the chaos of a large scale military operation  enters into the picture.  Far sillier orders have been issued in every  major war in history.As for the camera work, complain about the jostling camera all you want.   There's only so much you can do to simulate the fog of war, how everything  seems slightly off-kilter when the bullets start flying and your stomach  knots up.  The Oscar for cinematography, which is a shoe-in, will be  vindication enough against the naysayers.If you absolutely can't stand gore and violence onscreen, this film is not  for you.  For anyone who can, please don't miss it. It truly is  unforgettable.It will win Spielberg his second directorial Oscar, it will win for  cinematography, it will win best picture, and Hanks will probably win for  best actor.

Saving Private Ryan shows us the experiences of those men in graphic, terrible detail, and begs the question - How could these men, no different from you or I, transcend themselves and rise to the occasion in these terribly unordinary circumstances?  This film, just as in Schindler's List (perhaps the only film of the 1990's that equals SPR's brilliance in filming and emotional intensity) demonstrates the fundamental goodness of man and the endurance of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity.  I will not go so far to say that the film is perfect - even the greatest film has flaws, and SPR is no exception - but its technical merits and sheer emotional power more than make up for any of its defects.  All in all, it is, as many have said before me, a masterpiece - a film that will be remembered by me, and hopefully by every American, for a long, long time.

The movie takes place during a giant flood and we learn pretty quickly that water where it shouldn't be is very entertaining. Simple shootouts aren't just the same when they occur in 10 feet of water. Even a band of robbers chase the hero into a school with jet-skis, or crash through a church roof in a boat.

Any graduate of 8th grade algebra remembers the associative rule. That  was the one that proved that if a = b, and b = c, then a = c. Therefo= re, The Negotiator is a movie on par with Jurassic Park  (the revenge of ILM) and Independence Day. These movies were huge summer blockbusters, but I have yet to meet anybody who would describe them as good. And of course, neither Siskel or Eibert have been quoted as saying that this movie is good either.   Hmmm. How do you spell Quote in context? Oh, I just did.   I mean, Halloween XVII (Jason vs. Rocky the Flying Squirrel) is a blockbuster Halloween Movie, but nobody is going to try to justify it's existence. It's just too bad to see great actors like Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson struggle to save this film. There's just something about the ever-tough Samuel Jackson telling his wife I love you honey, and I'm on that bus of love with you. At least Spacey is spared such tripe self-mockery in his role, though the director still struggles to develop his caring family role with a pyramid of over-used clichés.Character development is only useful if you have some idea how to do  it without splicing in lines from some 1950's screenplay. Why didn't somebody stop this when they skimmed the lines. My only thought was that somebody wanted to make this movie into a comedy, because I openly laughed at several points. I was not alone.   The worst part about The Negotiator is the fact that the action sequences are pretty good, and Spacey actually has a few good lines. The mixing of the crap with the decent parts proves frusterating, and my final impression of the movie was pity for Jackson and Spacey, who  are now asssociated with a generally poor film.Rating ?????
