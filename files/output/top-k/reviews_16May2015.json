Sometimes it seems like no matter how hard someone tries to move on from his or her current state, just can't cut a break. A few people may believe that it is a calling of higher purpose. Something of which an individual cannot or try to escape. After three prior entrees, it feels as if Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) can't find a way to unbind himself from his boxing roots. There were some words thrown around in Rocky II (1979) and the seed was finally planted in Rocky III (1982) after losing Mickey. Once Clubber Lang was defeated, it seemed as if Rocky was decisively taking a step down from his lucrative pastime or so he thought.Enter Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren in his first starring role), the heavy weight boxing champion of Soviet Russia. A man of few words whose height towers among many and has a penetrating stare. Believing that his opponent should only be Balboa, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) steps in first to face Drago. Sadly, Creed underestimates Drago and dies in an exhibition match. Looking to avenge his long time friend, Rocky decides to take the rematch to mother Russia himself. And right when Balboa thought he was about done! This installment again retains a number of key elements that help made the original such a hit but just as well misses in areas too. Once again Stallone is credited as writer\/director of which this time keeps most of the direction focused this time. Unlike Rocky III (1982) which focused on the glam of fame, this chapter returns to what made Rocky likable and that's his family, friends and how he interacts with others.Although the run time is shorter than the predecessors are, the chemistry between all the characters felt more equal than Rocky III (1982). Burt Young as Paulie still has his funny lines and Talia Shire as Adrian shows her concern for the people she cares about. Audiences even get to see Rocky interact with his son this time! For Carl Weathers, as his last appearance in the series is great to watch too. There is one specific scene where Balboa addresses Creed about him fighting Drago and whether it is worth it. The words exchanged feel meaningful and put the situation into the right perspective. Some may think otherwise though because Lundgren's character has very little to say. However, when looking at Drago from the perspective of which he grew up in, it's not like his training real gave him a reason to say much. He was trained to win and winning was all he knew. However, this does not excuse these other particularly questionable areas in the film.An example of this are two montage scenes that are supposed to be throwbacks to the past films but it's done in such a random order than it doesn't quite work. With that, the scenes feel like filler, making viewers feel like they're beginning to waste their time. Another thing that doesn't make much sense is Creed's motivation to fight Ivan Drago. Didn't Creed remember what happened to Balboa when he was so eager to fight Clubber Lang from the previous entry? When you make haste without thinking or preparing, serious consequences may come your way. Creed knows this, so why did he not remember it? The whole USA vs USSR backdrop makes sense but again, why didn't Creed prepare properly for the match? His decision was rash and it cost him dearly. Wouldn't it have been more effective (emotionally) if Rocky and Creed prepared and then Creed lost? Wouldn't that be more heartbreaking? This is something Stallone could've included in his script but (obviously) wasn't used.Another aspect that is sorely lacking is the musical score. This time the music was composed by Vince DiCola (best known for The Transformers The Movie (1986) score). This was also DiCola's first entry in the film score profession. To say that it's bad is unnecessary. In fact, DiCola actually uses the Rocky and training montage theme in his score; the problem is he doesn't utilize it to its fullest capacity. Instead, the themes are hinted at only briefly. Other than that, the rest of the tunes belong to synth orchestration, which doesn't really fit the Rocky series except for the occasional pop song. With Bill Conti's signature piano, string and horn absent there aren't enough instruments for the audience to get attached to per scene. Even the emotional scenes aren't as effective as they could've been because the score doesn't match. However, the film isn't devoid of entertainment. The fight scenes are still lively. Lundgren and Stallone really throw the punches in this entry. Plus cinematography by again Bill Butler worked at its job. Once you do a certain job for so long you end not having to change much. Butler has maintained a consistent look in the Rocky series and he hasn't disappointed yet.This entry is fairly equal to Rocky III (1982), it just has problems in other areas. The writing and direction is a tad better which focuses more on its characters than it does fame and glory and Dolph Lundgren's debut is nothing short of good entertainment. However, it still suffers from unnecessary scenes, a contradictory motivation for Creed and a disappointing musical score, which unfortunately lacked the Bill Conti touch.

If you are in a small room with eight or ten 8 feet tall 300 pound acid bags and you start machine gunning and shooting grenades at them what would happen to everyone? That is right, THEY WOULD ALL DIE. Yes, gallons of molecular acid would be spraying like fountains all over everything; covering all our heroes and melting them. Jim, please watch the original. Then of course we have the cooling system conveniently located right next to the Aliens so they weaponry is useless. Again, same problem acid would be spraying out of their bodies; imagine hitting one with a grenade; hey, good idea, as Hudson would say.I defer to the earlier great reviewer of a military man; Marines do not talk like this. Jim has evidently been beat up by military people. He has such a chip on his shoulder; does everyone remember THE ABYSS? Do you know how long a hand to hand fight between Virgil and a SEAL Team leader would last? Yes, about five seconds. The tall fat man would have been ten more seconds for leverage. Does Jim know how many men wash out before even becoming a SEAL not to mention a team leader? The dialogue is typical Cameron brain dead juvenile crap. This is not a sequel to ALIEN. It is True Lies and ALIEN put into a blender; this is what you end up with mass audience pablum. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it worth seeing? yes. Just turn your brain off and the volume way, way down. The whole Ripley into female Rambo thing not working. These are MARINES they do not fall to pieces and all gather around Ripley to hold their little hands and tell them what to do. We even have to endure, Ripley Jr., Newt also more calm then our terrified marines. Give me a big break. It features some of the worst lines recorded onto a film soundtrack, basically every time Hudson speaks. Finally, the aliens kill him off but not before we had to listen to him being a whiny crybaby; what an insult to the Marines!!Let's look at the most heralded scene in the movie the confrontation between the Queen and Ripley. What are the Alien's reflexes like? Did Jim watch Parker try to charge the Alien in the original? How did that go? How long before the Queen impaled Ripley through the side with its reflexes? Yes, about 5 seconds. I agree with earlier reviews; try explosive decompression and have a 400 pound queen hanging on to your leg. Trust me it is not going to go well. My main complaint is that it is a James Cameron movie NOT a sequel to Alien. The giant plot holes, hammy acting, cheesy 4th grade dialogue and the hyper feminism that within the context of trained killers like Marines gives the film such a lack of verisimilitude. Alien was a work of art, better acting, better script, better direction; this is mass audience action crap. Entertaining, yes, but utterly brain dead and stupid.

This is what differentiates older classic films with today's ADD gore and action festivals for the brain dead. I laughed at some of the earlier reviews that labeled this as slow. See, we used to like to get to know our characters; then you care what happens to them. The by play between Parker and Brett by two great character actors is the needed levity to lighten this very dark film. Also, notice the acting, a great ensemble Scott put together here carried by English veteran's Hurt and Holm. Young directors need to watch this film as a template of how to make a great film.The use of slowly showing more and more of the Alien is a much imitated feature of this classic but it has never been done this well ever. Ridley used the old technique of radio; let the viewer's imaginations supply more terror than the limited effects of the day were able to provide. Today's films leave nothing to the imagination; this is one of the main reasons they are so dreadfully boring. If you couple this with no character development and bad acting you understand why Hollywood is losing a fortune at the box office. We see progressive shots of the Alien, a little more every time building suspense and interest. Look at the scene of Dallas in the air ducts; today the alien would grab him blood would spray all over scene done. Scott uses the voice of Skeritt with growing alarm mirrored by his team monitoring him. The music, the visuals of slime on the floor, running from the fittings how the scene is developed to a crescendo with the music simply, Ridley Scott's best scene on film, period. Again, when Lambert is killed what would we see today? Alien would grab her she would be impaled, blood would spray scene over. BORING. Scott uses visual clips; we see it bent over her, cut out, cut back straightens up to 8 feet tall, the spiked tail going behind her; yet, when she is killed we see nothing WE ONLY HEAR. Again, our imaginations, you know that thing inside of your head, supplies images that the effects people were unable to. Even if they could it would never have the dramatic impact. The chest exploding scene, which evoked minor protests in 1979, made many people run for the bathroom in 1979. Scott never told his actors what was going to happen; that is real fear on their faces. The gradual buildup to the revelation that Ash is a company robot and has been protecting the Alien right along; compare this to Fassbender's overrated acclaim in Prometheus. There is no comparison acting wise Ian Holm can out act Fassbender on his worst day. Notice how Holm does not prattle on like David; you come to notice that he only cares about the alien and could not give a crap about anything else. David chatters about, watches old movies; in short, there is no comparison. The scene in the pod where the alien's hand pops out had popcorn flying all over the cinema in 1979; drop dead scary. The visuals in the film are on the Sergio Leone level of excellence. Goldsmith's score coupled with the beating heart soundtrack will scare the living crap out of you. There are several pop out scares in odd places so that you never really relax at all the first time you see it. In my opinion, the best American film of the 20th century far superior to the Godfather. It will be here long after we are all gone.

This is what differentiates older classic films with today's ADD gore and action festivals for the brain dead. I laughed at some of the earlier reviews that labeled this as slow. See, we used to like to get to know our characters; then you care what happens to them. The by play between Parker and Brett by two great character actors is the needed levity to lighten this very dark film. Also, notice the acting, a great ensemble Scott put together here carried by English veteran's Hurt and Holm. Young directors need to watch this film as a template of how to make a great film.The use of slowly showing more and more of the Alien is a much imitated feature of this classic but it has never been done this well ever. Ridley used the old technique of radio; let the viewer's imaginations supply more terror than the limited effects of the day were able to provide. Today's films leave nothing to the imagination; this is one of the main reasons they are so dreadfully boring. If you couple this with no character development and bad acting you understand why Hollywood is losing a fortune at the box office. We see progressive shots of the Alien, a little more every time building suspense and interest. Look at the scene of Dallas in the air ducts; today the alien would grab him blood would spray all over scene done. Scott uses the voice of Skeritt with growing alarm mirrored by his team monitoring him. The music, the visuals of slime on the floor, running from the fittings how the scene is developed to a crescendo with the music simply, Ridley Scott's best scene on film, period. Again, when Lambert is killed what would we see today? Alien would grab her she would be impaled, blood would spray scene over. BORING. Scott uses visual clips; we see it bent over her, cut out, cut back straightens up to 8 feet tall, the spiked tail going behind her; yet, when she is killed we see nothing WE ONLY HEAR. Again, our imaginations, you know that thing inside of your head, supplies images that the effects people were unable to. Even if they could it would never have the dramatic impact. The chest exploding scene, which evoked minor protests in 1979, made many people run for the bathroom in 1979. Scott never told his actors what was going to happen; that is real fear on their faces. The gradual buildup to the revelation that Ash is a company robot and has been protecting the Alien right along; compare this to Fassbender's overrated acclaim in Prometheus. There is no comparison acting wise Ian Holm can out act Fassbender on his worst day. Notice how Holm does not prattle on like David; you come to notice that he only cares about the alien and could not give a crap about anything else. David chatters about, watches old movies; in short, there is no comparison. The scene in the pod where the alien's hand pops out had popcorn flying all over the cinema in 1979; drop dead scary. The visuals in the film are on the Sergio Leone level of excellence. Goldsmith's score coupled with the beating heart soundtrack will scare the living crap out of you. There are several pop out scares in odd places so that you never really relax at all the first time you see it. In my opinion, the best American film of the 20th century far superior to the Godfather. It will be here long after we are all gone.

However, the themes and stuff they talked about is worth watching this movie for so much so that I preferred the way they talked about it here then they did in other similar movies like Blade Runner.The animation to this movie is very striking and beautiful, at least for the tone they're going for. It is worth the movie if you enjoy animation as well. It really looks good in this movie. So I would say if what you're looking for is a well done anime\/sci-fi semi-action movie with something intelligent to say then I would suggest it if you can look past the near-gratuitous fan service.

Mind you, I'm not necessarily talking about its theatrical value, but as its quality as a genuine martial arts movie, opposed to just an action movie with kicks. It's not the only film to attain this distinction, but the fact that it manages to do so on an adult level with a mixed cast of both acclaimed and (at the time) forthcoming stars qualifies it as the grown-up version of THE KARATE KID. If this means little or nothing to you, I advise you stop reading this review, but if you believe that the fighting arts can positively affect your life and that a good movie can be made of this concept, read on.The story A team of professional martial artists must master themselves under the tutelage of a tough coach (James Earl Jones) en-route to representing the United States in the national championships and an all-or-nothing battle against the formidable Korean national team.I won't deny that the movie strays into B-grade territory every now and again. Though the rest of its fights take place on the mat in a professional capacity, the film affords itself one bar brawl, similar to something you'd see in a Van Damme movie (albeit with six Jean-Claudes instead of one). The script seriously neglects at least one of the main supporting characters (David Sonny Agresta), and the inclusion of one main character (Sally Kirkland of Anna as James Earl Jones' co-trainer) is unnecessary. With that said, the movie features surprisingly strong acting for any kind of martial arts film. The cast list includes no less than three Oscar-nominees in pivotal roles (Jones, Sally Kirkland, and Eric Roberts), and while they're not giving the performances of a lifetime, they and the others are way beyond adequate. Jones' booming voice and Eric Roberts' emotional mini-speeches readily stand out as things that would have been difficult to pull off with a lesser cast and script and immediately set it apart from wannabe films that focused more on fighting.The fighting is worth more than half a glance, however. As the freshman outing of fight choreographer and quasi-villain Simon Rhee, the series of matches are a celebration of traditional tae kwon do, emphasizing realistic forms. The fighters are mostly real-life practitioners and collectively good, but I find myself appreciating the husky and uncharacteristically-cast Chris Penn almost more than the rest, as he goes to show that you do not have to be physically toned to excel at throwing kicks. There are a couple training scenes about, with the fights polarized to the first and fourth quarters of the film, and yet the martial arts are the subliminal driving point of the story. Each of the major characters has clasped onto a single aspect of them for Phillip Tommy Rhee, it's personal desire and sacrifice; for John Virgil Dye, it's the spiritual aspect; for Chris Travis Penn it's the building of confidence; and so on. Throughout the movie, the characters grasp additional aspects, therein becoming better people regardless of whether they win or lose their end matches. Some of the situations these concepts are demonstrated in can be hammy, but the emotional truth is untainted. The movie sets an upstanding example.Director Robert Radler would dedicate a good number of future martial arts flicks, but none with the emotional and dramatic worth of this, his magnum opus. I can honestly say that I can't think of a serious karate film buff who ought to be without this little gem - it's that good, even after two decades of future films to compare it to.

The actors shine, the story is compelling, and the directing is incredible. Frank Darabont truly outdid himself with this masterpiece.Tim Robbins' is truly convincing as Andy Dufresne, in a role that would truly define his career. We see an innocent man thrust into an unfair situation, who maintains hope to keep himself moving and that hope itself will become contagious. Morgan Freeman steels the show as Red, his partner in crime. Freeman brings to this film a sense of thoughtfulness, a sort of diamond in the rough that is prison. He may not be perfect but he is wise, no man could have pulled off this role quite like Freeman did. Too much do we forget Bob Gunton in the role of the sinister Warden Samuel Norton. We are both terrified and disgusted by him as he skirts the law and abuses his inmates in an effort to stay at the very top.The violence and the nature of some of the inmates is worth noting as it portrays prison accurately. In films like Cool Hand Luke we see how these chain gang members are portrayed as sort of good old boys who merely made a mistake. With characters like Boggs Diamond we receive a visceral reminder of what prison life is really like, and we accompany Andy on his ride through it.

But this one is special. If you've read any of my reviews, one of my key points in the creation of any great film is the CASTING, and this is a prime example. With few exceptions, the acting was first-rate, in every way. The two leads, headed by a extremely capable Michael Nouri and a fabulous Kyle MacLachlan, were noteworthy, with Nouri as the world-weary detective, and MacLachan's nuanced, tortured role adding a dimension of scenic truth and pathos to the entire production. I've always been a fan of Michael Nouri, and his easy, believable performances never fail, a worthy counterpoint to this highly interesting mix of protagonists. But what impressed me the most about this film was that it clearly had heart, a tender through line of humanity and dare I say it, LOVE, that runs continuously through this piece, without ever getting in the way. How many scifi action movies can claim the same thing? The scene at the end makes me tear up every time. The thoughtful score by Michael Convertino added in full measure to the uniqueness of this film. If The Hidden isn't already isn't a classic of science fiction, it certainly will be.

The life of Jim Morrison is a complicated one and it would be very hard transferring it to film. Stone gets many things right and also gets things wrong. First I have to talk about Kilmer's great portrayal of Morrison. They really tried to make him look as close as possible to Jim Morrison and they did a great job. Kilmer's singing was also very impressive and he managed to sound very close to Morrison. This biopic takes place in a six year period from the Band's beginnings and successes to Morrison's death in Paris during the summer of 1971. While many parts of the film did actually happen a lot of it did not as there are many historical inaccuracies throughout. It seems like that is many people's main issue with this movie, it got the portrayal of Morrison wrong. In the movie, he is shown always having a bottle in his hand while in reality and according to Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger this was simply not true. Many other inaccuracies are peppered throughout the film so make sure to take what you see with a grain of salt. Where this movie really shines though, is the music! All of the Doors' classics are here such as L.A. Woman, Light my Fire, The End, Moonlight Drive, and many others. The other interesting thing about this biopic is the setting of 1960 in which the movie shows the counterculture of America and the affect the Vietnam War had on people. So, while Stone's The Doors doesn't really tell the truth about the band I think it does a damn good job at telling a story. I don't really think I could give this movie a rating because I wouldn't even know if a number could justify this movie. (I'm not saying the movie is great just hard to give a score to.)

Harper Lee's novel is so touching and powerful that it would've been a shame if the film didn't do it justice, but after 50 years I can honestly say that it holds up as a true classic. The story is told through the point of view of a young innocent girl who sees her attorney father as a hero and that is what makes this story so easy to engage with. It's a film that focuses on social injustice and it is told through an innocent child's perspective which gives it a fresh spin. The courtroom scene is powerful and moving, but everything that leads up to it is also very fascinating. Watching the children play and gossip about their mysterious neighbor is sort of a parable for the social injustice that the story tackles on later in the film. It's as if Lee were trying to show us how primitive and childish society had become during that time of racial segregation. The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Mulligan and perfectly adapted by Horton Foote. After I return from my vacations I will try to write a more thoughtful and insightful review, but for now I wanted to point out some of my initial thoughts about this inspiring movie. I can finally understand why this is Clark Kent's favorite movie because Aticcus FInch is simply the personification of that superhero.

That's why I love this film is for the soundtrack which is enough to watch the filmThis is one of my favorite vampire movies and it still showcase what a vampire film is suppose to beSo what if this is not the best film in the world it's still a good film to me the soundtrack is superb I give Queen Of The Damned an 8 out of 10 ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"16 May 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Before I review Queen Of The Damned I want to make something for the record to be clear, I never read any of Anne Rice's books that this film is based off.So that could explain why I did enjoy this film if I had read the book before viewing the film I might have felt differently however again I'm one of those movie fans who looks past the junk and see the treasure and if you watch this film with a open mind you might find some good to it while it isn't a classic it still enjoyable to me.The film plot centers around Lestat (Stuart Townsend) who has awaken for the first time in years to begin his raise as a rock star. Along his journey he meets Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) who after getting a hold of his journal from David Talbot (Paul McGann) begins to become curious about Lestat begins to look for him only for him to find her. However he is unaware that he is about to awake the mother of all vampires Akasha (Aaliyah) with his music and wants to bring hell to Earth.Also the film takes us to where Lestat becomes a vampire thanks to Marius (Vincent Perez) as he begins to teach Lestat about the life of a vampire. Queen Of The Damned actually took plots from The Vampire Lestat And Queen Of The Damned. And This was Aaliyah's last film before her death and it's sad that we didn't see her much in the film but the scenes she took part in she really shine as the antagonist. Akasha was pure evil with no compassion for life. She ranks up there as one of the most evil villains I have seen and in my opinion of the best things about this film.Lestat being played by Townsend I actually enjoy his performance better as the anti-hero, plus Marguerite's performance as Jesse made it interesting for her.The movie best feature is the soundtrack which I remember buying in 2002 before I saw the film, the soundtrack is one of my most favorite movie soundtracks with my favorite song begin Forsaken sung by David Draiman of Disturbed which I felt set the tone and story of the movie.

It doesn't deserve its rating. The film has some great elements. Elements that were truly groundbreaking at the time. The set design is spectacular. The soundtrack is brilliant. And the film on the whole is fun, entertaining and full of endless charm.However it gets let down by the story and the characters, The plot is rarely coherent. The characters are weak. They do illogical things that are completely at odds with who they are supposed to be. The manner in which Goldfinger treats Bond is completely ridiculous. And before you all disregard this review through rose-tinted spectacles you should know that I loved this film and everything about 007 when I was 10.

Not only did this film offend so many historical facts about 19th century south- west, it portrayed a homo-erotic trio between Billy the Kid, Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) and Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) that was reduced to the worst kind of camp comedy utterly boring.I won't waste your time by commenting on the plot, except to say it was simply ridiculous. (For a brief few seconds, I considered the possibility that Hughes had produced a clever satire, like 1974's Blazing Saddles. Forgetaboutit!) On the other hand, the final confrontation between Garrett and Holliday is so unintentionally funny I was rolling in my seat, holding my ribs. That was the high point in this movie for me. The rest of it is snore city.To be kind, the acting was just adequate for a high school stage play. The direction by Hughes proved he knew more about playing with aircraft than crafting plays. The editing must have been done by a blind six-year old; one scene, for example, ended on a door - for over twenty seconds! The musical score, by Tchaikovsky, was too intrusive, too loud and inappropriate for most of the scenes.Of course, as many know, this movie was made to showcase Jane Russell in her first role and, incidentally, to introduce Jack Buetel in his first movie also. Only the addition of the two stalwarts, Huston and Mitchell, allowed this effort to provide the necessary comic relief - such as it was. Those two must have been paid an awful lot of dough to appear in this turkey.Added all up, though, this movie could easily be labeled as the worst western in movie history (though that accolade, IMHO, still remains with 1969's Mackenna's Gold). However, as it is billed as 'comedy' first, I guess it wins the honor of being the worst comedy I've ever seen. Frankly, I don't recommend this movie to anybody except critics willing to give up another two hours of their life to say I survived The Outlaw!

As a big fan of Stephen King , I can say that The Green Mile is one of my favorite books ever. In it (and in the movie of course) the reader can find everything good and evil, love and pain, the significance and insignificance of life and so many, many things.
