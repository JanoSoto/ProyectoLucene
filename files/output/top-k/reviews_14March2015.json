The film was not the first of the found footage genre but it is nevertheless an incredibly innovative film. The information about the Blair Witch and Rustin Parr is related to the audience early in the film through interviews with the people of Burkittsville, most of whom dismiss the stories about the Witch as nothing more than a local legend. This is a very clever idea as most towns have stories about ghosts which few take seriously. For instance, there is a castle not two miles from where I live which is supposedly haunted! The stories are regarded by Heather, Josh and Mike as cool material for their documentary but nothing more than that, certainly not as a warning for things to come. It foreshadows their later trouble for the audience but not the characters.The writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were able to give a new spin to a very old idea that what you don't see is more frightening than what you do. This technique is used repeatedly and very effectively in the film with the noises that the characters hear at night. Several of these scenes take place in almost complete darkness, adding to the effect. The film was made on the cheap over a mere eight days and features no real special effects, instead relying on humanity's ancient and instinctual fear of the unknown to provide its scares rather than digitally rendered gods and monsters. Things like the weird, life size stick figures are enough to creep us out!The three lead actors Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams - who all use their real names - shot almost all of the film personally. They were given an outline of the plot but improvised the dialogue themselves. They interrupt each other and occasionally stumble over their words, giving the film a wonderfully authentic quality. This is helped by the fact that Heather, Josh and Mike all have flaws and seem like real people. None of them are especially pleasant people to begin with. As their situations worsens, we see them all go through waves of anger, upset and hysteria to the point that they're borderline unstable. Many of us would try to deny it but I think that 99% of people would react the same way. The fact that Heather keeps recording when logic would dictate that they drop the camera is explained by the fact that it helps her to cope. I would ditch it the first chance that I got but I can well imagine other people holding on to it for the same reason as Heather. There isn't a single part of their behaviour that doesn't ring true. Roger Ebert compared her wonderfully acted (and later much parodied!) apology to the camera to Robert Scott's final diary entries before he froze to death in the Antarctic and I think that that says it best.I don't usually comment on the promotional side of films but I think that it is worth mentioning in this case. It was one of the first films to be very heavily marketed on the Internet, something which we take for granted today but was groundbreaking in its day. A mockumentary - which, oddly enough, I had seen - was made to promote the film as were several tie-in websites concerning Burkittsville and the police investigation into the disappearances. It was essentially an attempt to do deliberately online what Orson Welles had done accidentally on the radio in 1938. It led to numerous debates as to whether the film was fiction or an actual documentary. We were all far too young to (officially!) see the film but I remember talking about with my friends in school at the time. This kind of campaign would probably not work in 2015 but it was a fantastic idea in 1999.

This is a story as explosive as his blazing automatics . Womanizer Sam Sapade is a two-fisted and cynical private detective operating in the big city . When his secretary tells him the new customer (Mary Astor) waiting outside his office is a knockout, he wastes no time before seeing her. It turns out she's a knockout with money. And she wants to spend it on his services as a private detective . This lovely dame with dangerous lies employs the services of the notorious private detective . She has some story about wanting to protect her sister. Neither he nor his partner, Miles Archer, believes it. But with the money she's paying, who cares? The job proves to be more dangerous than either of them expected. It involves not just the lovely dame with the dangerous lies, but also the sweaty Casper Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet) , the fey Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) , and the thuggish young Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr) . Three crooks, and all of them are looking for the statuette of a black bird they call the Maltese Falcon . Spade is quickly caught up in the mystery and intrigue of a statuette known as the Maltese Falcon . As Sam fights to get hold of a black bird ¨the stuff that dreams are made¨ (a line suggested by Humphrey Bogart was voted as the #14 movie quote by the American Film Institute) . This first-rate and entertaining picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows Dashiell Hammett's book fairly closely otherwise , he also wrote ¨The thin man¨. Twisted film Noir about murders , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the novel ¨The Maltese Falcon¨¨and screen-written by the same Huston . Frustrated at seeing his script for Juárez (1939) rewritten by Paul Muni, the film's star, John Huston vowed that from then on he would direct his own screenplays and therefore not have to see them get meddled with. He was fortunate in that he had a staunch ally in the form of producer Henry Blanke who was happy to fulfill Huston's wish. Word-for-word and scene-for-scene virtually the same as the original novel. It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail .The climactic confrontation scene lasts nearly 20 minutes, one-fifth of the entire running time of the film. It involves all five principal characters, and filming required over one full week . Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the tough-talking P.I. Although George Raft was originally cast as Sam Spade , he allegedly turned it down because it was not an important picture, taking advantage of a clause in his contract that said he did not have to work on remakes . For decades this film could not be legally shown on US television stations because of its underlying suggestions of illicit sexual activity among the characters (i.e., O'Shaughnessy's promiscuity, indications that Joel Cairo was a homosexual). Much of the movie is filmed over Humphrey Bogart's shoulder so that the audience can be in on his point of view. His scenes with Mary Astor are awesome and at their best compared to those he subsequently shared with Lauren Bacall in ¨Dark passage¨ , ¨Key Largo¨ , ¨The big sleep¨ and ¨To have and to have not¨ . The couple Bogart-Astor throws in enough sparks to ignite several lighters . This was the first pairing of cynical Humphrey Bogart and Femme Fatale Mary Astor . Mary Astor's off-screen notoriety was instrumental in her casting , she had been in several scandals concerning affairs she had been involved in during her marriage. And she was having an affair with John Huston during the making of the film. Magnificent support cast , here was the first pairing of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, who would go on to make nine more movies together. Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by Arthur Edeson and magnificent musical score by the classic Adolph Deutsch . And also shown in horrible computer-colored version . The motion picture was masterfully directed by John Huston ; filming was completed in two months at a cost of less than $300,000. A former version in 1931 by Roy Del Ruth , it was also pretty good starred by Bebe Daniels as Ruth Wonderly , Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade , Dudley Digges as Casper Gutman and Una Merkel as Effie Perine . In fact , Warner Bros. planned to change the name of the film to The Gent from Frisco because the novel's title had already been used for this The Maltese Falcon (1931) , the studio eventually agreed to keep the original title at John Huston's insistence.
