Emmet WalshREVIEW BY JOHN ULMERSteve Martin had basically gained a burst of fame before starring in Carl Reiner's wacky comedy The Jerk. Martin was fresh off hosting Saturday Night Live a few times, and had made a few albums and stand-up gigs. But The Jerk is what established him as an on-screen comedian.Martin plays a lame-brain fool, who lives with his family on a plantation farm. Only one problem. His family is black, he is white. After coming to facts about his racial status, Martin flees from the scene and heads for the downtown gig. He is suckered out of - and into - many things throughout the film. Not as much of because he is innocent as he is dumb, however. Unlike comedies like Blast From the Past where the main character is treated bad and doesn't realize it because he\/she is innocent and has no idea what to expect from life, Martin gets treated bad and doesn't realize it because he is stupid, not only because he is innocent.The Jerk starts out working at a gas station. Some of the funniest scenes occur here. One, is when a madman with a sniper rifle is shooting at Martin and misses. Martin, being The Jerk, thinks the man is purposely shooting at paint cans. He says, Hey! It's the cans! He must hate the cans! Stay away from the cans! Another is when he gets a home...living in a bathroom. (Like it? I LOVE it!) And one that has always gotten my funnybone is when Martin looks in a phone book and sees his name. I'm a person now! He yells. This is true, of course. All of us feel like more than just skin after seeing our names printed somewhere. I recall first seeing my name as a reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes. It feels great to have your name written somewhere, because you know that someone, somewhere, saw that name and put it in. Someone read one of my movie reviews. Though Martin's character takes it to a new extreme, it is nevertheless true. When you sign your name on a document, the document becomes active and real. So why should it not be the same with Martin's character? Perhaps while he is a jerk, he is at the same time smart. Nah, he's just stupid.The Jerk carved a place for itself in history. I had really never seen any comedy like it before. Airplane was released the same year, and the humor was much the same, as well as the editing (see below), but I saw The Jerk first, and it was an odd surprise. The humor is by itself. It is so odd and original that it makes it one of the best. Martin went on to make the less-successful The Man with Two Brains, also directed by Reiner. The film is much the same, but does not work to the same degree. Too many jokes fall flat. Unlike The Jerk, where the jokes start to fall flat in the middle and pick up again at the end, The Man with Two Brains had its hit-and-misses almost the whole way through. It was a fine comedy, but not great at all.Steve Martin brings his character to life. He is one of the absolute dumbest, innocent, naive individuals I have ever seen on screen. But what makes him work so well is Martin. Martin behind it all. But the thing is, Martin dissolves himself completely into character. He is so stupid that you can't help but laugh. In The Naked Gun (1988) Leslie Nielsen used a dumb character and played him smart, deadpan, serious. Like everything he was saying and doing was normal. Martin does the same, but in a different way. He doesn't play him deadpan and smart. He plays a dumb character dumb, having no idea what he is saying and doing is wrong. And another interesting aspect is that even though Martin disguises himself as The Jerk, we can still see Martin shining through. Martin can play versatile actors (see Planes, Trains and Automobiles - 1987), but Martin is still inside. We can see him shining through. That is why Steve Martin is one of my favorite comedians. He can envelop his character, yet at the same time keep the Martin charm. That's why I can usually expect solid laughs from a Martin vehicle.Director Carl Reiner does a few out-of-place cuts in The Jerk, just like he did in The Man with Two Brains, but I think that it worked overall. Part of what makes this movie so funny and goofy is how the editing is so odd. So many scenes are out of place and pay nothing to the film. But like I said, that is what makes it so original and stupid.The film loses some steam halfway through, and the jokes sometimes fall flat, but overall the comedy is one of the best of its genre. I would say it is Martin's best comedy, but that spot is saved for Planes, Trains and Automobiles which co-stars John Candy. THAT movie is Steve Martin's best, and always will be. Overall, The Jerk is one of the most original, wacky, and wild and crazy (Martin reference intended) comedies ever. See it for laughs, plain and simple.

In fact I've always held a vague annoyance with the D&D playing type.  I felt that they propagated the stereotypical and negative geek-in-their-parents-basement image that seems to be assigned to anyone with an interest with comic books, even if they never touched a D&D card in their life. That said, I'm well aware that not every D&D player falls into the stereotype the collective has earned. So what possible  reason would I have to check the Dungeons and Dragons movie?One reason Zoe McLellan.  She's been a guest star on two of my favorite television shows-Star Trek Voyager and The Invisible Man-and I wanted to see what other work she had done.  After watching the movie I think I can safely say, bias or not, that Zoe gives the best performance of anyone in the film. Why was the movie hardly wonderful? The answer may lie in the fact that it was director Courtney Solomon's first film.  The documentary on the making of the film featured on the DVD was very informative.  Solomon basically says that he skiped film school and just went out and tried to make a movie.  As someone who has an interest in film I respect and admire anyone who goes out and makes it happen for themselves, but it's not worth much if you shoot yourself in the foot on your first outing.  Perhaps film school would not have been such a waste of time after all...The film opens with a brief voice over which explains where we are and what's going on.  Director Soloman calls this the Star Wars approach and feels that it was the best way to go.  Let me tell you, the man wasn't kidding about taking a Star Wars approach.  When I first saw Ridley, Justin Whalin's character, I thought Han Solo.  His get up looked suspiciously like that of a certain rebel smuggler.  Ok, I though, maybe just a coincidence. After all, Marlon Wayans doesn't really fit the Chewbacca profile.  But my suspicions quickly returned when Ridley began to interact with Zoe McLellan's Marina.  Bickering reminiscent of that between Han and Leia.  Or an attempt at it, at least.Continuing with the Harrison Ford theme, Ridley finds himself at one point navigating a maze which is not much more than a combination of some famous obstacles once faced by a certain Indiana Jones.  Specifically, the maze involves these scenarios The first section has swinging axes that fall from the ceiling when you break a beam of light; Indy met a similar trap in the cave at the beginning of Raiders.  Secondly is a room with tiles. Step on the wrong ones, and the walls emit huge plumes of fire. Indy nearly bit the dust in The Last Crusade when he forgot how to spell Jehovah and stepped on the wrong tile.  After this, Ridley faces a room where spikes come down from above, threatening to impale him. Sound familiar? Yep, Indy and his pal Short Round were saved from a pointy death by Willie in Temple of Doom. When he successfully navigates these perils, Ridley enters the room that contains his prize sitting on a pedestal, just like the gold head statue at the beginning of Raiders.  Oh, but there's more.  At one point in the maze a spike nearly impales Ridley. His reaction?  A slant of the head and a lop-sided grin pure Harrison Ford. Ridley later retrieves another artifact that is protected by an ages old being not unlike the saint guarding the Holy Grain in The Last Crusade.  If you're wondering how this happened, Solomon gives us the answer. The maze was designed by George Gibbs, who was the mechanical effects supervisor on Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade.  It would appear that Mr. Gibbs was feeling nostalgic.The performances by the heros are not great by any means, but they do have their moments. I thought Marlon Wayans spent a lot of time sounding like Chris Tucker's character from The Fifth Element, all that high pitched screaming and squawking.  The villains however were downright pathetic.  Jeremy Irons portrays the worst evil wizard.  He's like something out of an episode of the Power Rangers.  Bruce Payne gets a demotion from main villain in Highlander Endgame to the  second in command lackey in Dungeons and Dragons.  He was ok in Highlander, but his performance here is terrible. And he wears blue lipstick. Why?  Who knows. Maybe he likes it.Dungeons and Dragons never had a chance from the word go.

I thought Marlon Wayans spent a lot of time sounding like Chris Tucker's character from The Fifth Element, all that high pitched screaming and squawking.  The villains however were downright pathetic.  Jeremy Irons portrays the worst evil wizard.  He's like something out of an episode of the Power Rangers.  Bruce Payne gets a demotion from main villain in Highlander Endgame to the  second in command lackey in Dungeons and Dragons.  He was ok in Highlander, but his performance here is terrible. And he wears blue lipstick. Why?  Who knows. Maybe he likes it.Dungeons and Dragons never had a chance from the word go.  A virgin director, too much so-so CGI (I'm of the opinion that if you can't afford it, don't try to use it at all), and a weak script that attempted to combine Star Wars and Indiana Jones with Dungeons and Dragons mixed in. After all, that's what the movie was supposed to be about.  Whether I like fantasy or not, and my personal opinion about D&D gamers aside, this movie had much more potential, but it falls flat on its face, largely I suspect, because of the director.

I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here.  But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color.  The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented.  The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's.  Now, this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this movie are all too wrong.  The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly on Marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character.  The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrific events take place in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.The second problem is the lighting.  This is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction.  Most of the scenes are very brightly lit, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at NIGHT!Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance.  Yes, he does pull off Norman Bate's awkwardness and madness quite well, I don't deny him that. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show  the softness.  There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character, at least at first, which then fades away once we realize the truth about him.  Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS!!!!There are a few good aspects of this film.  Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates.  Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but, unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film, Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits.I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel.  I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because, after seeing this film, that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen.  There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original, and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax.  So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way.  Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow.  Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.In other words, my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said.  Like everyone else here, I reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original.

For the money? well, you say, it won him the Academy Award. Granted, this role didn't cast the slightest shadow on his reputation, but it proves how important the script and the director are, once again. When one considers this film in the context of Asphalt, with its dead-on script, penetrating insight into the human condition and sterling (pun intended) performances by lesser known actors; and Witness, with its stylized and literate script, and its superstar cast (partially against character,making it all the more meaty), each bringing a lifetime of personality to the role, one can only say that the director oof Reversal, whose name I cannot remember, must have stifled his Newport cast with invisible pillows. Not only was the family dysfunctional, but the script gave nothing for even the children to do as part of daily life, except revive their mother time and again after being summoned by their robotic step-father.

All I can say about that first viewing is that it really gave me shivers...years later (five days ago), I got the Criterion DVD by mail, which I ordered from Ebay. I watched it and was really disturbed. Then, I listened to the audio commentary by the director, David Cronenberg, which also directed pretty great films such as Crash, Naked Lunch, and eXistenZ. The commentary itself is worth the DVD's price (even though it can be hard to find because it is out of print). It really helps understanding Cronenberg's vision of every scene, and believe me, he brings many nuances and psychological details, even though Jeremy Irons' acting is awesome and really eloquent and meaningful. The film is about two twins, Elliott and Beverly (both played by the fantastic Jeremy Irons) who are gynecologists and discover that some women suffer from mutations in their uterus. Besides their work, these two twins are pretty much the same person...at least, on the outside (they live in the same apartment, they have the same job, they even share the same women!)...on the inside, it's different, and that's what we discover when the disturbing mind of Beverly unfolds before our eyes and hearts.Cronenberg is ambitious. Like he said, most of the films that feature twins are comedies or thrillers in which one of the twins is good and fights his evil brother. He takes a very different approach and focuses on the complexes and psychological flaws that having a twin could create. Personally, if I had a twin and saw this film, it would completely change my life. This film goes deep. From the introduction where you see them when they're just young boys to the heartbreaking and disturbing ending, you see Elliott, the one that gets the honors, the one that had a lot of women in his life, the one that manipulates people, the one that is strong, briefly said. In the other hand, you've got Beverly, the drug addict, the one that gets his first real relationship, the one that somehow follows his brother, without ever being number one. Cronenberg exploits this complex trouble and analyzes the competition that can occur between twins, the incredibly fundamental union between the two brothers. Also, Cronenberg shows us Beverly turning completely insane, and explores the very deep faces of his deranged mind. Cronenberg is a good director, saying the opposite would be a lie. This film probably isn't considered his best, but in my opinion, it is, or at least, it is equal to his best films. His directing is creepy and moody, while not very slow-paced. He really delivers a disturbing and terrifying film, with such a deep exploration of the mind. The acting is exceptional, especially from Jeremy Irons. I mean, these roles were not easy at all, and he plays two at the same time...in many scenes he has to talk to himself, and he uses completely different and appropriate facial expressions and tones for every line one of the twins says, without ever exaggerating. When I was twelve, I didn't know this actor, and I would have never been able to tell you there was only one actor playing these two. Genevieve Bujold is good, not perfect, but good enough. But Irons is really a great actor. Many sequences of this film are haunting, especially the dream sequence, which is obviously very symbolic, but also very intense. The whole scenes in which Beverly falls into insanity are handled with genius by Cronenberg and Irons. Also, the scene where Elliott dances with his girlfriend and invites his brother to dance with them. It shows how influential and seductive Elliott is to his twin. The music is haunting too. It is beautiful and scary and really fits with the atmosphere of the film. Overall, Cronenberg made a beautiful yet extremely disturbing study of the twins phenomenon and the psychological impact on them. Also, he put in images the idea he has about the link between them.

The reason I can't bring myself to dislike Forever is the actors.  Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey are guys that I love watching, and I still follow their careers by seeing their movies.  The obvious question now arises Why did a gang of such accomplished actors give us such sub par performances.  The answer is equally obvious Joel Shumacher. The studio wanted a lighter Batman movie after Burton's dark Batman Returns, which I feel is the best film in the series.  Therefore, Shumacher set out to make Forever as a hybrid of the campy 60's tv series and Burton's dark vision.  I think he accomplishes it to some degree, but I can't help but think what could have been if it was Burton who had taken on the characters, specifically Two-Face.  Face is a classic Batman villain in that he's a direct mirror Batman\/Bruce Wayne.  Unfortunately most of the significance of this is lost because of Shumacher's direction. I enjoy Val Kilmer therefore I like him as Batman, but he would have been a much more worthy successor to Keaton had the direction of the movie been different.  I can't stress this point enough the actors are not at fault here.  Other things I enjoy about the movie are Batman's vehicles.  The Batmobile is beautiful and rivals the one from the first two movies as my favorite.  The Batwing, while not exactly aerodynamically sound, is still a great visual, as is the Batboat. Here is the inevitable but.  While I tolerate Shumacher in this, the first of his Batman ventures, there are things I won't forgive him for. Forever is the movie that gave us the nipple endowed Batsuit. Ridiculous. Burton made a wise move in Batman Returns in making the Batsuit more body armor-like and less of a muscle suit.  Schumacher not only reverts to the muscle suit, but gives Bats and Robin nipples.  Maybe Bats is attempting a new strategy If the criminals are doubled over in laughter before I get to them, I don't have to beat them up.  Other than the nipples, Bats and sidekick to have nice suits.  The radar-modified suit at the end of the movie is also cool, but Shumacher unfortunately goes overboard with the custom costumes in the next film, Batman and Robin. I don't have any major complaint about fights or stunts in the movie, save the outrageous scene where the Batmobile is driven up the side of a building. Flat out absurd. It's no wonder the scene changes so we never find out what Bats does when he gets to the top.  Gotham City itself is tolerable, but nothing of the wonder that it is in Burton's movies.  The attempt is made to meld Bo Welch's socialist-influenced design from Batman Returns with a typical movie futuristic city, but it's not very effective. Just the same, one of Forever's saving graces is that Gotham is not yet the absurd caricature that Shumacher and crew create in Batman and Robin. A Batman movie seems equally empty without Danny Elfman but Elliot Goldenthal's score is wonderful, and in it's peak moments nothing short of spectacular.  His themes really become part of the movie for me-I can't imagine watching the movie without the soundtrack to accompany it. At it's best moments the word I think describes the score best is triumphant.  An excellent word to be associated with Batman. At one point in the movie the caped crusaders find themselves on an island of steel, at which point Robin remarks Holy, rusted metal Batman! Confused, Batman responds What?  Of course, this exchange is a clear nod to the 60's tv show, but the fact that Batman has no idea what he is talking about carries a second message this ain't your daddy's Batman.  No, it's not. But it's not our brother's either.  It's an amalgamation of both of them.

The movie has been re-released to coincide with the release of the television series now on DVD and the new television series that is being broadcast. Speaking as a fan of the television show, its about time!People who were there when it was first released and have been wanting the film can now get hold of it easily and people who don't know about the greatest of Transformers are now made aware.  And maybe I'm slightly biased towards this film because I'm a big fan of anime and cartoon series' but I think its great.It begins with the decepticons (bad guys) planning an all out attack on the autobots (good guys).  They battle and the leader of the autobots Optimus Prime is badly damaged but before he dies or shuts down, I'm not sure, his gives to his second in command the matrix, it is said that the matrix will light their darkest hour. But the decepticons are not the only force to be dealt with there is a planet sized enemy which devours all that stands in its way and its heading towards Cybertron, but with Megatron also under its power the planet is a force to be reckoned with. Transformers has a fantastic soundtrack, its cheesy but its good because of this it fits in with with the film and the themes of the film, (which is basically goodies have more heart and are better than baddies) perfectly, most of the songs are performed by Stan Bush whose vocal stlye again is perfect for the film. The animation is smooth and is the same as in the television series, more characters are introduced and the older characters developed or evolved, its a good length and offers everything you could ask for in a movie made of this now cult television series. If you remember the televion series from when you were a kid and you want to revisit your childhood its excellent or if you have kids and think that kids television shows were better when you were a nipper get it for your kids.

I don't agree with Eric from Seattle's interpretation of Harry...How could Harry be a figment of Michel's imagination, a sort of ghost à la Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense when we see the said Harry interact with Michel's wife and daughters? I don't think Michel would have imagined Harry in such details, for example Claire visiting him at his hotel to tell him to stay away from them?  The reason why Michel kills Harry at the end, I think, is that, yes, the latter has acquired a very twisted power over him, but Michel turns the tables on Harry, saying You too prevent me from fulfillment with your half-a**ed theories. Whatever REALLY happened to his parents and brother, Michel is shaken, and the presence of this nonsense-spouting psycho is not helping him. The sight of Prune (Plum) dead somehow makes him snap out of it, in a way. Yes, he kills Harry, but could it just be because he wants to save his WIFE and DAUGHTERS?

It's much more convincing than having some Hollywood queen who is completely foreign to a little dirt, grime and action.  The fact that there isn't a wealth of recent pirate movies sits Cutthroat Island near the top of the heap, but I don't think it's unjustified.  It really is a fun movie, and that's what a pirate movie should be.  How can you have a completely serious pirate movie?  It wouldn't be any fun. You have to have a guy with a wooden leg, some kind of pet-be it a parrot or a monkey, and guys that say aye and arg.  The ship to ship cannon fight is amazing.  The simple reminder that seaborne warfare was like that once is amazing enough.  Just pull up and start blowing the trash out of each other at close range.  A far cry from today, where we just fire missiles at targets dozens of miles away.  Flintlock pistols and sword fights are always cool, and Cutthroat Island has its fair share of them.  I enjoyed Matthew Modine's character, but I admit at times his lines seemed an uncomfortable fit, as though they were shoehorned in. The rest of the supporting cast is effective, and Frank Langella as Morgan's despicable uncle is the typical bad pirate, but enjoyable none the less.Pirates of the Carribean is coming out a few months from the time I am writing this, and it will be interesting to see if and how the two movies are compared.

She does not look like a man, no matter how hard she tries (and she didn't try very hard in this film).  And those who make consistent close contact with he\/she should be horse whipped for not knowing the difference.  But I gradually just ignored that fact as the movie got better and better.No one can deny that this is yet another vanity project for Babs.  Or that the music in Yentl pretty much all sounds the same.  Or that Babs has no problem showing overly gratuitous male nudity, but won't even give us a glimpse herself.  But Yentl is a very deep character and film, which are always hard to come by.  Not just of one character, but of three, which is really hard to come by.  Babs herself is servicable as an actress, but it is Amy Irving and Mandy Pitakin who really shine in this film.  Both really laid it all on the line.  It shows, and they make this film. As a writer, director and producer, Babs tries to make her mark (as she does in all her films), but who doesn't?  She makes her mark with reliable different techniques in dialogue and direction, but doesn't try to throw it in our face.  She's serviceable as producer, director, and actress.  Of course, you're crazy if you try to deny the woman her musical talent.  All the songs in Yentl SOUND the same, but they are not written the same.  All the songs fit well within the framework, and tell us what Yentl is feeling at the time.  Exactly what they were meant to.  Perhaps the film shouldn't have ended in a song.Not that affirmative action has any place in Hollywood, but Babs has really gotten the shaft over the years.

I have a feeling that if Yentl had been directed by a man, it would have had a picture and director nomination, especially in a year where The GOD AWFUL Big Chill was so recognized. Yentl is a film that tells a story of a turn of the century Jewish girl who wants to study like the boys do.

It gives you an idea of what awaits you in the wide world and yet it tells you that if you hold true to what you are and make things happen you will get what you want out of life in the end.  Now, the animation isn't as good as even the old Batman\/Tarzan Saturday morning cartoons of the 70's, but it has style for days.  The soundtrack has become a top selling CD although released years afterwards.  The voice characterizations are as good as any animated film ever made. And last but not least, it has John Candy, who, in my book, just has to show up to make a movie.  Whether you stay to watch the rest of that particular movie is entirely up to you ... 9 out of 10.

(include me) From the opening pan of the courtroom and the shot of the wide-eyed victim (all ready for his painted-on-velvet close-up), I knew where this movie was heading. Henry Fonda, in his white suit was liberal political correctness personified. I'm not taking anything away from the plot and the characterizations and the impressive acting all around, only that the intentions were so blatant and the action so manipulative. Would Hollywood ever have made a movie where the direction of the action moved from innocent to guilty? Not on your tin police badge! I hoped that at least E.G. Marshall would have stuck to his guns (so to speak) but the plot had him cave because of Fonda's evidence of litte dents in the side of the nose from glasses. Ugh. Now we all can go home and feel better about how good the good guys are and how bad and corrupt the system is.
