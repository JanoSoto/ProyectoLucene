The film is all at once a realist drama, a political thriller and a war movie; Ken Loach's trademark vérité style dogging every cut; composition; transition and individual scene resulting in a near breathless film-watching experience of conflict, both of an internal and external sort, tribulation and strife. The film is very much The Spanish Civil War, as well as those of whom fought in it, through the eyes of Loach; an event of which, like several other background incidents that have since plagued Loach's work, such as Ireland's Independence throughout The Wind That Shakes the Barley; The Navigators, and its covering of men suffering at the result of British Rail's privatisation, but also albeit fleetingly, Looking for Eric's monopolisation of Manchester United football club, is melded into what is first and foremost a character study feeding off an intense sense of realism.Ian Hart eventually comes to play that of David Carr, a young Liverpudlian man of whom we first see in the then-present of the mid-nineties alone and in a bad way as he alone occupies his tower block apartment having suffered a heart attack. The tower block itself is a tad grimy; graffiti of a somewhat politically motivated sort plagues the stairs, stairs of which paramedics must ascend out of the fact the lift does not work and probably has not done so for some while. Alas, everyone, including that of his granddaughter whom discovered him, are too late to save our Dave and he dies from the heart attack; an event leading his young relative to uncover a tin in the apartment rife with trinkets and items that we will come to learn meant a great deal to him. The tin mostly contains Spanish memorabilia, and we are led into assuming the man to be somewhat political out of the miner's strike newspaper clippings he kept. Amidst the photos; the collections of dirt kept back and the letters we, through the granddaughter, build an image of David's experiences abroad at an important time in his life.Principally, the film is one long flashback with brief darts back to the present also arriving as we witness Dave's exploits in tandem with that of his granddaughter's uncovering of the facts; her character most probably discovering as much about the Spanish Civil War as Loach's intended audience are. In 1930's Liverpool, Carr is in his mid twenties and intermingles with the odd friend here and there when he isn't looking for work out of being unemployed or maintaining his Communist party roots. One day, a trip to a local cinema encompasses that of a propagandist newsreel and a talk by a Spanish politician, of whom has come over to inform those of specific political stances whom might be willing to fight with him, as a brooding situation in Spain develops. Seemingly desiring a life away from what foundations he has, Carr accepts what proposals are outlined that day in the darkened, enclosed locale of the picture-house and it isn't long before he is riding a train in northern Spain to the front-line of what is The Spanish Civil war raging between Conservatives, and those of a more leftist-nature on the political spectrum, against the Fascist might of Franco and his followers.There is a beautifully placed scene very early on in Carr's venture out there, an exchange on board a train as he makes his way across and through the somewhat barren northern parts of the country depicting him barely able to even say the Spanish word for Thank you. This, not only a happening highlighting his raw and inexperienced nature to the locale, actually accentuates how much it means to those with whom he's intermingling when a train guard hears of the cause for his presence and offers him a free ticket on behalf of it. One thing leads to another, and he eventually links up with a rag-tag bunch of soldiers predominantly populated by Spaniards known as the 'POUM', a united workers party fighting the concurrent fascist sentiment. Through this group of people of varying nationalities and the nature of their cross cultural banding togetherness, the general disposition of the film's production is nicely surmised, as this piece formulating out of the resultant coming together of varying fellows combining for a cause. It is within this group that he meets an array of people, including that of local Spaniards; Frenchmen; the fiery Maite (Bollaín) as well as Blanca (Pator), whom he eventually comes to feel rather fondly for.The film does an excellent job in channelling the nature of what warfare in the trenches, unfolding in this era may have been like; everything droll and unglamourous when it isn't bullet ridden, the better equipped enemy never feeling much more than not-so-far-away, with conflict and violence seemingly around most turns. Away from the sequences of conflict, which reach heady heights when the early storming of a nearby town plays out, the film is rife with really remarkably played sequences of heavy political involvement featuring the characters deliberating and speaking on the state of their nation and what ought to happen; the scenes so authentic in their unfolding, one could be forgiven for thinking one had been transported back in time and invited to a live chaired debate. The film is a remarkable drama, a war film in which the warfare slips away and into the background whilst the characters take centre stage; a film which beautifully sews in a love story amidst all the strife and generally makes for accomplished viewing.

And that's exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted - he wanted to create something that was about more than just an actor - it was about life itself.2001 A Space Odyssey is one of the two greatest epics of all time. It is a film of breathtaking technical brilliance that is matched by some of the most ambitious storytelling of all time. In a nutshell, 2001 tells the story if human evolution. We start in the past, where our ape ancestors are starving and are perhaps even on the verge of extinction. They fight with other animals over a waterhole, and the general outlook is bleak. That is, until they find a mysterious black monolith that has appeared from nowhere. Our ancestors crowd around the monolith, and soon after they take a step towards evolution when they use their first weapon. Then, using the finest transitions in film, we flash forward into our own future and see a space dance between a space ship and space station to Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube. We meet a scientist, Dr Haywood Floyd, who is on his way to the moon in secret. Why? Because they have found another monolith on the moon. And, as before, this monolith represents another jump in evolution. Two astronauts, a team of scientists and a computer called HAL embark on a journey towards Jupiter - and then unknown, leading to one of the finest endings in film that will leave you pretty dazzled and initially confused. With this film though, confusion is what Kubrick was aiming for. I've often heard people say that this is a bad film because it has no conclusive ending, or that it just cheats us out of an answer. But Kubrick was no cheat. He was a man who planned everything. I think that he chose the best possible ending - one that leaves everything open to interpretation because no one know what the future holds, least of all Kubrick. Why provide a wrong answer for the sake of a conventional ending, when you can provide an open, ambiguous ending that asks so much? A conventional ending might have satisfied, up until proved wrong. With this ending, 2001 is timeless. To match the scope of the storytelling is Kubrick's almost unrivalled genius as a technical director. He is one of just two truly artistic, technical directors who always presented films that were large in scope, yet always grounded. 2001 is entirely grounded in its presentation of science and fact - no sound in space, realistic space ships and stations, realistic travel times between planets. There are no magical powers, no Warp 5. There is only fact, upon which Kubrick builds his vision. This film asks everything of mankind. Why are we here? What brought us here? Is there a higher force, and if so is it God, or another alien race? Can we achieve immortality? It asks all these questions and more, yet leaves the answers entirely up to us, because in the end, no one knows what the future holds and therefore how can those questions be answered. And, finally, it leaves us with one final, wonderful question - What waits for us in this universe?Perfection achieved on every level.

In Turkey Bond meets up with the consul Karim Bey who helps him get the machine out of the Soviet Consulate and arranges for Bond and Tatiana to escape by train&#x85; of course this won't be easy as both Soviet agents and SPECTRE are keen to get their hands on the machine.This second outing for Bond is even better than the first, Sean Connery is great in the role and the beautiful Daniela Bianchi, who played Tatiana, is one of the best Bond Girls. A good bond film needs good villains and this has a couple of great ones in the form of the thoroughly horrible Rosa Klebb; played by Lotte Lenya and the suave but psychotic Grant, played by Robert Shaw. There may not be a SPECTRE lair to blow up in this one but there are gunfights, hand to hand fighting and an explosive scene where SPECTRE agents aboard speedboats try to capture Bond. This film also introduces Blofelt; head of SPECTRE&#x85; although we only hear his voice and see his famous white cat&#x85; it will be some time before he is seen. We also see Q for the first time; the gadget he gives Bond is far more believable than some things provided in later films.

'Dirty' Harry Callahan is a San Francisco cop with a difference - he's warped, perhaps even psychotic. Because of that, the police tend to keep him reserved for the most diabolical cases where they need a man who will bend the rules to get the job done (hence 'Dirty' - every dirty job that comes his way). After the precision shooting of a woman, Dirty Harry is assigned to the case. He soon finds out that there is a serial killer on the loose, who wants money to stop killing. The serial killer, known as Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), is a psychopath who knows no pity or remorse. When the city doesn't pay, he starts killing. Dirty Harry knows that the man won't stop, but is hampered by a flawed law system. A girl is then kidnapped and supposedly buried alive, and Dirty Harry lets lost his own psychotic side - one that matches Scorpio's. There are many messages in this film about the law, police officers, killers. But at a basic level, this film asks a very good question - what happens if a child is buried alive, has 5 hours to live and you know who the kidnapper is? That's the basic question asked. Harry goes much further than the law allows him, which in turn raises questions about the flawed law system, but also about why the police would hire someone like Harry in the first place. Is he literally hired to clean up the law's mess, or failures? Does he represent a total failure in the law system?The acting in this film is second to none. Clint Eastwood is perfectly cast as the ruthless Dirty Harry, and gives one of his truly iconic performances. He is then matched by the exceptional Andrew Robinson, who acted Scorpio so well that he received death threats in real life - he creates a character that you absolutely hate beyond all reason. And the direction and action in turn matches the acting. Don Siegel's relentless, level-headed direction keeps the action grounded and realistic. And the shot where Harry is waiting on the bridge for Scorpio is one of the best in cinema. Overall, this film is very, very good and iconic. Sometimes, the message is lost in the violence, or it becomes muddled. But it's enough to make you question the law system, and whether it's effective or not.

After the first film, which was shot on a very low budget, surpassed everyone's expectations by becoming the highest grossing independent film in history, major studios were making a series of imitators, one of them being Sean Cuningham's Friday The 13th (1980), which was released by Paramount and a blood stained or more commercial answer to Halloween. It's ironic that the same studios who turned John Carpenter's horror thriller down were making their own films about serial killers stalking teenagers, most of them being uninspired compared to the original Halloween. There are a few exceptions though, like Wes Craven's superb A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).Anyway, back to this movie. Universal Studios began approaching John Carpenter and Debra Hill with the idea of a sequel, for which they declined at first. Even Debra Hill said herself in a 2002 interview that a sequel was The furthest thing from our minds. After Moustapha Akkad (finacer of the first film) agreed to make a follow up, Carpenter and Hill said that they would produce it and write the screenplay but only if the film were be to directed by someone else. Carpenter originally handed the opportunity to direct Halloween 2 over to Tommy Lee Wallace, who was the production designer and editor of the first film. Wallace didn't care for the script that Carpenter and Hill wrote and stated that he wasn't attached to the story so he dropped out of the project. The responsibility of directing would eventually go to an unknown director named Rick Rosenthal who had made a short film that Carpenter was impressed with which is the reason why Rosenthal got the job.Carpenter and Hill decided to make this movie a continuation of the first film, it picks up exactly where the first one left off and takes place completely on the same night as the fist film. After it is revealed at the end of the first film that Michael Myers is not dead, police are out around town looking for him, along with Dr. Loomis who knows for sure that Myers is still alive. Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the hospital after surviving from Michael's bloody rampage. She appears to be safe but Myers soon finds out about where she is and makes his way to the clinic and of course, all hell breaks lose. It appears that the nightmare isn't over yet and audiences will have to find out if Laurie (or anyone for that matter) will survive the rest of the night.Production began in early 1981, Jamie Lee Curtis returned to play the role that made her famous from the first film, Laurie Strode. Dean Cundey, who was the cinematographer on the first Halloween, returned also to bring his unique visual approach. This time, to play Michael Myers, the filmmakers brought in a stunt man named Dick Warlock who had worked on many movies as a stunt man for many years. The always loyal Donald Plescence also returned from the first film to play Dr. Loomis, his performance feels just as focused as it was the first time around. Besides Jamie Lee and Donald, an entire new cast was added to play the residents at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, which most of the film takes place at. There was a lot of tension on the set, Carpenter and director Rick Rosenthal had a different vision on what the finished film should be and and producer Debra Hill said that the movie was very difficult to be fully realized. When the film was finished, Carpenter was not happy with it and even said that Rosenthal should completely change his movie, stating that it wasn't frighting enough. Carpenter has said in an interview that he shot the opening scenes in the movie and that he was not happy doing it but that it had to be done to make the movie better. This is the film that you see today.Released on October 30th of 1981, Halloween 2 was a box office hit and while Carpenter and Hill were not pleased with the film, audiences enjoyed it. Rick Rosenthal, while his experience with Carpenter may have not been pleasant, has said that he thinks the movie holds up very well and is still really scary. Rosenthal would return to direct another Halloween sequel 20 years later, the 2002 film Halloween Resurrection. As for my views on the film, I feel that this movie is just as great as the first film and just as scary and entertaining. This film was much darker in terms of style and of course, there is more gore this time around. While the first film has no scenes of graphic violence, we can all assume that John Carpenter was feeling (as Tommy Lee Wallace stated) the pressures of the market place. Films like Friday The 13th had much more blood and violence in them so Carpenter wrote Halloween 2 including more of that. I still feel that this movie is just as suspenseful and while not as pure as the first film, still a good movie, I would say that it's great even. The atmosphere is well done and includes really nice camera work from Dean Cundey. If you're a horror fan then this movie should please you.

When the film was finished, Carpenter was not happy with it and even said that Rosenthal should completely change his movie, stating that it wasn't frighting enough. Carpenter has said in an interview that he shot the opening scenes in the movie and that he was not happy doing it but that it had to be done to make the movie better. This is the film that you see today.Released on October 30th of 1981, Halloween 2 was a box office hit and while Carpenter and Hill were not pleased with the film, audiences enjoyed it. Rick Rosenthal, while his experience with Carpenter may have not been pleasant, has said that he thinks the movie holds up very well and is still really scary. Rosenthal would return to direct another Halloween sequel 20 years later, the 2002 film Halloween Resurrection. As for my views on the film, I feel that this movie is just as great as the first film and just as scary and entertaining. This film was much darker in terms of style and of course, there is more gore this time around. While the first film has no scenes of graphic violence, we can all assume that John Carpenter was feeling (as Tommy Lee Wallace stated) the pressures of the market place. Films like Friday The 13th had much more blood and violence in them so Carpenter wrote Halloween 2 including more of that. I still feel that this movie is just as suspenseful and while not as pure as the first film, still a good movie, I would say that it's great even. The atmosphere is well done and includes really nice camera work from Dean Cundey. If you're a horror fan then this movie should please you.

After the first film, which was shot on a very low budget, surpassed everyone's expectations by becoming the highest grossing independent film in history, major studios were making a series of imitators, one of them being Sean Cuningham's Friday The 13th (1980), which was released by Paramount and a blood stained or more commercial answer to Halloween. It's ironic that the same studios who turned John Carpenter's horror thriller down were making their own films about serial killers stalking teenagers, most of them being uninspired compared to the original Halloween. There are a few exceptions though, like Wes Craven's superb A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).Anyway, back to this movie. Universal Studios began approaching John Carpenter and Debra Hill with the idea of a sequel, for which they declined at first. Even Debra Hill said herself in a 2002 interview that a sequel was The furthest thing from our minds. After Moustapha Akkad (finacer of the first film) agreed to make a follow up, Carpenter and Hill said that they would produce it and write the screenplay but only if the film were be to directed by someone else. Carpenter originally handed the opportunity to direct Halloween 2 over to Tommy Lee Wallace, who was the production designer and editor of the first film. Wallace didn't care for the script that Carpenter and Hill wrote and stated that he wasn't attached to the story so he dropped out of the project. The responsibility of directing would eventually go to an unknown director named Rick Rosenthal who had made a short film that Carpenter was impressed with which is the reason why Rosenthal got the job.Carpenter and Hill decided to make this movie a continuation of the first film, it picks up exactly where the first one left off and takes place completely on the same night as the fist film. After it is revealed at the end of the first film that Michael Myers is not dead, police are out around town looking for him, along with Dr. Loomis who knows for sure that Myers is still alive. Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the hospital after surviving from Michael's bloody rampage. She appears to be safe but Myers soon finds out about where she is and makes his way to the clinic and of course, all hell breaks lose. It appears that the nightmare isn't over yet and audiences will have to find out if Laurie (or anyone for that matter) will survive the rest of the night.Production began in early 1981, Jamie Lee Curtis returned to play the role that made her famous from the first film, Laurie Strode. Dean Cundey, who was the cinematographer on the first Halloween, returned also to bring his unique visual approach. This time, to play Michael Myers, the filmmakers brought in a stunt man named Dick Warlock who had worked on many movies as a stunt man for many years. The always loyal Donald Plescence also returned from the first film to play Dr. Loomis, his performance feels just as focused as it was the first time around. Besides Jamie Lee and Donald, an entire new cast was added to play the residents at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, which most of the film takes place at.

And, whilst that is an apt description in some respects, it doesn't do this film enough justice. Alien took sci-fi and horror and gave them both a much needed shake. Before this, sci-fi and alien films had been a bit soft, a bit too hopeful. And most horrors had become a bit clinical in their execution, a bit predictable. Alien is neither of those things. It is a claustrophobic, brutal experience that will leave you sceptical as to whether anything nice waits for us in space, and if it's not nice what will we have to do to stop it. This is almost a horrific version of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Alien starts, unsurprisingly, in the outer depths of space. A spaceship is travelling to earth with cargo, and the crew are in deep freeze. However, after the ship intercepts a signal, the crew are awoken and are ordered to investigate. Needless to say something pretty horrific is waiting for them. This film is genuinely a masterpiece. Some people consider the James Cameron sequel to be superior, but I firmly believe that this is the better. Firstly, this benefits from a mature cast with no Tom Cruise style actor. The cast is made of grounded, realistic actors. Tom Skerritt, a character actor, is Captain Dallas, who is in charge. He acts this with realism, with dignity. He's not a flashy actor, he's just an actor who plays it straight down the line. He is then backed up by other, fabulous character actors such as Yaphet Koto, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and of course, John Hurt (in surely the best role). We are also introduced to my personal favourite actress Sigourney Weaver, who even now is the only woman who can open and headline an action film. She acts the role of Ripley to perfection - a normal woman who's doesn't need a man to protect her and can hold her own, but is open to human emotions and is literally terrified. Weaver makes Ripley one of the best heroes because she's a scared woman with no choice but to fight. Also, it's a credit to the writers that the made action revolve around a realistic woman for a change. There's no relying on men, no 'girlie' crying or whatever. No hysterics. Ripley is a real, grounded woman who has to fight and is a match for any man on the ship. Secondly, this Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely superb. Scott is a talented director, but sometimes he allows his directing to get in the way of a good story (Gladiator!!!). Not so with Alien. He makes this story a claustrophobic horror, that builds slowly at a constant, measured pace, then explodes to life (quite literally). From then on, it's a tight, horrific ride until the final climax which is pretty epic in its way. Finally, this benefits from Jerry Goldsmith's best score. A score that is never over the top, doesn't give away the horror or the emotion, and is as measured as the acting and the directing. One of the finest horrors, and one of the finest pieces of storytelling every made. The only tragedy is that its name has been soiled by the later sequels.

The Usual Suspects, more than any film, is a masterpiece of effective manipulation on which the final twist is only the icing on a rather delicious cake.I'm inclined to believe that most of the fans realized the magnitude of The Usual Suspects on TV, VHS or DVD rather than in a movie theater. The movie has a fair share of thrills and action but is richer in terms of plot, subplots, and sub-subplots and demands more than one viewing. Although I catch one or two subtleties every once in a while, I think I got now 99% enough to consider myself a true fan of the film, and again, this is not just because of the finale.The Usual Suspects is like a modern Rashomon in the way it plays back and forth with flashbacks through an interrogation between a police officer, David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Roger Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a dim-witted cripple and the only survival of a harbor massacre. This is the mystery the movie opens with, as the game consists on finding out the 'why' and the 'how' lying beneath a bloody killing that killed everyone for 91 million dollars worth of an inexistent dope. And progressively, the mystery deviates to a more harrowing 'who' question, incarnated by the haunting presence of a criminal mastermind, named Keyser Soze, a human devil whose identity remains secret. The film puts us in Kujan's shoes, he who pretends to be the smarter, still, both Kujan and us, take Kint's words for granted until we're fooled by the shocking finale, but again, everything is in the build-up.The build up is why the comparison with Rashomon takes its full significance. Kurosawa's masterpiece didn't just pave the way for non-linear narrative films, it was also revolutionary through the introduction of subjective narration, inviting us not to believe in everything we see from a character's point of view. Not that most of what Kint reveals is a lie, but what Kujan will believe won't be necessarily the truth. This is manipulation at its best, to make you believe something from your own thinking, by still respecting your intelligence. And this is the irony of the film, while we expect a twist, we're never discussing the veracity of what is said, it's like approaching the virtual core of the truth without never touching the inner verity. This is why the ending is literally spectacular; we're literally blinded by the unbearable truth's light. But this effect wouldn't have been the same if it wasn't for what preceded.As a reference to the iconic line from Casablanca, the usual suspects are five criminals joined in the famous line-up for a mysterious truck robbery. What strikes the most is that they are criminals of higher caliber, when in general; you've got one tough guy and just some bums put there as fillers. There were obviously lined up for another reason, a mission for Keyser Soze, the criminal whose reputation exceeds the limit of believability, a myth, a spook story? His absence is as chilling as his presence anyway. And there was absolutely no way for them to refuse, the tightly written script leaves no plot holes, only stuff left to interpretation, but for the rest, and every single detail, every line or look on a face, makes perfect sense. It's an elaborate puzzle where you can get the final image until the last piece and nothing can match the first time you experience the film, and not just the ending.And the greatness is that the build-up of Keyser Soze's character contributes to show him as man so evil, and so present, that his non-existence would be unacceptable if not implausible. He's here, and he's surely one of the usual suspects, and since we feel we're being tricked, we ought to think, maybe Keyser is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) or this Kobayashi lawyer (Pete Postelwhaite) or who the hell knows, maybe Kujan. It's not thrown in our face, we really try to believe this and when Kujan releases Kint, whatever the truth is, we feel like any coming twist must be both convincing and spectacular. Well, the wall board was probably one of the greatest cinematic revelations ever, getting us the final piece of the puzzle as we understand how Kint used the wall to insert some realistic details in his story. We got the final move of a psychological chess game, an extraordinary manipulation highlighted by the succession of quotes in voice-over in a masterstroke of sound editing sublimated by a perfect music and a revelation reaching its pinnacle on the sidewalk. Check-mate. When the movie ends, we realize what came before really needs a second viewing.And besides the writing and the editing, there are the little details you re-discover. When Kint is looking earlier at the wall, he looks dumbly detached but the second time you realize that he's building his story.

The Usual Suspects, more than any film, is a masterpiece of effective manipulation on which the final twist is only the icing on a rather delicious cake.I'm inclined to believe that most of the fans realized the magnitude of The Usual Suspects on TV, VHS or DVD rather than in a movie theater. The movie has a fair share of thrills and action but is richer in terms of plot, subplots, and sub-subplots and demands more than one viewing. Although I catch one or two subtleties every once in a while, I think I got now 99% enough to consider myself a true fan of the film, and again, this is not just because of the finale.The Usual Suspects is like a modern Rashomon in the way it plays back and forth with flashbacks through an interrogation between a police officer, David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Roger Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a dim-witted cripple and the only survival of a harbor massacre. This is the mystery the movie opens with, as the game consists on finding out the 'why' and the 'how' lying beneath a bloody killing that killed everyone for 91 million dollars worth of an inexistent dope. And progressively, the mystery deviates to a more harrowing 'who' question, incarnated by the haunting presence of a criminal mastermind, named Keyser Soze, a human devil whose identity remains secret. The film puts us in Kujan's shoes, he who pretends to be the smarter, still, both Kujan and us, take Kint's words for granted until we're fooled by the shocking finale, but again, everything is in the build-up.The build up is why the comparison with Rashomon takes its full significance. Kurosawa's masterpiece didn't just pave the way for non-linear narrative films, it was also revolutionary through the introduction of subjective narration, inviting us not to believe in everything we see from a character's point of view. Not that most of what Kint reveals is a lie, but what Kujan will believe won't be necessarily the truth. This is manipulation at its best, to make you believe something from your own thinking, by still respecting your intelligence. And this is the irony of the film, while we expect a twist, we're never discussing the veracity of what is said, it's like approaching the virtual core of the truth without never touching the inner verity. This is why the ending is literally spectacular; we're literally blinded by the unbearable truth's light. But this effect wouldn't have been the same if it wasn't for what preceded.As a reference to the iconic line from Casablanca, the usual suspects are five criminals joined in the famous line-up for a mysterious truck robbery. What strikes the most is that they are criminals of higher caliber, when in general; you've got one tough guy and just some bums put there as fillers. There were obviously lined up for another reason, a mission for Keyser Soze, the criminal whose reputation exceeds the limit of believability, a myth, a spook story? His absence is as chilling as his presence anyway. And there was absolutely no way for them to refuse, the tightly written script leaves no plot holes, only stuff left to interpretation, but for the rest, and every single detail, every line or look on a face, makes perfect sense. It's an elaborate puzzle where you can get the final image until the last piece and nothing can match the first time you experience the film, and not just the ending.And the greatness is that the build-up of Keyser Soze's character contributes to show him as man so evil, and so present, that his non-existence would be unacceptable if not implausible. He's here, and he's surely one of the usual suspects, and since we feel we're being tricked, we ought to think, maybe Keyser is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) or this Kobayashi lawyer (Pete Postelwhaite) or who the hell knows, maybe Kujan. It's not thrown in our face, we really try to believe this and when Kujan releases Kint, whatever the truth is, we feel like any coming twist must be both convincing and spectacular. Well, the wall board was probably one of the greatest cinematic revelations ever, getting us the final piece of the puzzle as we understand how Kint used the wall to insert some realistic details in his story. We got the final move of a psychological chess game, an extraordinary manipulation highlighted by the succession of quotes in voice-over in a masterstroke of sound editing sublimated by a perfect music and a revelation reaching its pinnacle on the sidewalk. Check-mate. When the movie ends, we realize what came before really needs a second viewing.And besides the writing and the editing, there are the little details you re-discover. When Kint is looking earlier at the wall, he looks dumbly detached but the second time you realize that he's building his story.

The man is Johnny Smith played by Christopher Walken in one of his most memorable lead performances.Indeed, the movie strikes by its simplicity, from a basic but intriguing plot device, it opens the door to a series of episodes where the only noticeable evolution is Johnny's state of health, worsening as his power gets more important. The question is less in the 'how' than the 'what', how he got the power is pointless; the key is to know what to do with it. In a certain way, the movie deals with an existentialist issue of a man who lost his girlfriend, his mother, his job, and questions his own utility to the world, the world that can be reasonably reduced to the little town of Castlerock from his modest perspective.The answer is satisfying as it doesn't insult our intelligence by trying to depict the gift in a negative way. Johnny saves a little girl from a house fire, he reveals to his doctor that his mother survived the Holocaust and in a later emotional scene, the doctor realizes its true but can't find the strength to speak to his mother. This moment helps to understand the limits of Johnny's power in its ability to provide happiness, is the relief to know that someone we learned to mourn is actually alive worth the awareness of a wasted time? The story intelligently deviates to highlight the practical usefulness of Johnny's gift as it helps to put an end to a series of atrocious crimes during an investigation lead by the Sheriff Tom Skerrit's. The resolution leads to a particularly gruesome scene reminding us of the horrific aspect of the film.The killer's suicide scene indeed invites to consider the significance of horror in The Dead Zone. The movie doesn't feature many bloody scenes, it surely is more a fantasy thriller than a horror film, but gore and violence are not the only basis of horror. Strangely, the doom of Johnny is to foresee not the present, past or future, but the horrific events wounding one's heart or about to destroy a life. Johnny's mind is like a Pandora box carrying the whole torment and catastrophes that can destroy a person as a metonymy for human lives. He relives human tragedies, World War II, murders, natural disasters; Johnny witnesses with his eyes the darkest side of humanity.And the worsening of Johnny's state indicates that the weight of these sufferings and this pain is getting heavier and more unbearable on his shoulders. Somewhat, he's condemned to death, but something is still missing. He helps people because it's his true altruistic nature but his reputation as the local freak is getting more and more on his nerves and somewhere the question is still asked what can he do with his power? This is where the antagonistic presence of Greg Stillson, plays its role. Martin Sheen, in a scene stealing performance plays the role of a demagogic politician hose devouring ambition inspires both people's respect and fear. He's the kind of born-to-win leader and extremely talented tactician who'll never allow anything or anyone to block his road for destiny, for the White House.Johnny will foresee the devastating effects of Stillson's ascension to the power and how it would lead to a nuclear holocaust. Asking a strange question to his doctor, Johnny wonders if he would have assassinated Hitler if he had the opportunity. This question reveals two important points the meaning of Johnny's power, and of his unique condition. He's got the power to change the future for the best, and he was meant to stop the ascension of Greg Stillson, to spare the world from his cruel actions. Johnny Smith is a Christ-like figure, and will sacrifice himself by saving lives of millions of people.Stephen King has a strange fascination for these persons whose actions benefit to humanity, exceeding the limits of their modest condition, John Coffey is one of them. The kind of ordinary setting of Castlerock that we'll find again in Stand By Me reinforces the ordinary aspect of these heroes, everyday men in quest for a meaning to their lives. And of course, there is a supernatural power handled with a tactful intelligence, no special effects, no over-dramatization, the gift is not the end but the mean of its hero to save people's lives, and speaking of hero, Johnny Smith is an extremely likable character, inspiring our most profound sympathy, a man whose physical torment is due to his power to save people, Stephen King's mind provided not just memorable villains, but extraordinary and universally appealing heroes.And the movie invites us to think about these men who accessed to the power by cheating, lying, and providing a positive image to people, with an indecent capability to cover their hideous, heinous or cowardly natures. Life is a hazardous lottery where the most deserving don't necessarily win, innocents die and evil people succeed, and as a reminder of the infamous butterfly effect, The Dead Zone proves that many tragedies can still be avoided if we had the ability to see through the heart, what a cruel fantasy, highlighting our vulnerability.David Cronenberg's direction, and the cinematography of the film is cold and austere but contributes to create an efficient intimate feeling, to the limit of claustrophobia, as to make Johnny Smith, an even more isolated character.

It can be analyzed on so many levels. It is a comment on the failure of the prevailing socio-political order at the height of the tumult of the '60s, in 1968. It is a comment on race in that the black hero of the film (Duane Jones as Ben) fends off death, only to ultimately succumb to an ignorant mob of white men in a truly pointless death. Via the character of traditional Harry (Karl Hardman), we see the passive approach toward change-hide in the cellar and hope that one survives. This might be analogized to many in the United States at the time who resisted change and tried to ignore it and hoped that they might weather the storm as they were. This is in bold contrast to the character of Duane whose resourcefulness and hard work engages the zombies, come what may. This might be analogized as the youth, as minorities, as folks who wanted to see a new way of doing things and would push to secure it.The film itself is quite spare in its style, which to me makes it quite ripe for metaphor and interpretation. One can see, in the vivid, sharply-drawn characters, the outlines of prevailing schools of thought driving the coruscating changes of the '60s.The story of the film is that a group of people find themselves trapped in a home with zombies zeroing in on them. They are stuck in the house and are trying to survive the attack of the relentless flesh-eaters. The group is composed of a family- which lives there and whose daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) has already been bitten by the zombies. They, including the old-fashioned Harry and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman), with whom he is feuding, are in the cellar. A young man named Tom and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley) who are a bit more forward-looking have also taken refuge in the house although they are a bit more willing to join Duane upstairs in taking on the zombies directly. The decisions they make about where they will take their stand will determine whether they will defeat the zombies or not.The film was heavily criticized when it was released for some of the imagery which was quite gruesome. In watching it now, it retains the ability to shock, and the matter-of-fact way in which the zombies continue to attack, not in a graphic way, but simply unrelentingly, gives the film the continued ability to scare. As noted, I found the film quite acidic in its commentary on Vietnam, on race riots, on changes in demographics and on a country in flux, but if you just want to watch it simply for a good scare, it would work that way also. Director George Romero has conjured up a compelling story onto which one can attach all sort of meaning and the cast, most especially lead actor Duane give great performances. There are some very scary moments in the film and its importance, as a pioneering horror film was recognized several years ago when the Library of Congress accorded it protection as a work of enduring value. It's not hard to see why. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 August 2011","score":"","review":" This is a genius film. It can be analyzed on so many levels.

One could bemoan it for robbing them of a full Tarantino movie, delivered in his prime, by saddling the plot with an unexpected swerve into Robert Rodriguez exploitation. Or they could sit back and enjoy it for the utterly unpredictable, bewildering, guns-blazing, I can't believe that just happened, speed boat ride that it is. I fall into the latter camp, and while both directors have undeniably made more intelligent, deep, well-rounded pictures, there's no denying From Dusk Till Dawn has a certain unusual charm that's tough to nail down. Tarantino's script elaborates loosely on a lot of the social observations he'd originally made in Natural Born Killers, while the film's semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek attitude is an obvious precursor to the superduo's later collaboration on Grindhouse, marking it as an evolutionary milestone of sorts for both. George Clooney steals almost every scene as a take-no-crap heistmeister who's desperate to cross the Mexican border, Harvey Keitel seems unusually understated as the soft-spoken jaded preacher, and Tarantino himself breaks out his C-level acting chops in an appropriately stiff, detached performance as Clooney's creepy, sexual predator of a brother. This isn't quite the joyride I'd remembered it as, but it still provides a few laughs and six barrels full of blood.
