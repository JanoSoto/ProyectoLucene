Many years later, and posing as a pianist, Bauer marries Paula Alquist, whose aunt he murdered years before. The married couple then move into the opera star's home - still the location of the hidden jewels - at which point the mind games begin.Bauer increasingly behaves cruel toward his wife and places in her mind the idea that her mother died from a condition which drove her insane. Believing herself to have the same condition, Paula begins to question her sanity, begins to slowly lose her mind, begs her husband for patience and kindness, without realising that he is the man behind her woes.To add to the creepiness, Paula's father, whom she thinks she escaped from, was a domineering and possessive figure whom Bauer himself slowly morphs into, until he to becomes a father figure of the most fearsome kind.And so as the film progresses, Bauer will attempt to commit his increasingly hysterical wife to a mental institution. But it is he who is insane, his marriage to Paula a mere pretext for his claiming possession of the opera star's house so that he might continue his obsessive, mad search for the jewels.Packed with psychological nuances, the film is menacing and terrifying in subtle ways, and its pretty creepy the way Paula becomes ensnared and later free of two oppressive institutions; family and patriarchic matrimony.But even the villain of the picture, Sergius Bauer, earns our sympathy. In the grips of psychosis, it is clear that his sadistic behaviour towards his wife stems from an attempt to redress the sense of disadvantage he has always felt toward powerful women (like the opera star he murdered).So at its best, the film deftly merges film noir and the damsel-in-distress genres. In both genres, a projection of sexual fear participates; noir, in which the male is ensnared, trapped and ruined by the woman, and the damsel-in-distress thriller, in which a man disadvantages and conquers a woman. You might say the fantasies and desires of one genre stem from the fears and anxieties of the other.So in terms of Gaslight, we have the noir half of the film in which Bauer fears being consumed (sexually, physically and emotionally), fears being a victim, fears female sexuality and power, and the damsel-in-distress half, in which he represents male power, the need to dominate and assert himself. What makes the film creepy is the way the two genres overlap, combating one another in an intimate tug-of-war.8\/10 &#x96; An interesting film which bears some similarities to Hitchcock's Notorious and Vertigo.

Until you find out that Tim Burton is the director of this film, you'll probably wonder why someone would choose to, almost, document the life of such a person. However, it is typical of Burton to portray the life of someone different, not typical. It is sad that Edward D Wood Jr. did not receive fame until after his death, spending most of his life creating films that were not accepted in Hollywood. The story of his life has become more popular and watchable than any of the films he made. He does still have a small amount of fans today, but, he really was no Orson Welles, despite aspiring to be. Tim Burton depicts the sad yet, hopeful life of Ed Wood very well. Although we know that none of Ed Wood's films gain huge success and popularity, that doesn't stop us hoping they do. We easily associate and believe in the character played greatly, by Johnny Depp. Ed Wood is filmed in black and white which makes it seem even more true to life. However, the actors cast to play Wood and his bizarre friends such as, Bunny (Bill Murray) and Dolores (Sarah Jessica Parker), are played by modern actors. This lets the audience know that Burton is clearly not trying to make a documentary\/docu-drama etc, he is purely making a film; something that will entertain the audience. The many comedic moments in this film also add to this idea. Johnny Depp makes a marvellous Ed Wood, his lack of blinking and goofy smile add to the idea that Wood really was an eccentric character. This without the fact he liked to dress in women's clothing, something I think Johnny Depp, strangely enough, suited. Another performance that has to be commented on is that of Martin Landau who played Bela Lugosi. His performance was so good it won him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The irony in this is that the real Bela Lugosi never won an Oscar himself. Landau is very well suited to the role, and looks like someone who could definitely have played Dracula. He knows himself that, what I do best, what I've always done best, is act. He portrays wonderfully the character of Bela Lugosi and his struggle to find fame and fortune; dealing with a drug addiction and being willing to play any character thrown at him, however awful it was. Overall, Ed Wood is a funny yet sad, portrayal of Ed Wood's life. It definitely deserves to be named one of Tim Burton's best films, and again, we see a brilliant collaboration between him and Johnny Depp. ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" d Wood is the story of the worst Director - ever.

The film's opening credit sequence is unnecessary self-indulgence, and is totally out of place in terms of the subsequent story. However, the following scene in club Obi-Wan (really subtle I know) is very clever and works extremely well, putting Indiana Jones in the situation totally consistent to what we saw in the previous film. The action is ingenious and exciting. The following sequences in the streets of Shanghai and aboard a plane over Asia work well and set up the story well. However, the role of the gold-digging nightclub singer Willie Scott (played by future Mrs Spielberg Kate Capshaw) is an unfortunate miscalculation and I found totally annoying throughout the film, and makes it hard to sympathise with the predicaments the character gets into. In fact, I go through the film wondering if the character had been killed whether it would have bothered the audience at all? This is indicative of a broader problem in the film. The view of making the second film in the series darker in tone is not in itself an issue (see Empire Strikes Back as an example of how that approach can work), but the problem the film has is that there is insufficient development of the characters to make you care about the predicaments they get into. The focus of the story seems to be how far the film-makers can grow to gross-out the audience and not get an adult rating, and as a result the film feels more like blatant audience manipulation rather than genuine entertainment. I felt that what might have been an interesting script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz become focused towards set pieces and gross out moments, that is would appeal to the more obvious audience manipulation phase that both director Stephen Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas seemed to be going through at the time. Even the villains of the piece are not sufficiently fleshed out in this film, and as a viewer I felt much less involved in the story.I found few of the characters in the film at all memorable. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Indiana Jones this time around is more understated, but since the character is given little development or anything of interest to do except react to the events the character is not as engaging this time around. Background characters are genuinely unmemorable or annoying (Willie Scott). The only character in the film I was drawn to was Indy's sidekick Short Round, who was very well played by child actor turned stunt co-ordinator Jonathan Ke Quan. While the character's background and connection to Indy is never clearly explained, his character generates some sympathy and I found when his he is directly contributing to the story, the film became more interesting and involving. The only aspects of the film that are genuinely appealing are the impressive technical achievements within the action sequences. These include a series of accomplished live action sequences that take place in a mine, and on a rope bridge. ILM's Oscar winning visual effects work, led by Oscar winner and ILM veteran Dennis Muren (already an Oscar winner for Empire Strikes Back, ET and Return of the Jedi, and would go on to collect more awards for T2 and Jurassic Park) is more subtle in this film, but culminates in a terrifically staged mine car chase sequence , which is the film's highlight, demonstrating flawless editing (Spielberg's regular Michael Kahn) between live action and miniature elements. However I was still surprised that the film won an Academy Award for visual effects as I felt more interesting and pioneering work had been done on Ghostbusters and 2010 that year. There is a witty homage to David Lean in terms of how some of the jungle plain sequences are shot, with an epic and wide scope to them. John Williams's score is as usual very accomplished. However it accentuates the mean spirited tone of the film and lacks the heart of Raiders of the Lost Ark, again making the audience less involved with the characters in the story. Mention also has to go to miniature supervisor Lorne Peterson's work on this film and George Gibb's live action effects work. Peterson has gone on to be a very successful miniature builder for Hollywood films, and Gibbs would win a second Oscar for his on-set work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and work on a large body of high profile films subsequently. Douglas Slocombe's photography is impressive, ably assisted by some effective Steadicam work at the film's climax, and Eliot Scott's production design work evokes the time period very well.

Douglas Slocombe's photography is impressive, ably assisted by some effective Steadicam work at the film's climax, and Eliot Scott's production design work evokes the time period very well. Overall an impressively well made but distant and uninvolving story marred by self indulgent, blatant and unsubtle audience manipulation.

It is also notoriously hard to follow, with a plot so and labyrinthine and subtly suggestive it leaves most viewers baffled. And yet it is immensely popular, was a commercial success in its day, and has long been praised as one of the all-time classics of the form. It must have some secret.The screenplay is adapted, very faithfully I must say, from the novel by Raymond Chandler. In a book, where it's possible to chew over a story point-by-point, such complexity is quite acceptable. But Chandler's story seems staggeringly unsuitable for the movies. For a start, the intrigue does not revolve around any tangible goal or object, like the titular bird in The Maltese Falcon, a similar but far simpler work. This means rather than watching out for who's hiding what, we have to pay attention to the relationships between the characters, none of whom has any obvious reasons for helping or hindering one another. The characters themselves are numerous, with more heavies, molls and dodgy businessmen than you can shake a pistol at. And while the dialogue is sparkling with quotable quips, whenever anyone gets onto the actual subject of the investigation, it suddenly turns into gobbledegook. Bogart's going over with Joe Brody over whoever may or may not have the photos of Carmen is a veritable tongue-twister. No wonder audiences then and now were confused.So what else does The Big Sleep have to its name? Well, most importantly it has its too leading stars, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Bogart and Bacall were built for noir styling. They both have a hard iciness to their personae, but with easygoing charisma and a knack for delivering smart dialogue with aplomb that makes them absolutely irresistible. And between them they have chemistry to boot. Even if you didn't know they were an offscreen couple, you would still think them destined for each other on screen. It was their first pairing a few years earlier that livened up the otherwise uninteresting To Have and Have Not, where they took a few classy lines of script and made the air crackle.Standing between this stellar pair and that convoluted plot is director Howard Hawks, and this is where things get really neat. Rather than try to elucidate the story, Hawks buries it even further. At any moment which deals with the finer details of the plot, Hawks dresses up the image with shadows, movement or really whatever clutter is available. In the opening scene at Sternwood's house, the gloomy, cavernous interiors show off the old-world austerity of the place. He then makes a bizarre jungle of Sternwood's greenhouse, with bits of plant invading the foreground like tentacles. All of this is part of the atmosphere, or more precisely the trappings of film noir, and Hawks lays it on thick to immerse us in the picture's world. However, Hawks was exceedingly good at bringing individuals out of the mosaic. In the first scene between Bogart and Bacall, all the other business fades away, the sets become light and bare, and suddenly we are just looking at two people. Compare this to the scene in which Bogart finds a drugged-up Martha Vickers at Geiger's house, where Hawks places her to blend in with the lavish decoration. She is effectively part of the scenery, not a focal point as Bacall is.The upshot of all this is, we don't end up feeling as if we've been told a story as such, but we do feel we've been given an experience. When Sternwood sets the scene to Bogart, we are unlikely to pick up all he says about Regan or Geiger, but we do remember the old man's mutterings about brandy and cigars. When Bacall comes to Bogart's office, we don't recall what she has to say, but their funny telephone conversation, where Bogart pretends Bacall is his mother and Bacall pretends Bogart is her father, sticks in our minds. By all means, try and fathom what's really going on &#x96; it's a rather fun intellectual exercise for repeated viewings &#x96; but the real point of The Big Sleep is to give us the very essence of hard-boiled fiction, of mean-faced hit men and double-crossing dames.

Although there are exceptions, it is generally a safe rule of thumb that any novel whose main character is a novelist should be left on the bookshop or library shelf. About conceptual works of art whose purpose is to make a meaningful statement about the purpose of works of art, the less said the better. And when Hollywood makes a film about Hollywood the result is normally either introspective navel-gazing or smug self-congratulation.There are, however, exceptions. The early fifties saw two great movies about the movie industry, one a tragedy (Sunset Boulevard from 1950) and the other a comedy (Singin' in the Rain from two years later). Remarkably, both films were inspired by the same actress, Norma Talmadge. Talmadge is today a largely forgotten figure; she was a huge star in the silent era of the 1910s and 1920s, but along with John Gilbert became one of the major casualties of the coming of sound in the late twenties. She made two talkies, but neither was a success and her career came to an end in 1930. Part of the problem was her working-class New Jersey accent; American society is not as linguistically classless as some would like to believe. (Talmadge was still alive in 1952, and I often wonder what she made of these two films; in neither case is the character based on her portrayed in a very sympathetic way).Singin' in the Rain is set in the Hollywood of 1927. The Talmadge figure is Lina Lamont, a highly popular silent film star working for the fictitious studio Monumental Pictures. Lina has a crush on her handsome co-star Don Lockwood and convinces herself that he is in love with her. In reality Don has little time for Lina who is vain, shallow and stupid. (She is also to prove bitchy and spiteful). When the first talking picture, The Jazz Singer, proves an enormous success, the head of the studio decides that he will convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. (The film is a romance set during the French Revolution; Talmadge's final film, Du Barry, Woman of Passion was also set in eighteenth-century France). This, however, proves to be a problem, as Lina has a harsh and grating voice, and attempts to give her elocution lessons prove unsuccessful. A young actress, Kathy Selden, is hired to dub Lina's voice. The rest of the film deals with the growing romance between Don and Kathy and with Lina's sexual and professional jealousy of her young rival.Mention Singin' in the Rain to anyone today and they will probably think of the sequence in which Gene Kelly performs the title song, a sequence which has become famous, even among those who have not seen the actual film. Even parodies of it, such as the one performed by the British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, have become famous in their own right.There is, however, more to this film than just one single scene. It is often compared with that other fine Gene Kelly musical from a year earlier, An American in Paris. The two films, however, are quite different, and each has its own strengths. An American in Paris is certainly more visually imaginative, and I would also rank it higher in terms of its music. Although Singin' in the Rain has some well-known songs, including not only the title song but also the likes of Make 'Em Laugh and Good Morning, I would not class these as highly as Gershwin's music used in the earlier film. Both films have a balletic sequence designed to show off Kelly's dance skills. In An American in Paris he dances with Leslie Caron, who plays his love-interest in that film, but here his partner is not his leading lady Debbie Reynolds but rather Cyd Charisse, who does not actually have an acting role. (At this stage of her career Reynolds was not regarded as a dancer).In terms of plot and of humour, however, Singin' in the Rain is the better of the two films; the plot of An American in Paris consists of little more than a boy, a girl and a happy ending. The phrase musical comedy (like romantic comedy) does not always imply that a work is particularly humorous; it is often used as a description for any musical play or film except for the minority (like Carousel or West Side Story) which end tragically. Singin' in the Rain is one of the few musical comedies which is worthy of the name. It is one of the few Hollywood films which actually dare to make fun of Hollywood itself. A lot of the humour derives from the difficulties the industry encountered during the early days of sound, not only actresses with dodgy voices- Jean Hagen's Lina is a great comic character- but also problems in hiding the ungainly and not very effective microphones and in synchronising the sound with the picture. One of the themes is the antagonism between stage and screen during this period- during the silent era, and even in the early years of the sound era, stage actors, particularly classically trained ones, despised the cinema which they saw as a vulgar pantomime. Here Kathy claims to be a stage actress, although it later turns out her experience has been rather limited. There is also a lot of physical comedy, especially in the scenes featuring Donald O'Connor as Don's friend Cosmo.Singin' in the Rain was a hit at the box office, but it was not a great success with the critics, unlike An American in Paris, which won the Best Picture Oscar for 1951.

Depp wasn't his usual quirky character that we've come to associate with him through his many collaborations with director Tim Burton. Working here with a director other than Burton, Depp's character is more serious and has more depth (and Depp actually reminded me a little bit of Matthew McConaughey in this); Spencer Armacost is mysterious rather than quirky. As Spencer's wife Jillian, Theron breaks away from her usual strong woman persona and plays a much more vulnerable character who gradually realizes that she's caught up in something out of her control. Both Depp and Theron were quite good, although perhaps the best (if limited) performance in the movie was from Joe Morton as Sherman Reese, a NASA official who figures out the mystery that's going on here, but who no one takes seriously. His limited performance in his later encounters with Jillian as he tries to explain to her what's happening was actually riveting.The story has Spencer as an astronaut who survives some type of accident in space but was completely out of touch with NASA for two minutes. He returns to earth and everything seems normal. The question is - what happened during those two minutes? Neither Spencer nor his partner Alex (Nick Cassavetes) will talk about it. The story and the mystery unfold slowly (frankly, too slowly for my liking.) There's really very little to hold your attention through most of the first hour or so of this. Just vague hints of something being not quite right - but maybe Spencer just has a bad case of PTSD from his experience. There are surprises. Alex's unexpected death and his wife's totally unexpected suicide afterward add to the growing feeling that something's not right. Reese's re-introduction as the ex-NASA employee trying to warn Jillian probably represents the high point of the movie. The mystery (although we kind of suspected all along) is revealed and then it's a matter of seeing how it turns out. There's a spurt of energy and drama after that one hour mark as the movie picks up steam. Somehow, though, that dissipated rather quickly. The ending was - to me at least - unsatisfying; the last scene left too much up in the air.Basically, the performances are good, and there's a fair bit of potential in the story, and I appreciated seeing Depp and Theron in what were - for them - unconventional roles. The story was lacking though. It needed more meat, and it needed more tying up at the end.

C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved.

C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully.

When world media is too preoccupied with portraying Iran as a country where revolutions, reform movements and extreme corruption takes place, his films remind the world that there's another side to the beautiful country. 'Rang-e Khoda' displays the beauty through the simplicity of everyday life in Iran.The story revolves around a blind little boy named Mohammed who's been admitted to a boarding school for the blind and now that the summer holidays are about to begin, he eagerly awaits his father to take him home for the holidays. His father reluctantly arrives later than everyone else. He sees his son as a burden, a obstacle that prevents him from moving further in life. However, his grandmother and two sisters are thrilled to see Mohammed.The characters are beautifully written. Each and every one of them are recognizable as humans we have met at some point in life. Hashem, for example isn't an evil person. After losing his wife and his faith and being affected by poverty and aging, he has his own struggles to overcome and he sees his own son's handicap as another struggle while fearing that there will be no one to take care of him at old age. But all of this prevents him from seeing what a gifted, spirited, kind and lovable child Mohammed is.The cinematography is first rate. None of the shots look staged. Every setting looks raw and authentic. The Persian landscape is breathtaking. Music is used to a minimum. Actually, it's the sounds of nature that 'function' as background score by affecting the mood. Majidi also leaves some elements open to the viewer's interpretation such as the frightening sound of the 'djin' and the very ending itself.The performances are spellbinding. I wonder how the director got child actors to deliver such sincere performances. Mohsen Ramezani, Farahnaz Safari and Elham Sharifi act so naturally. Hossein Mahjoub is excellent as the tormented Hashem and Salameh Feyzi wins the audience's heart right from her first scene.Needless to say, Majidi's films are gems. As a lover of cinema,I find the experience of a Majidi film to be quite precious as they remind me of appreciating the beauty of daily life and nature.
