Both films were made in the '60's, in the then popular 'Scope technique of photography. Both feature a female protagonist through whose eyes we see events and who may or may not be entirely reliable. And both feature a big, spooky house with things that go bump in the night. But The Innocents is better than the other film in just about every way, and may be the best ghost story movie ever made, or at least the best I've ever seen.Deborah Kerr is perfectly cast as a prim governess who is given charge of two strange children in a huge, rambling English country estate. Kerr was known for playing nuns and nannies, and was the epitome of British refinement. So to see her playing this sprightly governess, who gradually unravels under the influence of the creepy goings on taking place in the house around her, adds an extra jolt of shock to her performance. I don't know that I've ever seen her play a role better than she does here, with perhaps the exception of Black Narcissus. In the story this film is based on, Henry James's Turn of the Screw, the state of the governess's mind is left ambiguous. Is she correct in assuming that evil forces are at work and are manipulating the children, or is she manufacturing everything in her head? The film's director, Jack Clayton, does an admirable job of trying to achieve this same ambiguity. The children are just creepy enough, and objective parties like the housekeeper seem freaked out enough, that the viewer suspects the house may indeed be haunted by ghosts. But Deborah Kerr plays the role so well, that it seems just as likely that she's conjuring situations from her paranoia. I won't tell you which is true, but few movies have an ending more shattering than this one.The Innocents is the best kind of creepy movie, because the creepiness is in the psychology of the characters, not in the film's effects. For a relatively short movie, it packs a lot of themes into its story sexual repression and deviance, obsessive protective instincts, the nature of evil. On top of that, it's got top-notch production values. The b&w cinematography has been much lauded, but kudos need to go to the art director for taking full advantage of the massive set (notice the use of flowers) and to the film editor for terrific use of dissolve editing.

I was actually amazed that as late as 1973, something this bad, which had production values from the early and mid 60s, was able to lure stars into it.I mean, the camera-work was horrendous, the editing was choppy, and the scenes were ridiculous. For example, after 1 woman wakes up to find a man dead next to her (with eyes reminiscent of eggs over easy) she looks and behaves as if she had just lost at bridge. Death doesn't cause anybody to get all that hysterical. In fact, it doesn't cause any display of emotion whatsoever. Nope, they are all behaving as if they have been pumped up with Prozac. Didn't any of the professionals realize just how unreal (and spectacularly bad) this was? But spectacularly bad doesn't even begin to describe phase 2 of the movie, which I like to call the Kojak moment. Suddenly, for reasons that had to be contractual in nature, Telly Savalas enters the flick and we all enter a giant parody of something (what, I do not know). It was very, very bad camp. Savalas chewed up so much scenery it is amazing that the cause of his death wasn't by choking. But it was as if he was in an entirely different film. Very jarring. At this point, the overacting was just jaw-dropping and I started begging for the movie to end.But it didn't. It went into phase 3.Phase 3 is the Night Of The Living Horror Express phase when all the egg-over-easy zombies come after the living.Thankfully, the movie eventually came to the end of the tracks, both literally and figuratively.I suspect that there was something in the gaze of these ghouls to transform normally reasonable moviegoers into raving fools who then go on to laud the virtues of this atrocious flick.See it with the lights on. If you keep them off, you risk falling asleep.

It's the kind of story that can only happen in movies, especially of the Hitchcock vein; I imagine the 'master' having his kicks making a movie like this, one that doesn't necessarily mess with the audience's head like Psycho, but has that same tension between the good vs. the evil (the latter of which not always as it might seem, to put it mildly). Two well-to-do men meet on a train, one more eager to talk than the other (this one being Robert Walker as Bruno, the elegant, pushy, scathingly funny antagonist to Farley Granger's Haines), and a 'criss-cross' murder scheme is presented forth. This leads the story into a carnival sequence that ranks among Hitchcock's finest (it's also fast-paced too, in a way, it keeps moving- finger snaps- and then leads up to something we know was going to happen, but like 'this' is the surprise).Then, of course, the even more morbid, creatively odd pieces of storytelling make their way into the fabric. It's not a whodunit, but rather an almost satire of the boredom and terrifying double-edged sword nature of the high-life. Bruno may be a truly wicked soul, but he's not totally un-likable; there is something about the Hitchcock villains, like in most of the great stories out there, that make them even more interesting than the protagonist. Not that Granger's performance is bad; he actually has a good handle on the sort of petrified look throughout the film. But it's Walker, and supporting players like Kasey Rogers as Miriam Haines, and surprisingly (maybe not too surprisingly) Hitchcock's daughter Patricia as the young sister with a 'similar' pair of glasses, who pull out the best acting.There are maybe a couple of minor liabilities, if not necessarily in my book then for others; a couple of scenes are so shameless to entertain that the art-value of the film *almost* becomes a little too incredible for its own good. That it's also not scored by the great Bernard Herrmann is also a downer. But other than that, the film is totally unpredictable, and therefore not only gives opportunities for some jaw-drops with its story turns, but also provides some very funny parts, once the tone is set. I sense a little in relation to a Bunuel film at times (Hitchcock did mention Bunuel as one of his favorites), like when Bruno 'crashes' a black-tie party of Haines', and gives two little old ladies an experiment in his ideals. This all leads up to another carnival sequence. I won't say too much of it, aside from it bringing some genuine thrills, but what shocked me was really how it culminated, that when things came to a head, it wasn't at the expense of the total disbelief of the situation. And that song can stick with you for days. This is one of Hitchcok's most entertaining films, still with some of that classy style from his films of the 40's, but also as a kind of bridge to the more outrageous films of his later years.

Coppola's backlighting and use of shadows is creative and unique. But, unfortunately, after a while his emphasis on style over content begins to eat away at the film's other strengths - the relationship between the heroine (Winona Ryder) and Dracula (Gary Oldman) is weak. Many story links are completely nonsensical and people appear and disappear at whimsy. The heroine's fiancée (Keanu Reeves) writes to her from Transylvania, asking her to depart at once to marry him; in a matter of one or two scenes she has suddenly traveled a vast distance and is standing at the alter prepared to wed. It seems like Coppola loses a grip on his characters and plotting very early on.Oldman gives a chilling performance but isn't given very much to do, because he's set aside and the special effects take over.

Yes, we all know the infidelities and troubles Mr. and Mrs. Fellini had in their life-long marriage. Like every other marriage we know.What is astonishing are the artistic treasures they left us.Nights of Cabiria is one among many of the finest films ever made.Sweet Charity, the musical rip-off of this masterpiece, cheapens the entire enterprise. Good intentions notwithstanding.We don't need Bob Fosse, and certainly not Shirley MacClaine replacing Giulietta Masina, nor second-rate Cy Coleman's score, to musicalize what was already a brilliant musical (thanks to Nino Rota and Bonagura).Fellini's film sings on its own, thank you.Sweet Charity is a perfect example of Hollywood and Broadway making a travesty of art.Sweet Charity -- film and stage performances -- are hollow, shallow exercises compared to the original film. Yeah, Shirley and Chita Rivera and Paula Kelly dance up a storm. Nothing to do with the story or the characters. Everything to do with making a musical. What fun! Unfortunately, Broadway and Hollywood cut out the heart. Dancing zombies.Fellini's film is the gem. Polished to within an inch of its life, though pretending to be a diamond in the rough. Like all Fellini's works.Giulietta Masina IS the tiny hooker you want to love. No Hollywood star playing a hooker she simply is. Like all (few) great actresses.Fellini knows what he has, in a wife, in an actress. He's genius enough to turn the camera on her and let her genius shine.Don't think she's a genius? Try La Strada.

Hollywood moved from studio to location filming, developed film noir (although it didn't know it was doing it) and tackled realistic film themes with a vengeance. It gave us The Best Years of our Lives and countless other masterpieces, Treasure of Sierra Madre is one of them.From the novel by the mysterious B.

Brilliantly directed by John Houston, it is today best remembered for Humphrey Bogart's amazing character performance as Fred C. Dobbs, the blow hard drifter whose paranoia eventually destroys him.Bogart, who had spent years in Hollywood in supporting roles, mostly as gangsters and thugs, had risen in the 40s to the spot where he was Hollywood's number one leading man, in part because the mannered tough guy persona he had perfected to play bad guys proved to be the perfect lone wolf image for the 40s. But with Treasure he moved into a whole new realm, taking on character roles which would prove the best of his career. They would include his performances in African Queen and perhaps his best role, in Cain Mutiny. But ironically, in Treasure, Bogie is out gunned by Walter Houston, who deserved the academy award he picked up for best supporting actor. His grizzled, but wise old miner is simply one of those roles that are unmatched in cinema --the culmination of decades of hard work and impeccable craftsmanship.Treasure is a wonderful movie on so many levels. It is a wonderful example of a real life adventure tale --one that people could have and did actually live.But more than anything else, it is the American experience -- put on film.

All I wanted to add was that this movie tops any of the Dracula films ever created, and actually goes so far as to make me appreciate the book moreYes, the book. This is the ONLY Dracula movie ever to stick almost directly to Bram Stoker's novel, and it does so with only one variation. In the novel, Mina Harker never has an affair with the Count, and never speaks to him except from at her husband's side. For that matter, nothing of Elisabeta was ever mentioned; obviously all of this just popped out of Francis Ford Coppola's head, and I admire that. Other that that... the movie follows the book practically page by page, through Jonathan Harker's journal, through Mina's letters, through Jack Seward's diary, and through Abraham Van Helsing's letters. You can say what you like about how boring Keanu Reeves was, or how over-the-top Winona Ryder was, but I believe that the characters in the film were excellently copied from those in the book, and that the movie was extremely well casted. (Jonathan Harker WAS boring, and Mina WAS a bit melodramatic, by the way...)I can't say which I like better, the book or the movie, but I can at least admit that Count Dracula is my favorite Gary Oldman role. The special effects and costuming are fantastic, and the supporting cast is amazing, as well. Anthony Hopkins's is the most true portrayal of Abraham (and the recently renamed Gabriel) Van Helsing, of any other in film, and you can only love his eccentric-godfather sort of role to Jack Seward. The diversion of the film from the EVIL of Dracula, to his more human side, is much different from the book, and is both refreshing and attractive.I have nothing more to say, except that any person who reads the novel, must next see this movie; it brings ideas to the mind that the book alone did not.

Mr. Williams never forgave his mother for letting his sister Rose undergo a lobotomy to cure her anxiety problems, something that he dealt with in this work, as well. As a play, this was done Off-Broadway, something unheard in those days about the work of one of last century's best regarded playwright. It proved to be a great artistic success for the author, even with a cast of non stars in it. In fact, Suddenly, Last Summer was paired with a shorter play, Something Unspoken, under the title Garden District.Joseph L. Mankiewicz, one of the best directors and writers that ever worked in Hollywood, undertook the direction of Gore Vidal's screen adaptation. In a way, it must have been a daring decision to bring it to the movies, since the play speaks about things that in the theater it could get away with, but in the movies, a different medium, and with the censure of those years, not even a distinguished team as the one assembled here, could get away with a movie that seemed to be years ahead of its time. The film is set in 1937.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.We meet young doctor Cukrowicz at the start of the film as he is about to perform a lobotomy on one of the patients in the public hospital, where the lights go out during the operation. The ambitious director, Dr. Hockstader, wants to send the young doctor to talk to Mrs. Violet Venable, one of the richest ladies in New Orleans, because she is interested in donating money toward a hospital's improvements, with the caveat that her young niece, Catherine, undergoes the operation. Evidently, she has been babbling all kinds of nonsense and has been diagnosed suffering from schizophrenia.What Mrs. Venable doesn't tell the young doctor is the reason why her niece is acting in such a strange manner. During the visit, she speaks of her dead young son, Sebastian, who died tragically, suddenly, last summer of a heart attack. Violet doesn't go into details, but it seems there is much more to the story than she tells Dr. Cuckrowicz. Mrs. Venable talks about her summer trips with Sebastian and the horrible experience she had in the Galapagos watching the young turtles rushing to the sea falling prey to the predatory black birds that seem to cloud the sky.That there's something more, is clearly noticed by the young doctor when he meets Catherine, the lovely young woman being kept in another hospital's mental ward. Catherine comes across as quite sane, which poses a moral dilemma for the Cukrowicz, who is under pressure to rush Catherine's lobotomy. Since he has so many doubts and in trying to see what's wrong with the girl, he hears about how Catherine and Violet have served as procurers to the late Sebastian.The climax comes as a family reunion in which Dr. Cukrowicz gathers in the Venable mansion's patio all the people involved in the case. It is in this setting that he is able to extract from Catherine's memory what she has kept bottled up there. In a sequence that plays as a film within Catherine's mind, we watch the horrors this young woman went through when the situation gets out of hand between Sebastian and the young men of Cabeza de Lobo, where they had spent part of their vacation.Tennessee Williams, the playwright, and Gore Vidal, the adapter, both spent time in Italy. It's somehow disorienting that Catherine is talking about Amalfi and changes to another location, the scene of what appears to be the martyrdom of Sebastian, paralleling the life of the saint of the same name, to Cabeza de Lobo, which sounds more as being set in Spain than in Italy. Nevertheless, these starving children Sebastian lures to him by using his gorgeous cousin in revealing swimsuit, are key to what happens to him in that shocking day.Katherine Hepburn is about the best thing in the film. She plays a refined and dignified wealthy New Orleans matron with great assurance. Ms. Hepburn gave an understated performance showing a restraint that with some other actress might have develop into caricature. Her Mrs. Venable is a woman whose sorrow for the lost of the son knows no bounds and is trying to shut up the only person that knows the truth about what really happened to him.Elizabeth Taylor makes an invaluable contribution to the film with her luminous portrayal of Catherine. She was seen in the film at the height of her beauty and youth. Ms. Taylor, in one of her best appearances in any film, is convincing as the young woman who has been traumatized by what she had witnessed that fateful summer.Montgomery Clift, who has the lesser part of Dr. Cukrowicz, does what he can with his role. Mercedes McCambridge, on the other hand is perfect as the ambitious poor relative without scruples, who will do anything to receive the crumbs of her richer relative and couldn't care what happens to her daughter.This film was ahead of its times and still packs a lot of power because of the direction of Mr. Mankiewicz and his stellar cast.

(This is not taken to mean that horror films do not have a good storyline but to mean that many do not because the horror and gore is more of the norm.) What 'Candyman' does succeed at is its ability to 'do' horror well. Typically, horror films are not frightening, even when they want to be. In fact, some of them can be downright amusing. 'Candyman' did have its creepy moments. Although I saw this film in my teens (12 or more years ago now), I remember the scene showing how the Candyman character became Candyman through torture by bees \/ his slave masters. That is really all that I can remember.I must not have thought the film was terribly frightening because I remember repeating his name in the mirror to impress the friend that I watched the movie with. Of course, nothing happened. Despite the creepy factor succeeding, I can only give this film a '2\/10' because it is not what I would consider to be a great film, and it is certainly not the best film in this genre.If you are looking for something to creep you out this Halloween, however, this is your film.

I've never sought out the film before because I assumed that it would be an uninvolved telling of an uninteresting piece of British history. I was wrong.The piece works on several levels, as they say. First, the period evocation is excellent. I became interested in this era after reading an interesting book on slum landlord Peter Rachmann a few years back (he is a minor character here). Christine Keeler was a figure who inhabited both the pot and ska parties of London's impoverished immigrant community and the bedrooms of the most powerful men in the land, and this breadth and contrast gives the film sufficient scope to successfully capture the energy and feel of the time.Second, the handling of character development is exemplary. The film surprises you by gradually shading in the relationship between Keeler and Stephen Ward, until their completely believable 'love affair' becomes the focus in the moving finale. Joanne Whalley and John Hurt are both exceptional as Keeler and Ward, turning in subtle and detailed performances. These characters are contradictory and ambiguous, the kind of complex human beings who could quite easily be reduced to type by lesser actors.Third, the film is made with real heart and intelligence. It is sympathetic to its characters and it strives to understand them, and thus help us to understand them. The director, Michael Caton-Jones frames and cuts with brilliant understatement, making potent and witty use of contemporary music throughout. I really didn't expect the seamless technique and low-key accretion of detail employed here, and it kept me fascinated.The tone of the picture is just right. A kind of compassionate sadness. We come to feel the real injustice of the moral and social hypocrisy bought to bear without being assaulted by it, and as noted before, the ending is powerful and affecting. It would appear that tabloid scumbags were as pernicious an influence then as they are now, and the observations thereon are as relevant as ever.If I had to find fault with the film, it would be this Ian McKellen models perhaps the least convincing bald pate in the history of cinema as John Profumo. So much so, that, for me, it impacts negatively on his otherwise notable performance. Its a minor flaw all told.I was surprised. I was impressed. I was moved.

We even get to see the original readings & auditions for the movie's parts, which have some interesting surprise stars who initially read for the film.I was pleased to see focus put on the teacher and the school kids responsible for bringing the book to Coppola's attention by sending him a petition requesting he be the one to direct the movie, as he'd done such a beautiful job directing The Black Stallion, another teenage classic. There is a great NBC news clip with Swayze & C.

Goodness! The Omen is fantastic - it has a good storyline, it is scary and creepy without the use of chainsaws, knives, blood or chase scenes. Damien is also great - the scene where he goes psycho in the car is very well done. I also love his clothes (being made in the seventies there are quite a few pairs of mini flares). Mrs Baylock, Damien's nanny is like a nightmarish Mary Poppins. It is a long film but there's a lot of story to fit in so it has to be. Another great scene is the tricycle scene. It is simple yet effective, what a horrible boy we all think, yet it also looks like an accident because he was just so into riding his trike. Is he really evil or was it just Mrs Baylock's fault? Ooooh! The goldfish falling is also a nice touch. (I read recently that Harvey Stephens who played Damien still has the tricycle.)
