Whilst he's serving his time, he befriends master forger Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman). At first, the two men merely share a friendship of 'convenience' - Papillon offers to protect Dega from other prisoners who are trying to get his money and in return Dega promises to finance Papillon's escape once he gets to the penal colony. However, as time passes a much stronger bond begins to develop between the two men and they both decide to try to escape together.The first thing I'd like to address with this film is its running time and at close to 150 minutes it's a very long film and the problem is that it actually feels like a long film. The first half of the film is particularly long and drawn out and I couldn't help but feel that the film was badly in need of being edited a bit.Despite the above gripe the film is still engaging and at times it's very moving. As mentioned, Dega and Papillon's friendship was one of convenience at the start, but as the years pass by a strong bond began to exits between the men and each respective stage of this friendship is brought to life beautifully between Hoffman and McQueen.For me, the best part of the film was McQueen's first stint in solitary confinement. Here screenwriters Trumbo & Semple Jr really highlight how 2 years in solitary confinement can cause a gradual deterioration of the mind - the dream sequences and hallucinations really help to get into Papillon's mind-set and see what he's thinking. McQueen's performance really helps as well and when watching him here I really cared for his character and felt his pain... In truth at times I forgot that I was actually watching Steve McQueen as I've always felt that he's a bit of a mediocre actor (he was particularly wooden in Bullitt), but I was genuinely surprised how good he was here. The only slight downside with this aspect of the film is that I got no feeling that Papillon had been on half rations for 6 months; it probably would have been more convincing if McQueen had gone 'method' and lost some weight during production, but I realise that this is an actor's choice and it's possible that they may have had a tight scheduling limit. It's only a minor criticism and as I said McQueen was excellent here and throughout the film. Hoffman was good as well, but I already knew that he was a good actor, but McQueen was the real revelation here.Although this is a serious portrayal of man's desire to escape from prison the film does have some light hearted moments such as the scene where Papillon and Dega are trying to capture the crocodile - that bit was very funny. The film is also emotionally involving particularly towards the end - I got the impression that Dega didn't go with Papillon because he'd become somewhat institutionalised and perhaps saw Devil's island as his home. The fact that his wife left him as well may have also made him feel that he had no real reason to leave. That's just my assumption.Papillon is a good film, but it does drag at times and is far too long. As far as Prison escape films go then this is inferior to the likes of Shawshank Redemption, Escape from Alcatraz & The Great Escape. However, if you're a fan of those films then you should find plenty to enjoy here too.

This is a significant character trait for Elwood, especially given the fact that he doesn't seem to work or have steady employment. He's in actuality the nicest man you may ever see in a motion picture (not Mr. Smith or George Bailey I should say)... and yet Elwood is also a drunk, though in keeping with his personality he's a pleasant, happy drunk it would seem as well. One wonders what would happen if he didn't have the booze - and one never sees what happens to that second martini he always orders, now do we - or all of those faces at the bar looking at him and his friend Harvey. Will anyone else see this pesky wabbit? Perhaps...Harvey is a charming, weird movie. It's weird because of how the movie takes on its premise, and actually treats it as a kind of serious comedy, or a very light-hearted drama. The factor I think is the mental hospital, where-in his sister wants to commit him (played by Oscar-winning Josephine Hull, mostly in a performance where she has to cry a good deal and be in hysterics). But, needless to say, due to a misunderstanding he commits *her* instead (and maybe latent sexism perhaps, that this male doctor doesn't trust this woman, but I digress), and Elwood walks out. Now the doctors and everyone gave to get him back. But will it be such a struggle to get him there? Stewart is the reason to see this movie, as is the case with all of his major performances and this is certainly one of them. As Dowd he commands the screen and yet is so genial and friendly to all of the characters. The movie is ultimately a comedy of manners as much (if not more) than about some crazy person. The writing, based on a play, takes the time to understand this man, and by proxy Stewart fully understands him, and really admires him it seems like. We kind of want to believe this rabbit exists (maybe, and this isn't a spoiler so much as a hint, maybe it does?) by how Elwood makes it seem... alright, somehow. What do you do with someone who isn't seeing things as 'normal', but has the sort of good manners and respect for others, even those who may not deserve it, that would give regal families a run for their money? Stewart gives Elwood charm and humility and, at one point, kind of a tragedy when he tells about what it is he does to the doctor and his assistant in the alley (that may be the best scene in the film).It may not be a perfect movie; the supporting performances are a mixed bag for me, or it may also be in the writing. As the characters scramble and get into misunderstandings and even a possible romance (!) blooms between one of the orderlies and Elwood's niece, it's a lot of like comic stuff that only adds so much to the narrative. And yet it's hard to begrudge these creations - and Hull, though sort of one note, gives Veta Simmons her all - because Elwood strips down their devices through so much kindness and warmth. If anything Harvey is so strange because it isn't afraid to be so genuine in spirit, and it's disarming at first (and the laughs are bigger, and sporadically it's a very funny time) and then one comes to see it's just how the movie is. And of course it's the right move to make the rabbit an invisible thing; the moment it's actually *there* on screen, the magic is lost.

The Coens from the offset are determined to present a film that is clearly set in the real world. It's always in the back of the mind of an audience. The sets are meticulous and detailed and certainly lend this false warning credence. Say for example the slow pan over the various messes of painting materials and avian inspiration that introduces the couple of Marge and Norm. It's a very modest and rather cramped home that they live in. Now compare this to Jerry's openly lit and generously spacious home. Their character's respective reactions to their economic status is but one of the telling signs that the Coens weave into Fargo. The casting also lends itself to the realism of the film. Almost all speak in a bumbling Minnesotan accent. For Marge and her associates the film's various events are just another day of their lives. Cinematographer Roger Deakins manipulates the colour temperature of the frame in order to evoke a sense of a harsh icy cold Canadian landscape. The palette is dominated by greys, whites and blues which accentuate the many outside scenes and the character struggles. Take for example the frustration and rage in which Jerry lashes out at the ice covering his windscreen, characterising yet another blunder in his plan. Or the desperation that Grimsrud shows as he tries to crawl away with snow in his face and a bullet in his leg. Perhaps the best example of Deakins' influence is a great shot which contrasts the harsh outside landscape of Fargo with the warmer, cramped interior of Norm and Marge's home. The physical barriers manifests in a division of the frame into two separate elements and creates an effective disparity that illustrates both the cold unforgiving nature and the cosy life that the couple share. And here you are. And it's a beautiful day. Carter Burwell's Norwegian folk-inspired theme builds up magnificently in the opening scene and chimes in occasionally with a few plucks of the harp and a hint of sleight bells, create a moody and heavy atmosphere much like the weather. For Jerry however, that is not nearly enough. It's a very different mindset which Willim H. Macy manages to display in a masterful performance as the spineless, pathetic and selfish cars salesman. He might be considered the central character; he is the first introduced in a rather innocuous way, presented as mild mannered, timid, polite. It's a very strange line then when we discover of his intentions to pay two criminals to kidnap his wife. Coens present a protagonist in front of us and promptly pull the rug from beneath our feet. But even with that revelation it's not such a clear cut moral view. The character of Jerry is slowly revealed to be more than meets the eye. They first agree on the modest sum of forty thousand split plus a car. It isn't until much later that we find out Jerry is actual double crossing them for a million, not to mention that he is embezzling cars from the dealership as well. The Tru-coat debacle is similarly revealed to be another of his scams. Macy plays the character with a panicked illusion of sincerity, using stuttering mannerism to great effect. His selfishness and self-centeredness is abruptly apparent when he arrives home with groceries and forgets the act of calling in a kidnapping for his own wife. Or when he completely forgets about the effects and impact this will have on his son. There's a great scene where he is arguing with Wade on how to deal with the ransom; Jerry's concern is completely genuine from a normal perspective but within the film is actually for the money. It's a great thematic moment where we truly question his motives. There's another important scene that is often overlooked. The meeting of Marge and Mike Yanagita seems meaningless at first but is the cause for a vital realisation within Marge. She is the bastion for morality within the film, and seems genuinely concerned for Mike if not a little out of her element. Even when Mike tries to get a little too close for comfort (despite her obviously pregnant belly) she waves it away without a second thought. It's not until later on when she finds out Mike was lying the whole time that she realises the moral deceit that she has witnessed. For Marge who hunts criminals all day, it never occurred to her that someone who she is familiar with and as another person in the crowd could have ulterior motives. Grimsrud and Showalter are respectively vicious and cold-blooded. Marge recognises another side of injustice and crime in Jerry the second time around after that lunch with Mike. But even so at the end of the film she still does not possess an understanding of their motivations or been violated by inherently bad nature. She lies in the small room of her house with her husband, celebrating a minor achievement and being content with her life. Jerry in his desperation for wealth is never once shown to be in that sort of lower status or have any good reason for needing to embezzle 320 thousand. It's a fantastic case of shifting protagonists, values and ideals. There's blurred boundaries even between the criminals and the ordinary white and blue collar workers. Consider the ineptitude and disdain that Jerry displays as he is finally caught out by Marge, or the curiously naive reaction of Jean to a masked man approaching her side door with a crowbar. Little details in the acting and direction create plenty of subtext that takes Fargo beyond the conventional definitions of characters and morals. It's a special little film.

The sets are meticulous and detailed and certainly lend this false warning credence. Say for example the slow pan over the various messes of painting materials and avian inspiration that introduces the couple of Marge and Norm. It's a very modest and rather cramped home that they live in. Now compare this to Jerry's openly lit and generously spacious home. Their character's respective reactions to their economic status is but one of the telling signs that the Coens weave into Fargo. The casting also lends itself to the realism of the film. Almost all speak in a bumbling Minnesotan accent. For Marge and her associates the film's various events are just another day of their lives. Cinematographer Roger Deakins manipulates the colour temperature of the frame in order to evoke a sense of a harsh icy cold Canadian landscape. The palette is dominated by greys, whites and blues which accentuate the many outside scenes and the character struggles. Take for example the frustration and rage in which Jerry lashes out at the ice covering his windscreen, characterising yet another blunder in his plan. Or the desperation that Grimsrud shows as he tries to crawl away with snow in his face and a bullet in his leg. Perhaps the best example of Deakins' influence is a great shot which contrasts the harsh outside landscape of Fargo with the warmer, cramped interior of Norm and Marge's home. The physical barriers manifests in a division of the frame into two separate elements and creates an effective disparity that illustrates both the cold unforgiving nature and the cosy life that the couple share. And here you are. And it's a beautiful day. Carter Burwell's Norwegian folk-inspired theme builds up magnificently in the opening scene and chimes in occasionally with a few plucks of the harp and a hint of sleight bells, create a moody and heavy atmosphere much like the weather. For Jerry however, that is not nearly enough. It's a very different mindset which Willim H. Macy manages to display in a masterful performance as the spineless, pathetic and selfish cars salesman. He might be considered the central character; he is the first introduced in a rather innocuous way, presented as mild mannered, timid, polite. It's a very strange line then when we discover of his intentions to pay two criminals to kidnap his wife. Coens present a protagonist in front of us and promptly pull the rug from beneath our feet. But even with that revelation it's not such a clear cut moral view. The character of Jerry is slowly revealed to be more than meets the eye. They first agree on the modest sum of forty thousand split plus a car. It isn't until much later that we find out Jerry is actual double crossing them for a million, not to mention that he is embezzling cars from the dealership as well. The Tru-coat debacle is similarly revealed to be another of his scams. Macy plays the character with a panicked illusion of sincerity, using stuttering mannerism to great effect. His selfishness and self-centeredness is abruptly apparent when he arrives home with groceries and forgets the act of calling in a kidnapping for his own wife. Or when he completely forgets about the effects and impact this will have on his son. There's a great scene where he is arguing with Wade on how to deal with the ransom; Jerry's concern is completely genuine from a normal perspective but within the film is actually for the money. It's a great thematic moment where we truly question his motives. There's another important scene that is often overlooked. The meeting of Marge and Mike Yanagita seems meaningless at first but is the cause for a vital realisation within Marge. She is the bastion for morality within the film, and seems genuinely concerned for Mike if not a little out of her element. Even when Mike tries to get a little too close for comfort (despite her obviously pregnant belly) she waves it away without a second thought. It's not until later on when she finds out Mike was lying the whole time that she realises the moral deceit that she has witnessed. For Marge who hunts criminals all day, it never occurred to her that someone who she is familiar with and as another person in the crowd could have ulterior motives. Grimsrud and Showalter are respectively vicious and cold-blooded. Marge recognises another side of injustice and crime in Jerry the second time around after that lunch with Mike. But even so at the end of the film she still does not possess an understanding of their motivations or been violated by inherently bad nature. She lies in the small room of her house with her husband, celebrating a minor achievement and being content with her life. Jerry in his desperation for wealth is never once shown to be in that sort of lower status or have any good reason for needing to embezzle 320 thousand. It's a fantastic case of shifting protagonists, values and ideals. There's blurred boundaries even between the criminals and the ordinary white and blue collar workers. Consider the ineptitude and disdain that Jerry displays as he is finally caught out by Marge, or the curiously naive reaction of Jean to a masked man approaching her side door with a crowbar. Little details in the acting and direction create plenty of subtext that takes Fargo beyond the conventional definitions of characters and morals. It's a special little film.

Having read many of Steve Gerber's Howard the Duck comics from the '70s, I can say they left me unimpressed in a guess you had to be there to get it kind of way. The comic was a satire on various trends from the '70s but mostly it just reads as dated now. Anyway, the movie is far from satirical. It's just a straight-up sci-fi comic adventure that requires no thinking. In fact, it discourages it. The first thing you notice about the movie is how ugly it is. Visually it is just awful. Most of it is dark and drab, kind of like the Masters of the Universe movie. The suit for Howard (which supposedly cost $2,000,000) is kind of creepy-looking and always very obviously is just a dwarf walking around in a duck costume. The special effects on the whole are unimpressive considering the budget, which was pretty big for the time.For years I thought it was impossible to make it past the first hour of this but I finally did it and I can honestly say that whatever weird charms this has, it really peaks by the half-hour mark. The voice for Howard is provided by Chip Zien, who sounds a lot like Steve Buscemi. He does about as good as you can expect given the script he had to work with. Tim Robbins stinks in a supporting role. Jeffrey Jones hams it up but provides most of the movie's few funny moments. Lea Thompson is the best part of it all. Her enthusiasm is contagious and every time I felt like turning it off she managed to keep me interested enough to keep going. The movie descends into full-blown stupidity with an extended slapstick plane and car chase sequence in the second half, which totally feels tacked-on because they could tell 'something' was missing and didn't know what else to do. There are some good parts, just not many. Space rabies, Playduck, the cheesy theme song finale, and adorable Lea Thompson are the highlights. But ultimately it's just a big bore that goes on way too long.

Directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca takes place during the early days of World War II in French Morocco where many European refugees were searching for a way to escape to the Americas and evade Nazi control. In Casablanca we are quickly introduced to the owner of a nightclub, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick is a bitter and cynical man who has decided to look out for himself and offer his clients a good time at his club. But when a man shows up and gives Rick a couple of transit letters that will allow the holder of these papers to travel freely through Europe in order to escape to the United States from Lisbon, they know they can make a lot of money by finding the right buyer. A married couple show up at Rick's bar to buy the letters and this is where we discover why Rick is so bitter. Victor's (Paul Henreid) wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), had met Rick in Paris a while back when she thought her husband, a resistance leader, had been killed during the War. The two had an affair, but when Ilsa discovered that Victor was alive and that he had escaped the Nazi concentration camp where he was held she leaves Rick without giving him any explanation. Rick has never been able to get over the betrayal and seeing her at his joint with her husband makes him even more bitter. And so the adventure begins as Rick must decide if he wants to help Victor and Ilsa escape from the Nazis or if he should simply look the other way. Claude Rains has a supporting role as a corrupt French official while Conrad Veldt plays a Nazi Major.Today we all praise the screenwriters for this film, but there was much skepticism during filming. Neither Bergman nor Bogart thought it was any good and some claim that they didn't want to work together. I don't think Michael Curtiz ever imagined this film would become such a beloved classic either, but somehow the film clicked in all cylinders and the story has stuck with audiences ever since. The on screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is the main reason why the romance works so well and the scenes they ask Sam to play their song on his piano is memorable. It's the best romantic film of all time in my opinion because it has it all romance, betrayal, and sacrificial love. There are so many beloved quotes in this film and it only gets better over time. The ending is also one of the best in any movie and one of the reasons why so many consider this such a revered classic, but I can point out several other emotional moments such as the scene where Sam is ordered to play a German patriotic song for the Nazi soldiers in the bar, only to have Victor respond by asking the band leader to play La Marseillaise and drown out the song from the Germans. Even the revelation scene where we get flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa's affair and discover how she never meets up with him at the train station and instead he's handed a farewell note from her, is quite emotionally engaging. The film offers plenty of thrilling scenes as well for those that aren't interested in the romance so there is no excuse for anyone not to see this classic. In case you forget how brilliant the screenplay is let me just remind you of some of the best quotes in this movie.Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. We'll always have Paris.

That was it in a nutshell just turn your brain off mayhem. This film I feel captures that, despite not meeting every expectation this film came pretty close.The film is a parody of the 50's sci-fi from the good to even the ones you might have seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000. As well as most of the Irwin Allen disaster films he was most famous for. It's not exactly one of the best parody films I've ever seen but it's solid.I really like the effects which are a combination of both CGI and practical which I feel actually hold up pretty well today. The aliens look just like the ones on the cards silly and butt ugly at the same time. Along with the technology like the giant robot which are always my favorites. And even like the laser effects and the way the people die, despite not gory it still looks brutal.I love the manic campy dark humored fun this film has, the whole film in a way plays out like a Mad Magazine cartoon, as each of the random things the Martians do are almost like comedy skits. From simply killing people in creative random ways like using one of the big robots to destroy a trailer with people we don't like which was a satisfying payoff. Commit petty vandalism, tour, you name it. I even like that the martians have comical personality which I feel fit them perfectly because like with the cards we're not meant to take them seriously. These guys are pretty much jerks, that you love to dislike both taking over the planet while fraking around and having fun in the process.Also I like the amount of clever humor it has, not just in visuals but verbal. The verbal humor is just fraking hilarious were the dialog is deliciously bad, some of the things certain random human characters say and even the Martian's sometimes can make you both laugh and groan at the same time. It's kinda funny because it's true in most disaster or badly made alien invasion flicks, sometimes they would have that dialog no matter how chessy or bad it was, some lines they said were fondly memorable.Even the human characters are fun, okay I wouldn't say their characters their more like charachures and that's the point. Just like in the cards their all one or two dimensional characters, and most of them are as moronic as most of the populace of South Park, which of course make the Earth all the more ripe for take over. I like that they have a little personality and also the fact that it consists of a really huge A list cast which is both surprising but makes it all the more funny as each of them are just hamming and cheasing up the caricature's they play. It's also funny because most disaster films from Irwin Alien always consisted of a big A list cast for some weird reason.Really like the young main protagonist played by Lucas Haas along with his grandma. Both have a good back and forth, and I like the fact that in a way she's a better parent than his real parent whom are a couple of unlikable lowlifes. The grandma says one of my favorite lines, They killed Congress. I couldn't help but crack up a bit from the way she said it but also something in the dark part of my mind I'd love for aliens to do since we have one too many corrupt politicians in the cabinet already.Jim Brown along with Pam Grier are really solid and it was great seeing both of them together once more since both are Blackpotation alumis, though I don't think and even they didn't think it would be this movie which make it all the more funny. Really like that their kids are bad asses as we see both get the aliens guns and are actually kicking more ass than the secret service, for a highly trained protection force they really suck. And liked it when Jim Brown was fist fighting against one of the aliens and breaking the glass, he could almost be like a Shonan anime protagonist because he's got some super human knuckles to be breaking though glass without getting cut.Rod Steiger as a over the top gung ho general along with Jack Nickelson as the president are just hilarious. From seeing the General so determined to kill the aliens.

That was it in a nutshell just turn your brain off mayhem. This film I feel captures that, despite not meeting every expectation this film came pretty close.The film is a parody of the 50's sci-fi from the good to even the ones you might have seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000. As well as most of the Irwin Allen disaster films he was most famous for. It's not exactly one of the best parody films I've ever seen but it's solid.I really like the effects which are a combination of both CGI and practical which I feel actually hold up pretty well today. The aliens look just like the ones on the cards silly and butt ugly at the same time. Along with the technology like the giant robot which are always my favorites. And even like the laser effects and the way the people die, despite not gory it still looks brutal.I love the manic campy dark humored fun this film has, the whole film in a way plays out like a Mad Magazine cartoon, as each of the random things the Martians do are almost like comedy skits. From simply killing people in creative random ways like using one of the big robots to destroy a trailer with people we don't like which was a satisfying payoff. Commit petty vandalism, tour, you name it. I even like that the martians have comical personality which I feel fit them perfectly because like with the cards we're not meant to take them seriously. These guys are pretty much jerks, that you love to dislike both taking over the planet while fraking around and having fun in the process.Also I like the amount of clever humor it has, not just in visuals but verbal. The verbal humor is just fraking hilarious were the dialog is deliciously bad, some of the things certain random human characters say and even the Martian's sometimes can make you both laugh and groan at the same time. It's kinda funny because it's true in most disaster or badly made alien invasion flicks, sometimes they would have that dialog no matter how chessy or bad it was, some lines they said were fondly memorable.Even the human characters are fun, okay I wouldn't say their characters their more like charachures and that's the point. Just like in the cards their all one or two dimensional characters, and most of them are as moronic as most of the populace of South Park, which of course make the Earth all the more ripe for take over. I like that they have a little personality and also the fact that it consists of a really huge A list cast which is both surprising but makes it all the more funny as each of them are just hamming and cheasing up the caricature's they play. It's also funny because most disaster films from Irwin Alien always consisted of a big A list cast for some weird reason.Really like the young main protagonist played by Lucas Haas along with his grandma. Both have a good back and forth, and I like the fact that in a way she's a better parent than his real parent whom are a couple of unlikable lowlifes. The grandma says one of my favorite lines, They killed Congress. I couldn't help but crack up a bit from the way she said it but also something in the dark part of my mind I'd love for aliens to do since we have one too many corrupt politicians in the cabinet already.Jim Brown along with Pam Grier are really solid and it was great seeing both of them together once more since both are Blackpotation alumis, though I don't think and even they didn't think it would be this movie which make it all the more funny. Really like that their kids are bad asses as we see both get the aliens guns and are actually kicking more ass than the secret service, for a highly trained protection force they really suck. And liked it when Jim Brown was fist fighting against one of the aliens and breaking the glass, he could almost be like a Shonan anime protagonist because he's got some super human knuckles to be breaking though glass without getting cut.Rod Steiger as a over the top gung ho general along with Jack Nickelson as the president are just hilarious.

This is one of those movies where someone could argue with me up and down how bad it is and I wouldn't care because I adore it. I've seen it dozens of times but it had been awhile so watching it again was a delight all over. I read the book years ago too and the film is very close to the book. The characters and story and drama and comedy and romance is near perfect. It is just completely entertaining and touching and so well acted. I am certain that this will be a classic in the years to come. Films to me are meant to be entertainment. That is the ultimate goal. There are exceptions to that of course (art, education, theories, knowledge) films can be all these things but I love when a movie is just simple and entertainment and Where The Heart Is is exactly that. I love these characters and their interaction and the things that happen to them over the course of the film. The soundtrack is also very good and the setting of the small town just really warms your heart. It is everything you could expect and then some and always leaves me smiling.Natalie Portman is a star. She has been a star since she was just a little girl and she is still a star today. This was when I really noticed her for the first time as an actress because she is absolutely endearing in this role. She is simple but so far from stupid and her characters goes through such an incredible arc through the course of the film. She might be one of my favourite movie characters. Ashley Judd is fantastic as Portman's best friend and a struggling single mother. She actually gets a huge story arc herself and its often moving and hard to watch and uplifting in the end. Their chemistry is terrific and Judd is phenomenal. Stockard Channing adds a level of expertise to the film as the lovable Sister Husband. She becomes a surrogate mother to Portman and although her role is less substantial, its important and a great part. James Frain is fantastic in a subtle brooding sort of way as the brilliant and tortured soul Forney. Frain also has a great story arc and his chemistry with Portman seems odd at first and then completely wins you over. Joan Cusack and Dylan Bruno round out the supporting cast and both are truly outstanding. Some might say these characters are a little cookie-cutter but the film covers such a wide span of time and they go through so much that you'll become completely attached to them.Considering how much happens and how much time the film covers, the pacing is near perfect. It never feels rushed and makes sense and is believable even in the most ridiculous sense. The film feels genuine and honest and fun and you can't ask for more than that from a movie like this. I think its a complete shame that Matt Williams, best known as a producer, didn't do a lot of directing after this. He holds everything together and keeps everything flowing nicely and while the film doesn't exactly stand out in style, it is still no small feat to hold it together with very bold characters. If you have not seen the Wal-Mart Baby movie...please see it. It is one that I cannot recommend enough. You will laugh, cry, rejoice and meet some really cool folks.

Ray, at first, has no idea what this could mean. He consults his wife, Annie Kinsella (Amy Madigan), to try and gain an idea as to what it means. After she laughs and tells him he is going crazy. Ray begins to believe that he must build a baseball diamond in his corn field on his property in Iowa. As Amy begins to believe Ray, Ray embarks on a journey to get Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and set him free. Throughout the journey the audience follows Ray as he constructs a baseball field, befriends strangers, and creates magic that must be seen to be believed.Throughout the movie, there is a main theme that becomes prevalent, this theme is that one must always pursue their dreams or ambitions, no matter what people may say or believe against it. Even though Ray is told many times over, by Annie, Terrance, and others that his dream and idea is impossible and foolish, Ray still follows his heart to create what must be made. Annie is the first one to tell Ray that his vision is crazy. But, after an eerie dream with relevance to this vision, Annie believes in Ray and begins to support his cause. The next to try and stop Ray is Terrance. Terrance is not easily swayed by Ray. When they first meet, Terrance is scared and taken back by this irrational vision a stranger presents to him. But, after Ray takes Terrance to a baseball came, and they both see a vision on a screen, Terrance becomes swayed and believes in the vision of Ray Kinsella. Another movie that is similar to Field of Dreams, sharing a similar theme, is Mulan. Even though Mulan is in another category of movie, they share a similar theme. Mulan wants to fight, even though she is a woman, and women are not allowed in the army. Mulan changes her appearance to seem like a man and fights in the army, even though it is against believe. This theme, to pursue one's passion regardless of adversity, is shared between both films.Along with the storyline, there are other features in the movie that promote the theme of Field of Dreams. The first, is the angle. Throughout the movie, when Ray is hearing these voices, the camera begins to focus solely on him, and slowly spin around, showing the importance of this moment, and the cycling of thoughts through Ray's mind. Another technique that is used is the lighting. The lighting in certain scenes focus on Ray, as he drives towards his goal. When he is working in the field on the baseball diamond, even though it may be dark, there is a light on Ray to show his determination. Ultimately, Field of Dreams portrays Ray Kinsella's path and focus in a superb way and engulfs the audience in a terrific journey of surprise and compassion.

Throughout the movie, when Ray is hearing these voices, the camera begins to focus solely on him, and slowly spin around, showing the importance of this moment, and the cycling of thoughts through Ray's mind. Another technique that is used is the lighting. The lighting in certain scenes focus on Ray, as he drives towards his goal. When he is working in the field on the baseball diamond, even though it may be dark, there is a light on Ray to show his determination. Ultimately, Field of Dreams portrays Ray Kinsella's path and focus in a superb way and engulfs the audience in a terrific journey of surprise and compassion.

Ray, at first, has no idea what this could mean. He consults his wife, Annie Kinsella (Amy Madigan), to try and gain an idea as to what it means. After she laughs and tells him he is going crazy. Ray begins to believe that he must build a baseball diamond in his corn field on his property in Iowa. As Amy begins to believe Ray, Ray embarks on a journey to get Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and set him free. Throughout the journey the audience follows Ray as he constructs a baseball field, befriends strangers, and creates magic that must be seen to be believed.Throughout the movie, there is a main theme that becomes prevalent, this theme is that one must always pursue their dreams or ambitions, no matter what people may say or believe against it. Even though Ray is told many times over, by Annie, Terrance, and others that his dream and idea is impossible and foolish, Ray still follows his heart to create what must be made. Annie is the first one to tell Ray that his vision is crazy. But, after an eerie dream with relevance to this vision, Annie believes in Ray and begins to support his cause. The next to try and stop Ray is Terrance. Terrance is not easily swayed by Ray. When they first meet, Terrance is scared and taken back by this irrational vision a stranger presents to him. But, after Ray takes Terrance to a baseball came, and they both see a vision on a screen, Terrance becomes swayed and believes in the vision of Ray Kinsella. Another movie that is similar to Field of Dreams, sharing a similar theme, is Mulan. Even though Mulan is in another category of movie, they share a similar theme. Mulan wants to fight, even though she is a woman, and women are not allowed in the army. Mulan changes her appearance to seem like a man and fights in the army, even though it is against believe.

New Bond movies were very frequent back then, pretty much one per year. Connery returned for more movies, but for director Terence Young it was his third and final installment. And he went out on a high note as Thunderball won the only Visual Effects Oscar of the whole franchise. All in all, there are a total of four wins. The most recent entry Skyfall actually managed half of these. And the very first went to Goldfinger.Thunderball is a worthy addition to the series. However, I have to say it is not really outstanding in any regard. Largo I personally found one of the more forgettable villains of the series and his henchmen are not too memorable either. Rosa Klebb, Goldfinger, Oddjob or Dr. No from previous films were all somewhat more special in my opinions and made their films really worth watching. In terms of the story it's also nothing that hasn't been done before. However, this time it is more about a terrorist attack than about Cold War. Bond and the MI6 know by now that it's not the Russians doing bad things to the western world, but that it is actually SPECTRE. Our hero has to recover two stolen atomic warheads this time before Largo can fire them on Miami or a major British city. Oh yeah, but Claudine Auger is as attractive as it gets, easily among the hottest Bond girls in history. And then there are Q, M, Moneypenny and Leiter, all the usual suspects, but none of them with much impact or screen time in this one.There are several pretty good scenes, such as the scene where Bond is almost killed on that spine stretching machine, maybe an equivalent to the laser machine from Goldfinger, the scene in which Bond quickly turns around during the dance scene before he gets shot, the very early scene where we see how Blofeld deals with traitors, the Big Ben reference and a handful more. However, the several underwater scenes I found not too thrilling really, even if these were maybe the ones that resulted in the Academy Award win. But I really love Tom Jones' song, maybe the most memorable aspect for me personally and easily in my Top3 Bond songs, if not number one. Quite a shame it was not featured that much during the film like other Bond songs. This would have made a great Academy award winner. All in all, I enjoyed watching these over 2 hours, but I feel no need to watch it anytime soon. A good watch for people who love spy movies. Recommended.

British comedy of the late 20th century was up to par with early British cinema as this movie proves. Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley are riotously funny in their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. Equally hilarious is Jeffrey Jones as Inspector Lestrade. Besides this film, another comedy crime film was made in Europe the same year &#x96; 1988, with Michael Caine and Steve Martin. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels took place along the French Riviera &#x96; the Cote d'Azur. Scoundrels was a smashing success, this one wasn't. It's curious to me that they were first released in the U.S. and then in several other countries before England, several months later. Scoundrels was released two months after this film, and was the more widely promoted and distributed of the two. So, it is better known today. But Without a Clue is an equally brilliant comedy, if of a different design. Scoundrels is a wonderful situational film with great humor and competition between two (or more) types of scam operators. Without a Clue is a farce built on witty, hilarious dialog. I don't know whose idea it was, but this parody of Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth stories is fantastic. The writers did a superb job. In a nutshell, Doyle's Watson is changed from a chronicler of Holmes adventures to a writer of fiction. He is the creator of the character, whose shoes are filled by Caine's character, an all but unknown stage actor by the name of Reginald Kincaid. And, Watson is the brains behind the duo, and the only real super detective. In essence, Caine is the front in his fictitious character. Trouble is, it's all taking place right then and there in London, and the cases are very real. So the public is eating up the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and the character. Because the cases are real, he's real. It is sort of a flight of fancy to imagine that Watson is writing a story, Holmes is memorizing his part, and then the actual crime\/case takes place. But, rather than wrestle with that, it's best to go with the flow of the movie to enjoy the humor. This is definitely not one that some describe for turning off one's brain. Do that and you'll miss much of the humor in the witty lines. Besides the dialog, this is a great comedy of expressions. That's where the acting comes in &#x96; for the sake of comedy. Just watch Watson's face as he rolls his eyes at another Holmes goof-up. Watch Lestrade's face as he raises his eyes as though trying to look into his head &#x96; wondering if there's anything in what he just heard or saw. And watch the smile and the twinkle in his eye as Holmes boastfully pontificates on his achievements in the case. And, by the way &#x96; Caine's Holmes is not a buffoon. He does have a brain and is capable of giving a good rejoinder when put on the spot. But, as Watson says, he's just incompetent and doesn't have a clue. Finally, there are a number of hilarious situations &#x96; the writers put comedic stuff in everywhere. Caine, ever the ham actor Kincaid, is basking in the adulation of his many admirers. But the brilliant Watson wasn't smart enough to realize the psychological effect this would have on him. Because after a while, he's not content to let Holmes have the glory from the success of his story &#x96; so to speak. He's envious of the praise heaped upon Holmes. He can't stand it when an idiot like Holmes &#x96; which he calls him, receives all the praise and adulation. Particularly since Holmes really doesn't have a clue in solving any of the cases. I don't know if there's a word for this type of writing and film. But, the English Hollywood folks did an outstanding job all around on it. The directing, cinematography, editing, sets and all technical aspects are wonderful. The musical score by Henry Mancini fits the film perfectly. And the writers with their superbly clever and witty script provide the fuel to make this such a hilarious comedy. The threesome of Caine, Kingsley and Jones pull this off in riotous order. I can only image the laughs and fun they must have had in the making of this movie.I so enjoy laughing and chuckling in a wonderful film such as this. This is one of those rare films that a person can watch time and again, without much time between viewings, and enjoy it anew with much healthy laughter. It's so funny and so good, it doesn't wear thin. It is there to enjoy for years to come. What a clever plot! What a funny, witty script! What superb and hilarious acting!

I can only image the laughs and fun they must have had in the making of this movie.I so enjoy laughing and chuckling in a wonderful film such as this. This is one of those rare films that a person can watch time and again, without much time between viewings, and enjoy it anew with much healthy laughter. It's so funny and so good, it doesn't wear thin. It is there to enjoy for years to come. What a clever plot! What a funny, witty script! What superb and hilarious acting! This is what great cinema entertainment is supposed to be. Without a Clue joins Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and a few dozen others in my library of 10-star comedy films.

All those years of chain-smoking and heavy bourbon drinking (he missed several days on the set because he was too hungover to work) had finally caught up with him. Bogey's decrepit appearance, together with that glistening, disgusting drool that always accumulated at the corners of his mouth, was hardly the image of a leading-man. Warner's unwisely went with the premise that Marlowe, Bogey's character, was a sexy sleuth who had young dames going after him right and left. The unintentionally hilarious scenes of having 19-year-old starlets throwing themselves at the dour, aging Bogey (like the steamy Dorothy Malone and her whiskey-infused attempt to seduce Bogey as she closes her bookstore, or the unbelievably sexy Martha Vickers, who wrapped herself like a snake around Bogey) comes off as a ridiculous tableau of nubile young women instantly attracted, however unlikely in reality, with the toupee-wearing, narrow-shouldered geezer who wore his belt line almost up to his ribs. Pic was filled with such laughable bits, such as when Bogey jumps into a cab, orders the strikingly beautiful young driver to follow another cab, telling her It's a tail job, and she quickly reposts with a lascivious grin, I'm your gal! That line might have gotten a great laugh if Bogart had reacted with even a scintilla of ribald humor, but as usual he seemed straight-jacketed within his stuffy, signature anti-hero-living-by-his-own-code persona. What a dud of a romantic leading man. Bogey was a real man's man, never a lady's man, and the problem was that in this film (and all of his films) he never really seems sexually interested in any of the women in the cast. He leaves Dorothy Malone in her bookstore to follow a suspect he'd been staking out across the street just as he is about to close the deal with Malone. Seriously!? It would have taken a team of draught horses to pull any real, red-blooded man away from the breathless, sexually eager Malone. Author Raymond Chandler remarked that the coquettish Martha Vickers totally upstaged Lauren Bacall's stiff and sterile perf with her intense performance in the original cut (shown in 1945 only on a limited basis overseas to U.S. troops). Warner's writers later tried to build up Bacall in the theater release version with added love scenes shot with Bogey and Bacall nearly a year later, in 1946, after the principal photography had wrapped (Bogey and Bacall had by then just been married), intending to inject at lest a modicum of sexual energy into the boring, stale chemistry between them in the earlier cut. Most tragically, Warner's cut out and left on the cutting-room floor most of Martha Vickers' scene-stealing role so it wouldn't further detract from Bacall's gawky, unconvincing performance. What a shame.The added love scenes with Bogey and Bacall seem contrived, flaccid, and sexless, almost as if Bacall could hardly wait to wipe Bogey's drool from her own mouth. The unfortunate Bacall was also stuck with lines so trite and on the nose she must have been mortified to have to say them, as when he kisses her I like it. I'd like more. Ugh. Who wrote this doggerel? A Nobel Prize winner in literature? Oh, wait, it was! Faulkner won the Nobel just a few years later. Go figure.Dorothy Malone should have won the Best Supporting Oscar for her all-too-short, serpentine duet with Bogey in her bookstore. Martha Vickers' nymph-like, seductive performance was borderline pornographic, but had in spades what is always missing in pornography genuine sensuality. Malone and Vickers were real actresses who simply blew the lightweight Bacall right off of the screen. 6 out of 10, primarily for the small yet unforgettable performances by Vickers and Malone, otherwise I'd give it a very reluctant 4.

Having previously heard about all of the things that have been said about this movie, I decided that I would give it a watching, and I have to say, that I was certainly dazzled by what I saw. TRON contains what one would expect a movie to have, its well written, well acted, and especially, it contains absolutely outstanding special effects. Basically, the effects in this movie are like no special effects that you have ever seen, they are so extraordinary, you might not believe your eyes. This movie wasn't nominated for The Academy Award For Best Visual Effects, because it was considered cheating to use a computer at the time, although this was later changed, but it would have made a bigger difference had this film been nominated in that category. Anyway, TRON is a very exceptional film that is guaranteed to dazzle just about anybody who watches it, and that is the truth.Also, we've got a good line of performances from the cast. The always talented Jeff Bridges is very good in his role as Kevin Flynn, the computer hacking protagonist. Bruce Boxleitner and Cindy Morgan also are very good, but the best performance in the movie would have to be that of David Warner, who plays Ed Dillinger. Warner has usually been known for playing the villain more than the hero, and if you ask me, the villain role suits him perfectly, as he was hands down the best one in the movie, not that the other cast was bad, as they did good, but Warner was the best. But as one all knows, the highlight of the movie would have to be the absolutely groundbreaking and breathtaking special effects, which for the time were like nothing anybody had ever seen before.
