When I was sixteen, all three of the Austin Powers movies were out in stores, and I finally watched them all in reverse order. I have now seen each of them several times, and recently watched this one, the original Austin Powers International Man of Mystery, for the first time in a couple years (back when I last watched the entire trilogy). It was my first time seeing it after watching all the James Bond movies in order, so I now understand some of the parodies, and I think my latest viewing of this 1997 comedy was a lot like the one before it. I may not like it as much as I did as a teenager, but I still laughed, you can be sure about that. It's definitely more watchable than the 1967 version of Casino Royale, and probably certain other lacklustre Bond spoofs as well.In 1967, Austin Powers is a British secret agent and a stereotypical 60's womanizer. His archenemy is Dr. Evil, a man with plans for world domination! One night, while the agent chases after his foe, the evil doctor manages to get away in a rocket, where he cryogenically freezes himself, and plans to return sometime in the future! Powers is then cryogenically frozen so he will be available to continue his battles against the madman whenever he happens to come back. Dr. Evil finally returns from suspended animation thirty years later, in 1997, and immediately reunites with his colleagues to figure out new ways to try and take over the world! So, Powers is unfrozen and sent with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of a woman he worked with in the 60's, to once again try and foil his archenemy's plans. Unfortunately for Powers, a lot has changed in thirty years, and his womanizing ways will no longer be tolerated.Comedian Mike Myers, who wrote the story, plays two characters in the film, Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. He does a good job with both, playing a likable, charming fool and goofy parody of James Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Both of these characters can still make me laugh with their antics. The washroom stall gag, Powers mistaking the mother of his boss, Basil Exposition, for a man in disguise, and the conflict between Dr. Evil and his son, Scott, are three things I can point out as comic highlights, but those aren't the only ones. Certain other characters can be quite funny as well, such as Frau Farbissina, a villain played by Mindy Sterling, with her screech, and Mustafa, Dr. Evil's henchman played by Will Ferrell, even though this chararacter isn't in the film for long. Yes, this is a raunchy comedy, with sex, nudity, and some language, which I don't have a problem with, as long as it's funny, but if this type of dirty humour bothers you, and\/or you don't care for Mike Myers as a comedian, then Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is not for you. However, if you like Myers' sense of humour and want to laugh, this James Bond spoof could be your kind of comedy.

He relayed a story about when he spoke with Walt in 1951 and mentioned how great he thought this mix of sound and images was. Walt responded by saying, but it hasn't made any money yet. And that was ten years after its release. He did say that Disney still held strong to his convictions that it was what he needed to make at that time. In 1940, he believed that showing a visceral experience like Fantasia was just what the medium called for; it was the natural evolution of animation in his mind. You have to respect that, no matter how much money he lost after its four-year creation process, employing thousands of animators, it was all about the craft. When you look at the state of the genre today, with about ten films a year from multiple studios, many of them drivel, it is definitely a treat to go back seventy years and see what actual hands drew for the world to see. Frame by frame, note by note, you really can't deny the brilliance of this film, even if you probably will fall asleep at least once each viewing.I remember the first time I had seen Fantasia, I was young and it was one of the few Disney films I had yet to experience. I hated it. It was the most boring thing I'd ever seen. Even when Mickey Mouse finally showed face, with that wizard hat I had seen in so many pictures, I could care less. Truthfully, I might not even have finished it, (when intermission came halfway through, I told my friend that I couldn't even remember what else there was, all my memories had played in Act 1). But I kept thinking about the film each year later. As I grew older and started pursuing a career in the arts, it nagged at me that I didn't appreciate the feat. Then Fantasia 2000 came out and I began to see what I missed in the original so many years before. So, when it was announced that Fantasia was coming to Buffalo's premier theatre Shea's, it was an invite that was tough to pass up.Admittedly, I almost nodded off a few times during the two-hour duration. But that is not meant to detract from the wonder this film instills, not at all. From the narration amongst the Philadelphia Orchestra by Deems Taylor, in partial silhouette, complete with a prologue to each song, (whether they be the kind of music that tells a definite story, the kind that has no specific plot, or that which exists simply for its own sake), to the image of conductor Leopold Stokowski standing alone on his platform, to the animation on screen, working from the music, telling its story, you will be transported to a different world. It is not for everyone&#x97;especially little children this day and age with no attention spans, (many parents left with their offspring early on)&#x97;but if you're willing to let it wash over you, and enjoy the works of Bach, Tchaikovsky, etc., you won't be disappointed. It's a concert film above all else; you're just watching animation rather than the musicians and their instruments.And you cannot deny the artistry of it all, oftentimes hearkening to future films Disney would be making. You can see the precursors to Tinkerbell in the naked fairies flying around as well as the donkey used that same year in Pinocchio. The abstract illustrations are intriguing, but my favorites are definitely the ones steeped in some biomorphic form. I absolutely love the Nutcracker Suite vignette, find the Sorcerer's Apprentice to be wonderful, and really get blown away by some of the finale, the combo of Night On Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. In that final sequence you get to see some amazing artwork in the devilish, winged creature as well as the architectural forms during the light moments at the end. At times you see frames with immense amounts of gradation and depth, moments where the stark flat colors usually seen, meld into still frames gorgeously painted as though works of art, not something to be seen for a fraction of a second. I'm not sure exactly what causes this, but those freeze-frames are my favorite part of the film.So, is Fantasia a great film? I don't really know how to answer that question. I can appreciate it for what it set out to do, and deem it a complete success in that regard, but would I rather watch it then the likes of Disney classics like Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, or Robin Hood? No. That said, though, I would recommend it to anyone out there with an open mind and ability to see past the commonplace and mainstream. Some may say you can only truly enjoy your experience if you are on drugs, that the creators themselves were at the time, but that is a disservice. Fantasia is a world that needs to envelop you and become your sole visual focal point for two hours. If you are willing to put in the time, Disney's epic will not lead you astray.

","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"5 April 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas as the best next to Fargo (1996) but also labeled it the best mob movie ever. A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, Goodfellas is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to The Godfather (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace The Godfather (1972) as the best mafia movie, Goodfellas would be it.Goodfellas is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.Unlike other mob movies, Goodfellas does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves. The movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the Ray Liotta character immediately states afterward As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States&#x85;it was there that I knew that I belonged.This is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and Martin Scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. In regards to the cast, it is perfect. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. The only part I thought was wrongly developed was Lorraine Bracco's character. I just felt the character was either too over the top or Bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. There is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which I felt was just a little too long. But these few minor flaws aside, Goodfellas is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where Hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range.

","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"5 April 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas as the best next to Fargo (1996) but also labeled it the best mob movie ever. A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, Goodfellas is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to The Godfather (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace The Godfather (1972) as the best mafia movie, Goodfellas would be it.Goodfellas is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.Unlike other mob movies, Goodfellas does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves.

He detonates a few bombs in New York City and sends McClane on Fools Errands while covering up his real scheme to steal gold reserves.

Zeus Carver has a nationalistic mentality and John McClane is your not-so-average white-bread cop. Despite their differences they still get together to handle the same goal. Zeus despite his prejudices was still a factor in helping McClane solve those riddles which were more clever than the riddles that were given to you by Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever.Jeremy Irons is magnificent as Simon Peter Gruber.

So yes. I thought. I thought, 'Wow - this is an incredibly bad film.' Again, reading other reviews, I am confronted with the idea that perhaps Doctor Bill's wanderings through NYC are really just some kind of dream or fantasy sequence. I don't know where this idea came from - perhaps the book itself but I can definitely say that it DOESN'T come from the film. There is nothing to suggest that you are in a dream or fantasy world - it is played straight. And because of this it fails miserably because neither character, but especially Cruise's, acts in a manner that follows normal human behaviour.SPOILER ALERT Bill states quite clearly in the argument between he and his wife that he is not a jealous person. Nothing is particularly shocking about Alice's admittance that she wanted to have adulterous sex with a Naval officer that would suddenly cause this to change in Bill. And yet suddenly we now see Bill obsessing over the image of his wife engaging in adultery in his mind, and at this point the whole movie loses the plot. We see a grieving daughter that hardly knows him profess her undying love to him. Who knows why. He then decides to visit a prostitute - only to not go through with it when his wife calls, even though there is no indication of the relief of an escaped mistake. Despite this ' I can't cheat on my wife' moment - he then suddenly becomes incredibly curious about his piano friend's secret gig - that he goes to an awful lot of trouble to steal into the event to see for himself. Why? It just wouldn't have happened. Bill's character is not that sexual driven - he not that sexual compelled - hence him not having sex with the prostitute. He wouldn't have gone there. And when he did get there- he certainly would have gone running at the first sign of trouble - i.e., the masked woman telling him to get out of there.I could go on and on about these strange behavioural choices. And I understand true 'tragedy' where a character is compelled by their character to follow their seeming fate through to a destructive conclusion - but there were no signs of destruction in Cruise's character - nor was there a fatal and destructive end. So it was all pretty pointless. Add to it an incredibly trite ending in a toy store where the moral of the story is 'we need to f**k.' If that sounds bad- let me assure you - it really really is.In terms of sexual matters - overt and subtle and the machinations of sexual desire - David Lynch captures more truth in a single surreal scene in almost any of his movies than this one does in almost three hours.

There is no plot, no characters worth caring about and a whole bunch of long drawn out dialogue. Just when you think something interesting might happen. Up pops another stupid animated character, sits down and we are treated to another 25 minutes of talking about nothing in particular.

He worked with Spielberg on his most successful films, the Gremlins films. This little film, which looks like it was shot entirely on leftover street sets on the Universal lot, came out of that period. Tom Hanks was still mostly known as a comedian (thank the heavens!), and it was still a time when Corey Felman being in the movie was a sign of hipness. For younger viewers who missed this time, the movie must be a time capsule. I remember seeing it in the theater and enjoying it a lot, and while it hasn't really held up necessarily as one of the best comedies of its era at the very least it offers some fun performances and a neat ironic perspective on suburbia.Hanks plays the suburban everyman, Ray Peterson, whose wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) wants him to relax and enjoy his vacation but whose best friends in the neighborhood (Bruce Dern and Rick Docummun) want him to take part in their juvenile spying games. When it starts to look more and more like their strange Eastern European neighbors might actually be serial killers or something of the sort, Ray and his friends go to extreme measures to try to infiltrate the spooky house.Rick Docummun is a bit annoying for the amount of screen time he gets here, but Bruce Dern is the best thing about the movie. He plays a paranoid 'Nam veteran with a trophy wife (Wendy Schaal) and an overdose of tenacity. Fisher and Hanks are good as the central couple as well. Feldman is awfully irritating in this movie because Dante chooses to let him basically narrate to the camera as if he were Frankie Avalon or Ferris Bueller. The brilliant comic actor Brother Theodore and notable character actor Henry Gibson are wonderful as the bizarre Klopeks. Dante\/Corman regular Dick Miller shows up in a funny bit as a conservative garbage collector paired with a hippy type partner (Robert Picardo) who insists that the customers have the right to look at their neighbors' trash. I would have liked to see a whole movie just about Picardo and Miller.The unfortunate thing about the film is that it promises a lot more than it delivers. The first 20 or 30 minutes are great, with setting up the fun characters and the goofy situation. But by the end everything is a bit forced. There's no reason for Dr. Klopek to betray himself so obviously, it seems like it was just done to wrap the film up on a sort of Twilight Zone vibe that doesn't fit the tone of the film. It could have been a smarter movie if Hanks' character and his friends truly were delusional. But for whatever this movie is, I'll take it. It's pretty much the last movie that I thought Hanks was funny in (no, not Joe Versus the Volcano no thank you). It was great to see Carrie Fisher in the movie after she hadn't been on screen in any movies I'd seen in a few years, and it's still fun to see her in this kind of domestic housewife situation. She could always add a funny moment or two to a comedy, as she did in Austin Powers as well. The early parts of the movie though seem to promise something like Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, a smart dark comedy on suburban absurdity, but the film doesn't really follow through.

A gaggle of society's goofiest citizens have taken advantage of a new policy to loosen hiring standards at the police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all directions to get them thrown out. They embark on their first assignment, which is to turn around Commandant Lassard's beloved precinct 16, which has been dubbed the worst precinct in the city and given 30 days to turn around or suffer some major employee turnover, a fate which is relentlessly helped along by the eternally butt- kissing Captain Mauser. They display a spectacular feat of water-borne police work, saving the academy and then return in the next movie to beat the city's other police academy when it turns out that the governor decides it's not worth the money to keep them both open.Oh, and of course you all realize who is in this thing, right? None less than Sharon Stone, David Spade in his first film, and Tony Hawk in an early stunt-skateboarding role! You gotta see this!This time, Commandant Lassard has come up with a scheme he calls Citizens on Patrol (C.O.P. Get it? Get it?), in which he elaborates slightly on the plot of the original movie. You see, the police force has been stretched a little too thin and the public has developed a negative opinion of them due to the fact that they can't be everywhere at all times to stop every single crime in the city. So the natural solution, of course, is to train the public as deputy police officers and basically have briefly trained undercover cops all over the city. In fact, so close is the resemblance to the first movie that we are even treated to a couple characters who are forced to join the police academy or face jail time &#x96; an idea suggested, of course, by Mahoney himself. This is the best part of the movie, by the way. There is a hilarious gang of skateboarding punks who are disturbing the peace left and right, headed by none other than David Spade, who is a hardened urban predator if I've ever seen one. Thug life, baby!!Sharon Stone also has a relatively small role in the film, although probably one of the ons that she would like to forget about, and Lieutenant Harris is back after being gone for the last two movies. All of the other relevant cast members return, with the addition of a new group of misfits, like the token fat black guy, David Spade and his idiot skateboarder friend, and Tackleberry's FATHER-in-law. Remember that guy? Who is always gleefully punching out his son? I can't wait until the grandparents start joining!But don't worry, until then we have Mrs. Feldman to hold us over. Here's this sweet old lady living in a nursing home\/military barracks and who has more of a love of all things camouflaged than Tackleberry himself. In fact, I was waiting the whole movie for her to tell her that she's his long lost mother, but no such luck. Something went wrong with the screen writing in there somewhere, but ultimately she turns out to be one of the most consistently funny characters in the movie. She's played with a good-natured smile by Billie Bird, who clearly enjoyed herself while making the movie. You can always tell when the actors are having a good time, and it always makes the movie better, which is good because this movie needs a lot of help!Of course, it's not much different than the last three movies as far as being worth watching. Bud and his father are still trading punches and it's still more groan-inducing than laugh- inducing, people are still accidentally wandering into the Blue Oyster Club, which hasn't been funny for three movies by now (Proctor inadvertently wandering in naked was the high point of this gag, but also the point where it becomes the most clear that the joke has lost its steam), and Jones is still doing that Bruce Lee impersonation which was funny in the first movie when I was a kid, but as an adult not so much&#x85; But, Callahan has a great wet t-shirt scene that makes the whole movie worthwhile!Oh, and was Mahoney's mischievous grin ever amusing?

Bill Paxton? Nah, he's cool, I think. I never needed to forgive him for Weird Science, but Guttenburg unfortunately has a whole string of bad sequels to make up for, and Cocoon and Short Circuit are just not gonna cut it! At any rate, super-gluing the loudspeaker to Harris' face was funny, but why they missed out on the opportunity to have Harris screaming through it at high volume at the doctors in the hospital I just can't understand. The screenwriters are not scoring many points in this one!But still, this is one of the better Police Academies so far. This one and part 3 are the best ones in the series that I've seen so far, despite the hilarious 1980s badness (there's a boot- legging crime lord, for example, who operates his illegal warehouse standing around with a fistful of cash and a hula hoop around his shoulders), but there definitely are some fun gags. Harris macing his armpits is one is one of the more memorable gags in the whole series, along with Mauser getting his hands glued to his hair, and I have to admit that I enjoyed some of the scenes of the original recruits trying to recruit the public for the new C.O.P. program.

They used f-ck 138 times, and I wouldn't be surprised if leads is in the same sort of bracket. Funny thing to open a review with, sure, but they used some words a hell of a lot. The dialogue is really fantastic though, and the repetition of some words just seems to add to that. Of course they keep ranting about leads -- their entire lives are defined by the damn things. The acting is also really good, and I'm disappointed Baldwin only had one scene (which was by far my favorite one). All in all, it really got under the skin of the problems faced by these salesmen, from a useless and annoying boss to customers who just aren't interested. The desperation caused by threats of job losses is really sold here, which is a really relevant theme at the moment (and probably always is). It wasn't really perfect for me though... I sometimes got annoyed with how a character would go from a huge loudmouth to mute, almost as if they were waiting for the next (admittedly entertaining) rant to reach its climax. It also had a plot twist I didn't see coming, which was nice.My rating for it may actually go up an entire point at some point, depending on if I ever get the notion to rewatch it. Right now, I don't think I'd want to see it again outside of the Baldwin scene.

Problem is that the balance between these two different genres isn't very good, meaning that the movie doesn't work out the way it was supposed to.The idea was pretty good, the execution of it however really wasn't. The movie can be seen as on 'unofficial' sequel to the George A. Romero movie Night of the Living Dead and its sequels. Those movies of course already had a healthy dose of comedy in them and this movie tried to take its comedy one step further. The comedy is however to lame to consider it funny really, which is also due to its fairly poor production values and poor actors involved.The movie is rather cheap looking and there really isn't enough gore or good make-up involved to please any zombie movie\/gore fan. It has a bit of a B-movie feel and look over it, which of course gets also strengthened by its silly script and comedy.The character are often more annoying then likable enough which, again, is due mostly to its weak writing and lame comedy. Seriously, this movie features the type of jokes and dialog that seems to be written by an 10-year old, in just one afternoon.I like horror and I like cult-horror perhaps even better. This movie however really doesn't deserve to become a cult-horror classic.
