Here, the journey of Marshal (Samuel Gerard) continues, yet with another fugitive. Most of Hollywood sequels are badly-written, pretty hasty, and repeating its original at best. But this time, it even outclassed its original. (The Fugitive) was well-made entertainment, however too long, somehow uninteresting with Mr. Ford, not to mention that I remember falling asleep in front of it at the first watching! While I have been hooked by (U.S. Marshals), for countless times.(Tommy Lee Jones) returns to the character that brought him the Oscar. That reminded me of (Charles Laughton) when he won the Oscar for portraying (Henry VIII) in (The Private Life of Henry VIII - 1933), then returned to the same character again in (Young Bess - 1953). There is a certain love for the Oscar's part I suppose. Yet, aside from that, I believe (Jones) loved to come back because how he and (Gerard) are very damn alike. The first always says I do not have a sense of humor of any recognizable sort, (Harrison Ford) said once Acting with him is like having a fork in your back all the time, and (Will Smith) has stated that He's my buddy, but it's hard to be a friend of someone who doesn't lie at all !. So I think (Tommy), one way or another, was playing himself. Or maybe he gave the character a lot of his own.I liked the character's reactions. When he was told He's dangerous, armed, well-trained, what will you intent to do?, he replayed simply and seriously  catch him !, not catch him badly or the son of bitch is mine or I'm the one who's going to learn this sucker the meaning of PAIN ! to the end of the Dirty Harry, SuperCops, I'm The Man dictionary in any other American action. Or when he was among the investigators in (Irene Jacob)'s apartment, notice well that he doesn't speak unless for harmless remakes, looking the most kind or naive one in the bunch till the end of the scene. Or when he comes to his senses near the climax, choosing not to kill the fugitive. Over and above, (Jones) mastered some good physical efforts as well. However (Jones) is accused of repeating himself. While being a master actor, every now and then he's forced to do the same thing again. For instance he was the man who chases the innocent till he catches him then convinces his innocence in (The Fugitive). Then the same man yet with a love interest and a desire to avenge in (U.S. Marshals). Then he sort of remade it again yet with a fugitive woman in (Double Jeopardy). And he did it once more with less talk and more action in (The Hunted) ! It's full of perfect chases. The long sequence in the movie's middle is superb (I don't remember anything like it in The Fugitive !). The problem is that the climax looks so pale compared to it. All the cast did their best. Yes, (Irene Jacob) was nothing but the escapee's charming scared girl (The way most of the American movies deal with talented European actresses). But what the heck, it's an action, and nothing wrong with seeing such a sensitive eyeful like her in it. OH MY GOD she looked uniquely sexy in that short black dress and that short black hair too. The dialog was close to spontaneous; representing hot, honest and funny moments (all the conversations between Jones & Joe Pantoliano). This script was accurate. Even the idiot points, such as arresting Wesley Snipes' character because of the medicine he takes, have been presented fast enough so you couldn't glimpse. No wonder, since director (Stuart Baird) was originally one of Hollywood top-notch editors for 2 decades before becoming a director in the mid-90s.I recall the authentic poster in the video store back then. It had just small photo for (Jones) looking sullen and the rest of it was for (Snipes) jumping from the roof. I bet the movie makers were proud of themselves for make this astonishing stunt in specific. Although it got my admiration, but I have to hate the fact that the movie gave up one shot in which (Snipes) salutes (Jones) sarcastically a la' military way while he's above the train; I deem it the best finish to this outrageous sequence. Though you'd never find it unless in the movie's trailer !OK, now for something magical. While I watched the movie 3 times already I didn't notice something that even at the fourth time my mom was the one who noticed it and told me; after (Jones) discovered the truth of (Downey. Jr) he tricks him like adept magician, emptying (Downey)'s gun in front of him, and us, while no one is looking. The thing is how (Jones) was that charismatic to pull the trick off so I - a pro viewer I think - didn't observe this, and for many times too ?! It seems that the director betted on (Jones)'s presence and he, clearly, won.Finally, I liked the movie's sense of honoring; starting from the slightly strange title, to the last scene with Jerry Goldsmith's tune crowns the victorious marshals. Yes, it's a sequel, straight action, Hollywood stuff but not with the bad reputation of that. And (Jones), (Gerard) both were great.

They are in search of the Messiah and they come bearing gifts...but first they make a small mistake and deliver them to He who is not the Savior, Brian, who happens to be born on the same day, just down the alley from that Jesus fella. Brian grows up a fairly oblivious and apolitical mama's boy, though with less interesting in stonings than is usual. Alas, events lead him to work with the People's Front of Judea, the attempted kidnapping of Pilate's wife, accidental prophet-hood, and eventual crucifixion to the tune of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. The conventional wisdom on 'Life of Brian' is that it's the Python crew's most polished or competent film as a team, and I'd probably agree with that, though I find 'Holy Grail' funnier. It's still scatter-shot and somewhat inconsistent of course - I for one found the whole Pilate\/Biggus Dickus thing a bit overlong, and the alien abduction while fun doesn't really add anything besides giving Terry Gilliam more to do - but it does actually feel like a moderately cohesive film, and of course it takes the typical Python over-the-top methods on attacking organized religion to a point which all but the most humor-challenged Christians ought to be able to admit to at least chuckling over - it's a bit more pointed and narrow in its humor. Of course, the film isn't really anti-Christian, or anti-Jewish, but rather anti-stupid. Maybe that was it's biggest problem....Early highlights include the stoning scene and the scene with the ex-leper, but where the film really takes off in my mind is when Brian becomes an accidental prophet. It seems to be channeling or ripping off Holy Grail at first - smart, articulate Brian being completely misunderstood by the idiot peasants, just exactly as Bedevere in the earlier film presiding over the witch's trial - but the brilliance with which Brian quickly goes from being just another hairy crazed prophet (reminiscent naturally of street-corner shouters even today) to being followed all around by a witless mob is startling and hard for me to describe. I think this may be the high point of the Pythons' wordplay, and the fact that it's foreshadowed in an early scene where Brian and others are listening to the real Messiah but misinterpreting his words wildly only adds an icing to the cake. If there's a message to Life of Brian it's that people will hear what they want to hear, and sometimes no matter how clear you think you're being, you're not going to get through to them - especially if God's in the way; also, people want someone else to save them, to do the work of making the hard decisions &#x96; even if they have to turn off their brains to believe.I find comedy harder to describe or critique than just about anything else; perhaps that's a cop-out but I'm not sure how I can really get at just how clever and funny the film is without quoting a bunch of dialogue, and what's the point in that? You're here on IMDb, you can check it out easily yourselves. I will close by saying that in one way 'Life of Brian' does seem to conform to the more modern style of religious epic - the Jerusalem and the Jews here are dirty, disheveled, and poor. Gone pretty much for good by this time is the splendor of the 50s and 60s Cinemascope epics - although I suspect that may have as much do with the small budgets of the Pythons' film, and Scorsese's and Gibson's later efforts, as with any conscious desire to make things grubby ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Three wise men wend their way to a small hut in a small town, 2000 years ago.

And then, there are train wrecks that take place in the sky. Because the transportation conductor running the show is higher than a kite, has absolutely no idea what they're doing, and won't be bothered to look on the road ahead to ensure an accident does not lie up ahead. I thought Child's Play 2 was a train wreck, the sort that would fit this description. I was wrong. I thought that was as low as this series could go and the next film just had to be better somehow. I was mistaken there as well. I am passionately anti-drug, but I want to know what writer Don Mancini was smoking when he wrote these early sequels. Did someone lace his cigars with angeldust? And this isn't because they're in any way Fantasia-like, or anything like that. It's because of how unbelievably insane the ideas are.First, Andy was never a complex character. You felt bad for the child actor playing him in the first two movies, he was very sympathetic. But there was nothing really going on inside him. He was not an important part of the franchise. I could watch a hundred movies (if I were forced to) with Chucky just running around, stabbing people and swearing at them, and never once go- where's Andy? So, the kid grows up or his parents don't want him in anymore of the movies. I can live with that. I can even accept that Mancini decided to write him as a teenager, since he wrote him into a role that I'm naturally attracted to watching- the introverted, misunderstood, slightly strange, put-upon loner. But that's where this movie's greatest flaws lie.Let's just start with how whiny and irritating the sniveling, prepubescent Justin Whalin is. At least when John Waters cast him in Serial Mom, he was supposed to be irritating. Here, it's like they think it's an added perk. The character is already such a miserably lame goody-two-shoes, who - even though he's supposed to be mentally fragile and disturbed - leaps at every chance to stop the evil Chucky from killing, even though everyone Chucky targets are oppressing him in some way. If he were really disturbed, wouldn't there be some part of him that was happy people were being murdered? He's basically the Carrie or the Angela Baker (Sleepaway Camp) of this movie, being tormented by stern, judgmental sergeants and sadistic lieutenant cadets drilling and taunting him. Several cadets lashing out at him or threatening him. This situation was just begging for a playfully evil bite of sweet revenge.But, no... That would have been too experimental or risky. Instead of being mean spirited toward the tormentors, Universal horror movies of this era were all about being mean spirited toward the victims (especially Wes Craven's films for the studio). Then at the last minute, the sadistic jerks who drove you crazy get knocked down by a bullet or they bump their head on the ceiling (1989's Shocker), and that's it. That's all they get as a penalty for the evil they perpetrated and the pain they caused to the protagonists (say that 5 times fast). We get no satisfaction of revenge. No reparations. Nada. In fact, if anything the worst characters in the movie get the quickest, least painful deaths. What kind of justice is that? What ever happened to- what goes around comes around?Or, if Andy can't be morally vague- what about his twin brother, Whitehurst? He's so physically low head-hung, moping around, defeated in every way. It'd be no stretch at all to show him laughing evilly or smiling a little at the sight of the ensuing carnage. As it stands, he's the only truly interesting character in the movie (played to perfection by the quintessentially nerdy Dean Jacobson). Another bright spot, though not nearly as bright, is the vivacious and energetic Perrey Reeves as the sassy DaSilva. The only cadet to be able to knock king-jerk of the jerk-pile Brett C. Shelton (played by the gorgeous, ultra-masculine Travis Fine, who you may remember as the orderly who loses his job because of Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted) off his pedestal. And because I don't like to leave anyone out, she has a friend who is also enjoyable to watch, played by Donna Eskra.With a movie this embarrassing, it's best not to dwell too much more on the negatives.

Rather he is the character around whom the life and fortunes of the Jewish prince, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) revolves, though he doesn't know it until quite late in the film.I haven't read the 1880 novel by General Lew Wallace, nor have I seen either the 1907 1-reeler or the 1925 Fred Niblo version, also a long and expensive epic. But William Wyler's film is fascinating to me in part because of this absence of Jesus - and the absence of religion from much of Ben Hur's life in the film, though not from his thoughts. The basic story is really quite simple Ben Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judeah after years in Rome, now a tribune and second in command to the military governor or prefect. Though the two seem overjoyed to see each other we quickly learn that Messala both have ulterior motives in renewing their friendship - Messala to help crush opposition through Ben Hur's help, and the Jewish prince to accomplish the exact opposite. This is not a friendship made to last. In short order, Ben Hur is accused of a crime he didn't commit and sent to the galleys; after years of rowing in chains, he saves the life of a Roman consul during a naval battle, for which he is freed and eventually becomes the consul's adoptive son, all the while earning a name for himself as the greatest charioteer in Rome. But his heart belongs to his homeland, and as quickly as he can he returns to take vengeance on Messala, who has also imprisoned his mother and daughter. Messala, also a great chariot driver, will eventually face him in the justly famed chariot race where no rules apply and each man plans to seek the other's death. This 9-minute action sequence really is as thrilling as I remembered it from years ago and is deserving of all the praise it gets; it has a real time you-are-there feel to it that I've never seen in any other historical epic.But in the background is always the young rabbi, roughly the same age as Ben Hur, who gave the then-slave a drink of water as he was about to be shipped off to the galleys, and who the now-freed son of both Rome and Judeah feels compelled to offer the same favor as the Crucifixion draws nigh. Jesus appears in long-shot or in partial view for perhaps 5-10 minutes out of the 3 1\/2 hour running time here, but his presence lingers throughout; the biggest problem I had with the film, in fact, was in the last half hour as the rather cheesy-looking scene on Cavalry translates is intercut with the healing of Ben Hur's now-leprous mother and sister and his own conversion - it all seems to obvious and simplistic; but I guess that for a believer it must work. Too, it seems that Ben Hur is able to have his cake and eat it too achieving his vengeance, getting his fortune and family back, finding the love of the onetime slave girl who had been promised to another. Sure, he suffered, but at the end his worldly happiness seems more obvious than any spiritual redemption.This isn't a huge flaw for me, however, as I realize how difficult such a dramatization is, and in particular when filmed by believing Jews and Christians and intended for an audience that had not yet tired of such simple homilies and the grand scale that the film does, at least, still impress with. The acting is all pretty much what one expects in such a thing - lots of declamations and stagy, overly dramatic glances, hands thrown up at the site of lepers, etc. The photography is quite beautiful if completely unrealistic - this never really looks like the holy land, never really even looks like the real world, with a lot of dreamy overlit closeups, deep shadows when deemed dramatically necessary, interior lighting that is sometimes indistinguishable from exteriors -- none of it matters really, if you accept that this is big scale Hollywood Biblical melodrama and look at it in terms of its success as a genre piece. I like a lot of the actors in smaller roles, particularly Frank Thring as a somewhat sympathetic, realistic Pontius Pilate whose words of wisdom Ben Hur rejects in one of the best scenes in a film that is really dominated by intimate character interludes despite its reputation for spectacle.On the whole, it works for me, Wyler is a fluid enough storyteller to keep things moving despite the immense length and the extremely wide format is rarely a distraction, if rarely necessary either. It's easy to see why this was such an immense hit, earning the equivalent of over $700 million today theatrically; it's also to see why it marked the peak of the genre and why it all went downhill rather quickly, as it was such a grueling production that few filmmakers would want to tackle such a thing again even with the potential of very large returns.

Creator Darren Aronofsky appears to have run rampant in his feature debut, but one can easily argue that he's thought everything out meticulously. As a result, Pi, will satisfy the tastes of some and completely fool others.The main character is Max Cohen, a mathematical genius with some serious issues that lead to pill-popping. He believes in the power of math as a universal language -- nature's language and that there are patterns to everything. With the help of his supercomputer, he embarks on a task to determine a pattern governing the stock market, only what he's on to - - a 216-digit strand of the numerical value of Pi -- has a lot at stake for Wall Street and even a sect of Cabalistic Hasidic Jews who believe it holds Messianic clues.If a word could describe Pi in both plot and it's film-making, obsession would be the best choice. Aronofsky's shot sequences, with repetition and attaching the camera to his actors and the choppiness of the film suggest just how crazy this matter is to both Max and those transfixed on numbers. As Max immerses himself further in the mystery, things only get more chaotic. You get the sense that Aronofsky knew exactly what he was doing, but because it's so abstract and difficult to grasp, you're not totally sure if it all works. The fact that it's filmed in black and white might also suggest the same random pattern idea of the film. What seems to be so clear cut is really more maddening.Pi might just be one of those second viewing required films. It's a cerebral thriller and relentless at that, clearly meant for the tastes of abstract movie watchers. Nevertheless, Aronofsky demonstrates some impressive skills, ones that no doubt led to his success in cult hit Requiem for a Dream years later.

Released in 1980 to a limited box office success, mixed reviews and even (one would say, understandable) hostility from feminist groups, it certainly didn't catch on overnight. What's more, Stephen King was famously angered by how his story had been translated to the silver screen and Kubrick's crazed perfectionism boiled over to the point where it became what he was known most for, personality-wise (he notoriously did over 300 takes of the What should be done with Danny scene). But jumpforward 30 years, and The Shining has finally risen to a level of greatesteem with critics and audiences alike, and rightfully so.Struggling author and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny (Danny Lloyd, who, thanks to some clever direction had no idea he was working on a horror movie) have just arrived at the magnificent, sprawling Overlook Hotel in Colorado, where Jack has landed the job of caretaker during the winter off-season. Jack hopes to get some serious writing done during their stay, but unbeknownst to him, Wendy and Danny, the Overlook has a very violent past in which one of the former caretakers murdered himself and his entire family out of isolation. Their spirits remain, haunting and cursing the hotel. On top of that, young Danny possesses a very powerful gift called shining, which enables him to clairvoyantly detect and communicate with evil spirits, a gift he ironically shares with the hotel's kindly head chef Dick Hallorann (the wonderful Scatman Crothers). Over the winter, emotional problems and isolation send Jack spirally down into the depths of insanity, leading to only two things bloodshed and death.Now I'll be honest Kubrick is one director who either amazes me (Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and of course this) or bores me stupid (Barry Lyndon and the first half of 2001 A Space Odyssey), but with this knockout masterpiece he makes not one decision that's less than a genius one. His direction here is nothing short of breathtaking, as his rhythmic pace in the second and third acts and tedious attention to detail in all three acts of the film enables him to notch the tension up to almost unbearable levels, all building up to one of the most unforgettable climaxes ever seen in cinema. Much credit for this goes to cinematographer John Alcott, whose stunning aerial shots and creepy Steadicam interior photography enhances the film's eerie atmosphere enormously. The music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind also does what it is meant to do brilliantly.Maybe most thankfully, given this is a horror movie after all, the acting is exceptional. The one and only Jack Nicholson, despite not wanting to be in the same room as his director during filming, enjoys what for me is his best role after One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's R.P. Murphy, and boy does he give it his all. Nicholson makes it look all too easy as he effortlessly portrays Jack in every stage of his downfall &#x96; from slightly crazy and career-driven but loving husband and father to unstable hotel-bound man to finally a complete and utter animal. Nobody else could have played this part, and it's surely one of the scariest performances in the history of film. Although her character will probably annoy many people (and indeed that's really the point, you could argue), Shelley Duvall does a radiant job as an initially seemingly catatonic housewife who must race against time to save herself and her son from the one man who should love them more than anything else in the world. Finally, Scatman Crothers brings a whole lot of old-world charm to the wise and affable cook who shares Danny's gift\/curse.I was first introduced to Kubrick's film of The Shining when I was a 13-year-old lad, eager for something new, and I was mesmerized &#x96; scared out of my brains, but mesmerized. Its technical mastery aside, The Shining becomes a true definitive masterpiece in how it deconstructs the human condition, looking at what makes us sane and what can spark irreversible insanity in us all.

Embarrassingly twist-heavy turkeys with people from various walks of life being kidnapped and tied to chairs and incapacitated in all sorts of different ways. But none of them, no matter how twisted they think they are, have been able to re-capture the creepiness, the intensity, the all-out bravura of this little house in the snow, half-character study, half-balls to the wall abduction picture. You want torture? Annie Wilkes will give it to you. But she'll also give you a killer more tormented, more human, and more sympathetic than a thousand generic dorks like Frank Zito (the killer from 1980's sickeningly overrated Maniac). And her victim, Paul Sheldon, doesn't even half to go on a nightly binge of drinking and drugging in a European whorehouse first. Instead, he authentically heads into the right place at the wrong time. And his captor isn't an inherently evil person (even though she is a Republican), who sets out with an agenda to torture him. Rather, this is one of the few torture films where I really feel the killer is sorry for the victim and their self at the same time.Also sad is the current trend to feel all horror has to be realistic. Why? Misery already captured enough realism to make all similar set ups ineffective. Is there anything more realistic than a person doing terrible things for self-righteous or religious reasons? It has a wealth of historical precedence. It's a classic. And it's relevant to today's world as well. But most importantly, it gives the story dramatic weight and makes the situations more tense and nervy. Best about that, the movie doesn't become an out-and-out drama. So many of Annie's almost weepy confessions are pathetic and funny and so creepy, it's nearly bone chilling. At one point, she casually pulls a gun we didn't know was there out of her robe pocket and talks about putting bullets into it. The music plays it as climactic, but it's incredibly funny. While quieter scenes where she lets something she should keep hidden slip out, such as where she admits I love you, Paul or when she talks about how hard her husband's passing was on her, are almost skin-crawlingly uncomfortable or awkward.Paul Sheldon is the main character and the actor playing him, James Caan (of The Godfather fame) is the star (though I'd never heard of him before this movie). But, Kathy Bates is the real star here. Apparently, she was something of a stage actress who almost never acted in movies. If a director making a horror film now were to cast an actress like her in their film, they would probably relegate her to the role of a zombie with no lines or a simpering, senile old wombat (like any older or more chubby woman is in the current Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake franchise). Even at her age at the time of Misery's filming. It takes a smart director to know what an actress like this is really capable of. And not only is Rob Reiner a smart director (or, at least he was when in the 80's and early 90's), but he actually uses Bates in full powerhouse mode. Not only was this a star-making role, but it was a move to make a fuller figured woman more important in film history. You don't see that kind of thinking or initiative taken by today's class of student-director monkeys making horror films (or any film) now. Although many of them are pleasant enough people, I'm starting to think they're a bit shallow for deciding the Jessica Biel type is always more suited to be the star than someone like Kathy Bates.James Caan as Annie's unwitting, uninterested love interest is the modestly amicable, handsome face of a gracious guest. He may have a lot of time and place backstory going on, but he's not very important. He's really just a body in a bed. And that's the way I like it. Besides, who really goes to a horror film (or thriller) to watch characters wax poetic about some great experience they had- which men often do a lot anyway. Hoping to feel more important or liked by flexing their storyteller muscles. Babbling about romanticised scenes of being somewhere cultural while sharing a beer or some vintaged (insert Classy Booze Type here) in the company of some rustic, hard-edged, but life-affirming old fart...blah blah blah. That's what makes me so often think- who cares about Him? Whoever He is, I think you'll find this is applicable to any male character in film or literature who is shown as more important or interesting because they've been everywhere or done everything (everything Classy, that is). I would hope this covers Annie's supposition that he's a man of the world type.This movie is All About Annie. Oh, and Buster, the town's easy-going crusty old sheriff and his very horny wife, Virginia. He's the other main character in a way, because he's a very normal person as well as a great problem solver. Not only does he figure out most of the Paul Sheldon mystery, but he has enough common sense to fix a towns-person's dilemma with one 15 second phone call. He and his wife are not only real salt of the Earth folk but they provide much more skilled comic relief than the cops in Wes Craven's 1972 directorial debut, The Last House on the Left. Misery is simply a masterpiece. Perfect in every single detail. The product of a lot of hard work and dedication to good film-making. Almost no one involved with the film ever returned to the horror genre again. But they crafted one of the most satisfying psychological horror films I've ever seen. Even out-Hitchcocking Hitchcock. It's got needles, a shotgun, a sledgehammer, and a killer typewriter. What else does a horror film need?

But she'll also give you a killer more tormented, more human, and more sympathetic than a thousand generic dorks like Frank Zito (the killer from 1980's sickeningly overrated Maniac). And her victim, Paul Sheldon, doesn't even half to go on a nightly binge of drinking and drugging in a European whorehouse first. Instead, he authentically heads into the right place at the wrong time. And his captor isn't an inherently evil person (even though she is a Republican), who sets out with an agenda to torture him. Rather, this is one of the few torture films where I really feel the killer is sorry for the victim and their self at the same time.Also sad is the current trend to feel all horror has to be realistic. Why? Misery already captured enough realism to make all similar set ups ineffective. Is there anything more realistic than a person doing terrible things for self-righteous or religious reasons? It has a wealth of historical precedence. It's a classic. And it's relevant to today's world as well. But most importantly, it gives the story dramatic weight and makes the situations more tense and nervy. Best about that, the movie doesn't become an out-and-out drama. So many of Annie's almost weepy confessions are pathetic and funny and so creepy, it's nearly bone chilling. At one point, she casually pulls a gun we didn't know was there out of her robe pocket and talks about putting bullets into it. The music plays it as climactic, but it's incredibly funny. While quieter scenes where she lets something she should keep hidden slip out, such as where she admits I love you, Paul or when she talks about how hard her husband's passing was on her, are almost skin-crawlingly uncomfortable or awkward.Paul Sheldon is the main character and the actor playing him, James Caan (of The Godfather fame) is the star (though I'd never heard of him before this movie). But, Kathy Bates is the real star here. Apparently, she was something of a stage actress who almost never acted in movies. If a director making a horror film now were to cast an actress like her in their film, they would probably relegate her to the role of a zombie with no lines or a simpering, senile old wombat (like any older or more chubby woman is in the current Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake franchise). Even at her age at the time of Misery's filming. It takes a smart director to know what an actress like this is really capable of. And not only is Rob Reiner a smart director (or, at least he was when in the 80's and early 90's), but he actually uses Bates in full powerhouse mode. Not only was this a star-making role, but it was a move to make a fuller figured woman more important in film history. You don't see that kind of thinking or initiative taken by today's class of student-director monkeys making horror films (or any film) now. Although many of them are pleasant enough people, I'm starting to think they're a bit shallow for deciding the Jessica Biel type is always more suited to be the star than someone like Kathy Bates.James Caan as Annie's unwitting, uninterested love interest is the modestly amicable, handsome face of a gracious guest. He may have a lot of time and place backstory going on, but he's not very important. He's really just a body in a bed. And that's the way I like it. Besides, who really goes to a horror film (or thriller) to watch characters wax poetic about some great experience they had- which men often do a lot anyway. Hoping to feel more important or liked by flexing their storyteller muscles. Babbling about romanticised scenes of being somewhere cultural while sharing a beer or some vintaged (insert Classy Booze Type here) in the company of some rustic, hard-edged, but life-affirming old fart...blah blah blah. That's what makes me so often think- who cares about Him? Whoever He is, I think you'll find this is applicable to any male character in film or literature who is shown as more important or interesting because they've been everywhere or done everything (everything Classy, that is). I would hope this covers Annie's supposition that he's a man of the world type.This movie is All About Annie. Oh, and Buster, the town's easy-going crusty old sheriff and his very horny wife, Virginia. He's the other main character in a way, because he's a very normal person as well as a great problem solver. Not only does he figure out most of the Paul Sheldon mystery, but he has enough common sense to fix a towns-person's dilemma with one 15 second phone call. He and his wife are not only real salt of the Earth folk but they provide much more skilled comic relief than the cops in Wes Craven's 1972 directorial debut, The Last House on the Left. Misery is simply a masterpiece. Perfect in every single detail. The product of a lot of hard work and dedication to good film-making. Almost no one involved with the film ever returned to the horror genre again. But they crafted one of the most satisfying psychological horror films I've ever seen. Even out-Hitchcocking Hitchcock.

Jackson, the Badass Motherf#%ker himself, as a man whose bones break so easily that he can hardly leave the house. The Sixth Sense is a hell of a debut film to follow up, but in retrospect I would argue that M. Night Shyamalan did a great job of it with Unbreakable. The movie has received mixed responses from critics and the public alike, but it is inarguably an interesting experience as an example of a young writer and director carving a spot for himself in the film-making world while running with the big dogs. Comic book aficionados are likely to find a lot of fascinating material to chew on in Unbreakable, although I also enjoyed the film immensely despite a total lack of interest in comic books. Shyamalan takes a certain aspect of the potential historical meaning and significance of comic book mythology and crafts it into a superhero thriller that is entirely his own, which is no small achievement. Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis play Elijah Price and David Dunn, respectively. We meet David soon after a spectacular train crash that leaves every single passenger dead and himself without a scratch, and we meet Elijah minutes after his birth, the trauma of which broke both of his delicate arms and legs. Elijah grows up to be high-class salesman of rare and priceless comic book art, the results of a childhood limited to the safety of his room and his comic collection, while David grows up to be a security guard at a sports stadium. Elijah discovers David as a result of his surviving the train crash, and he becomes convinced that David's strength is the exact antithesis of his own weakness, and that this power connects them. The movie explores Elijah's efforts to convince David of his theory and David's gradual understanding of what exactly that theory means. Given the supernatural nature of it, he becomes less and less impressed with Elijah's persistence. The movie is a fascinating ride and tells a compelling story despite being peppered with the same kind of plot holes that plagued The Sixth Sense, although here I seemed less willing to accept them. David never noticed, for example, the fact that he has never been sick or even mildly injured in all of his life until Elijah pointed it out to him. For someone with a career in high school football that ended as a result of an injury that he was forced to fake, this seems like more than a little bit of a stretch.Shyamalan comes through on the public expectation of a good twist at the end of his movies, and while the twist in this one isn't as brilliant as that in The Sixth Sense, it's still unexpected and leaps and bounds beyond the laughable twist at the end of The Village. The moody tone and photography is characteristic of Shyamalan's work, as is Willis' subdued performance. There are times when the film's score picks up with nothing really carrying it, but the movie has a solid story and sure-handed direction that ensures that even the most judicious of us can let go and enjoy the ride. It's not his best work (that's probably still The Sixth Sense), but clearly Shyamalan's first three films were his best work so far, and after three increasingly disappointing films in a row, I hope he goes back to the kinds of stories that he tells best before he ends up going straight to DVD.

The reason why the show is so loved is because it does what we always want to do or say during a really bad movie. So naturally the successful show that was created on Comedy Central wanted to do a movie about our favorite sarcastic robots. Was the movie a success? Not so much, but doesn't mean that this movie is bad at all, in fact, it's a great one to watch. My only disappointment? I think was just the fact that this was just like any other episode, there was nothing really too special about it to make it stand out as a movie. Secondly, I've seen funnier episodes than this movie. I'm not dissing the movie, because this is still completely worth the watch.Mike, Tom and Gypsy are startled to find Crow deep in the lower sections of the Satellite of Love, pounding at the hull with various digging instruments. He has convinced himself that he can tunnel back to Earth, he tells them. Checking his digging calculations, Crow discovers that he already knew this was inevitable Look at that, Breach Hull, All Die. Even had it underlined! They return to the Bridge, as Dr. Forrester announces that he is about to make them watch the 1955 classic sci-fi thriller This Island Earth in an attempt to break their wills. In Mystery Science Theater 3000 tradition, we are in for a good ride as they mock this silly clichéd 50's sci fi film with no mercy.I do love the film that they picked This Island Earth, while in some sense it is a fun little sci fi classic, probably the first movie that I saw before I ever saw it on Mystery Science Theater 3000, it still is really cheesy and fun to make fun of.

Not so much, but doesn't mean that this movie is bad at all, in fact, it's a great one to watch. My only disappointment? I think was just the fact that this was just like any other episode, there was nothing really too special about it to make it stand out as a movie.

Ha! You didn't know I was gonna say that, did you?! - Jack SlaterIntended to be a huge summer blockbuster, but ultimately becoming a big-time flop, Last Action Hero stars the then-infallible Arnold Schwarzenegger as the fictional action hero, Jack Slater. Jack Slater stars in his own franchise, Slater and is idolized by Danny (Austin O'Brien), a young boy who escapes his real-world troubles with an unhealthy movie-going habit. When an opportunity arrives for Danny to see the upcoming Slater IV prior to its release, he can't pass it up, and a magical ticket given to him by the theater owner propels him into Jack Slater's world, where clichés rule the realm and anything can happen.Unfortunately, Last Action Hero has been maligned through the years for being both misunderstood and eclipsed by the success of another 1993 blockbuster, Jurassic Park. What many may not realize, until they give it a fair chance, is that it's a brilliant action satire that serves a double function in that it is as action packed as it is humorous. As Jack Slater, Arnold pokes more fun at himself than any critic ever could. Teamed up with director John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator), it's got loads of explosions, stunts and special effects, so much so that it represents the best of 80's\/early 90's action film, while simultaneously mocking it. Austin O'Brien plays the young protagonist well, and thankfully, isn't just another annoying kid in a summer blockbuster. The subplot of Danny's escapism will appeal to and hit close to home for many a film fan, which is one of the film's greatest strengths.If there is one flaw, though, it's that the film is about twenty minutes too long, which means the joke wears thin after a while. It seems that Last Action Hero is stuffed with almost too many ideas and in-jokes, which is where it loses points. Despite this, though, it's immensely entertaining and unrelenting in its roasting of typical Schwarzenegger fare. Forget the fact that critics hated it and audiences rejected it; Last Action Hero is like a valentine to action fans everywhere, a bold and unique blockbuster that perhaps never found its way to its true audience ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2009","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers.

Okay, I have to admit that it doesn't have the quality of a cinema hit like Lord of the rings or Star wars. You could categorize this movie as a 'B-movie', but that would be too low, in my opinion. The story goes like this the natural history museum in Chicago opens up a new display of various artifacts and relics. Wooden crates are send to the museum from many countries, including South America. Strange enough, is that the crew of the boat that was carrying these crates has completely vanished. Later, it becomes known that something else was on that boat and has now found it's way into the museum. People start to disappear. It becomes a race against the clock to find whoever or whatever is responsible for these crimes before the grand opening of the new exhibition starts...The acting is not top-notch, but it's not horrible either. There are a few peculiar moments in the overall dialog, but only if you are nit picky and look for them. It doesn't really slow down the movie that much. The effects in this movie are quite effective. I don't want to spoil what they are used on, but I can ensure you that you will be entertained. There are a few scientific errors in this movie as well though. If you are at home in any of the areas such as genetics or related subjects, you'll spot them instantly. It doesn't bother the 'common' movie viewer, but I can imagine that people who've studied these subjects can get irritated.If you look past the flaws this movie has, you will enjoy it a lot. It's perfect if you want to fill the evening with a good, mysterious movie. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10.

However, it was inevitable that he would find his way to Hollywood, and along with famous producer David O. Selznick, he adapted Daphne du Maurier's classic book into a thrilling and tense story about obsession, death and the effects and memories we all take with us long after someone moves onto the next world.What makes this such an interesting picture is the fact that Hitchcock was able to adapt some new and ground-breaking ideas into the filming process which obviously improves the quality of the experience as well as usher in a whole new way to create movies. He storyboarded every scene, used deep-focus photography and edited the picture in camera, in other words only shooting what he wanted to see on the screen. This gave him a complete vision of what he wanted as well as kept the nosy Selznick's hands away from his product. What it leaves us today is spellbound, suspended and amazed at what he was able to do with a camera; in some ways 40 years ahead of its time. Though he would not receive as much credit as Orson Welles one year later with Citizen Kane, he nevertheless left behind a stirring story filled with complex and emotional people who bring us along on this strange and mysterious journey.The movie never would have been as great without an all-star cast, which Hitchcock had with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine as the two lovers separated by the dead Rebecca's presence as well as supporting characters Judith Anderson as the obsessed housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and the slick and sneaky George Sanders. The narrative feels to bend a little in the final third as we are brought along to figure this dilemma out in a routine police investigation. Nevertheless, filled with dazzling images of Manderley, a completely convincing performance by the beautiful Fontaine and Hitchcock's ability to have Rebecca cast a shadow over the characters despite being dead, this is a classic not to be missed and one that needs multiple views before the mystery is cleared up. Even then, perhaps all will not be revealed.
