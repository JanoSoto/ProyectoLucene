In fact it's kind of a refreshing take on the drama\/romance\/comedy genre. This film is more than a romantic comedy. On the surface that's what it may seem, but it's not. It has more substance and more dynamic angles to the whole concept of love, friendships, curiosity, and loyalty. Ben Affleck portrays Holden, he and his friend Banky(Jason Lee) are the comic-book writer, artist, and inker duo of Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to Alyssa(Joey Lauren Adams) also a comic-book artist, and falls for her hard. Only to later find out that she is a lesbian, which crushes him. Even though they maintain a decent friendship, he still harbors feelings for her, and surprisingly she does as well. This in turn causes some negative reaction to their peers and possibly to themselves. In doing so they ask themselves Can they have relationship with her past being such a huge burden? What kind of sacrifices will have to be made? The film explores all these concepts. I like movies, but I can't recall, and correct me if I'm wrong, if there is another movie with a similar concept prior to Chasing Amy. With that being said, like I said in the beginning of this review, I think this movie really pulled a 360 on the whole genre. It was definitely something new. The three primary leads are great. Affleck and Lee bounce off each other so well in the beginning and it becomes a little upsetting to see them bicker at each other when Joey Lauren Adams's character Alyssa gets in the way of their friendship. Speaking of Alyssa, Lauren Adams is great in the role. She is very cheeky and provides some levity in the film. Smith allows these characters to grow which allows us as the audience to care about them. He writes these characters realistically as possible and I like how he didn't fall under almost any clich√©s in this film. As always Kevin Smith provides lots of sharp and funny dialogue. But this film was something radically different compared to Clerks and Mallrats. Almost all the time Chasing Amy balances out the crude and mean spirited humor and a tender romance extremely well, and it doesn't feel out of place. Strangely it's actually a nice combination between the two. What I also loved seeing was the appearance of Jay and Silent Bob, who for the most of the time whenever they appear in other films are they for some fun gags and humor. This time around, Silent Bob speaks some wisdom out of his mind. He gives out a thoughtful speech about love and relationships all in a matter of minutes to Holden that explains the film's title. Chasing Amy proves Smith is a very capable writer and director. I enjoy Kevin Smith films, but this film is something else. It's so much more and it only suggests that Smith could do so much more if he pushed himself a bit further. 9.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 November 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It's very well made.

Given the pedigree behind everything involved with the film - and, for me, I'm a sucker for a good infidelity drama - it's only a shame this isn't, you know, one of the top films of the 80's. It doesn't quite get there, but it's not for lack of trying on anyone's part. Heartburn is an entertaining picture, even as it doesn't quite move to a beat of a fast drummer, nor does it have very easy solutions to its dramatic conflicts. But that's a good thing here; Nichols and Ephron know this story has people who can't resolve or move on too easily, despite all signs pointing in a direction the audience can read.It's basically this girl and boy meet, boy marries girl - though girl doesn't really want to marry exactly, and one of the funnier set pieces shows Rachel stewing about in the bedroom adjacent to the wedding as friends and family come to try and support (sort of) this whole union - girl and boy find a real 'fixer-upper' house, girl is going to have boy's baby, things are happy... and then suspicion creeps in for the girl. A lot of this is not very much 'plot' driven, though Nichols knows how to tell his story.If there's anything 'off' it might be that the pacing is a little lackadaisical. Not quite the same as 'slow' exactly; you just have to be keyed in to the rhythm that's going on here. The filmmakers here are emphasizing character more. You get scenes, sometimes very funny, like when Mark just breaks out into a goofy song following the news that he's having a baby... and then breaks out into song again the next morning to wake up Rachel. A lot of the movie is more funny in a sly, observational way. It's not as 'LOL' type of funny as work Ephron was to do after this, and some might say like those other movies it's a little chick centric. I can't say if it can be so easily pegged, albeit there are piffy bits like Rachel watching the TV and getting messages about the infidelities going on.Nichols knows this material needs the help of its actors, and of course he has two of the best... ever, really. The charisma and combination just works, there's no doubt about that. And there's both real comedy and real drama to work on (probably more drama than comedy). And sometimes things happen in the movie that seem to be more incidental than anything to push it forward - i.e. Kevin Spacey's debut as a thief - but even this ends up kind of playing a part in the story, at a key moment, near the end. The actors make all these beats very, painfully, awkwardly, sadly and bittersweet-like real. When Rachel suddenly realizes that moment where things are wrong in a hair salon, the way it comes to her, how Nichols moves the camera (and, one of his gifts, knowing when NOT to cut), and how she looks and she goes from 0 to 60... it's wonderful stuff.Why not great? Maybe a little too loose in parts, and the Carly Simon score is grating after a while and dates the movie (the songs too). But all in all, Heartburn is a very good movie about this relationship and its peaks and valleys, but also about the nature of indecision, and how something as seemingly clear-cut as 'stay with your husband - or go' is a real, concrete, existential dilemma.

It's pretty damn scary! It's a better film than films like 1983's Christine & 1986's Maximum Overdrive, combined. Director Lewis Teague did unleashed a semi good horror movie into the screen and it's a bit overlooked. It had some bite with its bark. I remember seeing this film when I was a kid, and being very afraid of the huge St. Bernard. It was like if the dog, Beethoven got rabid. It's a scary thought of a family pet turning against the owners. Unlike the other horrors novels, that go deep into the supernatural and fantasy genre. This film, portrays something that could honestly happen. Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, the movie tells the story of a mother, Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) whom wants to get her car fixed, only to find herself with her son, Tad (Danny Pintauro) trapped in a car, when the neighborhood friendly family dog, Cujo becomes crazed and started killing people after being bitten by a rabid bat. I think, some people give this movie a bad rating, due to that reason, that it's feeding into the hype that certain dog breeds are dangerous. Yes, it's a bit prejudice and ignorance to think of all St. Bernard are evil, but to claim that the movie is too far fetch to be taken serious is an understatement. There has numeral cases of dogs turning against their owners. Yes, abuse, hunger and poor breeding play most of the factors to those accidents happening, but ruthless behaviors coming from normal well-kept dogs, do happen as well. Dogs do bite and dogs could kill you if they wanted to. They are indeed animals, no matter how tame they can seem. You do have to suspense disbelief, somewhat because the movie makes Cujo look something out like a monster. It's like 1993's Sandlot, in the humorous ways, they make Cujo look more than a normal dog through means like puppetry, forced perspective and a guy in dog costume. Still, some shots were pretty good, like the JAWS like animal point of view shots and how they show that loud sounds hurt Cujo. The movie does show how rabies does in fact lead to behavior changes in animals, but a rabid dog would either be hyperactive or lethargic, not super-crazed. This is a lethal disease that would cause the dog to be weaker and weaker, by the time, the Trenton family comes into play. A rabid dog is more likely to attack humans when prone, but it's normally it is too weak to be, even that vicious. It wouldn't have the strength to kill multiple people. Most rabid dogs would not be a killer like Cujo. Still, there's always going to be a slim chance that your dog will turn on you. But the odds of this are so astronomical that to be honest, I would not worry about it. It rarely happen. This movie shouldn't stop people, from buying St. Bernard. Most of them, are truly friendly. It was genuine problem in the making of the film because they simply could not get the St. Bernard to act aggressively. They had to replace him with a cunningly disguised Rottweiler for several crucial scenes, and tape his tail to his leg so he didn't wag it constantly. Large breed dogs like St. Bernard perfectly stable if purchased from a reputable breeder or pound. As long as you meet the requirements of taking care of the breed, this movie shouldn't stop you from buying dogs like that. One thing that I love about the film, is the sense of Man Vs Nature. Thank God, Stephen King didn't add the supernatural into it. The original novel was supposed to be a sequel of sorts following Stephen King 1983's The Dead Zone, in which a previous dead serial killer character, kind of bogeyman, supposedly haunted Tad and possessed Cujo to kill him. I just glad, it never came about, in the film version. I do like how Cujo stakes his prey, as if a Lion or a wolf, waiting for the right moment to attack. You really get the race against time, as conditions inside the car, become more and more unbearable, as heatstroke and dehydration, starts to kick in. The only thing, I kinda hate about the film is how annoying, the child is. The way, he's scream is ear-bleeding. It's super loud. It's doesn't help that the kid is nearly ten year old, yet, he acts like a useless toddler. How lame! He could do more, to help his mother. He was just a burden to watch. He's way too sensitive. I just wish, the movie had the same ending for the kid as the novel. One thing, I didn't like is the sub-plot that the novel had, about Donna cheating on her husband. It never added much to the story. The movie also brings it in, to help push the story, on why the police couldn't find, Donna and the kids, but the movie doesn't give us a conclusion on what happen to the Trenton's marriage. It ends with a cliffhanger note. The same, goes with the Camber family. They go away, for plot reasons, so Donna and the kids can be stuck with the dog, most of the film, but still, you would have thought, they would be used for the big climax, but no, they don't return. The movie would have, more depth, if Bret (Billy Jayne) was the one that had to take his own dog down. It would have been a great Old Yeller type of an ending. Sadly, it never came. Overall It's a dog eat dog world out there and Cujo indeed deserve another look. Like me, you're be really surprise, how good, it was.

The movie does show how rabies does in fact lead to behavior changes in animals, but a rabid dog would either be hyperactive or lethargic, not super-crazed. This is a lethal disease that would cause the dog to be weaker and weaker, by the time, the Trenton family comes into play. A rabid dog is more likely to attack humans when prone, but it's normally it is too weak to be, even that vicious. It wouldn't have the strength to kill multiple people. Most rabid dogs would not be a killer like Cujo. Still, there's always going to be a slim chance that your dog will turn on you. But the odds of this are so astronomical that to be honest, I would not worry about it. It rarely happen. This movie shouldn't stop people, from buying St. Bernard. Most of them, are truly friendly. It was genuine problem in the making of the film because they simply could not get the St. Bernard to act aggressively. They had to replace him with a cunningly disguised Rottweiler for several crucial scenes, and tape his tail to his leg so he didn't wag it constantly. Large breed dogs like St. Bernard perfectly stable if purchased from a reputable breeder or pound. As long as you meet the requirements of taking care of the breed, this movie shouldn't stop you from buying dogs like that. One thing that I love about the film, is the sense of Man Vs Nature. Thank God, Stephen King didn't add the supernatural into it. The original novel was supposed to be a sequel of sorts following Stephen King 1983's The Dead Zone, in which a previous dead serial killer character, kind of bogeyman, supposedly haunted Tad and possessed Cujo to kill him. I just glad, it never came about, in the film version. I do like how Cujo stakes his prey, as if a Lion or a wolf, waiting for the right moment to attack. You really get the race against time, as conditions inside the car, become more and more unbearable, as heatstroke and dehydration, starts to kick in. The only thing, I kinda hate about the film is how annoying, the child is. The way, he's scream is ear-bleeding. It's super loud. It's doesn't help that the kid is nearly ten year old, yet, he acts like a useless toddler. How lame! He could do more, to help his mother. He was just a burden to watch. He's way too sensitive. I just wish, the movie had the same ending for the kid as the novel. One thing, I didn't like is the sub-plot that the novel had, about Donna cheating on her husband. It never added much to the story. The movie also brings it in, to help push the story, on why the police couldn't find, Donna and the kids, but the movie doesn't give us a conclusion on what happen to the Trenton's marriage. It ends with a cliffhanger note. The same, goes with the Camber family. They go away, for plot reasons, so Donna and the kids can be stuck with the dog, most of the film, but still, you would have thought, they would be used for the big climax, but no, they don't return. The movie would have, more depth, if Bret (Billy Jayne) was the one that had to take his own dog down. It would have been a great Old Yeller type of an ending. Sadly, it never came. Overall It's a dog eat dog world out there and Cujo indeed deserve another look. Like me, you're be really surprise, how good, it was. ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"20 November 2014","score":"","review":" I don't know, what some critics were thinking when saying Cujo is not as menacing or frightening as other film adaptations of author Stephen King's popular stories. It's pretty damn scary! It's a better film than films like 1983's Christine & 1986's Maximum Overdrive, combined. Director Lewis Teague did unleashed a semi good horror movie into the screen and it's a bit overlooked. It had some bite with its bark. I remember seeing this film when I was a kid, and being very afraid of the huge St. Bernard. It was like if the dog, Beethoven got rabid. It's a scary thought of a family pet turning against the owners. Unlike the other horrors novels, that go deep into the supernatural and fantasy genre. This film, portrays something that could honestly happen. Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, the movie tells the story of a mother, Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) whom wants to get her car fixed, only to find herself with her son, Tad (Danny Pintauro) trapped in a car, when the neighborhood friendly family dog, Cujo becomes crazed and started killing people after being bitten by a rabid bat. I think, some people give this movie a bad rating, due to that reason, that it's feeding into the hype that certain dog breeds are dangerous. Yes, it's a bit prejudice and ignorance to think of all St. Bernard are evil, but to claim that the movie is too far fetch to be taken serious is an understatement. There has numeral cases of dogs turning against their owners. Yes, abuse, hunger and poor breeding play most of the factors to those accidents happening, but ruthless behaviors coming from normal well-kept dogs, do happen as well. Dogs do bite and dogs could kill you if they wanted to. They are indeed animals, no matter how tame they can seem. You do have to suspense disbelief, somewhat because the movie makes Cujo look something out like a monster.

I can see them liking some aspects and some parts, but both guys actually thinking this was a good movie is beyond me. Honestly, I found this movie worse than Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin tried to be cheesy and kiddie, but it accidentally crossed the line between fun and stupidity. That movie's weirdness just got old after a while and was actually fun in many parts.

Here's what happens, Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric go on a cruise were madman Willem Dafoe uses crazy computer schemes to blow everything up. Sounds good and fresh right? The first half-hour actually is good. People having fun on a cruise, Jason Patric going to propose to Sandra Bullock. When the movie switches gears by becoming more of an action movie as Dafoe hijacks the ship, that is when everything becomes very bad very quickly. If the movie would have stayed the way it was the first little bit, I would have liked this movie just as much as Siskel and Ebert. But nobody knew a ship being taken over would not work, that idea hasn't been done a whole lot and when it has been done, it turns out to be a success.

As anyone knows who has had their ducts cleaned, the required form is HZ\/7B. But I forgive this creative license, because after all, Mister Gilliam's movie is a fantasy; why, he depicts Harry Tuttle, freelance repairman, as an actual person, when everyone knows that rogues like him are just fairy stories invented to scare children. More serious is the erroneous depiction of the elevator shafts in Information Retrieval. I have never been, of course, but I have it on good authority from a friend who has his very own number on his very own door in that very building that the shaft to the right of the reception desk does not stop at the fourth basement level. The elevator bank to the right, however, does. It is details like that that really take me out of a story, and I expect better of Mister Gilliam. After all, he recreates perfectly the look of things around here, from the one- seater cars to the art deco skyscrapers to the film noir fedoras and shadowing. We wouldn't get much done in Information Adjustments without our fedoras, our classic movies on closed-circuit TV, and our pop art on the walls. Without those, the office would just be row after row of absurdly magnified computer screens and perforated, continuous-feed printers, and that's no world I want to live in! At any rate, I also appreciated the festive cheer and very English humor that Mister Gilliam brought to the proceedings. It always puts a smile on my face to see our Nazi stormtrooper security team singing Christmas carols, and to overhear the friendly small talk that they make while hauling a truckload of blindfolded, strung-up terrorists in for interrogations that will be duly and meticulously transcribed, screams and all.

But the same can be said of The Maltese Falcon, which has a plot maybe more convoluted than this film.The overall feeling of the film is anticipation, the waiting for something to happen that clarifies the ambiguous intentions and the shady alliances of the characters, because the viewer--unlike in some other films--knows less than the characters.The acting of Mel Gibson, Raul Julia and, especially, Michelle Pfeiffer should be singled out. In a film where intentions are not revealed, the actors need a good internal compass to direct them with integrity in the development of the roles through the story.The music used adds significantly to the film's mood. Especially the unmistakable sax of David Sanborn, which is one of the highlights of the film.I can understand why some might criticize the ending. I think there might be better choices, but that does not negate the value of the entire film.

Gratefully this wasn't the case at all. You really cared for each of the individual protagonists. Kevin Costner's performance was fantastic, you felt how much he cared but mostly how he just had enough of Al Capone's rain and corruption. Sean Connery was excellent as always, you can believe he's a old school type cop who's seen it all. I didn't realise till after he gets killed how much I cared for Charles Smith's character I think this is due to how well directed the film was, it was full of unexpected twists that kept to you glued to the screen. I needed a pee during the last 40 minutes of the film and I didn't go. I just couldn't stop watching, I had to see what happened next! The sound track was superb, it enhanced every scene it was used in. The directing was brilliant I loved it was done so well, I thought it was better than Scarface. The whole feel of the movie was brilliant and it didn't drag on like some movies do (especially in this crime\/drama genre), it was a nice length. This makes the film even more re-watchable which is another positive. One thing that stops it being a ten is I didn't see enough from Al Capone you got a few snippets but you never felt how feared he was by everyone not only who was around him but the people in Chicago in general more of that would of made it even better for me.

This film was amazing. The acting was fantastic, to watch this straight arrow cop have to do things every bone in his body is telling him not to, was completely enthralling. At times Ethan's performance reminded me Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad just the way he carried and handled himself in certain situations was superb. High praise indeed from me.

The story has twists right to the very end and what makes this film so special and separates the good films from the great. Is that you understand what Ethan's going through, how he sees Denzel's character, how he's conflicted between knowing whats right and what he wants. This is due to the marvellous work of Director Antoine Fuqua, the acting of the two lead roles and the script! The script was sensational it really was, it was dark and gritty throughout keeping a harsh realistic aspect to it.

The Master of film really needed a miracle after the failure of 1941 and boy did he make a adventure classic he really did! I want to talk about John Williams's Theme which is so iconic you can hum it straight away I mean I know every part of the theme every single section of the music I can follow the film along and notice every thrilling trumpet solo and every beat and action the music provides just every section of that unforgettable theme is memorable even the love theme of Marion and Indy's relationship is so perfect! There are some special scenes that are perfect for studying film and it's needs to entertain the fist fight the truck chase are perfect examples of this! John's music scores both of those scenes and all the action scenes the basket game and the Arab swordsman who Indy shoots in the film's best moment of comedy are all scored beautifully and perfectly! Every time the theme is played you know Indy is doing something heroic or heart stopping because you associate the theme with Indy and the adventure and every time the music does not play it means Indy is not on the screen it could be Marion or the Germans that is so important to the film and impossible to replicate in an action film!

As a non-American viewer, this great film gives me an understanding of some American cultures and sub-cultures, including the passion for guns and self-protection. Any country with that kind of beginning cannot simply shake out the inhabited violence in the historical bloodstream. The plot of this film is simple and focused, yet one feels one can understand the entire history of the formation years. Much like a tiny Japanese garden that reflects the wilderness at large. Hatred to this film, based on the hated towards its director Michael Cimino and the allegations of the film's all-around failure, has effectively disillusioned the viewers for decades. On its merit, the film is decent and very well-made, regardless to how much it cost to get made. Having known or not the making of this film, which involves, madly, hundreds of takes for each shot, soon enough one realizes the great painting-like quality of the picture. While watching Heaven's Gate, my mind wanders to The Godfather Part 2, which I find very much in the same level in terms of production. However, Heaven's Gate is a lesser film to that one when it comes to acting depth and dramatic effects. Cimino intends to create a perfect film, and instead he throws himself into the logistical side of the film and forgets to arouse the audience adequately. Anyhow, I encourage everyone to watch this film. As a Buddhist, I realize that hatred breeds stupidity.

The psychological aspects of the story mark this out as a genre piece of worth.Elsewhere director Quentin Lawrence does a study job with what is available to him, Forest Tucker is the hero in waiting, playing it reserved like, and Warren Mitchell proves good foil for Tucker and the Terror! It's not a great film, but it is a good one, let down in some tech departments for sure, but strengths elsewhere make up for its flaws. 7\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"20 November 2014","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" I went to watch this movie with an expectation of seeing a masterpiece, but the film went far from it.
