[{"date":"6 July 2014","score":"","review":" Shrek is Dreamworks biggest and best film franchise with 3 sequels, various specials and 1 spin off. But whilst the sequels are good, none even compare to the original. This is a masterpiece in both animation and writing to make one of the earliest and best CGI animated films.This film keeps making me laugh no matter how many times I've watched it. Throughout it mocks just about every typical fairytale cliché, parodying every detail from the brave dashing knight being a big ogre to the helpless princess being a kick ass chick with attitude. Ironically in their parodying of the stereotypical fairytale romances, it also creates one of their best. Shrek and Fiona are such a perfect couple. Every moment they're together it just feels right. Whether they're bonding over being outcasts or just because of their love of weedrat stew the pair just feel perfect for each other. What puts it above the regular Cinderellas and Snow Whites is that they are both very real characters. Both characters have brilliant designs that have extremely detailed and realistic faces so we always see how the feel. Also they have unique personalities to ensure they stand up from the bland hero and princess formula. Then there's Donkey who makes most of the films funniest moments. Just like Williams with the Genie in Aladdin, Murphy makes this role his own with his fast talking voice suiting Donkey perfectly. Shrek remains one of my favourite films of my childhood. Everything from the soundtrack to the voice acting comes together to make this a great film for the entire family.
