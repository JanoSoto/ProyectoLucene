The movie is a character study of a young man named Paul Baumer (played by Lew Ayres in an Oscar snubbed performance) who is in college during the start of the film with some classmates of his and a teacher who convinces them to serve in World War I and that It is a wonderful thing to die for your country, which is the heroic thing to do. Then as soon as Paul persuades his friends to enlist and go off to war they begin to realize that killing people isn't as fun as they previously thought to which they go from a pro-war to an anti-war stance. Although I disagree with the film's point of view I think that is a great thing for people to serve their own country, and the great thing about movies is that people can tell a story from a certain perspective. The movie compares to some of the greatest war films of all time for example Platoon (1986), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Patton (1970), The Deer Hunter (1978), and The Hurt Locker (2009). Even though the war films that I just listed take place in different wars that we have been involved in, the thing that made me love the movie a whole lot more was reading the novel because it gave me a better understanding of what the film was about and the emotions of the characters, which is why in the film's case it is great on so many levels even the storytelling, acting, photography, and writing, etc. Also these are reasons why I personally think that the movie should received more Oscars and nominations that it ended up receiving at the 3rd Oscars ceremony.

Yet the subsequent sequence includes the sight of two Jedi fighting side by side, blaster bolts deflected in rapid succession, a lightsaber plunged into a metal door to melt it, and eerie insect-like machines with shield generators. How many upgrades to things in the original films were crammed into this one sequence?Don't get me wrong, for this is not intended to uphold The Phantom Menace as a great piece of filmmaking. It still has a host of defects, many of which have been multiplied or magnified due to the clamoring of a fanbase overly insistent on being offended. Yet, its successes have been largely dismissed, and it is not the painful experience that many have declared it to be. Despite modern critics pandering to the fanbase with textbook theory and overcomplicating the matter, the biggest issue has always simply been the less than compelling characters. The story, despite the occasional straining of logic and uneven pace, is passable, and, to its credit, contributes to the two primary subplots of the prequel trilogy the creation of Vader and the establishment of the Empire. Disregarding the other prequels, I think it is interesting to learn that the Jedi leaders originally had grave doubts about Skywalker's future, a grim reminder of what eventually happens. However, I do agree that placing more weight and focus on a development as significant as the resurgence of the Sith would have made for a more streamlined experience. But, I digress. Criticism towards the characters, while not unwarranted, has been misdirected. Most of the actors put forth earnest efforts, particularly Ewan McGregor and Pernilla August. The problem is that they weren't given much to work with. Qui-Gon Jinn, despite having maverick-like characteristics that befit his role in the story, is too subdued for a central figure, and we don't get much beyond the very basic mentor\/student dynamic between him and Obi-Wan. Queen Amidala gets by on admirability and determination. True, she makes some hasty or unwise decisions, but given her age and established inexperience that shouldn't be surprising. Her good intentions are constantly highlighted, so she gets credit for that, and I can't say I was unimpressed by how she conducted things during the climax. Some of the more effective characters don't have much substance, but are memorable, and sometimes that's more important in this film series. The CGI alien creatures, with one glaring exception, are a delight to watch. The shrewd, abrasive Watto is particularly interesting, and a testament that something simple as a unique means of locomotion can add much. The sleazy, hot-headed Sebulba is also great, and Boss Nass is amusing. The secondary villain, Darth Maul, may not have much screen time, but capably fills the role of a menacing, shadowy assassin. No doubt ever exists in the audience's minds that he is a capable threat. Notice how he refrains from the usual doubt exposing taunts, indicating his desire for a purely physical victory. Two aspects of the film that are indisputably well done are the effects and music, both of which have always been crucial to the Star Wars franchise, and both of which save The Phantom Menace from true mediocrity. The reason for this is summed up well by the great Roger Ebert, who wrote, the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. People have grown so preoccupied with other aspects of production that they adamantly proclaim the impossibility of a film succeeding by virtue of its technical aspects; they're wrong. Such movies as Spider-Man 3, Transformers 2 and X-Men 3 were unable to do this because their visual effects were underutilized, ugly, or plumb not impressive. The standards of special effects in the Star Wars movies have always been far above average, and this evident extra effort helps make up for deficiencies. Consider the string of expository scenes after the main group arrives at Coruscant. The individual discussions are mostly stale, but the scenes look so good that this part of the movie hardly feels bogged down.The 4-faceted climax is by far the best section of the movie, and helps overcome the preceding feelings of mundaneness. Though the space assault feels perfunctory and lightweight, the other 3 subplots are entertaining in their own way. The capture of Viceroy Gunray has its fair share of surprises (am I the only one that thought it was neat that a female character was essentially saved by another female character?), and the battle between the gungan and droid armies benefits from interesting new technologies. As much as I like the AT-ST walkers, this battle is an order of magnitude above the ground battle of Return of the Jedi. The best segment is the duel between Maul and the Jedi, which remains a fine demonstration of innovation and upsurge in kineticism, trends that will extend to the succeeding two installments. While it remains the least of the Star Wars film series (not counting the debacle that was The Clone Wars), The Phantom Menace manages to be passable. Yes, it has lapses in logic, unsubstantial characters and fails to truly expand the mythos, but, as the critical reaction indicates, these do not demolish the entertainment value to the extent that some would profess. Audiences expected greatness, Lucas delivered adequacy, but given that more than a decade has passed I implore people to adopt a better attitude about it.

It wouldn't have bothered me if didn't go on for as long as it did. Then, after this long beginning scene, the movie started and I found the colors to be too exaggerated and annoying. I thought it was going to bother me for the whole movie. But after a while I got used to the coloring of the film and it started feel like it went along with the movie and the ridiculously hot summer day. Although, I still thought the red wall behind the three black men on the sidewalk was still too much and a very obnoxious color that didn't fit. But besides all of that I was really able to get into the plot of the film and feel the racial tension of everyone in this neighborhood. I was also pleasantly surprised by Spike Lee's acting ability, I had no idea that he could act along with everything else that he can do. I was very sucked into the film and definitely the Character of Mookie, although I had a love\/hate view of him. I feel as though the movie built really nicely with the racial tension and got to the explosive climax in good time. At first I didn't like the ending because I felt as though Mookie had betrayed the family that had been so good to him even though he was such a slacker, but then after conversation with people I realized that he basically saved his employers from being killed by the mob. I really loved the fact that the movie could spark such conversation and have different interpretations with the title of the film tying in so well. I really loved this movie and would definitely recommend it to really anyone that wants to see a good film.

Road Warrior is everything the first film isn't, it rounds up with even more non-stop, eye- popping & thrilling action that you wouldn't want to end. After the success of the first film, people weren't really sure if the sequel would really live up to it but sure enough it was most certainly a surprise to many and it now stands as one of the greatest sequels. Everything you thought you saw in the first film is put to test with even more extreme sequences with overpowering characters and compelling action. The stunt work that is handled so perfectly poured a lot into this film is more aplenty with its explosive car & motorcycle chases that have you at the edge of your seat. Let's get away from the action aspect right now and focus on the character development that portrayed is just so spot on. Just when Max thought he lost faith in humanity with all its violence and crude people, he then meets these people who actually have the dignity to maintain themselves and be normal human beings and not cause violence for no absolute reason. This is another aspect of the film George Miller got right, he just wanted people that weren't too deranged to help keep the storyline of the film in pace and make this type of film work out. With such a rumbling and uncontrollable score, the action sequences wouldn't of had a extra dose of excitement that it already has, without a score like this, the action sequences wouldn't of nothing to live up too to make them even more gripping and exciting. Conflicting is the right word to describe how unrivaled the costume design was, they really hit the nail on the head with that and you can just tell that this has adjusted a lot from the first film, it made each villainous character more uncomfortable and futile to watch but yet, it was so spot on. With so little supply on Fuel and Water, Max does what he can to risk his life to get those two major implements so he can survive in the environment he lives in now because those are the only artifacts he really needs in his life right now. Overall, The Road Warrior most certainly delivers with the chills, thrills and spills that is most certainly brought more of than in this hell of a sequel and gives the emphasis to action a huge name with so much to handle but is truly a honor to see happen. I found this sequel even more compelling than I did the first one even though the first did set up certain aspects that makes more things understandable and Mel Gibson gives yet again another reasonable performance as Max Rockatansky that will never be forgotten. I couldn't forget about the most saturating camera angles that leaves you in awe and makes you wonder how can just a man as George Miller make such glorious shots?! All in All, this is truly a all time favorite of mine and if I were in your shoes, this is another thrill ride you wouldn't want to miss with the Mad Man himself!

It is honestly Ocean's Eleven before there was an Ocean's Eleven, but it is not nearly as good. The use of shadow in the film added to the mystery of it all and the flashbacks helped tie everything together without giving too much away. This movie wasn't horrible to watch but, it's certainly not my favorite. It had the potential to be really good, but the lack of humor, depth, and drama held it back. The plot was decent, but it could have been flushed out more. I honestly wonder if the costume designers and makeup artists created Sherry's look based off of Betty Boop. George Peatty, played by Elisha Cook Jr., was such a sucker.

With plenty of great performances, one killer and unique Hans Zimmer soundtrack, and a road trip for the century, Thelma & Louise is definitely one of the defining films of the 90's and of the past half century. Not to mention the fact that it has one of the most, if not the most iconic selfie of all time. I'm pretty sure they started it all. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as two women who want to temporarily escape their simplistic lives and get away for a weekend. When one of them has a little too much fun, chaos ensues and suddenly they are fugitives.I don't think it's a problem to draw comparisons to other buddy films, but make no mistake, this isn't your prototypical buddy film, there is plenty of harsh realism on display. Our protagonists aren't your clichéd heroes that do no wrong. Thelma and Louise both do plenty of wrong, and guess what, it actually takes a toll on them. We don't find them blinded by the lifestyle, although they do have quite a lot of fun, but all of it impacts them significantly. Often we see tears and stress hinder their ability to keep driving, but they had no choice. I think it was great that this film not only gave us great characters, but it also played on the stereotypes and gender issues we have today. The reality is that a lot of people wouldn't believe that Thelma was being raped. It happens oh too often still to this day nearly 25 years ago. It's hard to imagine a time when women are finally treated the same as men, but hopefully one day.I also really enjoyed the performances of Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen. For Pitt, it was early on in his career, and he was no doubt doing a completely different role. I'm pretty sure it was the beginning of the Pitt madness of the 90's, but I thought this was more a showcase of his acting talent than anything else. Of course, he also served the role of duping the girls at one point, but I was glad to see in the end, the girls weren't really duped so much as they were let free. The last shot of the film, although definitely controversial, to me was a symbol of just being free to make your own choices. These two women were sick and tired of being controlled and told what to do from their husbands, and this road trip served as a getaway not just for the weekend, but for good. The only real problem I have with the movie was at times I felt the balance between drama and comedy was shaky. I know it can be a satire, but I almost would have liked a more straight drama with comedy sprinkled in then a balance of the two.
