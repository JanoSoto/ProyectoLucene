[{"date":"28 March 1999","score":"","review":"  Rushmore should become a cult classic, but is good enough to inspire something in the masses as well. A very well-casted, well-written and superbly acted story that is different from anything I have seen.Jason Schwartzman is great as the main character, determined to stay at his private school, Rushmore, forever; that is until he meets the woman of his dreams, Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). Bill Murray is classic, though not like he was in Stripes; more like he was in Kingpin.I just saw this movie again and have to say that the music selections are so great. I am buying the soundtrack for sure. I would recommend this movie to anyone (but not young children). It is unique and refreshing.

I was prompted to see it after seeing Rushmore (twice) and a friend of mine highly recommending it.Bottle Rocket didn't disappoint, but I think I might have disappointed it. You see, some of the humor is so subtle that you can easily miss it as I feel I may have. I caught enough of it however to know that Anderson and Wilson have put together quite a funny production.Owen Wilson is so damned funny in his portrayal of Dignan, a slightly off-kilter kid with bigger aspirations to a life of crime. James Caan is very good as well, in his small but essential part as the neighborhood crime boss.This film never takes itself too seriously and that is why it is so good. I hope to see it again in a couple weeks. And it has a good soundtrack to boot.
