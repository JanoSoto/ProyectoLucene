Since the day I've watched this movie, Tim Robbins acting is the greatest show on Earth for me. Anyway, besides him, Arlington has a solid script, that really has something to say, a correct direction e some great supporting cast. Joan Allen is creepy at its best, a wonderful performance. It's a shame that Jeff Bridges didn't represent well the fascinating role that he plays, but this is a minor flaw. Arlington Road is forever the show by Tim Robbins... and it's a devastating, outstanding, unforgettable piece of movie-making.

There were a whole slew of war movies during this period but this here is the most overlooked and that's a real shame because it's one of the best. I've heard some refer to it as a continuation of THE DEER HUNTER and there might be a lot of truth to that because this film takes place fifteen years after the war and it's clear with our characters that the horror of Vietnam are still haunting them. The movie is very quiet as it doesn't preach nor does it try to scream some sort of message. Instead we just peek in on these three people's lives and how the Harris character is pretty much dead even though he survived the war. I think what works best here are the performances, which are all rather amazing. I called the film underrated but that's also true of DeNiro's performance, which to me is one of the better ones in his career. Once again DeNiro dives head first into a role and really comes away with a very memorable character thanks to his performance. For the most part his character is out going and energetic even though he has some demons inside him and DeNiro perfectly pulls this off. I especially loved him during his out going scenes where he's constantly moving and dancing around to let off all the positive energy he's trying to give off. Those are the scenes that worked best with me and the ones that the legendary actor pulled off the best. Harris is also wonderful in the film and manages to steal every scene he's in. He doesn't have too much dialogue so the majority of his acting is with his eyes and he really does a remarkable job. Just take a look at the scene where he goes to visit the parents of his friend who was killed in the war. Baker doesn't get enough credit as an actress but she too delivers the goods here. This film has a slow pace, which allows us to get to know the characters, feel their pain and understand how all three of them are trying to grow. The moving hits on some rather dark subjects and has an overall depressing tone. This might keep some people away but that would be a shame because they'd be missing out on a very impressive film with three excellent performances.

The film centers on taxi driver Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a man clearly with his own demons who finds a purpose in life when he meets a 12-year-old hooker (Jodie Foster) who he plans on saving from her pimp (Harvey Keitel). To me this is one of the richest films ever made and it's one that can easily be overlooked in some circles if you don't really connect to what the film is trying to say. I didn't care too much for the movie the first few times I watched it because I was too young to really understand depression and loneliness. After I understood what those things could do to a person is when I fully became aware of the power in this film and today it remains one of the most powerful films ever made. To me the entire film is pretty much about Travis trying to find someone to fit in with but of course it never really happens until he meets the hooker. He tries fitting in with the Cybill Shepherd character but falls flat on his face. He tries fitting in with his co-workers but that doesn't work out too well. No matter what Travis tries he keeps ending up alone and as he put it, he's God's lonely man. This film works on so many levels but I think the psychological one is where it's best at. Getting us into the mind of Travis works for many reasons but the biggest keys are the direction by Scorsese, the brilliant music score by Bernard Herrmann and DeNiro's groundbreaking performance. Putting those three things together is what makes this a classic but we can also throw in the screenplay by Paul Schrader, which rightfully gives the movie the time and patience to let the Travis character grow right in front of our eyes. DeNiro's performance is certainly one for the ages, although I think he would get even better with Scorsese's RAGING BULL, which would follow in four years. His performance here is nothing short of amazing because you can't help but be terrified by this guy because of the look in DeNiro's eyes. You can't help but feel sorry for him at the same time because there are countless moments where he embarrasses himself because he simply doesn't know how to fit in. The word anti-hero gets used a lot and perhaps that's a good term but I think it's something much deeper than that. DeNiro hits all the right marks without a false note anywhere. Foster is also impressive in her few scenes in the film as is Keitel as the pimp. Shepherd is also good as his Albert Brookes and the underrated Peter Boyle who has one of the best scenes in the movie where he's trying to talk some sense into Travis. The visual look of the film is mighty impressive and Scorsese's directing style is nothing short of amazing. The slimy looking streets and the dark atmosphere are one of a kind and something many films tried to copy but could never get it as perfect as it is here. This here remains one of the greatest American films ever made and I'm really not sure any movie could top it in showing the effects that loneliness can have on a person.

First, there was the 1939 original titled Love Affair with Irene Dunn. Next we have An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.Finally the last time this movie was printed was titled again Love Affair with Warren Beatty and his wife Annette Bening. Undoubtedly, everyone knows that the 1957 version is the best due to Carey Grant and his stature I believe. It was pretty much a standard that everything Carey Grant touched turned into gold. Mr. Grant's picture was listed in Webster's Dictionary under the word Class. (Fun filled fact Cary's real name was Archie Leach!) So all together this movie had a head start of being a great success to 20th Century Fox. This movie probably will be remembered after all as one of the most romantic movies created in all time. I cannot say this is due primarily to Carey Grant, Deb Kerr, or even the plot. The 1957 plot was followed to the letter, verbatim from the 1939 version. So the question is why is this remake so remembered after all...no pun intended?So now I will try to dive into the reels of celluloid to solve this mystery of this film classic (untangle me please, I think I just got lost in the Wizard of Oz). Most important if you have not seen this movie please do. If you didn't please submit to me WHY so I can laugh at you! Even if you are a couch potato guy and non romantic type, something about Carey Grant will impress upon you and keep you entertained, if not Debbie Kerr's boobs should do the trick. You can obtain a copy of this movie here http\/\/www.amazon.com\/Affair-Remember-Cary-Grant\/dp\/B00007JMDF.( A free ad support to Amazon.com. I love Amazon you should too.) Alright back to the movie, released July 11th, 1957 billing two very big stars it instantly was born into the canals of movie legend. While I do like Carey Grant, Deborah Kerr was always a hit or miss for me. I find her to mostly be annoying and stuck up. Hollywood saw her as an approachable\/average lady type but I tend not to agree. I do not believe anyone could ever even come close to approachable as Audrey Hepburn. Had she been in this..it would of been immortal. Maybe I can go back in time and recast this...but I doubt it. My first conclusion is primarily, Cary Grant made this film what it is. As I have explained above, his billing ensured insta success and mostly every single one of his pictures was a monetary success. Known for his looks, his charm, and he was able to do all this while reminiscent of an average Joe. He was known in Old Hollywood for being the only leading man that could bear the brunt of jokes thrown at him. People loved having this demigod that they could laugh and touch. It would be as if a modern day Zeus would sit and eat popcorn with you watching this movie. I believe Mr. Grant's touch of himself allowed this movie to be what it is. I do believe he had a great vehicle of a script to do whatever he had to in this film. Since we are staying with actors in this paragraph, I shall briefly touch on Deborah Kerr. Yes, granted I believe she did a great job. I will give her the due for her part. I do not however think she made this film MEMORABLE. There are parts in the movie, mainly the last scene that do shine though. I mostly start to like her when she cannot walk anymore. Somewhere, somehow she related to the pain of this character immobility. Maybe it was more dramatic? Who knows. In the scene when she is on the cruise liner I like she is able to hold her own water with Cary Grant in her comeback lines. Without Cary in the scene, it becomes lack luster and somewhat mundane. So again, I give this 1st portion to Mr. Grant.Technicolor. Technicolor. Technicolor. What a change to the film industry for the better. It was the first major development since voice and sounds were added in the 1929 film The Jazz Singer Ms. Kerr here had the ability to use her red hair to boost her presence. Anything in color to me was better. I'm sure my buddy Robert Osborne (Hope your my friend!) might disagree. I prefer color. I believe that the colorization to the film helped entirely. Since Love Affair 1994 was color, it goes back to it was all about Cary Grant. I do love the version with Warren Beatty, I really do. But It just is not the 1957 version. Soundtrack. Soundtrack. Soundtrack. While we pulled a headline famous song routine entitled An Affair to Remember to accompany this movie it increased sales. Vic Damone was the first singer to attach his credits to it. Vic was pretty popular in his hay day and it was truly a good song. Ms. Kerr did fake sing a portion of her song but it was boring boring boring.

He was known in Old Hollywood for being the only leading man that could bear the brunt of jokes thrown at him. People loved having this demigod that they could laugh and touch. It would be as if a modern day Zeus would sit and eat popcorn with you watching this movie. I believe Mr. Grant's touch of himself allowed this movie to be what it is. I do believe he had a great vehicle of a script to do whatever he had to in this film. Since we are staying with actors in this paragraph, I shall briefly touch on Deborah Kerr. Yes, granted I believe she did a great job. I will give her the due for her part. I do not however think she made this film MEMORABLE. There are parts in the movie, mainly the last scene that do shine though. I mostly start to like her when she cannot walk anymore. Somewhere, somehow she related to the pain of this character immobility. Maybe it was more dramatic? Who knows. In the scene when she is on the cruise liner I like she is able to hold her own water with Cary Grant in her comeback lines. Without Cary in the scene, it becomes lack luster and somewhat mundane. So again, I give this 1st portion to Mr. Grant.Technicolor. Technicolor. Technicolor. What a change to the film industry for the better. It was the first major development since voice and sounds were added in the 1929 film The Jazz Singer Ms. Kerr here had the ability to use her red hair to boost her presence. Anything in color to me was better. I'm sure my buddy Robert Osborne (Hope your my friend!) might disagree. I prefer color. I believe that the colorization to the film helped entirely. Since Love Affair 1994 was color, it goes back to it was all about Cary Grant. I do love the version with Warren Beatty, I really do. But It just is not the 1957 version. Soundtrack. Soundtrack.

First, there was the 1939 original titled Love Affair with Irene Dunn. Next we have An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.Finally the last time this movie was printed was titled again Love Affair with Warren Beatty and his wife Annette Bening. Undoubtedly, everyone knows that the 1957 version is the best due to Carey Grant and his stature I believe. It was pretty much a standard that everything Carey Grant touched turned into gold. Mr. Grant's picture was listed in Webster's Dictionary under the word Class. (Fun filled fact Cary's real name was Archie Leach!) So all together this movie had a head start of being a great success to 20th Century Fox. This movie probably will be remembered after all as one of the most romantic movies created in all time. I cannot say this is due primarily to Carey Grant, Deb Kerr, or even the plot. The 1957 plot was followed to the letter, verbatim from the 1939 version. So the question is why is this remake so remembered after all...no pun intended?So now I will try to dive into the reels of celluloid to solve this mystery of this film classic (untangle me please, I think I just got lost in the Wizard of Oz). Most important if you have not seen this movie please do. If you didn't please submit to me WHY so I can laugh at you! Even if you are a couch potato guy and non romantic type, something about Carey Grant will impress upon you and keep you entertained, if not Debbie Kerr's boobs should do the trick. You can obtain a copy of this movie here http\/\/www.amazon.com\/Affair-Remember-Cary-Grant\/dp\/B00007JMDF.( A free ad support to Amazon.com. I love Amazon you should too.) Alright back to the movie, released July 11th, 1957 billing two very big stars it instantly was born into the canals of movie legend. While I do like Carey Grant, Deborah Kerr was always a hit or miss for me. I find her to mostly be annoying and stuck up. Hollywood saw her as an approachable\/average lady type but I tend not to agree. I do not believe anyone could ever even come close to approachable as Audrey Hepburn. Had she been in this..it would of been immortal. Maybe I can go back in time and recast this...but I doubt it. My first conclusion is primarily, Cary Grant made this film what it is. As I have explained above, his billing ensured insta success and mostly every single one of his pictures was a monetary success. Known for his looks, his charm, and he was able to do all this while reminiscent of an average Joe. He was known in Old Hollywood for being the only leading man that could bear the brunt of jokes thrown at him. People loved having this demigod that they could laugh and touch.

Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (Shawshank is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called The Sisters. Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the Sisters is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Cool Hand Luke, Brubaker and the more recent The Last Castle. (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, The Green Mile, based, like The Shawshank Redemption on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. The Shawshank Redemption falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word prison, from the French pris (taken), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as penitentiary or reformatory which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the fixer who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted The Godfather as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. Shawshank is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his rickshaw film was going) and redemption, except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word redemption is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption.

I was very impressed with his efforts taking into consideration that it was the first time in full charge. The film was written by Graham Yost, who could also be considered as a fresher, as Speed was the first film he wrote, prior to writing TV shows. To finish up, I did enjoy this film and I imagine many others will too. Don't have any doubt about watching this. Its not a must see film, but its enjoyable to say the least. So, if you ever have 111 minutes to spare in your life then the best thing to do is resort to Speed. The film, not the drug.

It's up to Officer Jack Traven (Reeves) to prevent the bus from exploding. He does this amazingly by boarding the bus and keeping the speed above 50mph. He also has to deal with terrified passengers which he finds isn't an easy job at all. Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is a passenger on board of the bus and she takes control as the driver. She controls the bus with an obvious wisdom of horror but also with a strong sentiment of authority. Reeves character puts his trust into Annie immediately and they are both able to support each other in many life or death situations that occur. Jack Traven (Reeves) and Annie (Bullock) form a comforting bond which really helps them both whilst they are in the middle of a crisis. Payne(Hopper) is simply greedy for money and wants Traven (Reeves) to provide the money for him - before he starts taking away people's lives, and he will do so with no hesitation. There is not a second of wasted screen time which just makes it a spectacular film to watch. The film is very enjoyable and includes intense situations that are simply breathtaking. Speed has been correlated to Die Hard because it features vulnerable hostages that are surviving from a heroic figure. What I enjoyed about this film is that it had a mixture of suspense and humour featuring fast moving shots and a killer sense of hilarity with various unexpected plot twists!However, there were parts of the film appeared to be a little unrealistic and it seemed that more research ought to have taken into position before shooting, or shouldn't have been included in the final edit at all.. I found myself questioning the logic during certain scenes considering it is classified as a realist film.

I happened across some of it in the middle of the night a few months back and was intrigued. I just saw all of it and came away somewhat impressed. Just read Ebert's scornful review to get an idea of the negative press that must have sunk this film. True, nothing we see is really plausible, but.... HELLO! This is a fantasy. It is science fiction. Well, thankfully the science really doesn't matter here.The story is somewhat based on the H.G. Wells book of the same name. Apparently the director of record here is his great grandson. I have never read the book, but it would seem unnecessary when it comes to understanding this film. Guy Pierce plays a young scientist who designs a time machine, hoping to go back a few years and save his fiancé who dies in a mugging. Using Einstein's theories, he does so. But no sooner does he think he has saved the woman, than he discovers that fate may not have any regard for our scientific accomplishments. In order to figure out why this is, Pierce next travels into the future. First into the year 2030, and eventually some 800,000 years later! What he finds has happened to humanity is enough to make anyone shiver. It seems that humans have destroyed the moon, and this eventually led to great problems for earth. Humanity ended up splitting into two subspecies. The Eloi, who are brown-skinned and peaceful as any romanticized depiction of Native Americans. And the Morlocks, an underground-dwelling and ferocious bunch who feed on the Eloi. Jeremy Irons is their supreme leader! He is the most advanced creature in the film. He can even read the minds of those he encounters. The rest of the film deals with Pierce settling in with the Eloi and trying to free them from the Morlocks. All of this in just over 95 minutes!! The film has many, many good things going for it. The special effects of time travel will be what you remember the most. Watching the earth change around Pierce while he sits inside the protective cocoon of his machine is quite a sight. The machine itself is an impressive creation rumored to be one of the most expensive movie props ever built. The acting is terrific in most cases, too. Guy Pierce has never quite become a huge star, but he has the talent to be one.

The music is better than average, and the locations (past and future) always look good or even frightening.I'd be the first to tell you to give this movie a look. It isn't too long, and it is full of interesting happenings. And keep in mind that it is a fantasy. You aren't supposed to believe it for a minute.

They were responsible for a string of films- Chariots of Fire, Gandhi, Local Hero, The Killing Fields, Hope and Glory- which not only rank among the greatest ever British films but were also much admired internationally. Chariots of Fire and Gandhi both won Best Picture Oscars, and several of their other films were nominated, including The Mission.The film did not, however, perform well at the box office; possibly its theme, the Guarani War of the 1750s, was too remote to appeal to the average cinema-goer. Set in what is today Paraguay and the adjoining areas of Brazil and Argentina, it tells the story of Father Gabriel, a Spanish Jesuit, who enters the jungle to build a mission and convert the local Guaraní Indians to Christianity. The Jesuit missions of this area were largely autonomous of the Spanish state and provided the Indians some protection against Portuguese slave-traders. Gabriel is joined in his work by Rodrigo Mendoza, a former mercenary and slave-trader who has repented and become a Christian after killing his brother in a quarrel over a woman. Eventually, Mendoza becomes a Jesuit himself.The crisis comes when the Jesuit missions, which under Spanish rule enjoyed some protection, are handed over to the Portuguese under the terms of the Treaty of Madrid. A Papal emissary, Cardinal Altamirano, is sent to determine whether the missions should continue to enjoy their autonomy under Portuguese rule, or whether they should be suppressed, which will allow the new colonial masters to enslave the Guaraní. The King of Portugal, Joseph I, has come under the influence of his anti-clerical favourite, the Marquis of Pombal, who is threatening to expel the Jesuits from Portugal itself, and Altamirano believes that such an outcome can be avoided if he permits the suppression of their missions in South America.The film is notable for its sympathetic treatment of Christianity, and poses the question how should Christians respond to evil? It does not provide an easy answer, because there is no easy answer to this question. (The script was written by Robert Bolt, author of A Man for All Seasons which asks the same question in slightly different terms). The two main characters, Gabriel and Mendoza, symbolise two possible responses, Gabriel representing Christian pacifism and Mendoza the concept of the just war. Mendoza the former slaver has come to detest slavery with all the zeal of the convert, and when the Portuguese send soldiers to destroy the mission he uses his military experience to lead the Guaraní in a war of resistance. Gabriel detests slavery as much as Mendoza, but he also detests war and violence, which he sees as the negation of all he has ever worked for, and refuses to fight the invaders, trying to defend the community by nonviolent means.Altamirano represents a third possible response, that of collaboration. As played by Ray McAnally, he is by no means an evil man, despite the part he plays in the destruction of the missions. He is sincerely devout, and can appreciate the worth of what Gabriel and the Jesuits are trying to do in Paraguay. His dilemma is similar to that facing many in Nazi-occupied Europe; does one collaborate with evildoers, in the hope that one can thereby mitigate their evil, or does one actively oppose them, with the risk that this might provoke them to commit even more wicked acts? Altamirano's decision is wrong, especially as the Jesuits were indeed to be expelled from Portugal about a decade after the events shown in this film, but that does not necessarily mean that the thought-processes that led him to that decision were all base ones.This was the second film to be directed by Roland Joffé, the first being The Killing Fields (also for Goldcrest). In the mid-eighties he was regarded as one of the brightest talents in the British cinema, and these two films show why. The British film industry is sometimes accused of shying away from the darker side of life, and it can certainly sometimes be parochial in its preference for films with a local setting, but these two films do not fit that stereotype at all; both are set in distant parts of the world, and both deal unsparingly with the subject of man's inhumanity. The Mission, in particular, is a superb film, for a number of reasons.Firstly it deals with a serious subject in an intelligent way. Secondly, there is a great musical score from Ennio Morricone, especially the haunting theme played to the Indians by Gabriel on his oboe. (Under the title Gabriel's Oboe it has become part of the Classical repertoire). Thirdly, there is the photography of the dramatic jungle scenery, which helped win the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. (The film was actually shot in Colombia; possibly political considerations precluded filming in Paraguay itself, then still under the rule of the Stroessner dictatorship). Fourthly, there is the power and drama of the action sequences.Finally, Joffé was able to call upon some great acting, from McAnally, and from Jeremy Irons who succeeds well in conveying Gabriel's wisdom and goodness. Above all there is Robert De Niro. This is not often ranked among his greatest films, but in my view it should be. (Perhaps some of his admirers find it difficult to accept him as anything other than an American). Mendoza is a character who goes through considerable development in the course of the film, from brutal, swaggering soldier of fortune, to conscience-stricken penitent, to man of God, to desperate freedom fighter, and De Niro is never less than convincing in all of these four different incarnations.

Not nearly as bad as critics have reported.Since its release and up until now, Bay and Bruckheimer's version of the day which will live in infamy remains much-maligned and heavily criticized. Sure it's melodramatic. Sure it's about as accurate as a kid playing with toy planes and boats in a bathtub. But I thought PEARL HARBOR, as an old-fashioned melodrama set on a historical event, is an entertaining romp, depending how you look at it. Despite Bay's self-importance, PEARL HARBOR is a gorgeous, visually-stunning, unashamedly clichéd and old-fashioned epic that, while a mile away from perfection, is also a mile away from what critics make it look. Where else could you possibly still hear such dialogs as ...And then I kissed him or I'll be back for you? Where else could you have a love story as complicated as a love triangle about two young pilots who both fall in love with the same girl, a nurse, amidst their duties in the impending war? How many movies still give as that gung-ho action as planes who go woosh!! in the air, chasing and gunning each other down? PEARL HARBOR offers them all, the old-fashioned way. It gets trite and cliché in doing so, but I think that's just part of fun.Like its obvious inspiration, James Cameron's mega-hit TITANIC, the movie is cut into two parts. The first act involves a love story, in this case a ménage à trois involving crack air pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), hopelessly devoted to gorgeous nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who volunteers to fight in the Eagle Squadron in England. Unfortunately his plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain is he's reported dead, much to the mourning of poor Evelyn, while Rafe's best buddy Danny (Josh Hartnett) provides her comfort. Will these two end up together? Well, after they cuddle in a parachute hangar, indeed they do, much to the anger of Rafe, who turns up alive and seeing his girl in the loving hands of his best buddy.But they really have no time to argue when history interrupts. Japanese Zeroes swoop down in the harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, having been devised few days earlier by Admiral Yamamoto (Mako), who's famous line of dialog (I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.) is only briefly mentioned here. The attack itself is immense, delivering all the explosions, disaster and trauma of the actual attack, only with neat CGI planes and sinking battleships. But just when the movie should have ended at this point, the movie throws in an additional hour devoted to the Tokyo Raid led by Lt. Col. Dolittle (Alec Baldwin, in a clichéd but acceptable role). Running nearly as long as 3 hours (or more!), PEARL HARBOR really doesn't need the extra hour, even if it just for the sake of ending the film on a happy note.But despite the prolonged running time, PEARL HARBOR just about gave me my money's worth. It's a terrific turn on the old 1940's romance movies (as Bay describes it). It's sappy, melodramatic and a bit cliché, but entertaining as whole. The performances were adequate, with Affleck and Hartnett playing bland yet reliable cocky heroes. But Beckinsale deserves some praise who looks and acts like a classic beauty, something that would be right at home with an old-fashioned lover story. Jon Voight momentarily appears as wheelchair-bound President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but goes way over the top in a scene where he literally stands in his own two feet, despite the fact that he was affected by polio. Cuba Gooding Jr. lands an important role that's reduced simply as an extended cameo while Baldwin and Colm Feore play clichéd roles of real flesh-and-blood historical figures. But what it lacks in human and character dimension, it makes up in pure spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and the production design is spectacular.

Sure it's melodramatic. Sure it's about as accurate as a kid playing with toy planes and boats in a bathtub. But I thought PEARL HARBOR, as an old-fashioned melodrama set on a historical event, is an entertaining romp, depending how you look at it. Despite Bay's self-importance, PEARL HARBOR is a gorgeous, visually-stunning, unashamedly clichéd and old-fashioned epic that, while a mile away from perfection, is also a mile away from what critics make it look. Where else could you possibly still hear such dialogs as ...And then I kissed him or I'll be back for you? Where else could you have a love story as complicated as a love triangle about two young pilots who both fall in love with the same girl, a nurse, amidst their duties in the impending war? How many movies still give as that gung-ho action as planes who go woosh!! in the air, chasing and gunning each other down? PEARL HARBOR offers them all, the old-fashioned way. It gets trite and cliché in doing so, but I think that's just part of fun.Like its obvious inspiration, James Cameron's mega-hit TITANIC, the movie is cut into two parts. The first act involves a love story, in this case a ménage à trois involving crack air pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), hopelessly devoted to gorgeous nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who volunteers to fight in the Eagle Squadron in England. Unfortunately his plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain is he's reported dead, much to the mourning of poor Evelyn, while Rafe's best buddy Danny (Josh Hartnett) provides her comfort. Will these two end up together? Well, after they cuddle in a parachute hangar, indeed they do, much to the anger of Rafe, who turns up alive and seeing his girl in the loving hands of his best buddy.But they really have no time to argue when history interrupts. Japanese Zeroes swoop down in the harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, having been devised few days earlier by Admiral Yamamoto (Mako), who's famous line of dialog (I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.) is only briefly mentioned here. The attack itself is immense, delivering all the explosions, disaster and trauma of the actual attack, only with neat CGI planes and sinking battleships. But just when the movie should have ended at this point, the movie throws in an additional hour devoted to the Tokyo Raid led by Lt. Col. Dolittle (Alec Baldwin, in a clichéd but acceptable role). Running nearly as long as 3 hours (or more!), PEARL HARBOR really doesn't need the extra hour, even if it just for the sake of ending the film on a happy note.But despite the prolonged running time, PEARL HARBOR just about gave me my money's worth. It's a terrific turn on the old 1940's romance movies (as Bay describes it). It's sappy, melodramatic and a bit cliché, but entertaining as whole. The performances were adequate, with Affleck and Hartnett playing bland yet reliable cocky heroes. But Beckinsale deserves some praise who looks and acts like a classic beauty, something that would be right at home with an old-fashioned lover story. Jon Voight momentarily appears as wheelchair-bound President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but goes way over the top in a scene where he literally stands in his own two feet, despite the fact that he was affected by polio. Cuba Gooding Jr. lands an important role that's reduced simply as an extended cameo while Baldwin and Colm Feore play clichéd roles of real flesh-and-blood historical figures.

Really, the story is about a couple young fellas in the desert who end up becoming involved in a plot to kill a gang of outlaw marauding vampires. That's the sum of it, and I won't tell ya how it ends up.Impressions\/observations - What I will discuss is the meat of the movie and why this movie falls extremely short of a good solid vampire movie. First off, I was very disappointed in the way the vampires are portrayed in this movie. There is absolutely nothing supernatural about them - they don't have superhuman strength, don't fly, don't really have anything about them that makes me believe that they are supernatural predators. They are about as ordinary as a gang of unruly youths, except that they have to be killed only under certain conditions. But I don't recall ever seeing them do anything in the movie that would suggest that they are, in fact, vampires. Not only do they carry guns to kill people with, they need cars to get around. I mean, this movie really gave the vampires a very mortal feel to them. They got lots of attitude and desire for blood-letting, but then again so do the thugs in a Charles Bronson movie. If you want supernatural thrills and chills - this movie falls flat on its face. It's just a reason to get a couple young hunks and an attractive girl together in a plot to kill some rather boring vampires.Gore - Not nearly enough to satisfy horror movie die-hards. The gore really comes down to maybe a few buckets of fake blood, but nothing to pop your eyes out or lose a kidney over. The killings are very non-traditional killings for a vampire movie - relatively tame with minimal blood. Too many scenes that cut away to another scene just as you'd expect so see some guts flying out. Again, compared to vampire movies like the very bloody and gruesome Underworld trilogy, this movie is very very tame.Nudity - A few scenes involving the attractive lead actress. I particularly found these scenes rather annoying - nonsensical nudity tossed into a movie, and from a girl who's entire character is nearly comatose and sickly. Although she is pretty to look at, the lead actress's character is so paper-thin and shallow that all she really is in the movie is a silent and underdeveloped persona that, through some odd and contrived arrangement of the plot details, needs to be in the movie. I don't mind actresses baring their skin when the role calls for it, but please folks, put it into context of a movie that makes sense. The first images of the movie showing her in the shower washing off the blood from her body was, in all honesty, nearly the point I wanted to throw the remote at the television and give the movie no further viewing. But I held back my inclination and decided to give the movie an entire watch.Action - Lots of it. Car chases, explosions, all the stuff of low-budget movies. There is nothing in this movie we haven't seen on a single episode of McGuiver. Again, the action is plenty but nothing remarkable. All pretty standard here.Overall - I gave this movie 2 points out of ten, and primarily because, for a vampire movie, it is a step backwards. This movie adds absolutely nothing to the vampire genre and actually mortalizes the vampires. For most of the movie, I was thinking OK this is a joke - we're all going to be told at the end of the movie that they really weren't vampires all along. But they were vampires in the end, just extremely boring vampires that were way to human for my tastes. No fangs, no special powers, nothing supernatural about them.

","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"13 March 2009","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I have never read a single one of John Grisham's novels; he is one of those authors whose works I know solely from film adaptations, of which there have been several. A Time to Kill forms part of the cinematic tradition which uses the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society. This tradition dates back at least as far as Intruder in the Dust from 1949, and perhaps the best-known example is To Kill a Mockingbird. Modern examples include Ghosts of Mississippi (also from 1996) and Snow Falling on Cedars, although that was set in the Pacific North-West rather than the Deep South and the defendant was of Japanese rather than African-American descent. Just Cause starts out like a film of this type but is then spoilt by a plot twist which negates its anti-racist credentials.The film is set in Clanton, Mississippi. A 10-year-old black girl named Tonya Hailey is raped, violently beaten and dumped in a river by two white racists. Tonya survives her ordeal and the men are arrested. Her father Carl Lee fears that, due to ingrained racism in the area, they may be acquitted by a white jury, and goes to the county courthouse where he shoots them dead with a rifle. The policeman escorting them is injured in the shooting. Carl Lee is arrested and charged with murder.The rest of the film revolves around Carl Lee's subsequent trial. A common feature of this type of film is the fearless white lawyer who stands up for justice. (It is curious how this convention has survived for so long. Might it not be more original to have a fearless black lawyer?) This film features two such characters, Carl Lee's attorney, Jake Brigance, and Ellen Roark, a liberal law student from Massachusetts and ACLU member who volunteers to assist Jake with the defence, which revolves around a plea of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Although he opposes racism, Jake himself is not particularly liberal; he is, unlike Ellen, a supporter of the death penalty. Indeed, there is a suggestion that he is so keen take on the defence because he approves of the sort of vigilante justice which Carl Lee handed out to the two rapists.Defending a black man accused of murdering two whites does not make Jake and Ellen popular with many in the white community, and tensions begin to rise, especially when the Ku Klux Klan begins to organise in the area. Jake is forced to send his wife and young daughter away for their own safety- a wise decision as his house is later targeted by arsonists. Ellen is kidnapped by Klansmen, but later rescued.I felt that Matthew McConaughey, only in his mid-twenties at the time, perhaps came across as too young and inexperienced for a lawyer charged with so major a case. (He was later, in Amistad, to play another lawyer acting for black defendants charged with murder, although that was a historical film set in the days of slavery). Several other actors such as Kevin Costner, most of them rather older than McConaughey, were considered for the role. I felt that much of the sub-plot involving Ellen, who comes close to having an affair with Jake before he develops a conscience at the last minute, was rather unnecessary, and probably included because the film-makers needed a role for a major female star. (Jake's wife Carla does not really count as such because she is absent from the action for much of the time).There were, however, some good acting performances. I liked Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee, a decent family man driven beyond endurance by the attack on his daughter and, more generally, by the racist attitudes of the white community. I also liked Donald Sutherland in a cameo role as Lucien Wilbanks, a veteran liberal lawyer who has been disbarred for violence on a picket line activist but who still manages to provide Jake with advice. Perhaps the best performance comes from Kevin Spacey as the ruthless district attorney Rufus Buckley, the sort of prosecutor who is less interested in justice than in furthering his own political career. (The American system of directly elected prosecutors- anathema to anyone involved in the British legal system- seems to be taking some flak from Hollywood; F. Murray Abraham played a similar character in the Bonfire of the Vanities).I have not liked all the Grisham-based films I have seen, but A Time to Kill is one of the better ones; I preferred it, for instance, to The Client, which was also directed by Joel Schumacher. The interest of the film lies not only in the courtroom duels between the opposing lawyers but also in the issues it raises about race and about justice. The film suggests that there may exist in America more insidious forms of racism than the brutal hatred which inspires the Klan and the rapists. Carl Lee points out that white people, however well intentioned, see him as a black man rather than simply as a man, and that even the most liberal whites rarely socialise with blacks. The film also explores the question of vigilantism and when revenge might be justified; if people are not to take the law into their own hands, the authorities need to maintain a firm grip on it themselves and to be sure that it does not slip from their hands though either weakness or prejudice. A well-made, thought-provoking thriller. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2009","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I have never read a single one of John Grisham's novels; he is one of those authors whose works I know solely from film adaptations, of which there have been several. A Time to Kill forms part of the cinematic tradition which uses the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society. This tradition dates back at least as far as Intruder in the Dust from 1949, and perhaps the best-known example is To Kill a Mockingbird. Modern examples include Ghosts of Mississippi (also from 1996) and Snow Falling on Cedars, although that was set in the Pacific North-West rather than the Deep South and the defendant was of Japanese rather than African-American descent. Just Cause starts out like a film of this type but is then spoilt by a plot twist which negates its anti-racist credentials.The film is set in Clanton, Mississippi. A 10-year-old black girl named Tonya Hailey is raped, violently beaten and dumped in a river by two white racists. Tonya survives her ordeal and the men are arrested. Her father Carl Lee fears that, due to ingrained racism in the area, they may be acquitted by a white jury, and goes to the county courthouse where he shoots them dead with a rifle. The policeman escorting them is injured in the shooting. Carl Lee is arrested and charged with murder.The rest of the film revolves around Carl Lee's subsequent trial. A common feature of this type of film is the fearless white lawyer who stands up for justice. (It is curious how this convention has survived for so long. Might it not be more original to have a fearless black lawyer?) This film features two such characters, Carl Lee's attorney, Jake Brigance, and Ellen Roark, a liberal law student from Massachusetts and ACLU member who volunteers to assist Jake with the defence, which revolves around a plea of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Although he opposes racism, Jake himself is not particularly liberal; he is, unlike Ellen, a supporter of the death penalty. Indeed, there is a suggestion that he is so keen take on the defence because he approves of the sort of vigilante justice which Carl Lee handed out to the two rapists.Defending a black man accused of murdering two whites does not make Jake and Ellen popular with many in the white community, and tensions begin to rise, especially when the Ku Klux Klan begins to organise in the area. Jake is forced to send his wife and young daughter away for their own safety- a wise decision as his house is later targeted by arsonists. Ellen is kidnapped by Klansmen, but later rescued.I felt that Matthew McConaughey, only in his mid-twenties at the time, perhaps came across as too young and inexperienced for a lawyer charged with so major a case.

This time Jones is searching for perhaps the most fabled artifact of all, the holy grail.In comparison to Raiders, I think that the script is more polished, utilizes comedy more effectively and includes set-pieces that are just as entertaining as those seen previously. That being said, at first there's a bit of a sense of 'been there, done that' since the early scenes are a little too similar to the first film. However, the film soon finds its groove and doesn't let up until the credits roll.A bonus this time around is the fact that Sean Connery stars as Jones's father. Ford & Connery are great together and the pairing lets us see aspects of the character that hadn't been explored before. John Rhys-Davies & Denholm Elliott reprise their roles from the first film while Alison Doody & Julian Glover do a fine job of portraying Jones's love interest and nemesis, respectively.Spielberg's direction is once again top-notch and the special effects are solid. John Williams returns with another Oscar-nominated score that recaptures the spirit of the original. Overall, the production values are first-rate.In the end, though, the most important thing to note about this film is that it's a hell of a lot of fun. I don't think that you could have asked for a better capper to the series, which is why it puzzles me that Spielberg & Lucas decided to revisit the character nearly twenty years later.

Ford & Connery are great together and the pairing lets us see aspects of the character that hadn't been explored before. John Rhys-Davies & Denholm Elliott reprise their roles from the first film while Alison Doody & Julian Glover do a fine job of portraying Jones's love interest and nemesis, respectively.Spielberg's direction is once again top-notch and the special effects are solid. John Williams returns with another Oscar-nominated score that recaptures the spirit of the original. Overall, the production values are first-rate.In the end, though, the most important thing to note about this film is that it's a hell of a lot of fun. I don't think that you could have asked for a better capper to the series, which is why it puzzles me that Spielberg & Lucas decided to revisit the character nearly twenty years later. As with Star Wars, stick with the original trilogy and you won't be disappointed. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"}]
