There's Something About Mary took the romantic comedy to a new level.  But Kingpin stands out as the most bizarre and likeable film of the Farelly trilogy.  Much like the Billy Madison of Adam Sandler films, Kingpin is not so much funnier than the rest of the Farelly Brother's movies, as it is more weird and awesome.There are some scenes that drag, and I don't think Randy Quaid's character is as funny as it should have been, but everything else here is gold.

In the first five minutes of Dinosaur, Disney tries to impress us by showing everything they can do with their computer generated effects.  And let's face it, that's the only reason we saw this movie in the first place (at least those of us without kids).But it's not the special effects that make a great special effects movie, and in the long run, Dinosaur will be forgotten among such landmark films as 2001  A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Toy Story. These movies combined creative ideas with special effects, and are now lodged in our cultural memory.Dinosaur exhibits no creative thought.  It's pretty much the same story as The Land Before Time, only this go-round we're dealing with digital dinosaurs.  Beyond being unoriginal, the story is weak  it's about a herd of dinosaurs trying to find their nesting area.  Everything that happens along the way has been done before and done better.  Even the celebrity voices suck (D.B. Sweeney?).  Particularly bad is the comic relief, which comes in the form of horny, yet unattractive monkey (I know it sounds funny, but it never is).  The movie is oddly short (about 75-80 minutes), for which I suppose we should be thankful.One comment about the special effects  they're great, but are they any more realistic than Jurassic Park's dinosaurs?  Spielberg wanted to show us what dinosaurs actually looked like millions of years ago.  In Dinosaur, we see a bunch of generic dinosaurs who make ridiculous facial expressions. The monkeys also make crazy faces from time to time.

I can only recall one discontinuity. Matthew McConnaughy's character punches Erik Palladino, and in the next shot Palladino doesn't look as if he's been punched at all. But such glitches are rare. Another criticism While it is refreshing that Mostow wants to convey that his characters are scared even when they do brave deeds, the director has McConnaughy spend more than half his screen time with his eyes wi-i-ide open. But I quibble. This story is fun for many of the same reasons that Star Wars (1977) is fun although U-571 is much darker. You have the hero, Lt. Tyler, who wants to be a skipper, but he isn't ready because he doesn't know how to make risky decisions. (Trust in the force, Luke.) The hero has two mentors and one dies off early just as Obi Wan Kenobi died off surprisingly early. Nice touch, giving him two mentors, because then we don't have to believe the hero learns his lessons from the dead mentor only. Realistically, he needs more than one lesson, as anyone does. Whereas a fantasy like Star Wars can have Obi Wan come back as a ghost, a gritty combat film must have a living mentor to be credible. The hero's initiation into the adventure is made more tense when he is kept in the dark about the mission until the crew is out to sea. Adding a sinister element of mystery is Jack Weber as Lt. Hirsh, a secret operative who is forced on the crew whether they like it or not. (Is he from signal intelligence, a precursor of the NSA?) Hirsh along with David Keith's Marine intelligence officer, immediately suggest that there are secret forces at work--even among the crew. In an eerie, disorienting scene, Hirsh exposes the fact that the radio operator (Jack Noseworthy) speaks fluent German, something he has kept hidden from crewmembers for fear of being identified with the enemy. In other ways, the language difference between the Americans and their enemy is exploited for tension What if your life suddenly were to depend on operating a vessel on which all the controls are labeled in a foreign language, and you have only two men capable of running around the ship, translating for your crew? The hero in U-571 faces one edge-of-your-seat challenge after another as he learns to command on the job. The tough situations become tougher and tougher until the climatic scene in which the hero not only gets to blow up something big (not quite the Death Star, but then Darth Vader isn't aboard, either), but he learns the final grim lesson of command in the process. The equally grim moral question that is implicit here goes unquestioned by film-maker Mostow, but then the hero's lesson is precisely that he does not have the right to hesitate about life-and-death decisions. Unless you avoid war movies like the plague, you won't want to miss this exciting film. By the way Yes, the movie is fiction. The British, not the Americans, caught the first German Enigma machine on a U-boat. And they didn't have as difficult a time bringing this war-winning elixir back to their tribe as do the crew in U-571. According to the legend on screen at the end, the first two or three Enigma's were found by British ships and then a US ship caught another one near the end of the war. I hate to quibble further (or do I?), but the part of Eddie (Terrence T.C. Carter), the black cook who gets to play an equal role as the crew dwindles, bears on the film's rather unrealistic treatment of race relations. Except for an early comment about how he finds out important things because white officers heedlessly speak in front of him as if he were not there, no further reference is made to the servile role forced upon African-Americans in the US Navy during World War II. No one expresses a lick of prejudice toward Eddie. Even when the Germans are accused of being prejudiced (by Eddie), they are never given the chance to show it. I think the film-maker's defense is that all historical movies are really contemporary stories; U-571 portrays race relations as they ought to have been rather than as they were. To complete the Star Wars analogy--for now at least-- Hitler is the ultimate Darth Vader but since this story is more realistic than Star Wars, it is about men fighting a small but significant piece of the war against Hitler, not the pitched battles we so often see in Star Wars where there is the possibility of taking out Darth.

When you boil it down to it, it's basically just a series of gags, strung together with a very weak plot structure. But who cares, for all its shortcomings, there are moments you will be laughing too hard to even notice. Stand out scenes include an uncomfortable encounter at an all-black fraternity and the unforgettable sperm bank hijinx (I am curious if that practice is endorsed by the medical world). Green is his expected eccentric self, although his screen time is very minimal. (His experimentation with certain rodents would make even Richard Gere proud.) And as for Sean William Scott, it seems as if he'll be typecast as Stiffler for the rest of his career, which is not all bad.  All in all the movie delivers with laughs throughout making it a worthwhile experience. It is exactly what a movie of this nature should be. 3 out of 5 stars.

Seven Samurai has no redeeming value whatsoever.Even the subtitles sucked.  In fact, they were the absolute worse I've ever seen.  Half the dialogue either wasn't translated or was white or white and therefore unreadable!  This made the plot hard to follow; fortunately, there wasn't much to follow.  A five year old could guess the conclusion after the first 10 minutes!A lot of people say there is incredible depth in 7 samurai.  They must be on crack.  The characters on incredibly shallow.  We learn nothing about anyone in the movie.  You'd think in three hours one could probe the characters minds - find out why they act as they do, but nope, once a character is introduced their developement stops.Then their are the inane sub-plots that go nowhere.  Please!  If you are going to introduce a plot device, have it go somewhere.  In real life, everything isn't meaningful, but this isn't real life - it is a movie.  If I wanted to see pointless stuff happening, I could look out my window!It is said that the Brigand's helmet inspired Darth Vader's.  If that's true, then the dumb comic guy must have inspired Jar-Jar (that is not a good thing).  At least Lucas had an excuse for including a dumb character - Phantom Menace was a kids movie.  Akira had no business doing so in Seven Samurai.So why does this movie have such a high rating?  I attribute it primarily to the fact that everyone is afraid to you they didn't like a classic.  If people stopped thinking like drones, maybe we could come to realize that some classics really aren't very good.  Just because a film is old & very known, doesn't mean it is great.In conclusion, Seven Samurai is terrible.  It is juvenille, lacks depth or character developement, and, in general, is highly overrated.

They should have awarded Dreamworks publicists a special Academy award for making everybody believe that this bland and cowardly film is a daring and shocking look into American life and deserves the heaps of praise it has received. (The cast deserves most of that praise, though. I hope this is the last time that so much talent is squandered in such a movie.)I hate to break it to the suburban Americans out there, but guys, there is not really much to see to your life when you look closer. I've read in some of the comments here that some people think this movie is un-American and immoral, but I think most of these conservative critics are Dreamworks employees trying to fuel some kind of controversy. Absolutely nothing shocking or immoral happens in the movie. For example, Lester spends months fantasizing about Angela and generally having a serious midlife crisis centered around her but he is able to control himself and does not sleep with her because she is a virgin? He even cooks her a meal afterwards and talks about his daughter with her, for God's sake! Hallelujah, he was about to be lost but he is now found! If only he hadn't been killed, he would have become normal again. This is a celebration of some cheap morals, not a peek into the dark side of the human psyche. And just because the ridiculously one-dimensional gay-hater is secretly gay, does it mean that the film deals a blow against suburban American values? It's nothing but a stupid joke on the expense of gay-haters, not deep social commentary. And the fact that he shoots Lester is not shocking, it's just the easy way out. If the guy actually overcame his idiocy and was able to talk to his son, we would have seen some pretty unorthodox resolution to this vaudevillian situation. (I could not believe the scene of the marine dad watching his son and Lester get down. It was worthy of a lame Seinfeld episode, not the Best Picture of the year)The only message that I got from this movie is Don't worry that your lives seem to suck, people, there is more to them than you can see, so keep on living the same way and feel good about yourselves. And, by the way, don't worry if you cannot see anything if you look closer, we'll tell you what it is that you cannot see.In short, this is a mediocre celebration of suburbia and people should be ashamed to have fallen for the hype and made this the #2 movie of all time.
