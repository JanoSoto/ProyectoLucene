If ROPE demonstrates some kind of technical experiment of minor interest that Hitch decided test out (nine minute filmed sequences without breaks), SPELLBOUND was an experiment regarding dreams and psycho-analysis used in solving a murder mystery.It wasn't the first to set part of the action in a mental institution. PRIVATE WORLDS had done so in the 1930s. And the supernatural film THE UNINVITED actually suggested something less than clean or healthy in the running of a mental institution. But both films did not go into a case history as closely. Due to the time limitations for a typical Hitchcock film (roughly two hours) the psycho-babble today does not impress people it takes years of therapy to get some grasp on the emotional problems confronted by Gregory Peck here. But unless one wanted a series of films over a period of twenty years (say one a year) detailing the actual speed of real psychotherapy, you had to accept Hitch's consolidated fictional approach to counseling.The plot deals with Gregory Peck arriving at a rest home in upstate New York that is run by Leo G. Carroll. Carroll is overworked, and is expecting his replacement. Peck shows up claiming to be the replacement. On the staff of the home is Ingrid Bergman, John Emery, and Steven Geray, and Bergman notices the new doctor is certainly acting peculiarly at dinner (he is upset looking at parallel lines his fork makes in the dinner table cloth). Eventually the new doctor flees the asylum, and Bergman follows him. She is also aware that he has been unmasked as an impostor - he is not the missing new head of the asylum. Bergman links up with Peck, who is suffering whenever he tries to recall certain past events. She is trying to get him to work with her, but he resents her efforts (though when not concentrating on his past and mental state he and she are falling in love). She is also aware that she and Peck are being sought by the police regarding the disappearance of the actual new head of the asylum.Eventually she gets him up to the home of her mentor (Michael Chekhov) and they analyze a dream that Peck tells them of. Although part of the dream is sexual (Peck sees Bergman as a waitress in a gambling club), most of it deals with his relationship with the missing man. And it becomes more interesting as the dream is designed by artist Salvator Dali, complete with melted wheels, eyes staring from walls (and being cut open) and mysterious, threatening men, wearing bandages around their faces. Soon the dream is interpreted enough for it to lead Bergman and Peck to a skiing resort, where the dream seems to find the solution to Peck's angst. But he is also arrested - the missing man has turned up shot to death, and Peck is the chief suspect. Bergman believes he is innocent now, and we wonder if she will prove it in the last ten minutes of the film.Like all Hitchcock films, once one sees it the mystery is no longer a mystery. Years ago my sister, wanting to see something else while I was watching SPELLBOUND looked at the television screen and said ....... is the murderer! I have never quite recovered from her spoiling the conclusion of the film for me.The performances are all good, including one by noted Russian actor and teacher Michael Chekhov. When I studied acting in high school I had to read his book TO THE ACTOR, and it is interesting to see he was a really fine actor. In fact, his performance as Bergman's wise old mentor was given the ultimate accolade when Mel Brooks highlighted it in his Hitchcock spoof HIGH ANXIETY, with Howard Morris playing Professor Olman (Little Old Man Brooks keeps calling him in the film). Morris even kept the little white beard that Chekhov wore on his face in the film.

The very first Rocky is a classic. There's no doubt about that. But this movie is still very good and very inspirational like the other Rocky movies. Rocky IV was very well made and very well done. The acting by everyone is great as usual. Tony Burton gives one of the best performances in this one. He has so many great lines. Because Duke loses Apollo and bonds with Rocky, it makes him such a big part of Rocky IV. You really end up liking him even more after this one. I can't understand why Tony Burton was barely used at all in Rocky V and VI. Other things I loved about Rocky IV were the training scenes in Russia, the masterfully choreographed fight scene, the fact that he grows the beard in training, and the fact that this is the first time that Adrian doesn't think he can win. Even though Bill Conti didn't do the score for this one and Vince DiCola was in there, it's fine. DiCola's score is great. It fits in perfectly with this Rocky. The songs on the soundtrack were great too. I loved Rocky IV's music. It was a nice departure from the same old thing. I honestly don't understand why anyone would think this is a bad movie.The Cold War type storyline is good in this too. The USA Vs. the Soviet Union. We were always in competition with them. It was either buildings, our space program, or our military. There was also much competition in the Olympics for that gold medal. This movie has many great scenes. One of my favorite parts is when the Rocky Vs. Drago fight is about to start and the two of them are staring at each other. I also love the training scenes and the final fight. People keep knocking that little speech that Rocky gives in the end. I don't know why. That was very well done too. He tells the Soviets how they felt about him and the way he felt about them was able to change from the fight. If something so great like that can happen there, then there is hope for the Cold War to some day end. Rocky says, If I can change and you can change, everybody could change. Great ending to a great movie.What I don't like are these horrible, negative reviews. All of you really need to lighten up. This is just a Rocky movie. All of you stuffed shirts are ripping it apart and trying to analyze it. It's just a movie. I can also prove a lot of these negative reviews wrong. First off, maybe you think the Apollo Creed and Drago fight is fake and would never happen. It can very well happen. In 1962 Benny Paret fought Emile Griffith. It ended tragically in the 12th round. Griffith trapped Paret in a corner and mercilessly beat him until his head went crashing into the ring post. Paret was lying helplessly on the ropes and Griffith kept banging the hell out of him. Griffith hit Paret 20 times until the referee stopped it. Paret went into a coma and died 9 days later. Maybe you think it's fake how Rocky keeps going down in his fight with Drago. In Primo Carnera's fight with Max Baer, Carnera went down no less than 10 times. Carnera also happened to be a 6ft 9in giant that couldn't even lick my kid brother. It seems you people also think that Rocky would have never won in real life. If you took a 7ft giant, taught him how to throw a punch, pumped him with steroids and put him in the ring against a great fighter I wonder who would win. A great fighter like Rocky would obviously win. Ivan Drago was just a giant that was taught to hit hard and be like a machine. As soon as Rocky cut him he didn't know what to do. Steroids and freakish strength do not make you a great fighter. Also keep in mind that Drago's fight with Rocky was his first professional fight. It was also the first time he was fighting someone that could fight back and the first time he ever had to go 15 rounds. It's a wonder Drago did as good as he did. The Soviets were shocked when Rocky started making a fight out of it. There were a lot of things they didn't consider with there machine. One of those things was Rocky. Drago was, in a way, just like Mason Dixon from Rocky VI. He had to really show what he was made of and he probably came out of his experience with Rocky a better fighter. Towards the end of the fight the Russian people were cheering for Rocky. You people think that wouldn't happen. Everyone loves an underdog. When Jesse Owens, an African American, won at the Olympics, Berlin cheered for him. Hitler even waved to him to congratulate him. So tell me now if Rocky IV is far fetched and could never happen.

She goes through a LOT of trouble to get in touch with this guy, whom she didn't really seem to get along with in the pet shop. How she suddenly fell in love with this guy or why she goes through so much trouble to do what she does is never explained.But, then we get to see dive-bombing birds! I don't necessarily mind a red herring plot, mind you. Psycho starts off as a story about an embezzler running away, but it takes a dramatic turn into uncharted territory as soon as our protagonist stops for the night at the Bates Motel. However, unlike in Psycho, the red herring plot doesn't disappear in The Birds once the main plot begins. We see long discussions between Melanie and her newly found roommate (played by Suzanne Pleshette) about Mitch. We see heart-to-heart conversations between Mitch and Melanie. And, the relationship between Mitch and his mother has clear elements of the jealous, controlling relationship that Mrs. Bates has with her son Norman. Why all of this continues to happen throughout the movie, I have no idea.

However, the scenes involving Martha Vickers, the kid sister Carmen are so much more interesting to me personally. Vickers is just a hoot to watch as the sex mad younger sister. Furthermore, my favorite scene from the film doesn't even involve, Bogart and Bacall. It involves Bogart, of course.... ( he is in the majority of the scenes, as our eyes and ears of the film) but it involves another actress-Dorothy Malone. The scene of which I am speaking of, has Bogart's character held up in a rain storm during a stakeout at a bookstore, and of course I believe the sexiest moment of that scene is when she closes the window blinds. I also love the way he says Hello! when she takes off her glasses, and lets her hair down. Dorothy Malone also improvised this scene as well. Did you do this? That?

He was an infamous part of cinema history and had created drama, intense action, explosions unlike action movies had never seen, gory kills, war, vengeance and most importantly...a one man destruction crew. Stallone returned in the third installment keeping very true to the John Rambo character. It isn't the best in the original trilogy...in fact it might even be the least impressive although I still loved it on its own merit but it loses a lot of true grit behind the original two films. I think quite honestly the film makers, cast and everyone involved just got really excited about making this third one and in the process overlooked some key elements. The first two films had been so phenomenally successful that they had a huge budget...the biggest in history at the time it was made....and it does show. Rambo III is shot throughout Thailand, Pakistan, Israel and the U.S. to double as Afghanistan. The war they deal with is a very real one...culminating around the time this was shot. So they keep the war real and the message vitally important. The problem is that they let some of the really strong story go to wayside, much like they did with the most recent Rambo film (2008) See my review. The story lacks the same heart although you do see some remnant of it. However, we also get treated to FINALLY seeing Col. Trautman actually partake in the action and we get to see them fight side by side for presumably the first time since Vietnam.Sylvester Stallone returns to one of his most infamous character, and also helms the screenplay too which is excellent at usually. Rambo hasn't changed. He's disillusioned with the world, hiding from himself and his country and he still has his steely determination. The only difference is that he has more punch lines to deal out. This being a major epic blockbuster action flick they made Rambo a little more personable by giving something a sidekick as well as some one liners which work pretty well (I'm your worst nightmare, its a blue light...it lights up blue....and so forth.) Richard Crenna also returns to the series as Trautman and for the first time in three films we actually get to see him put his acting chops to work and also partake in some action. In some ways I still see him as something of a robot but far less in Rambo III than in the other films. Him and Stallone have forged something of a bond that works for the series. I sincerely hope I am getting this right but I believe its Marc de Jonge, that plays Rambo's pseudo-partner who helps him get into the Russian fort. He does a good job of sidekick status but never really does any stand out moments. Unfortunately I can't decipher the name of the actor who portrayed the evil Russian Commander but in all honestly he was pretty awful and very campy. Definitely not one of the better Rambo villains.So with a less than great story, a sub par supporting cast, and dialog that goes a little more comedic, why is Rambo III the classic that it is? Simple...action. Considered by some to be one of the most violent movie ever, the explosions, the gun fights, the prison escape, the cave battle, the helicopter chase (again---far superior one in First Blood II), makes it a red blooded male favorite. There is a story there...however light it may be...and Stallone still kicks some serious butt!! It felt like at times they were trying to recycle some of the incredible action sequences from First Blood II but fortunately for them that film had such incredible action sequences that it works again. Regardless of how you feel about this third installment compared to the other two...you have to see it...its a natural progression and its worth of the series especially the original trilogy.

It felt like at times they were trying to recycle some of the incredible action sequences from First Blood II but fortunately for them that film had such incredible action sequences that it works again. Regardless of how you feel about this third installment compared to the other two...you have to see it...its a natural progression and its worth of the series especially the original trilogy. I happen to think Rambo, including this one is the patriarch of action films and you don't see anything like it anymore sadly. 7.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"10 February 2008","score":"","review":" I suppose the one item at highest risk of aging in a film of this sort after several years is its CGI or its special effects; but thankfully this first Lord of the Rings film now comes across as a sort of fun and epic adventure film rather than a fantastic piece of film-making, the sort of which perhaps blinded people (and may still do now) into thinking they are seeing a fantastic film with great story telling and great action scenes. I'm a fan of the Indiana Jones films and I can enjoy films like The Mummy every once in a while and whilst this Lord of the Rings film is perhaps a level above these titles on a sense of scale, it is really nothing greater than that.I think by the end of the film, it has confused itself. The narrative has become disjointed, the path the film looked like it was heading down has been ignored and characterisation has reached such a basic level that I'm sure there are theorists and critics out there who could have probably told you who would've died and who wouldn't have; even if they had no prior knowledge of the novel. By the time the credits have begun rolling, we have seen Frodo Baggins (Wood) go on a leg of a journey, making friends, allies and developing friendships along the way but the issues are the surprisingly lacklustre story and poor development of the rest of the fellowship. Legolas (Bloom) is a mere face; Boromir (Bean) is merely someone who is present to play out the role of the supposed 'spy in the camp' as he tries to goad the ring away from Frodo when he needs to; Gimli (Rhys-Davies) is another character who is placed, follows orders and fights when needed; also contributing to the film's inclusion of mediocre plot points when it is his idea to travel through the mines of Moria, a Dwarven kingdom and the other three hobbits are there for mere comedy. If you look at how the other three hobbits came into being in the fellowship, you'll see that Sam (Astin) was eavesdropping at a window and the other two were stealing crops from a field that Frodo and Sam just happened to be passing &#150; these are pretty poor character introductions and the three are never developed beyond the butt of most jokes.But what The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring lacks in characterisation; it makes up for in scale, vision, entertainment and ideas. The film also benefits from a good director; Peter Jackson it would seem knows how to make a good film and toy with his audience Sam states that he though he'd lost Frodo at one point when he lags behind, only for the two other hobbits to come bursting out of the field and bump into both Frodo and Sam. Whilst the introduction is crude and it is played out for a cheap thrill, Jackson combines Sam's fear of loosing Frodo with the relief that he's caught up with him and then back to the fear that something will go wrong when two unknown subjects burst into the frame, forcing us and the characters to jump. Jackson also makes the film very early on seem upbeat and jovial; the characters are in possession of an item of Armageddon and yet the film has an upbeat and somewhat relaxed atmosphere to it. This is most evident when Bilbo (Holm) hosts his birthday party and everyone is seen to have fun in a relaxed and somewhat cheesy manner; the evidence is also there when Bilbo thanks everyone for coming and goes through his family members. But this is good directing because it lulls us into a false sense of security; everything is fine and upbeat early on and yet the film will delve deeper into a darker and more disturbed groove once the adventure has begun; dealing with obsession and madness through Gollum as well as tackling issues of trust and friendship between Frodo, Sam and the fellowship itself.So during the birthday party, there are two examples that hint at this disturbing 'to-come' undertone Bilbo's speech starts off jovial before turning 'dark' when he disappears but it turns out that was all a joke anyway; immediately returning to the film's jovial nature. The second example is when everyone is having fun; a firework in the form of a dragon swoops down on the hobbits, they start screaming and panicking but it flies over and explodes everyone is happy again. These are mini-examples of the film overall displayed within the first third. There is also the clever atmosphere put across after the hobbits initially escape the hooded riders; they encounter an obnoxious gatekeeper and go to a rough pub &#150; are they now safe from the riders? It seems not as nothing gets in these people's way. But the script and story is what lacks here, apart from basic logic at times. The hooded riders actually run away from the wave, rather than keeping on going or turning around and Gandalf (McKellen) does not mention the danger of the Balrog before going into Moria.The film also suffers with its musical score; an unusual thing to be critical of. I've established the film begins in a light hearted manner but then grows darker and yet the score keeps a certain level of softness which culminates in the film actually ending in an upbeat manner. Two great friends have died and two more are taken but the film tiptoes around this, suggesting too obviously that the adventure continues.... Whilst the film is fantastic in its broad and epic scale, it does not work on its own as a journey of self discovery for Frodo and Sam. The most interesting character is not the hero but Gandalf himself and when that is the case in a film like this, you are struggling in certain areas.

When new recruit Paul Baumer cries and hides his face in shame during his first bombardment, veteran soldier, Corporal Kat Katczinsky grabs him and tells him it's happened to better men and it's happened to him (Kat). After returning from their first mission, the chow sergeant won't feed the men until the rest of the company shows up.

What is skillful is how the movie begins with a very classic English atmosphere; SO very trite and proper that it almost seems like in the Victorian age until the relationship with the servant becomes more and more strained and the movie develops an edgy offbeat sleazy feel to it, clearly emulating the contrast of how APPEARANCES were of English society at this time, and much of what was taking place in the shade.*The Following is an in-depth analysis of the plot which may be spoiled*After the servant is thrown out, for overstepping his territory, and lying that his fiancé was his sister, given the way the movie had been developing, in that the servant deliberately staged for his fiancé to have sex with his master, (or at least didn't care) and to infringe upon his territory, while all the while, keeping a very strong presence himself (redecorating the house, arranging things to his will, and even spending night in his fiancé's who is supposed to be his sisters room) until ultimately being caught having sex in his master's bed chamber, we say to ourselves... ok... so was he PLANNING something? ... and what was the point of all this behaviour, when essentially any servant behaving this way would get thrown out and never taken back in 99% of cases.Needless to say, by absolute chance the master meets the servant at a nearby bar, something impossible for any planning person to presuppose, and my point would be there are too many mindless movies with so called calculating and cunning evildoers, who's plans are revealed to involve presupposed outcomes or incidents that just HAPPEN to occur in the plot just to get in their lame little plot twist. Therefore let us ASSUME this movie isn't one of those and that nothing at all was planned, which now puts heavy question on what the servant had intended in the first place by being so overtly disobedient to get himself thrown out after a short time; something not impossible though highly unusual and needing SOME sort of explanation if at least a comment of i've been a servant all my life, and now I'm sick of it and want to make a joke of the upper class. in talking to his fiancé.Anyhow, The servant begs his forgiveness and asks to be taken back, saying that his fiancé left him and not only deceived the master but both of them, whereby he IS taken back, and quite instantly HE in essence becomes the new master of the house, becoming overtly overbearing and nagging. At this stage in terms of character development, the master becomes more and more yielding, seeming to shake off his stuffy old world upper class mannerisms, feeling compelled to the servant's more brutish low class behaviour; the 2 even playing ball games in the hallway and breaking things, both always drunk, the servant arranging wild parties. It is as if the master can finally release his tension and be a kid and have wild fun that perhaps he missed out on when he was younger. Does the master even have a job? The viewer comes to ask if his talks of work on reforestation was merely boasting about nothing. all of this is strange and perverse, unlikely, yet it seems plausible. If there is any message in this film it was about the changing times of English society. Let me say that anyone who has taken there to be ANYTHING semblant of homosexuality in this movie, is mentally deranged, as there is not the slightest hint or comment of ANY love or romance between the 2 men, physical or verbal. Only metrosexuals with a homophobic complex would even think of that.The role reversal is very interesting but to me it simply went too far near the end where the master's girlfriend who had also left him, comes back to find her lover in a drunken state with obnoxious party guests around. Here the servant's fiancé also returns and soon the servant orders everyone to leave including his master's girlfriend, without any interference from him. The movie ends as the servant retires to his masters bedroom to be met with a woman who looks like his fiancé but we can't really make her out.This movie is a failure because it doesn't answer simple important questions that any strong plot should, such as was it all planned from the beginning or not and if so why? Did the servants fiancé really dump him and only LATER return or not? If so then she returned to see the master, not the servant, as for all she knew he was thrown out, so who then did she truly love? Most importantly, was it his fiancé who he went up to meet and did they truly only just settle their differences that night, and why are we not allowed to see the most important part of the movie of WHO IS IT that is waiting in the masters room, that the servant goes to meet. In the end the whole thing is too ambiguous and gives the audience little credit, but still worth watching for anyone interested in mindfuck movies in general.

Therefore let us ASSUME this movie isn't one of those and that nothing at all was planned, which now puts heavy question on what the servant had intended in the first place by being so overtly disobedient to get himself thrown out after a short time; something not impossible though highly unusual and needing SOME sort of explanation if at least a comment of i've been a servant all my life, and now I'm sick of it and want to make a joke of the upper class. in talking to his fiancé.Anyhow, The servant begs his forgiveness and asks to be taken back, saying that his fiancé left him and not only deceived the master but both of them, whereby he IS taken back, and quite instantly HE in essence becomes the new master of the house, becoming overtly overbearing and nagging. At this stage in terms of character development, the master becomes more and more yielding, seeming to shake off his stuffy old world upper class mannerisms, feeling compelled to the servant's more brutish low class behaviour; the 2 even playing ball games in the hallway and breaking things, both always drunk, the servant arranging wild parties. It is as if the master can finally release his tension and be a kid and have wild fun that perhaps he missed out on when he was younger. Does the master even have a job? The viewer comes to ask if his talks of work on reforestation was merely boasting about nothing. all of this is strange and perverse, unlikely, yet it seems plausible. If there is any message in this film it was about the changing times of English society. Let me say that anyone who has taken there to be ANYTHING semblant of homosexuality in this movie, is mentally deranged, as there is not the slightest hint or comment of ANY love or romance between the 2 men, physical or verbal. Only metrosexuals with a homophobic complex would even think of that.The role reversal is very interesting but to me it simply went too far near the end where the master's girlfriend who had also left him, comes back to find her lover in a drunken state with obnoxious party guests around. Here the servant's fiancé also returns and soon the servant orders everyone to leave including his master's girlfriend, without any interference from him. The movie ends as the servant retires to his masters bedroom to be met with a woman who looks like his fiancé but we can't really make her out.This movie is a failure because it doesn't answer simple important questions that any strong plot should, such as was it all planned from the beginning or not and if so why? Did the servants fiancé really dump him and only LATER return or not? If so then she returned to see the master, not the servant, as for all she knew he was thrown out, so who then did she truly love? Most importantly, was it his fiancé who he went up to meet and did they truly only just settle their differences that night, and why are we not allowed to see the most important part of the movie of WHO IS IT that is waiting in the masters room, that the servant goes to meet. In the end the whole thing is too ambiguous and gives the audience little credit, but still worth watching for anyone interested in mindfuck movies in general.

Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express). The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964, so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi.The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities, Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town, just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers, he does not like to do everything by the book, in contrary to Allan Ward, he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town, but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened.The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors, but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent, even his appearance, the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles.The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride, she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful.This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together, they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened, bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.

There's much at stake as one country rules the South American colonies with the purpose to convert the natives and make peace while the other has the view of slave laboring and genocide. They decide to make an agreement; the Spanish sells the colony to the Portuguese putting many natives' lives in danger.Two character's are thrown into the mist of it, a Jesuit priest (Jeremy Irons) whose in construction of building a mission with the natives and a Spanish mercenary (Robert De Niro) who seeks freedom from his past sins. The story contains many controversial topics such as redemption, salvation, forgiveness, murder, discrimination, peace, and war.The story in my opinion was overall decent, but pretty much anything I have seen, such as The Last Samurai and Dances with Wolves. Robert De Niro in my opinion is no more than the action hero. I love De Niro's work, but his role in this was nothing as grand as some of his other works with director Martin Scorsese.The real genius was Jeremy Irons. I have only seen him in a handful of movies, but this is by far the one he gave the best performance for. One of the most compelling scenes I found in the whole movie was when he first encounters the natives. He gets surrounded by an army of angry Indians; instead of retaliating he sits calmly on a rock and plays a beautiful tune with his flute, leaving his audience bewildered and tamed from seeking his blood.But the main reason why I give this movie a 9 out of 10 was from its captivating film-making. The shots from the beginning of the waterfalls to the ending passage on the river were amazing. The cinematography by Chris Menges (who won an Oscar for the film) was far by excellent, adding a heavenly feel to the atmosphere. In addition, Ennio Morricone's score not only supported this beautiful vision of an earthly paradise, but it also made it feel real. How he did not get an Oscar for this, is beyond me. I felt like I was pulled into the film, as if I was there. Taking my eyes off the screen was nearly impossible. This is not my favorite film, but it is certainly a wonderful one.

As a result, everything but the special effects suffers. That's not to say that the ghosts and set designs weren't spectacular, they're just all you get.In a movie with a more than able cast, you wouldn't believe that these actors have had much experience because their characters are so flat. Tony Shalhoub is the only noteworthy player as his character has the biggest range of emotions. Matthew Lillard could have done well except for being too spastic. Shannon Elizabeth is obviously nothing more than eye candy since she never gets much of a chance to show that she can be more. Rah Digga seems like she was plucked from a pre 1950's Disney cartoon. F. Murray Abraham works as the villain since he has the most menacing look.The attempts at humor were what held the movie together and kept it from becoming boring. If that hadn't been incorporated, the movie would have been nothing more than a lot of flashes and loud bangs.The ending was easily the worst part because it feels too forced and haphazardly slapped together. It seems like no one really knew how to end it, just that it had to end.I suppose I should at least say a few good things about this movie. I did enjoy it. The make-up work was phenomenal, and the set design showed more dedication than most movies that have been released recently. If you want to see a haunted house movie and aren't very demanding, you'll enjoy this, too.

So I decided to rent it and see what it was about, I had no idea what the story was about, but if it's ranked so high on the top 250, why not check it out? So I watched it yesterday and this was one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, I almost felt like I was trippin' with this movie. I know that sounds bad, but I just felt like I was on such a trip with 8 1\/2, the camera shots, the characters, the costumes, the story, it was just crazy. I felt like I was getting pulled in so many directions and I wasn't sure where I was going. The story is a little hard to follow, but I watched it again, and from what I understand, I'll try to explain.Guido is a writer\/director who is constantly looking for new ideas for his new film. He goes into these strange fantasies of new characters, flying, new situations, and different colors or looks. But the actors that he works with are always looking for the bigger idea, they want something better. But after thinking back to his past, he may just come up with the best idea for a film.At least that's what I interpreted from 8 1\/2, this was seriously one strange movie. But the thing that stands out to me is this was a film that stood out very much for it's time, it was one of the first films that made people stop and seriously think about what they saw. It was one of the first major artistic films that had incredible camera shots and interesting characters, before the fancy effects of CGI, we had 8 1\/2. 8 1\/2 is a good movie, it's something you'd really have to be in a mood for though and you may have to watch it a couple times, but it's definitely worth it if you want a classic.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" 8 1\/2 is one of the most hailed movies of all time, especially in foreign films, I read in a magazine that this was the number one ranked Italian film.

OK, it was nothing too impressive but it seemed to be a good thriller and mystery movie, focusing on the underground really heavy hardcore porn industry. The movie however loses much of its credibility in parts, especially toward the ending of it.In the end the movie even manages to change into a revenge flick, which is highly in contrast with the rest of the picture. The rest of the movie mostly picks a realistic approach of things. It provides the viewer a look into the dark world of underground porn and whether it's a realistic authentic view of it or not, the way its shown in the movie works out effectively, mostly because the movie doesn't hold back as much as most other Hollywood movies regarding this subject will do. The ending just doesn't really work out convincing because it raises the question about the Nicolas Cage character; Why does he get personally involved with the case so much? There are several hints given throughout the movie that from the moment you'll enter they world of underground porn it will change you slowly. But there's a difference between saying this several times throughout the movie (mostly by the Joaquin Phoenix character) and actually showing how it affects someone. The movie really doesn't handle this well since it simply doesn't really show any of this. It's just so highly unbelievable all. Elements like this once more show that Joel Schumacher is no more than a very average director, though he still of course made some good movies as well.A shame all, since in the beginning of the movie when all the detective work got done, this seemed to be a pretty decent movie with potential. It's not like the movie is no a total bad one to watch but it's just that the movie could had been a lot better.Unfortunately the whole way the story is build up and being told is also quite predictable. At least to me this movie offered very little surprises in its storytelling and 'plot-twists'.The movie has a surprising good cast. Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare and Anthony Heald are all big names in the business and they all appear in this movie. Definitely true that the presence of these people also helps to make this a better movie to watch than it would had been without them in it.Oh well, it still is a decent enough movie to watch, at least if your expectations aren't too high.6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie began quite well.

It shows the horrible things that happen during it. From the combat out in the bloody battlefield to the war each man fights in his own head. Every serious movie is in a large sense different. It shows those horrible things from a different angle. In 'Paths of Glory' the view point is that of Colonel Dax, a respected officer in the French trenches of the First World War. His latest orders are to take a German position only a couple hundred meters beyond his own trench and hold it until reinforcements arrive.The interesting thing is that General Mireau who orders the attack is fueled mainly by ego. Colonel Dax is driven more by strategic logic and what it means for the lives of his battle tired soldiers. A great scene is when Gen. Mireau lays out his plan to Col. Dax. He proudly walks through the rugged trenches, scolding men who appear cowardly (There's no such thing as shell shock.) and ignoring wounded soldiers, but instead looking toward his objective. In this same scene Dax is clearly momentarily by the passing of some of his men who have torn limbs and faces. It is a scenes that lasts for about a minute, but it sets up the rest of the film brilliantly. Mireau's ego and Dax's loyalty to his men. But the shades of character aren't nearly that black and white. Dax is clearly driven to achieving the General's intended objective, but through the smoke and roar of the battlefield he somehow sees the futility of the matter and is later shocked when Mireau orders a court martial for cowardice from Dax's regiment.As an older war film the special effects and battle scenes are quite tame by today's standards (especially after a film like 'Saving Private Ryan') but the examination of the military mind is positively fascinating. World War One is often viewed as a useless war and the issues at hand could have been settled at a table and not a battlefield is a quote that I remember from one of my high school history teachers.

However, I just did not feel any of the emotion that I assumed the film Phenomenon was attempting to convey. I by no means blame this on the actors who, for the most part, put in above average performances based on what they were given. Unfortunately it is difficult to work on a higher level when the source material never delves deeper than surface level emotion. The downfall of this film falls squarely upon the poor, scattered screenplay. Although built on an intriguing concept regarding the power of human thought that occasionally does hit the mark and make an insightful comment on human nature (particularly the psychology of how people react to the unknown), it does not seem to know exactly where it wants to take this idea. Instead, the plot rambles about from one event to the next, which works for the first hour or so&#151;up until we hit the twist. A twist that takes all remaining mystery or intrigue out of the film and pushes it from a somewhat thought-provoking supernatural piece to what I'm sure the writers assumed would be a heart-wrenching drama. Regrettably, with so little emphasis on character development before this point (only the likable, good-guy George ever seems to have consistent motivation throughout the film) it makes it hard to connect with any of the suddenly formed relationships that could have been the basis for the drama of the last portion of the film. As much as I wanted to feel for George and the inevitable ending that had been presented, I found it difficult to muster up much emotion aside from a touch of depression which was brought on more by the unexpected, dreary down-turn of the plot than the event itself.Normally, I enjoy realistic science fiction films and the use of average heroes as protagonists, but due to the many downfalls of the script I found myself merely feeling disappointed as all hope I had in the movie slowly dwindled away. Certainly this is not a terrible film and the actors do their best to keep what little they have to work with afloat, but, for the most part, it is entirely unmemorable and would have done better as a feel-good, Sunday evening flick.
