For a start lets begin with the plot. Tom Green leaves his parents home to become an animator. Tom Green returns. Tom Green and his dad get into many heated arguments - thats about it for plot.

Masturbating horses - licking the bone of a friend's broken leg as he screams in agony, swinging a new born baby around by its umbilical cord are all part of the 'comedy' of Freddy Got Fingered.

The joke is on the unsuspecting public. Tom Green's antics are only funny for his ability to carry them out in public and for his complete lack of embarrassment. In this film the antics are scripted. Those on the receiving end of these antics are actors. Therefore it is NOT FUNNY, as the only thing that makes this guy funny is canceled out. I still can't believe that the people at 20th Century Fox couldn't figure this out. The fact that they actually sunk huge amounts of money into this film is not only sad, but offensive.

The chip will make a missile untrackable and unstoppable once placed in one. But there's been a problem amix-up of luggage at the airport causes an old lady, Mrs. Hess, to take the toy car with chip home and the crooks are stuck with herluggage. REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT DO READ ON!       Mrs. Hess lives in Chicago, and her neighbor is 8-year-old Alex Pruitt. He shovels the snow off her driveway and she's anythingbut nice to him. She gives Alex the toy car, but that's not the only gift Alex receives, for when he returns home, he finds he has the chicken pox! And now the crooks have ventured into town. They know the street the chip is on, but not which house it's in. What to do? According to Mr. Beaupre Search them all. Because since it's the suburbs, nobody is home during the day, except for Alex who's home sick with the pox. Alex discovers Beaupre in two houses on two days and both times calls the police, but Beaupre manages to illute their grasp, so the police think it was a false alarm. Since nobody believes Alex, he takes matters into his own hands. He attaches a camcorder to the toy car and it films Beaupre searching the Alcott house, but that plan backfires drastically. These crooks have the most state of the art equipment phone splicers and tappers, even a device for debugging the burglar alarm on people's houses. Soon Beaupre, Jernigan, Alice and Unger discover who's behind this. They plan to go to Alex's house next, so it's time to set up the security. While the rest of thefamily sleeps, Alex rigs up booby traps like the other kid in the two previous Home Alone films. It's got electric fences, toppling trunks of books, toppling barbell, everything!

At the time, it didn't strike me as something worth $10 to go see. Well it finally came out on cable, and having watched the whole thing, I can tell you the most tolerable scenes were in fact in the trailer. In retrospect, I think the best way I could have watched this movie was to have the TV turned off, but kept the sound system and cable left on, so that I could listen to the great soundtrack, without the annoying visuals. But unfortunately, I watched the whole thing from start to finish. The fact that I didn't spend $10 to see it wasn't enough to placate this feeling I had that I had somehow been cheated. Now you might be wondering, if this movie was so bad, why did you watch it until the end? That is a very good question, because I have walked out of bad movies before, or fell asleep half way through them. I guess the reason I watched it until the end, was because I wanted to see how much worse it could get. I think I wanted to establish a new low - a point of reference of how bad a movie could be. The previous title holder was `Howard the Duck', but Charlie's Angels makes that one seem Oscar-worthy. Let me just say, I love spy thriller movies like James Bond and True Lies. I also like funny spy movies like Austin Powers 1&2. I even like movie versions of popular TV series like Mission Impossible 1&2. But this one - I'm not even sure what this one is. The only conclusion I came to, is that Charlie's Angels is a 2 hour long music video.

Now you might be wondering, if this movie was so bad, why did you watch it until the end? That is a very good question, because I have walked out of bad movies before, or fell asleep half way through them. I guess the reason I watched it until the end, was because I wanted to see how much worse it could get. I think I wanted to establish a new low - a point of reference of how bad a movie could be. The previous title holder was `Howard the Duck', but Charlie's Angels makes that one seem Oscar-worthy. Let me just say, I love spy thriller movies like James Bond and True Lies. I also like funny spy movies like Austin Powers 1&2. I even like movie versions of popular TV series like Mission Impossible 1&2. But this one - I'm not even sure what this one is. The only conclusion I came to, is that Charlie's Angels is a 2 hour long music video.

At the time, it didn't strike me as something worth $10 to go see. Well it finally came out on cable, and having watched the whole thing, I can tell you the most tolerable scenes were in fact in the trailer. In retrospect, I think the best way I could have watched this movie was to have the TV turned off, but kept the sound system and cable left on, so that I could listen to the great soundtrack, without the annoying visuals.

I am extremely conflicted by this movie. I am a die hard phan of the series but I don't think I enjoyed this one. I want so hard to give Phantasm OblIVion a positive review, but I don't know if I can. I've read some of the other reviews (mostly negative ones) and I agree that there are some problems with this film. Problems Mike's parents died before Jody did, they completely dropped characters (Tim who could have developed into a fixture of the series, and Rocky who couldn't have), Reggie's one liners weren't that great (Blow me!), the red planet angle is dropped, and it's promises of closure and origins are false. I'm sure there are others but I'm too shaken to think of them. More questions and enigmas are created than resolved. Phantasm OblIVion shed no light into the heart of Phantasm and confused me more. No solutions are in sight and I hate that. I have been spun deeper into the web that is Phantasm, and I'm sure that's what Don Coscarelli wants. But I need closure!! But, on a sunnier (Morning) side, there are some good elements in the film. Highlights The opening sequence (eerie and awesome), Reggie still kicking a$$, and the idea that good spawned evil. Hopefully the next installment (Phantasm's End please!) will be the last and explain ALL. If your a true fan of the series then you owe it to yourself to see it once. And then maybe you can clue me in on whats in store for Phantasm. This is one of the best series in the genre and it absolutely cannot end like this. The game must go on.

The Coens evoke Double Indemnity (there's even an in-joke homage) and High Sierra and such, and Billy Bob projects some quiet, Bogart-like machismo (maybe it's all those cigarettes and low-slung fedoras). Ultimately, though, the movie seemed more about the gleaming black-and-white cinematography and fabulous '40s roadsters than man's condition.

So do yourself one big favour. Go to your local bookstore or comic shop, and order up as much of this stuff as you can. Then you can enjoy Crumb's notorious creation as nature intended, because this film is terrible. The animation isn't too shabby, managing to capture something of Crumb's style and humour, but the script is a disjointed, meandering mess that fumbles toward one of the weakest conclusions I've ever seen. All of Crumb's cynicism and irony has been replaced by a desire to shock and offend. Even though this is 'only a cartoon', I found the sex and violence - especially the scene where the female horse is whipped with a motorcycle chain - very hard to take. Crumb didn't completely disown shock value (anyone who's seen his infamous 'Joe Blow' strip will vouch for that), but he did it so much better than Bakshi's animators. There are several scenes that are completely pointless and seem to drag on forever. Maybe this is funnier to people who were there at the time, or who have smoked roughly their own body weight in marijuana, but to everyone else (especially Crumb devotees) it's a yawn.
