(Including King himself, which is a strange irony, but I digress). Then I remembered this film, and felt compelled to add this review to set the record straight. Back in King's early days, when he was not so much writing as channeling a prodigious amount of quality fiction, his own agent refused to take his output for fear of alienating his publishers (there was at that time a strange notion that if an author turned out TOO MUCH, it would overload the system and reduce demand. A concept that Miley Cyrus, for example, would have trouble with today). King would have none of it, legend tells us, and insisted that that the overage be published anyway, but perhaps under a different nom de plume. This work, if memory serves, was published under the name Richard Bachman, and is surprisingly pure, at least for King, most likely because it represents his early period, when he did not allow his zest for characterizations and nostalgia to take control of the actual narrative. So, to be sure, it not typical king, but a tightly controlled and highly focused story of the infamous gypsy curse. (Also the best title ever used in any Kind novel -- brilliant!). With this backstory understood, it may then be argued that director Tom Holland did not have to jump through the usual hoops to bring this story to life, because the story was pre-washed, like a pair of Levis, and ready for adaptation. That is my theory anyway. Bottom line, hands down the best King movie ever, direct, unfettered, uncluttered, and very un-nerving.

I've always loved the classic Disney cartoons (Snow White in particular) and have not loved the more recent Disney cartoon movies (though I appreciate the animation and Robin Williams in Aladdin). So I'm struggling with why this movie didn't bowl me over.It was supposed to! It's made in the middle of many American cinema masterworks&#x97;the same year as Citizen Kane after all&#x97;and it's just a few short years since Snow White and one year after the amazing (if long) Fantasia. (That film lost so much money, Disney made Dumbo short and on the cheap, which explains a little.)What gives? I think the movie ended up simply being cute and for children, I put these in quotes because these are good things. But they didn't work for me, sitting up alone watching it as a movie. It's great on many levels of course, including Elephants on Parade where the animation takes a spin into fantasy. But the story line is as thin as it is cloying, sad as it is obvious. It's perfect for kids of all ages, as long as they don't mind getting their heads messed up. (Kids handle it well in general, but many comment on how it deeply affects them.)One interesting thing to notice there is a hint (that I can tell) of World War II affairs in the telling. The Ringmaster's voice is by German-born actor Herman Bing, a Nazi sympathizer who later committed suicide. His accent, famously pan- European, is toned down, but it's here. This is no social protest film, of course. Charles Chaplin, being a concerned artist type, made The Dictator the previous year. Disney, a famous patriot in the old sense (and Republican), later went on (after Pearl Harbor in late 1941) to be extremely active and generous making wartime films (propaganda films, mostly) for the government. The most famous, of Donald Duck having a nightmare about Hitler in 1943, shows what is not here to an extreme. In fact, Dumbo has become more famous for the crows being voiced by African-American actors, and a debate, easily discovered on-line, goes into how racist this may or may not be. The voices are certainly typecast in a way very common in Hollywood movies of the time. They have a huge role in the film, however, and an interesting one to dissect. It's also been pointed out that poor Dumbo is never empowered&#x97;he never speaks, for example, but he does get drunk, poor child. Of course, he also flies. For real. And he doesn't have peanut allergies, thank goodness. That's power.So Dumbo is a brilliant trifle, a compact flexing of some great animation muscle. It is not a brilliant story but it's a very sad one for children who love their mothers (or miss them very much, as I do). It's not a very imaginative telling of the story, for the most part, or even a groundbreaking bit of animation, for the most part. But it is enjoyable&#x97;yes, endlessly. It's delightful and fun and whimsical and even at times very touching, heartbreaking. Which is all it needs to be.

It was a recording from a television broadcast and was missing the first few minutes, so the opening shots were of C-3PO and R2-D2 walking over the dunes of Tatooine. That planet is not, of course, named in the movie; strange as it is to think, there must have been a brief span of time when I knew the movie pretty well but didn't know the colossal amount of trivial information that I permanently internalized during my teen years. For a while I had no idea there were sequels. But the details and backstories that books and games and movies and TV shows have filled in over the decades were in a way already present, at least implicitly, at the outset. It is well-known that George Lucas was inspired by old sci- fi\/adventure serials, and that he tried to give this episode of Star Wars the feel of belonging to a far grander saga whose beginning and end were far off. It was an audacious, brilliant move, and it worked on my younger self exactly as intended. I was able to conjure images of Luke's heroic father, supposedly killed in the off-handedly mentioned Clone Wars, and I was able to get a sense of what those conflicts were like from the way that Alec Guinness looked and sounded when he talked about the past. I could feel the long history of Obi-Wan and Vader's relationship in the way they appraised each other during their showdown. I could imagine, vaguely, the previous ups and downs of the rebel alliance and the off-screen machinations of Imperial Senate.

I can't think of any other movies with him, but considering that I know his name he did a few, so he might be a good actor. But this movie really doesn't show it. I wonder if he even knew it was a comedy, because he sure didn't act as if he did.Actually besides having a more or less original idea for a romantic comedy the movie didn't go too far from it. The joke was pretty much the same all through 90 minutes. And it was also stupid. It was the kind of sentiment I would expect for a teen movie, but the characters in this one were in their 20's, the whole omg the poor guy can't live without sex thing is just dumb.

Some things in movies need to be CGI. The Lord of the Rings had amazing CGI, but only when it was necessary. A lot of what you see in that trilogy is actually present there. Rather than making the orcs CG, they are actual people in prosthetics and make-up. Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark did it all without CGI, and with amazing practical effects. But many modern movies resort to CGI for every scene. Every scene in the Star Wars prequel trilogy has CGI. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had a lot of unnecessary CGI. The Hobbit had CGI orcs, while the Rings trilogy relied on prosthetics for these creatures. So many movies use CGI in every scene, and I'm tired of it. CGI has a place in film, but not in every scene. That is part of why it is such a relief to go back to the first 40 years of film and see King Kong. Seeing these practical effects such as stop- motion put to such great use is wonderful. The stop motion is absolutely amazing and nearly flawless. The models are excellently made. But there is more to the movie than just these effects. Everyone knows the story. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is a passionate genius filmmaker who sets off with his film crew to make a picture on a mysterious island. When he gets there, his female star Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) is kidnapped by natives and left to be a sacrifice to Kong, a giant gorilla. But rather than killing her, Kong becomes obsessed with her, and takes her back to his cave. She is rescued by sailor John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), and Denham subdues Kong. He then decides to take Kong back to New York and make millions. But there, Kong breaks free and kidnaps Ann again, resulting in a city-wide rampage and a climax on the top of the Empire State Building. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie this exciting. The whole movie is thrilling, even before we see Kong. The best part of the movie is the hunt for Kong. The whole chase is tense and suspenseful, and amazing to see. Seeing the human characters alongside the stop- motion beasts is stunning for the time. I love seeing Kong fight a dinosaur. The whole chase is non-stop thrills. The climax on top of the Empire State Building is great as well, with great effects and cinematography, but nothing can top the jungle chase. The characters are products of films of that day. They didn't have much depth, and they didn't need it. It's simply a monster story. And of course, we have our monster. Kong is simply one of the best things ever. He is awesome. He's threatening (albeit fake-looking) and wreaks death and destruction, but he's a sympathetic animal as well. The sets of the film are some of the best I've ever seen. They are all actually there, and look like it. The score is great as well, creating a threatening and dramatic feel.

Not always directly, our paths don't always cross, and like one facing north and the other south we may never know each other exist, but the emotions that we share are universal and the needs of our hearts often fulfilled just as we feel the wind is stirring and our grip is loosening. Paul Thomas Anderson's grand opus on life, pain and loss begins with vignettes on coincidence, and ultimately fate, and throughout ponders on its recurring theme that we might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us before reaching its now legendary conclusion and having just one thing to say after 3 tumultuous hours&#x85; All we need is love.Winner of Best Film at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival, Oscar nominated for Tom Cruise's fearless performance and Aimee Mann's wonderful original song Save Me and my 26th favourite film of all time, Magnolia is a day long journey through the lives of both tortured and hopeful souls in the San Fernando Valley all seeking a connection, or redemption. Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), a good man seeking a companion responds to a 911 call for disturbance where he happens upon Claudia Gator (Melora Walters), a drug-addict and victim of child abuse whom he immediately cares for. Claudia's father is Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), popular host of long-running game show What Do Kids Know? and secret cancer sufferer with a month to live. The current whiz kid on What Do Kids Know? is Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), being used by his neglectful father and seemingly following in the footsteps of 'former whiz kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy),' who is suffering severely with depression and loneliness. This show is produced by Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), who is currently lying on his death bed being cared for by Phil Palmer (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a nurse desperately wanting to help track down his estranged son Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), a raging misogynist and motivational speaker encouraging his audience of men to seduce and destroy, while Earl's second wife Linda (Julianne Moore) is overcome with regret after finally falling in love with him now that he is dying, having cheated on him a number of times and only marrying him for his money.As the tagline says things fall down, people look up, and when it rains, it pours.Julianne Moore and Jason Robards Julianne Moore and Jason Robards Around the midpoint of Magnolia, in the audience of What Do Kids Know? a sign is briefly visible curiously reading 'Exodus 8 2,' referring to a passage in the Bible speaking of Israel's captivity in Egypt And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs. Those who have seen this film can understand the frog reference, and I believe that its meaning lies with the feelings our tortured characters are harbouring; grief, regret, sorrow, heartache&#x85; if you can't let these go then an incredible act will help dissolve them for you.

He is more than the protagonist of the film Rocky. He is this film. There is no separation. When you talk about the film Rocky, you talk about Rocky Balboa. He is possibly the only character in cinematic history that IS a film.Most of the film is about struggling smalltime boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and his life, while he prepares for a match against big-time boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). The film does not focus on just Rocky training, but on Rocky himself, as a person and on his life. That is the biggest reason this movie is so great. It is mainly just about a person and his life. Rocky is possibly the most likable character I have ever come across in any medium. The biggest reason for that is that he is the definitive everyman. He's simple, he's not too smart, he's passionate, he has problems like everyone else, and a good heart. I would have satisfied even if the movie had just been about Rocky's life, and left out the Apollo Creed match. Rocky is such a great character to watch, as anybody can relate to him. That is why the match with Apollo is all the more inspiring. Because Rocky is the everyman, the fact that he gets such a big break is truly inspirational. Most of the credit for the success of Rocky must go to Sylvester Stallone. He created the character on paper and on screen, and became the character. The movie was shot on a low budget in 28 days. The simple production became a huge hit and winner of the Best Picture Oscar®. There are terrific characters alongside Rocky, such as his girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire), who starts out shy and quiet, but because of Rocky starts to act like a womanly strong wife. Rocky's trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is a lot of fun as well, but with a good heart. Another aspect of the film I should talk about is the main theme. There are only a few minutes worth of music in the film, which leaves the focus on Rocky.

All it took was 2 or 3 minutes of Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity to know where the movies were going. Double Indemnity starts off with scummy insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) racing to his office with a gunshot wound. Rather than leave town or get medical treatment, he is compelled to confess his crimes. Then we see why somebody would shoot this rather dull fellow. This framing device wasn't as common in 1944 as it is now, so kudos to Wilder for making it work so well.Maybe Neff doesn't just blow town because he's in love with his semi-genius co-worker Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) and needs closure on that relationship. Okay, they're not in love sexually, but this is one of hundreds of great movies that---if you think about it---feature a bromance that overshadows any man\/woman attachments. As outstanding as the outstanding Barbara Stanwyck is as the fatal femme fatale, the real story is the strong friendship betwixt Neff and Keyes.Wilder's story (co-written with Raymond Chandler, adapted from James Cain's novella) is luridly delicious. Neff meets married Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) on a visit to renew her husband's insurance policy. They decide to make sure her hubbie has an accident so they can make off with a big payday. Keyes, however, is smarter than the gullible cops and he won't let the case go. He doesn't KNOW that Mr. Dietrichson was murdered, but he's going to figure it out. Meanwhile, Walter and Phyllis don't trust each other.The American Film Institute loves Double Indemnity almost as much as I do, proving that by ranking it 38th in 1998 and then 29th in 2007 on their Top 100 lists. Not bad for The Insurance Movie! The AFI appreciates it as a thriller and as a love story too, even if it's hard to believe that Walter and Phyllis ever had any real feelings for one another. She's rotten to the core and he's too horny to notice until it's too late. It's pulp and it certainly isn't the most uplifting movie made during WWII, but I smile just thinking about how bad these people are.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the Podcasts section for our 36-minute Double Indemnity 'cast...and many others.

Neff meets married Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) on a visit to renew her husband's insurance policy. They decide to make sure her hubbie has an accident so they can make off with a big payday. Keyes, however, is smarter than the gullible cops and he won't let the case go. He doesn't KNOW that Mr. Dietrichson was murdered, but he's going to figure it out. Meanwhile, Walter and Phyllis don't trust each other.The American Film Institute loves Double Indemnity almost as much as I do, proving that by ranking it 38th in 1998 and then 29th in 2007 on their Top 100 lists. Not bad for The Insurance Movie! The AFI appreciates it as a thriller and as a love story too, even if it's hard to believe that Walter and Phyllis ever had any real feelings for one another. She's rotten to the core and he's too horny to notice until it's too late. It's pulp and it certainly isn't the most uplifting movie made during WWII, but I smile just thinking about how bad these people are.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the Podcasts section for our 36-minute Double Indemnity 'cast...and many others.

The competency in direction - acting, staging, pacing, editing, and of course the pristine cinematography. It seems it was made by a director with many more years of experience. As many people involved with the project knew, this film would be remembered through time. Based on a real incident, it reflected the change in sentimentality of how soldiers were being used as human waves, where it was acceptable to allow for a certain percent of casualties. This disregard for human life is eloquently displayed with a series of scenes the demonstrate the futility of war. From the miserable trench conditions, to the fighting for mounds of dirt, to the blind military strategy that merely repeats failed attacks, to the absurdity of threatening death as punishment as part of the rules of war. Partly what makes this such a timeless statement is the fact it was banned in many countries, because of the possible explosive anti-military sentiments it may have provoked.Sadly, this film was ignored by the Academy Awards, there are many aspects of the film that are excellently executed. Primarily is the lean script. Clocking in at 88 minutes, each exchange by the great cast is sharp and poignant. The intriguing audacity of executing your own soldiers during a war creates meaningful contradictions. A Colonel wants 3 men shot for cowardice, as a representation of each group. Why not kill all the soldiers if they are all accused of cowardice? And what real incentive does it give the other soldiers to go on to a battlefield and be killed or stay in your trench and be killed? These dilemmas are intelligently staged with a crisp pace that successfully develops sympathy from the audience. Part of what makes the casting great is the use of actors that have distinctive characteristics that present more of the human side of facing death.I don't think anyone will deny the artistic freedom of using American actors as French soldiers. Or the fact this 1916 period piece has distinctly modern dialect and frank honesty about religion, military power, and what the definition of true patriotism is. Even better is that these subject matters are cleanly addressed with not one moment feeling like a dry debate. Rarely do these confrontations occur sitting down, the body language and use of space creates a dynamic that feels heavily thought out and rehearsed. The locations are exquisite. Ironically, the locations were filmed in a castle in Germany. All the characters in this film are well drawn and a joy to watch when sparring against each other. Kirk Douglas particularly savours his juicy scenes of disdain and rebellion. George McCready is the antagonist, and speaks with a lofty prima donna delivery that makes him all that more detestable.This film succeeds on all levels, it has great action scenes but has a moral message. It has unpleasant confrontations with death but is still beautiful to look at. The subject matter is serious yet very entertaining. It achieves the classification of a film masterpiece because of the ability of the filmmaker to encapsulate the heart of the story with only a few scenes (the entire film plays out over the course of 2 days) with well honed dialogue and an active camera.

Yes, he's that mysterious stranger whose somehow acquired a gift for gunfire overnight, or was it a silent deadly talent. Whatever it is, this non stop spectacle of action, amidst explosions and bloodshed is just that, not to be taken seriously. Bubblegum escapist fare. Cool, sexy Banderas makes a name for himself as the new bad..rse, out to settle a score if you know, from watching the first, only to receive a thunderblow of shock as to the identity of the avenged. Joaquin De Almedia is fantastic as the deadly Bucho, (only film I saw him in before-The Honorary Consul, what happened?) who's entourage he sends to find this so called myth of a man, only results in them coming back dead or injured. Banderas is great as the new hero, you so much vouch for, one cool gunslinger, and this is his movie. The way those two pistols pop up from under his coat sleeves is so cool, as many other things in this flick are. A movie, did you ask? No. A non stop action flick, super spectacular, just to get lost in, as well as Hayek's beauty, a fitting song, in light of the head turning accidents she causes. Buscemi is likable and funny as Bandera's sender of bad news, through his carefully detailed stories, that send of hearts racing. QT's joke goes down as a killer in my book, and he's so well enunciated, as he tells it (you'll split your heels) lapping it up for the camera. We catch momentary frames of him that actually paint as a different bad dude character, where really sometimes directors should stay where they belong. Danny Trejo, adds great nasty menace too as one nasty ugly Mexican, 15 years shy of his Machete role, who you don't want to f..k with. A much contrast to his role in Heat as one of Deniro's posse. Too in these sort of escapist fares, we have scenes of incredulity, one including Banderas, falling backwards onto the roof of a much lower building and not braking his back. Check out the opening credit scene with Banderas and his mariachi's capturing the attention of a room full of bar patrons, playing a great guitar playing track. Action, action, action, action, and more action. I can't put it better. We have bits of humor too, adding flavour, but mostly it's in not so happy instances. You will admire, revenge filled Banderas's persistence and stamina too.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"28 November 2013","score":"","review":" Best movie ever! Story line ...awesome! A man convicted of murder lives in a prison brutally ruled by a sadistic warden and secretly run by a con who knows all the ropes and pulls all the strings. The story is narrated by man named Red, who killed his wife to collect insurance. Everyone is probably thinking what an awful man and I already don't like this guy but throughout the story without knowing, you start to actually feel sorry for him and everyone else in the prison. I don't know what it is that Stephen King does but you really start to feel like they all have done nothing wrong. When a man by the name of Andy Dufrense comes to Shawshank on charges of killing his wife Linda Dufrense and her lover Glenn Quentin, who was a golf pro he changes the prison and he becomes a man nobody will ever forget. Andy claims to be not guilty, and throughout the story he tries to prove that. He usually keeps to himself and he has this attitude about him that doesn't seem right for a prisoner at Shawshank prison. He walks around calmly and upright just as if he was talking a walk through the park, this doesn't land Andy many friends. While doing his time in Shawshank he is constantly fighting a battle with these men people call the sisters and his freedom. This book is a very adventurous and somewhat mysterious book, it's probably not suitable for younger readers just because of the language and some sexual content, but I would definitely recommend it to young adults.
