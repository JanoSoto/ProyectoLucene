The director's name sounds just like that of a film-making auteur, and it was up for a number of acting Oscars (something that almost never comes to action\/adventure genre). I'll admit, I was fearing that the film would have a great action premise but instead have its actors go into dramatics and debate philosophy and their own mortality, or something like that. Fear not, however. Runaway Train is an action movie, and it's perfect for watching in one's living room.Manny (Jon Voight) is the toughest prisoner at a maximum security prison deep in the heart of Alaska. He's a hero to all the inmates, particularly Buck (Eric Roberts). When Manny decides to escape, Buck tags along. But their ride to freedom comes into deadly conflict when the train that they hitch a ride on loses its conductor to a heart attack.The acting varies; Jon Voight was awarded an Oscar nomination for his performance here, and while usually effective, it's nothing special. Manny is fiercely independent, and cares about no one. It's a survival mechanism that he has, and no one will get in his way of doing whatever he sets his mind to. The real surprise is Eric Roberts as Buck. Buck idolizes Manny, and wants to be his partner in their escape. But the dim-witted Buck learns the hard way that our heroes are not always what they seem. I have yet to understand why Rebecca DeMornay gets work; she can't act, and the only reasonable performance she has was in Risky Business. Of course, that was made only a few years before this film, so it makes sense that she was cast. But it does begin to show her non-existent talent. John P. Ryan is perfectly cast as Ranken, the prison warden who hates Manny so much that he's itching for an excuse to kill him (this is never really explained, but it's not particularly important anyway).Connections to the future action hit Speed are warranted, although the later film is eons better than this one. In this type of film, the most important determining factor in its success is its execution. Runaway Train is well made, and contains a consistent level of tension throughout.Unfortunately, the film does attempt to ask some philosophical questions about human nature in times of crisis. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except that these questions seem grafted on at the last minute, and the characters aren't developed enough to make it really work.Runaway Train is a good thriller, and well worth a look, but its attempts to do something audacious and profound bring down the project more than a couple of notches in quality.

Even better was the fact that Scream 2 was just about a step above the original was impressive. Both films also stacked the cast with hot, young up and coming stars, and a brilliant horror film maker (Wes Craven)and brilliant writer (Kevin Williamson.) Enter the 'final' part of the trilogy. Let's look at what has changed. Original cast...check...Wes Craven at the helm...check...Kevin Williamson...producer but not writer...hmmm interesting. Enter new writer Ehren Kruger who at this point hadn't had a lot of experience with big budget films. I don't blame Kruger for the stumble in the series necessarily. He did pen the script for both The Ring films which I adore, but then again he also penned Transformers 2 which compared to its original was nothing short of a disaster. Scream 3 is a must see but only because the trilogy as a whole is brilliant because where the series starts out in brilliance, it falls flat by the end with a lower standard of story, a rather disappointing conclusion, less variety and creativity with deaths and just extended characters that don't have the same appeal.In my opinion especially in the horror genre it's always good to have the original cast come back. I love this cast. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox (while I love her character...she looks awful in this movie), David Arquette, and Liev Schreiber however brief has a terrific scene at the beginning which will give you high hopes for the rest of the film. So enter the newcomers, the hot young cast we have come to expect from Wes Craven's Scream series and for the most part they are young, hot and decent actors but they aren't given the roles to sink their teeth into so you don't care about them. Patrick Dempsey is the head Detective on the case with an apparent crush on Campbell's Sid although that is never established nor explored whatsoever its just simply assumed. Dempsey is a great actor and they really short changed his character who could have been as good as Jerry O'Connell in Scream 2. Scott Foley is decent as young director Roman Bridger but again he never really gives us anything outstanding with his character. B-Movie King Lance Henriksen could have had an epic cameo role (think Henry Winkler in Scream 1) but instead he is drab and unimportant. Deon Richmond, Emily Mortimer, and Jenny McCarthy are just simply fodder for the Ghostface killer and they didn't give them anything to work with. I mean in the past films even the supporting cast had significant roles in the plot. The absolutely disastrous attempt to bring back fan favorite Jamie Kennedy in his role as Randy Meeks was even more disheartening and meant an awkward, forced and downright stupid cameo by Princess Diaries alumni Heather Matarazzo.So where did they go wrong? Well first and foremost the film was clearly rushed. They lost all heart and passion for the series and the genre and forced out a sub par entry to 'wrap' up the trilogy. The so called final solution to the Scream franchise was downright silly and not explained or linked together. I don't blame Wes Craven as the man is nothing short of brilliant and I don't even blame the lack Williamson at the helm of writing but simply bad timing and perhaps a rushed film schedule. Fortunately for Scream 3 it will be watched because the first two installments draw you in and make you want more. In true slasher flick style it is now official that Scream 4 (with the potential of a second trilogy) has been green lit and I couldn't be happier.

For the most part, I'd say the film has aged relatively well. Sure, a lot of the elements are dated, such as the clothes, technology, fashion, and expressions of the day, but having said that, I still feel it is relatable to today's generation. Everyone's had a god-awful, boring teacher like Ben Stein, a friend who was wound up too tightly like Cameron, and a friend who got away with everything like Ferris.I do like this movie, but I've seen it so many times over the years that I do feel it's been played out. Now when I watch it, I don't laugh because I think it's funny, I laugh because I remember thinking it was funny in the past, and now it seems it's just a conditioned response.Realistically, it's probably highly unlikely, if not altogether impossible for Ferris to have done all that he did during his day off in the Windy City, but it wouldn't have been very fun to watch a movie called, Ferris Bueller's Uneventful Day Off either.The only problem with a movie as famous as this is that by the time you see it, assuming you've never seen it before, you probably know or have heard a lot of the famous lines, but never in context.

In retrospect, bringing back Michael Myers for 'Halloween II' was a possible mistake if the intention was for 'Halloween' to become an anthology series with a different tale in each installment. The sequel's success only cemented expectations in the viewer's minds that homicide in Haddonfield by a mask-covered psychopath was what they would see unfold each time on screen. And so by 1983, audiences clearly weren't prepared for 'Season Of The Witch' and made this fact abundantly clear at the box office, which is a great shame, because deeply-flawed as it is, 'Halloween III' is a lot of fun and does not deserve to be overlooked the way it often is.The storyline, centred around a toy factory manufacturing murderous masks designed to bring nationwide doom at 9pm on October 31st, is built up very intriguingly. We have a 'Simon Van Gelder'-like madman trying to warn the world of the impending slaughter, chillingly-ruthless killers in business suits silencing anyone who tries to get the word out, and strikingly memorable death scenes - one of which might be described as 'facial origami', and that's only the first 15 minutes. Soon, our story's heroes are embroiled in the factory's strange machinations, where nothing and no-one is exactly what they seem. The script builds up a tense atmosphere, leading to a truly compelling end that will keep viewers guessing long after.Yet 'Season Of The Witch' (a title not to be taken too literally) comes across as an intriguing second draft - full of good ideas, but lacking the kind of logic and key exposition that would have really brought the audience on board. Writer Tommy Lee Wallace's America, for example, seems to occupy one single time zone, in which it's possible to have the nation's children watching their televisions at the appointed hour. Likewise, we are expected to believe that the illegal appropriation of one of the world's largest and heaviest artificial landmarks - a key plot point at the climax - seems to be no more difficult than stealing a mattress from a bedding store and spiriting it away on a car's roof. Dr Challis, the lead character, is an obvious graduate of 'Action Hero Medical College', stitching up wounds one day and tackling the undead like Indiana Jones the next. The film's other two leads are also something of a puzzle, with their identities and ultimate fate never being satisfactorily explored. All of which leaves 'Halloween III' as a series of entertaining sequences that anyone attempting the most basic of critical analysis will be punished instantly with crushing bafflement. The lack of audience enthusiasm cannot be solely attributed to the absence of Michael Myers (who ironically, does enjoy a few seconds of screen time).Nonetheless, it would have been interesting if 'Halloween' had become an anthology series of horror, and with 'Halloween III' not short on ideas, it's only a shame more care and attention wasn't put into the effort. All involved clearly failed to understand what they had set in motion with the first two outings, unable to see that any change in direction for the franchise would have to be very well-executed to win the fans over. However, it wasn't and Michael Myers would go on to make a respectable return five years later. For what it offers, I think 'Season Of The Witch' is definitely worth a look - arguably more creative than most of the 'Halloween' sequels, but seriously lacking polish.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 April 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Season Of The Witch' is the swiftly-ignored footnote in the 'Halloween' franchise - quickly forgotten evidence that 'Halloween' was meant to be more 'Creepshow' than 'Friday The 13th' in style. In retrospect, bringing back Michael Myers for 'Halloween II' was a possible mistake if the intention was for 'Halloween' to become an anthology series with a different tale in each installment. The sequel's success only cemented expectations in the viewer's minds that homicide in Haddonfield by a mask-covered psychopath was what they would see unfold each time on screen. And so by 1983, audiences clearly weren't prepared for 'Season Of The Witch' and made this fact abundantly clear at the box office, which is a great shame, because deeply-flawed as it is, 'Halloween III' is a lot of fun and does not deserve to be overlooked the way it often is.The storyline, centred around a toy factory manufacturing murderous masks designed to bring nationwide doom at 9pm on October 31st, is built up very intriguingly. We have a 'Simon Van Gelder'-like madman trying to warn the world of the impending slaughter, chillingly-ruthless killers in business suits silencing anyone who tries to get the word out, and strikingly memorable death scenes - one of which might be described as 'facial origami', and that's only the first 15 minutes. Soon, our story's heroes are embroiled in the factory's strange machinations, where nothing and no-one is exactly what they seem. The script builds up a tense atmosphere, leading to a truly compelling end that will keep viewers guessing long after.Yet 'Season Of The Witch' (a title not to be taken too literally) comes across as an intriguing second draft - full of good ideas, but lacking the kind of logic and key exposition that would have really brought the audience on board. Writer Tommy Lee Wallace's America, for example, seems to occupy one single time zone, in which it's possible to have the nation's children watching their televisions at the appointed hour. Likewise, we are expected to believe that the illegal appropriation of one of the world's largest and heaviest artificial landmarks - a key plot point at the climax - seems to be no more difficult than stealing a mattress from a bedding store and spiriting it away on a car's roof. Dr Challis, the lead character, is an obvious graduate of 'Action Hero Medical College', stitching up wounds one day and tackling the undead like Indiana Jones the next. The film's other two leads are also something of a puzzle, with their identities and ultimate fate never being satisfactorily explored. All of which leaves 'Halloween III' as a series of entertaining sequences that anyone attempting the most basic of critical analysis will be punished instantly with crushing bafflement. The lack of audience enthusiasm cannot be solely attributed to the absence of Michael Myers (who ironically, does enjoy a few seconds of screen time).Nonetheless, it would have been interesting if 'Halloween' had become an anthology series of horror, and with 'Halloween III' not short on ideas, it's only a shame more care and attention wasn't put into the effort. All involved clearly failed to understand what they had set in motion with the first two outings, unable to see that any change in direction for the franchise would have to be very well-executed to win the fans over. However, it wasn't and Michael Myers would go on to make a respectable return five years later. For what it offers, I think 'Season Of The Witch' is definitely worth a look - arguably more creative than most of the 'Halloween' sequels, but seriously lacking polish.

Its star\/writer\/creator was Paul Hogan, who came to the attention of British television viewers when his Australian sketch show was bought by the fledgling Channel 4 network.

It was the second biggest money-maker in the U.S. that year ( the first being the awful 'Top Gun' ), beating out 'Platoon', 'Star Trek 4 The Voyage Home', and 'Aliens'.So what was it all about? Divorced journalist Sue Charlton ( Linda Koslowski ) travels to Australia to meet the survivor of a crocodile attack. In the outback, she finds eccentric crocodile poacher Michael J.

The first forty minutes are good fun, but when it moves to the Big Apple the film really gets into its comedic stride, as Mick struggles to come to terms with American culture. He washes his socks in the hotel bath, chats to a stranger in the street as though he is an old friend, and, when a mugger tries to rob him at knife point, whips out his blade, and grins That's a knife!, causing the terrified man to flee.Suddenly a new folk hero was born.

I like both films for different reasons.Oscar nominated for Best Screenplay, Hogan attended the 1987 ceremony in his 'Dundee' clothes. Two years later, a sequel came out - 'Crocodile Dundee 2'. It did not do the big business of the first ( I thought personally it was superior ) but proved popular all the same. Alas Hogan waited until 2001 to make a third picture - 'Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles'.

My only quibble is that the movie is a bit long, but all the scenes are woven together so that the length of the movie (3 hours) pass by seamlessly. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, especially, are wonderful together and it is very interesting to see the youthful Pitt be in the 'power' position with the far-more-established, older (and always superb) Anthony Hopkins. Pitt's portrayal of Death incarnate is delightful as he attempts to navigate the world of the living; his often naive but utterly honest character is delightful to watch and Hopkins carries off his role of guide to Pitt with his typical panache and elegance. The supporting cast of Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor and Jake Weber are all superb and perfectly cast in their roles. I would be remiss without mentioning the musical score by Thomas Newman. It is gorgeous, sumptuous and stunning in places.In fact, the final scene (which I won't ruin here!) is made so much more poignant with the gorgeous music of the soundtrack adding to the emotion of the moment that the music is, as is often the case in movies, like another member of the cast. If you are a fan of any of these actors or just enjoy movies with a pleasant and\/or slightly supernatural plot, this movie will not disappoint you. There is a touch of comedy, a lot of pathos and an offbeat love story all mixed into one, and if you can watch the last ten minutes of this movie without feeling moved to tears I would encourage you to check your pulse because, music included, it is a stunningly beautiful ending.

The supporting cast of Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor and Jake Weber are all superb and perfectly cast in their roles. I would be remiss without mentioning the musical score by Thomas Newman. It is gorgeous, sumptuous and stunning in places.In fact, the final scene (which I won't ruin here!) is made so much more poignant with the gorgeous music of the soundtrack adding to the emotion of the moment that the music is, as is often the case in movies, like another member of the cast. If you are a fan of any of these actors or just enjoy movies with a pleasant and\/or slightly supernatural plot, this movie will not disappoint you. There is a touch of comedy, a lot of pathos and an offbeat love story all mixed into one, and if you can watch the last ten minutes of this movie without feeling moved to tears I would encourage you to check your pulse because, music included, it is a stunningly beautiful ending.

Actually it can be said that the film works as a metaphor of Dogma 95. Where in the film the characters form a group that breaks with their society's norms, the Dogma 95 was a group of people that went against the film making-norms. All the features that characterize both the dogma films and the idiots are designed to go against the mainstream, the middle class, to avoid being common and perhaps achieving a new and more true way of storytelling\/living. The Dogma manifesto is aimed towards a purer film, just like the idiots in the movie aiming for a purer lifestyle. The prominent technique used in the film is largely following the rules of the Dogma manifesto. In this way there is almost no technique, the restrictions created by the manifesto make the style more pure, creating a sense of things being natural which directly ties into one of the main themes of the movie- which is the characters obsession with getting away from society and normal life hence acting like idiots- which is also a direct reflection on why the manifesto was made in the first place. By allowing the actors to improvise von Trier further pushes this pure style, there was a script but it was very loosely followed. The actors were allowed to break from the norms of acting, letting themselves be idiots in a sense, while still maintaining their role as an actor- as they are only acting like idiots. We have noticed that almost all of them have interpretated during the film two characters &#x96;the disabled one, and the normal one-.

Carlito Brigante. All classic gangster characters brought to life by the great Al Pacino. He can add his portrayal of Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero from Donnie Brasco to that rogue's gallery. Like a master musician, Pacino has found yet another riff on his gangster persona that is totally different from previous efforts. That's a true indication of Pacino's talent.The film is based on the true story of how FBI Agent Joe Pistone infiltrated a New York mafia family for years under the alias of Donnie Brasco in the late 1970s and the toll it took on him and his wife and kids. Pistone\/Brasco (Johnny Depp) is taken under the wing of veteran mobster Lefty Ruggiero(aka Horse Cock) played by Al Pacino and it's the touching almost father\/son relationship between them that is the heart of this movie.The script does things to the story in the book that actually hurt its credibility. In the book, Pistone could not participate in any crime or even, where possible, not be present when one was taking place. In this film though, not only do we see Agent Pistone witnessing murders, we also see him hacking up corpses for disposal and stealing $300,000 from the mob. Complete nonsense, of course. The evidence he amassed would have counted for nothing if he had done that for real. To avoid participating in crimes, Agent Pistone had to constantly advise his mafia cohorts against carrying out robberies. This made them suspicious and eventually culminated in the most tense scene in the book, strangely missing from the film. One day, some wise-guys took Pistone to a warehouse and asked him for the name and number of someone who could vouch for him. If Pistone couldn't think of one or the name didn't check out, they would kill him right there and then in the warehouse. Pistone gave them and a name and number and the mobsters went to investigate, leaving Pistone to sweat it out, knowing he could die the second they returned. Hours later, the mobsters came back to the warehouse and said Pistone's alibi checked out. Pistone had to let them see that he was not taking it lightly and lashed out at one of them. They never questioned his loyalty again. That would have made an incredible scene in this movie and I don't know why it wasn't included.This is one Al Pacino's best performances, his Lefty can be an ice-cold killer one minute or a desperate father the next (his son is a junkie). He gives out fatherly advice to Donnie, but is also like an annoying relative. Lefty is the opposite of Mafia don Michael Corleone in The Godfather who was born into Mafia royalty and called the shots as the head honcho. Lefty is an older man way down the ranks of the mob who has missed his big chance and moans about it constantly. He feels disrespected by his Mafia colleagues and is drawn to Donnie Brasco as he is the only person in the film that gives him any respect.Johnny Depp does well in the title role of Donnie Brasco\/Agent Pistone and this is part of what I call his Crime Trilogy; Public Enemies, Blow and Donnie Brasco. Michael Madsen, still riding the crest of the Reservoir Dogs wave back in 1996 when this was made, is good as mob boss Sonny Black. Sadly, Madsen's career kind of went off the rails after this and he started doing stuff like Species II and the awful Bond movie Die Another Day and he ended up doing DTV movies mostly. Oddly, this very New York movie was directed by Brit Mike Newell and this is easily the best movie he's ever made. I would like to see him do another mob movie to see if can recapture the form he showed here.The script by Paul Attanasio was nominated for an Oscar and it gives a top actor like Al Pacino something he can really get his teeth into and he runs with it and makes it into something special (Pacino should have been Oscar-nominated too for his work here but he wasn't). Pacino needs material of this quality again; his recent movies 88 Minutes and Righteous Kill didn't really set the world on fire.Donnie Brasco is an excellent mob movie that got rave reviews when it came out but is strangely forgotten about these days and never plays on TV much (possibly because it wasn't made by one of the major studios).

Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it.

In short, it is a brilliant classic thriller. Even after first seeing the movie 7 years ago when I was 11, the film never loses its tension. Some people might say it lacks the show-off set pieces that was Hitch's trademark, but I have to say I don't find that the case. I for one found the climax especially nail-biting. On top of that, the film is very well made, the cinematography once again is faultless and the production values are sumptuous. The music also adds to the suspense and the tension, it is beautiful at times with the mix of Lehar's Merry Widow Overture, which is significant to the story, yet in the more tense scenes, it is powerful, haunting and chilling. The script is also of high-calibre quality, as is Hitch's direction. As are the performances. Teresa Wright is pretty much the epitome of pumpkin-pie innocence, while Joseph Cotton is charming and suave yet somewhat chilling as well as the killer who is wanted in the east for relieving widows of their wealth and their lives. The story is swiftly-told, isn't that complicated and moves along at a reasonable pace if rather slow on occasions.
