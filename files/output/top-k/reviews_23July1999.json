I had heard rumors that a girl gets her head cut off, a bunch of kids get brutally killed, cut up, and hung on hooks, and that other weird atrocities are committed, so I strayed away for awhile. Then, when I was in the sixth grade, my brother rented it against my will and I was forced to face my fears. After I was finished viewing it, I soon realized that there was absolutely NO large amounts of blood in the picture and that all the hype was b.s. I was actually kinda disappointed, but something pulled me in and I soon got the urge to rent it several more times. I then grew older and wiser, until The Texas Chainsaw Massacre got better with each viewing. It still does till this very day.I love this movie. I truly do. It is one of the ONLY horror films I've seen that actually provides genuine scares, in the same ballpark as Carrie and The Shining. Most horror is just a bunch of self-conscious and senseless gore and special effects, with no scares, no talent, and little shock value. Personally, I don't think a film has to be gory to be scary. In fact, I think the gore actually removes some of the calaustrophobic elements that truly make a film horrifying. I mean, look at the Friday the 13th series and see what I mean. TCM is practically goreless and is ten times scarier.The plot to this film is a basic one. A group of kids take a trip to the graves of their relatives to make sure they haven't been caught up in the current graverobbings and soon get caught up with a family of sadistic cannibals who proceed to terrorize them and . . . I think you get the message. Truly horrifying. The climax is one that is sure to freak anybody out, even if you think you've seen everything.

But the movie that came to my mind wasn't THE SHINING, it was another haunted house classic, POLTERGEIST.  In THE SHINING, Kubrick used creepy music, scary scenes, and terrific acting to make THE SHINING one of the most scary movies of all time.  In POLTERGEIST, Tobe Hopper and Steven Spielberg used visual effects to scare up the audience. THE HAUNTING does what Hooper and Spielberg did 17 years ago, to try and scare today's audience.  And does it work?  Well yes it does. The plot has a scientist, Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Nesson) who brings three people who suffer from insomnia to the gigantic and mysterous Hill House. One is a beauty (Catherine Zeta Jones), one a some kind of jester (Owen Wilson), the other a sensitive and depressed woman who just lost her sick mother after years of being taken care of and years of being ill (Lili Taylor). While they stay at Hill House, there are mysterous sounds going on at night, and scary voices crying for help. That is when THE HAUNTING works, it's creepy scenes.  And they are pretty creepy.  It's not a jump out and scare you surprise scary, it's more of a slowly approaching you scary, then it strikes you.  There are some pretty creepy scenes in this film, and with the visual effects, they help quite a bit. The production design (by Eugenio Zanetti) is fabulous!  I have never seen such a beautiful, mysterous, and scary house.  I won't be surprised if Zanetti is going to pick up another Oscar award for this film, he did a fantastic job!  The visual effects are also quite good, they look more realistic than your average computer-generated film.  And the acting by all of the leds (especially Lili Taylor) do a good job. The only thing that doesn't work for THE HAUNTING is the pacing, and the story.  The pacing picks up speed, then slows down, it picks up speed again, then it slows down.  Director Jan De Bont has made one of the fasted paced films of all time (SPEED) why didn't he make this a fast paced scary horror film? Instead he tries to blend both the horror\/effects with the plot. And the plot of this movie is the film's weakest point.

But the movie that came to my mind wasn't THE SHINING, it was another haunted house classic, POLTERGEIST.  In THE SHINING, Kubrick used creepy music, scary scenes, and terrific acting to make THE SHINING one of the most scary movies of all time.  In POLTERGEIST, Tobe Hopper and Steven Spielberg used visual effects to scare up the audience. THE HAUNTING does what Hooper and Spielberg did 17 years ago, to try and scare today's audience.  And does it work?  Well yes it does. The plot has a scientist, Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Nesson) who brings three people who suffer from insomnia to the gigantic and mysterous Hill House. One is a beauty (Catherine Zeta Jones), one a some kind of jester (Owen Wilson), the other a sensitive and depressed woman who just lost her sick mother after years of being taken care of and years of being ill (Lili Taylor). While they stay at Hill House, there are mysterous sounds going on at night, and scary voices crying for help. That is when THE HAUNTING works, it's creepy scenes.  And they are pretty creepy.  It's not a jump out and scare you surprise scary, it's more of a slowly approaching you scary, then it strikes you.  There are some pretty creepy scenes in this film, and with the visual effects, they help quite a bit. The production design (by Eugenio Zanetti) is fabulous!  I have never seen such a beautiful, mysterous, and scary house.  I won't be surprised if Zanetti is going to pick up another Oscar award for this film, he did a fantastic job!  The visual effects are also quite good, they look more realistic than your average computer-generated film.  And the acting by all of the leds (especially Lili Taylor) do a good job. The only thing that doesn't work for THE HAUNTING is the pacing, and the story.  The pacing picks up speed, then slows down, it picks up speed again, then it slows down.

A is really an evil person, intent on performing great harm in the future; B knows this but can't convince anyone else.  I heard that sigh.  But make A and B children, on the verge of adolescence, and not only is this tired formula invigorated, but it makes a great deal more sense.

The creaky old scenes where B goes to the police and either he is strangely incoherent or the police are strangely obtuse, are gone.  There is now a perfectly good reason why B can't go to the police, or indeed anyone.  Nor is there anything strange about the obtuseness of A's parents.  The rotten adult seems so commonplace that we scarcely bat an eyelid; the rotten child, who is in fact far more commonplace, we like to pretend doesn't exist.So I'm glad Hollywood took this step.  I also, for the most part, like the way the step has been taken.  B has no accomplices - he must battle A alone - and his plight is keenly felt.  There's an air of plausibility about it all.  Elijah Wood is an unusually good boy, Macaulay Culkin is an unusually bad boy; both look perfectly real.

I attended a press screening of Bowfinger, not quite sure what to expect, and although I was amused by the silly antics, I felt as if the film's main goal was to make a statement or two about Hollywood and what it takes to get a movie made.  First of all, while Eddie Murphy is in the film quite a bit, this is definitely Steve Martin's movie.  I left the film feeling that Eddie was not much more than funny set dressing rather than being a star.  Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, a washed up film director who gets a script from one of his employees that he feels is great movie material.  He soon realizes that the only way anyone will pick this film up is if he gets a big name star for the lead.  His focus turns to Kit Ramsey, played by Murphy, who happens to be the hottest star in Hollywood.  But Martin fails to get Ramsey behind the film, even though in some ways this is just the kind of script Ramsey wants.  So Bowfinger decides he'll shoot the film's scenes with Ramsey, even though Ramsey doesn't realize he's in the shot, by having his actors walk up to him in public and say their lines as if they're playing out the scene.  This works for a while, but soon Ramsey gets freaked out by all the strange behavior, and hides with his friends at the manipulative Scientology-like center, which is headed by Terance Stamp.  In the meantime, Heather Graham's character, a struggling actress, begins to sleep with every member of Bowfinger's crew, including Bowfinger, in an attempt to increase the length of her scenes.  With Ramsey in hiding, Bobby casts a look-alike to fill in for his scenes, only this guy, portrayed as the ultimate nerd by Murphy, can barely stand still much less play his scenes.  The movie goes from one silly scenario to another without having much direction with the story, all the while keeping the audience amused.  But I got the feeling I had seen all this before, with Tim Burton's Ed Wood, and once I reached the end of the film, I knew I had.  So in closing, there's nothing really new here, and not a lot of story to analyze, but plenty of laughs.  Bowfinger is an amusing and entertaining comedy, but I can't help but feel that it falls short of it's true potential.  Not a bad film, but not a great one either.

Now, I'll be the first to confess, I thought that a rehash of the cartoon in live action would just be typical Disney junk add one good actor and one decent idea, a pinch of good jokes, a pint of bad jokes, and about 3\/4ths cheesey special effects.  No story really necessary.But I was wrong.  Gadget was great.  Watching Matthew Broderick (whom I still feel is the most underrated actor in the business) as the hapless and clueless inspector was a thrill.  He brought a charm to the character that made Gadget much more than an idiot, he's just a well meaning klutz who's trying to figure everything out for his own.The actual story is about John Brown (Broderick), a security guard longing to be a police officer.  When trying to stop the evil Claw (Rupert Everett) from accomplishing a laboratory heist, Brown gets in a car accident and is blown up.  He is saved by the beautiful scientist Brenda (Joely Fisher) who was part of a project to create a new type of robocop.  An operation turns the ordinary John Brown into the multi-parted Inspector Gadget.Watching the movie was like a trip down memory lane.  All the classic items from the cartoon were there.  The Gadget-copter  and magnifying class are still in his hat, the Gadget-phone is still right IN the palm of his hand, and of course, the expanding arms, legs, and neck.  All of the memorable lines were present too.  Go go gadget ______, Wowsers, and yes, even Claw's tradmark I'll get you next time, Gadget.  Next time.Many of the jokes were either subtle, plain obvious, or even on a few occasions, hidden.  While only a few jokes really cause you to burst, you still giggle and smile at some of the lines cause that's what the movie wants; it wants you to smile through out.There was only one joke so bad that it left me very annoyed.  While taking his first drive in the Gadgetmobile, Gadget is told by the car to put on his seatbelt.  This is a Disney movie after all! the car chuckles as it rounds a corner.  Time out.  They aren't supposed to know it's a movie.  It's ok to make a joke that winks at the audience (such as the wonderful saturday morning cartoon reference) but to tell the audience and the character that it's a movie isn't funny.  It's arrogant, rude, and plain stupid.That takes us to my biggest problem the Gadgetmobile.  Beautiful, yes. Gadget filled, oh yeah!  Talkative, unfortunately.  It was impossible to get through a scene with out the car (D.L. Hughley) saying some sort of sarcastic comment to Gadget.  If the car is as new as Gadget himself, why does the car repeatedly refer to Gadget as rookie?  Apparently, Disney figured the car would be it's big popular character\/toy.  They were wrong. Personally, I liked the van that turned into a sportscar.  Now that was cool.Now while Gadget was essetially the same as in the cartoon (down to the costume), the Claw was a total opposite.  The great joy of the cartoon was never seeing anything more of Claw than his hand (almost like one of a suit of armor).  We didn't know who he was, why he was evil, or what he looked like.It took guts to explain it all in the movie.  Thank god for Rupert Everett. His over the top style made Claw the best character in the movie.  Even when his jokes were falling flatter than a pancake, you still laughed just cause of his flamboyance (and Everett is not playing Claw as a gay character, for the record).  When Brenda tell Claw that she liked him better in college obese, a devilish smile preceeds Claw's cry for junk food.  Bring on the brownies!Overall, the oddest part of Inspector Gadget was, despite the small number of laughs, you still exit the movie fulfilled and satisfied.  If anything, you kind of wish for maybe a little more direct Gadget vs. Claw.  Maybe in a sequel.  Oh come on, it's Disney.  You know they'll do it.

The film is so powerful a tale, such a primal journey into story archetypes, that people automatically reflect their own personality onto it.The theories are almost endless a racist tale of the Black man in American, a parable of America seeking an escape from the depression, a Freudian story of where the Empire State building is a phallic symbol and Denham uses Kong as his sexual release for his lust for Anne (I've always found this theory to be hysterically funny), and a tale of ecology and man's continual destruction of nature.  KING KONG is, after all, a work of art, so any of these theories can be argued.  But they tend to reduce a film that is far more complicated and powerful than a simple allegory.  All these theories people develop to explain the movie cannot finally contain it -- KING KONG is a timeless phenomenon of the richness of great storytelling.What truly makes the film work, for audiences in 1933 and today, is that it is a masterpiece of escapist fantasy and adventure that fulfills our wildest daydreams of far off tropical lands and the gleaming metropolis of 1930s New York, the two great jungles of fantasy.  Even today its relentless pace rockets viewers along.  Once Denham's expedition arrives on Skull Island, the movie NEVER lets up with thrill after thrill after thrill.  The effects look great, no excuses given -- they are a pure joy to watch.  Cooper once said that he wanted to make the best adventure film of all time, and that was his only intention.  Well Cooper, I think you damn near succeeded.
