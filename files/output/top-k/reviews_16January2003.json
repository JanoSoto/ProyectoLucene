That movie happens to be 'Showgirls'. On the back of the video cover for this film it states  The team that tantalised you with the controversial 'Basic Instinct', is back to take you one step further. Yet I feel with Showgirls the 'team' took us one step too far! This film is widely known as 'one of the worst movies ever made', with Verhoeven regretting ever touching such a project. With its weird and bitchy story, empty characters and more onscreen 'flesh' than you could ever imagine, I would have to agree with the general consensus and say that Showgirls 'is the worst movie I have ever seen'.Nomi Malone is an ambitious young woman who has moved to Las Vegas looking to break into the fiercely competitive world of 'Showgirls'. But before she can make it as a dancer, she has to be become a stripper at the Cheetah Club, where she will do more than take her clothes off. If she wants to hit the big time, she has to be prepared to do anything......For a film that I hate, there is so much I want to say as to why I feel that way about it. The actors that were chosen for this movie have a lot to do with it. Its main star is Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley), who looked very raw to the acting game. Some positives for Elizabeth include the great body she has, and the wonderful dancing ability she portrays through her character. Yet she really does look like a dumb blonde in 'Showgirls', so naive in a very evil world. Berkley has continued to act (to my surprise) in such movies as 'Any Given Sunday' and 'The First Wives Club'.Nomi accidentally makes friends with Molly (Gina Ravera) who is one of the more likable characters in the movie. She is about to graduate from Fashion College, and works backstage on showgirls. Her character has something happen to her late in the movie that even I find too hard to mention. Another likeable character is James (Glen Plummer), who meets Nomi in a nightclub that he works in. She gets him fired for 'dancing with her'. James tries to win Nomi over in his personal life, and so she can help him in his quest to be a dancer, although he fails miserably in both aspects. The problem I found with 'James' was that his character is very hard to understand. Plummer is most recognised in the 1994 hit movie 'Speed', as the Jaguar owner.Yet this film has more characters which I despised, more than I liked. Crystal Connors (Gina Gershon) is the star attraction of the Showgirls show. She is also very bitchy, evil and demands he own way every time. I am one viewer who did not like her that much. I liked Gershon much more in the '97 action movie 'Face\/Off'. Then take the character of Zack Carey (Kyle McLachlan), for the entire movie you think he is a good guy and that Nomi could do no worse than to have him as a partner, then he turns out to be just as bad if not worse than some of the other evil characters. McLachlan had a better role in HBO's 'Sex and the city'. Other people such as performers in the 'showgirls' and at the stripclubs all bring this movie down in my view.I can understand why Verhoeven took on 'Showgirls'. Its premise would have suited his sexual appetite, and you can see where he has put his own touches on it. I am certain that he would have wanted as much sex in 'Showgirls' as possible. Sadly the sex in this film became very dull after a while, with the 'female form' becoming something boring and unattractive. In fact you breathe a sigh of relief when you see the girls putting their clothes back on. Thankfully there were no references to the crucifix in Showgirls, a subject which I know Verhoeven is obsessed with.The screenplay for 'Showgirls' was written by Joe Eszterhas, whose script has some good areas. I enjoyed the whole area of the stripclub scene, and what it can involve, and how far a person will go to make it in the dancing arena. Yet there are some ordinary areas as well. The whole 'bitchy' feel came across too much, making this film for me a very evil one. Yet the story's characters were very shallow, with more of them hateable than likeable. Some of the blame has to lie with Eszterhas.All in all, 'Showgirls' is a movie I feel was a waste of time watching. It sexually exploits and degrades women, treating them as if they are not real people. It also shows dancing to be an 'eye for an eye' kind of industry, something which would distract new upcomers to the dancing profession. There are many moments in this movie that I found very hard to understand or watch, and once you have watched it you will understand what I mean. Finally, I want to mention that some of my friends have experienced what it is like to be in a stripclub. From their description, it sounded 'classy and fun'. Yet after watching this garbage, you could be turned of the by idea of ever going into a 'stripclub'.CMRS gives 'Showgirls' 1 (Bad Film) ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2003","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Three years after his success on 'Basic Instinct', director Paul Verhoeven did a movie that I am sure many people asked 'why?'

Yet for some reason we all find it hard to believe that our parents were once teenagers. In the 1985 classic 'Back To The Future', young Marty McFly gets the chance to experience what time travel is, how different his home town is in the '50s and also what his parents were like as teenagers.The year is 1985 - but not for long. Because teenager Marty McFly is about to be blasted back to 1955 aboard the plutonium powered DeLorean created by eccentric genius Doctor Emmett Brown. But when Marty accidentally keeps his parents-to-be from falling in love, it triggers a time shattering chain reaction that could vapourise his future - and leave him in the past! Now, Marty's only hope is to change history - before the clock runs out on his one-in-a-million chance to get himself Back To The Future!This film is incredibly clever in what it portrays. Its story is unique, original and different to the common time travel theme. The story for BTTF was written by Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis. Bob Gale one day wondered if he would have been friends with his father as a teenager, when he was a teenager. With that in mind the pair went about writing a script that had the element within it. Their comedic touch was exceptional, yet this story has many elements that make it very complex. The change that had to happen when Marty goes from 1985 back to 1955 is of major importance to the story or the whole project would have been a failure. It is no wonder that both men got an academy award nomination for their most intelligent script.Bob Zemeckis was coming off his success of 'Romancing the Stone' (1984) when he took on directing BTTF. His grand vision for this project made it the great success that it still remains today.  It was of great significance that Bob had Steven Spielberg as Executive Producer of BTTF. I am not surprised, as this movie would have been right up his alley. Spielberg had a busy time in the summer of '85 when BTTF was released, with another of his productions being released at the same time including the classic kids adventure, 'The Goonies'.The cast for this film was well chosen and acted. Michael J. Fox had a big work load when he took on the role of Marty McFly, as he was simultaneously doing the TV show 'Family Ties' as well. He was working days lasting 18 -20 hours. Taking that into consideration, it is the most professional performance from Fox. His character takes on so much, but Fox's performance is flawless. Fox also showed how versatile an actor he really was, learning how to use a skate board and showing off his guitar skills as well. Then there was Christopher Lloyd who was perfect as the nutty professor Doc Brown. Lloyd had a two dimensional role in BTTF which was entertaining to say the least. Marty is warned by his nemesis school teacher Mr. Strickland (James Tolkin) to stay away from the good Doctor, as he is 'Dangerous, a nutcase and will get him into big trouble'. This warning turns out to be so true.Other notable cast members include Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and George McFly (Crispin Glover) who play Marty's wacky parents. There roles called for them to be transformed into older people via the use of make-up. I like what they did for the movie, as their performances had to be different for each new part to the film. Marty's siblings include Dave (Superman star Marc McClure) and Linda (Wendie Jo Sperber), while Marty has a gorgeous girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells). I also like the bad characters in BTTF. They include people such as Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is a mean guy for the majority of the film, and picks on poor George McFly. It is fascinating to see George's son stick up for himself against a much younger Biff.  One of Biff's sidekicks happens to be a guy named Match (Billy Zane). In fact, this was Billy's first ever movie role. Bigger things were going to come for him in the future. Ironic?The idea of time travel must have been a difficult to bring to life on a production such as this. Zemeckis toyed with the idea that a refrigerator could be used as the transporter through time, but he was afraid that young children might try and hop in their own fridge and get trapped. So he decided to use a car, which was a good choice. Having it be as unique a car as the DeLorean was excellent, as the car has funny doors and looks some-what futuristic. This movie is also clever in the way that it shows what an experience time-travel might be like. What can happen to your transportation and the way you are transported, are captured beautifully in BTTF.This film is a lot of fun that the whole family can enjoy, whether it is Mum, Dad or the kids. I am not sure what genre to call it, perhaps a 'teen, family, sci-fi, coming of age, adventure story'. It is also a movie that gives hope to its viewers. I believe it is saying 'what has happened in the past or right now, might not happen in the future', which is a good a message for the many different people that watch it.  This movie has an incredibly good soundtrack (with Huey Lewis and the News smash hit - 'Power of love') and if you have access to DVDs, take a look at the 'Back To The Future' trilogy DVD, as it is one impressive pack.CMRS gives 'Back To The Future' 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film) ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I am sure at one stage or another that your parents would have said to you `I was young once to you know!'

The change that had to happen when Marty goes from 1985 back to 1955 is of major importance to the story or the whole project would have been a failure. It is no wonder that both men got an academy award nomination for their most intelligent script.Bob Zemeckis was coming off his success of 'Romancing the Stone' (1984) when he took on directing BTTF. His grand vision for this project made it the great success that it still remains today.  It was of great significance that Bob had Steven Spielberg as Executive Producer of BTTF. I am not surprised, as this movie would have been right up his alley. Spielberg had a busy time in the summer of '85 when BTTF was released, with another of his productions being released at the same time including the classic kids adventure, 'The Goonies'.The cast for this film was well chosen and acted. Michael J. Fox had a big work load when he took on the role of Marty McFly, as he was simultaneously doing the TV show 'Family Ties' as well. He was working days lasting 18 -20 hours. Taking that into consideration, it is the most professional performance from Fox. His character takes on so much, but Fox's performance is flawless. Fox also showed how versatile an actor he really was, learning how to use a skate board and showing off his guitar skills as well. Then there was Christopher Lloyd who was perfect as the nutty professor Doc Brown. Lloyd had a two dimensional role in BTTF which was entertaining to say the least. Marty is warned by his nemesis school teacher Mr. Strickland (James Tolkin) to stay away from the good Doctor, as he is 'Dangerous, a nutcase and will get him into big trouble'. This warning turns out to be so true.Other notable cast members include Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and George McFly (Crispin Glover) who play Marty's wacky parents. There roles called for them to be transformed into older people via the use of make-up. I like what they did for the movie, as their performances had to be different for each new part to the film. Marty's siblings include Dave (Superman star Marc McClure) and Linda (Wendie Jo Sperber), while Marty has a gorgeous girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells). I also like the bad characters in BTTF. They include people such as Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is a mean guy for the majority of the film, and picks on poor George McFly. It is fascinating to see George's son stick up for himself against a much younger Biff.  One of Biff's sidekicks happens to be a guy named Match (Billy Zane). In fact, this was Billy's first ever movie role. Bigger things were going to come for him in the future. Ironic?The idea of time travel must have been a difficult to bring to life on a production such as this. Zemeckis toyed with the idea that a refrigerator could be used as the transporter through time, but he was afraid that young children might try and hop in their own fridge and get trapped. So he decided to use a car, which was a good choice. Having it be as unique a car as the DeLorean was excellent, as the car has funny doors and looks some-what futuristic. This movie is also clever in the way that it shows what an experience time-travel might be like. What can happen to your transportation and the way you are transported, are captured beautifully in BTTF.This film is a lot of fun that the whole family can enjoy, whether it is Mum, Dad or the kids. I am not sure what genre to call it, perhaps a 'teen, family, sci-fi, coming of age, adventure story'. It is also a movie that gives hope to its viewers. I believe it is saying 'what has happened in the past or right now, might not happen in the future', which is a good a message for the many different people that watch it.  This movie has an incredibly good soundtrack (with Huey Lewis and the News smash hit - 'Power of love') and if you have access to DVDs, take a look at the 'Back To The Future' trilogy DVD, as it is one impressive pack.CMRS gives 'Back To The Future' 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film) ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Although I have never read a page of a 'Harry Potter' novel, I looked forward to watching 'The Philosophers Stone'.

This movie also shows me why Harry Potter is so popular with Children, as its story is directed right at that viewing audience. There is also an uncanny comparison to 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone'. Be captivated by the world's most popular mythical character, who has come to life! In a world where wizards, witches and regular folk live in an uneasy co-existence, Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and has special powers. When he is rescued from the abuse of his aunt, uncle and cousin, he is asked to attend the prestigious &#145;Hogwarts', school of Wizardry and Witchcraft. There, he meets two best friends, Ron and Hermione, who become his closest allies that have to help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths at the hands of a powerful adversary.I was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the first Harry Potter movie, but after watching I was certainly glad that I did. Its stars are well chosen, whether it be the adult or child actors.  The main man of the show was Daniel Radcliffe, who landed the envious role of Harry Potter. I found him to be a perfect &#145;Harry Potter', and a remarkable resemblance to the character that has been written and drawn. Once Harry goes to Hogwarts School, he meets both Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), who become his closest friends. In fact their friendship is one of the highlights of the movie. Having such young actors in those most important performances was quite achievement.The adult stars were also of the finest quality in Harry Potter. The star I recognised the most was Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). He was perfect for his role. He is deceptively good as Snape. Rickman is best remembered in the first Die Hard movie (1988). Harry's headmaster at Hogwarts is Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris). He is most respected at the school and has a long grey beard. Unfortunately Harris died a few months ago. Thankfully he finished his work on the second Harry Potter film. I liked Harry's adult friend Rubeus Hagrid, who saves him from his evil family. He is a funny guy, who helps Harry be the greatest magician he can be. Also look out for the funny cameo performance by John Cleese, who plays the humorous ghost &#145;Nearly Headless Nick'.The Philosopher's Stone has some fine scenes and special effects attached to it. I enjoy how we see Harry start to discover the strange world he is about to be involved in. When he gets right into &#145;Hogwarts', he is participates in the popular and important sport called Quidditch. The game that we get to see being played out is an impressive special effect. Then you have the three-headed dog, Fluffy, who scares the three young magicians many times. It is a funny character, who is an impressive computer generated image. Yet the best scene for me would have to be the vital Chess game that the children have to play when they are on the search for the mystery behind Harry's parent's death. This also shows what impressive sets had to be designed for Harry Potter. The chess set must have taken along time to complete, but what an achievement it was to see.Director Chris Columbus did a fine job with Harry Potter. I like the direction he took the audience on. It is also quite obvious that Columbus stuck very close to the unique Harry Potter story that has been written in the past, which is another positive for this film. This really is the perfect book to movie adaptation. The screenplay for the Philosopher's stone was written by Steve Klobe. While he had plenty of help by J.K. Rowling's herself, the story felt pretty accurate. The only problem I found with it was that it was a little &#145;childish' for my liking. But what can you expect from a story that is directed at children. So with most of the world going &#145;Harry Potter' crazy, buying all-sorts of the wizards merchandise, clothes and now the movie, some people have warned me of the dangerous effects that such a story can have on the world's youngsters. Witchcraft can have a bad effect on anyone, yet by having it in the hands of a child, makes it all the worse. I fully understand why some people are very weary towards Harry Potter.  What is of great disappointment to me is the Harry Potter DVD, which was not released in widescreen and seemingly only directed at children. I wish it had an adult and a child section which were separate. I look forward to seeing what the next chapter of this story will be like, as I have heard nothing but praise for the Harry Potter sequel titled &#145;the chamber of secrets'.

I really thought I was missing something because it has one of my favourite actors in it - Zach Braff on paper it should have been funny but there is only so many times seeing a lot of straight men act camp is slightly amusing and once that has worn off the appeal in this movie does too.

Quite the contrary, a premise like this is little more than a way to get people to expect a heightened level of blood and violence in the movie, it gives the special effects people an excuse to do creative things with ball hammers and to make the audience find even the most brutal murders to be `quite fun and funny,' as one IMDb reviewer put it.For some reason, however, I wasn't entirely amused to see a guy get shot in the shoulder and then the knee, and when he fails to produce a lighter when asked for a light, he gets a pillow pressed over his face and gets shot in the forehead. Granted, this was a very bad guy and had double crossed Porter (Mel Gibson, the GOOD guy) in one of the worst ways imaginable, and there is nothing that you want more than to see this guy fall, but that certainly doesn't make it amusing or even cheerful. I weep for the obvious descent of mankind into barbarism if people laughed at this. Let's consider the plot here. Mel Gibson is a criminal, and a good one at that. He and his wife are involved in crime that involves high risk and massive payoffs, and when one score results in the acquisition of $130,000, he and she and their partner, Val (Gregg Henry) begin discussing the splitting of the money. Porter calmly says that they will split it like they agreed in the first place, even though it turned out to be less than they expected, and Val and Lynn (Porter's wife) turn on Porter, shooting him in the back, taking all the money for themselves to run away together, and leaving him for dead. Five months later, Porter is recovered again and is out to get his money by whatever means necessary. The important thing here is that he is obviously so disappointed when he is forced to use violence that his shoulders droop to let us know that it's the last thing in the world that he wants, and on top of that, he wants $70,000, not $130,000. All he wants is his share, even after all he's been through. So how's he the bad guy again?Under the circumstances, it's amazing how obvious it is that presenting Porter as the bad guy is a weak ploy to get more violence into the movie, and it is a terrible sign of the state of our society that people enjoyed this. Try watching a movie like Payback and then watch Michael Moore's brilliant documentary Bowling for Columbine, you won't be so eager to root for the `bad guy' after all. On the one hand, Payback is a quality action film with plenty of car crashes and guns and killing and death, all the necessary ingredients for an action film these days, but the premise is such a weak scheme that it drastically lowers the rest of the movie. Lucy Liu, however, can be seen in a relatively early role looking sexier than anyone should really be allowed to look in a movie. I was almost depressed when it was over, she looked so good.I do not want to give the impression that Payback was a bad film or that I completely condemn it for it's ploy to get as much violence as possible into it, I just think that it could have been a much better movie if they hadn't laid so much emphasis on its violent content. Even the obligatory action movie hottie only added to the enjoyment of it all (I'm sure female viewers felt the same, of course), so it is certainly a movie that is likely to be enjoyed by action fans. The rest of you, however, may want to be a little more careful. The violence, at least at one point, is literally stomach-turning.

Furthermore, the influx of new war films of late, have led to many revisiting past ones such as the Thin Red Line.  This is where the negative comments stem from since Thin Red Line deviates so much from the other batch of war films.  It is a film more about human soul and nature, set in the backdrop of war rather than an out an out 'war' film with a set goal (e.g. secure the fort!).  For the record I have seen it with 2 other people and they didn't get it, so they didn't like it.  The Thin Red Line is like fine wine, you have to taste enough of (and a variety of) it before you can really appreciate a fine one.  And this is one.  This film is so much more. This was the first film I saw from Malick.  I have since seen Days of Heaven, and that is even more accomplished as an example of poetic moving imagery (although not as good as The Thin Red Line since it lacks the any real substance, intelligence, characterisation - merely a series of beautiful moving images, albeit extroadinary ones).  I must say Malick is an outstanding visionary. The Thin Red Line is magnificently shot with its long sweeping shots and panoramic views. Expect a certain stillness and beautiful calmness to the cinematography, which complements the somewhat philosophical nature of the film.  However Malick does make use of a more frantic camera motions and movements during the 'cleanup' of the japanese camp - but not just for the sake of it (i.e. the MTV style so prevalent today), but to emphasise the sheer terror, chaos, brutality of the battle.  It makes you question the justification and futility of such barbaric acts of war.  This is in stark contrast to his more measured thoughtful direction of the hill siege for example.  Thank goodness the more thoughtfully still and relaxed art of directing, is still around.  Others have argued the film is pretentious.  Me? I hate pretension in films if abused.  I'm an Bergman fan but even he is sometimes prone to too much 'arty poetic' talk in his films.  I hated Apocalypse Now since the actors would break in a long boring philosophical speeches at every opportunity.  The film is very overrated and not a patch on The Thin Red Line.  Many find this an enigmatic statement since I love philosophy, plus Apocalypse Now and the Thin Red Line are considered to be from the same mold of film.  For me, Apocalypse Now seemed more like an out of control binge on pointless philosophy just for the sake of it.  Not all of it really added to the film (thats just me).  In the Thin Red Line I could connect to the philosophy narratives, they revealed insights into the psyches and feelings of its characters, rather than just being there to make the film 'philosophical'.  They elicited feelings and emotions from its viewers (from me at least).  The Thin Red Line is never manipulative in the same ways that Saving Private Ryan is (a film which has its detractors from those stuck up elitist circle of critics I detest so much; but for all its negatives its still an accomplished film).Clearly Malick put his heart and soul into this film (his first for 20 years) to craft a profound, unforgettable and dreamlike piece of melancholic, poetic art.  It may not have the most realism.  It may be unconventional in both its narrative and plot, but those who understand it, those who yearn something a little different, something with a little more intelligence will find that it is a film which resonates a sense of euphoria through the mind and soul.  Incidently others who like this should try the other James Jones film 'From Here to Eternity' (53).  Not the same type of film (in a philosophical sense), although like The Thin Red Line its a war film concentrating on its characters rather than the war.  Its a prime e.g. of a Hollywood film, but its an absolutely CRACKING one with the same type of theme, i.e. a somewhat rebellious soldier who, while treated\/punished bad by the army still loves it.

Incidently others who like this should try the other James Jones film 'From Here to Eternity' (53).  Not the same type of film (in a philosophical sense), although like The Thin Red Line its a war film concentrating on its characters rather than the war.  Its a prime e.g. of a Hollywood film, but its an absolutely CRACKING one with the same type of theme, i.e. a somewhat rebellious soldier who, while treated\/punished bad by the army still loves it.  Also planned is 'Whistle' form Sidney Lumet.  Not yet released but considered part of a trilogy to From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line.  Can't wait.

Life is meaningless. `The Exorcist' clearly embraces the sanctity of the human condition and its purpose on earth, which is precisely why the possession must be as repulsive and vulgar as possible (the exact opposite of what we value). Otherwise, this challenge of faith is stick-figure and doesn't get at the essence of what could possibly offend the very foundations of the beliefs (whatever that may be) that keep us grounded in our everyday existence.

What is fun about this movie is how totally crazy that the whole idea behind it really was. However it is also interesting to once again visit the classic story that the two Bobs have been made famous for writing. There are other interesting aspects to this film, but if I tell you too much too soon, we might do some irreparable damage to the &#145;space time continuum'.Brace yourself &#150; as the most spectacular history-altering adventure of all time continues. Marty and Doc Brown have barely recovered from their first time-travelling adventure when they launch themselves once more into the space time continuum. But this time around, their history-tweaking antics in the year 2015 create a frightful, alternate 1985 Hill Valley where bully Biff Tannen is rich, powerful and Marty's Dad! Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again. But can Doc and Marty patch up the past without igniting a universe-shredding time paradox?What is most impressive about the second of the BTTF films is the story that was thought up by Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale. Many sequels are entirely different sorts of movies, but in this one, the writing pair have cashed in on what was successful in the first and cleverly integrated that into the second. If I was to tell you what the main parts to the story were, it would get both of us very confused. Another remarkable part to this movie is the way the future is presented here. The movie partly takes place in 2015, so I am sure back in the 1980s, the ideas of what the future would be like in the new millennium were quite outrageous. Yet for a film such as this they are the perfect ideas to present. Of the changes to Marty's home town Hill Valley in 2015, they include vehicles which can fly through the sky and kids who have skateboards that operate as &#145;hovercrafts'. In fact the movies special effect highlights include all of the scenes with these &#145;hovercrafts', with Marty evading a bad gang in the centre of Hill Valley. Marty and Doc Brown (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) are back in very entertaining roles. Fox takes on more than the role of 17 year old Marty McFly from 1985. He is also his son Marty Jnr., the older Marty (the father of the family) and his daughter Marlene. Fox commented that the process of being the many different characters was an arduous task, but one that makes the whole BTTF experience worth it. Yet the standout role in BTTF 2 has to be Lloyd, who as the Doc has many headaches when he goes from the future, the present and the past. He is breathless as he flies about trying to repair the damage that is caused to the &#145;space time continuum'. Many times I had to laugh as the Doc is rambling on about what chaos has been caused by the latest disaster.There are other reprising roles that are most noteworthy in BTTF 2. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is back, as is his older version in the year 2015, along with his grandson Griff, who is as much a &#145;butthead' as his grandfather was at his age. In fact going back to see Biff as a billionaire and a teenager was even more enjoyable this time around, as he is the tough guy that Marty McFly does not like. There is also Marty's mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), who is very old in 2015 and placed into a horrible life when the present is ruined by her son. I feel that she was a great choice for this role and I am glad she came back. A new actor to the cast is Karate Kid and Leaving Las Vegas star Elizabeth Shue, who is Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer. Her role in the movie is funny as she is taken on a ride that will show her future.Being behind the scenes of this movie must have been a nightmare, as you would not have known where you were from one day to the next. Perhaps that is the reason that this movie would have been so much fun to work on. I like what this movie points out about the past and the future. It shows you can go into the future and straighten out what little idiosyncrasy that you or your family might have. But it also shows what damage can be caused to the present, when one mistake is made. &#145;Back To The Future II' might not be as classy as the original movie, but what it lacks it in originality, it makes up with in comedy and humour.  With that in mind, fans of the series would have to be happy with a most satisfying of sequels.CMRS gives &#145;Back To The Future II' 4 (Very Good Film) ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Although it is not as good as the original movie in my view, the sequel &#145;Back To The Future II' is a movie that fans of the genre will always enjoy.

There are other interesting aspects to this film, but if I tell you too much too soon, we might do some irreparable damage to the &#145;space time continuum'.Brace yourself &#150; as the most spectacular history-altering adventure of all time continues. Marty and Doc Brown have barely recovered from their first time-travelling adventure when they launch themselves once more into the space time continuum. But this time around, their history-tweaking antics in the year 2015 create a frightful, alternate 1985 Hill Valley where bully Biff Tannen is rich, powerful and Marty's Dad! Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again. But can Doc and Marty patch up the past without igniting a universe-shredding time paradox?What is most impressive about the second of the BTTF films is the story that was thought up by Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale. Many sequels are entirely different sorts of movies, but in this one, the writing pair have cashed in on what was successful in the first and cleverly integrated that into the second. If I was to tell you what the main parts to the story were, it would get both of us very confused. Another remarkable part to this movie is the way the future is presented here. The movie partly takes place in 2015, so I am sure back in the 1980s, the ideas of what the future would be like in the new millennium were quite outrageous. Yet for a film such as this they are the perfect ideas to present. Of the changes to Marty's home town Hill Valley in 2015, they include vehicles which can fly through the sky and kids who have skateboards that operate as &#145;hovercrafts'. In fact the movies special effect highlights include all of the scenes with these &#145;hovercrafts', with Marty evading a bad gang in the centre of Hill Valley. Marty and Doc Brown (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) are back in very entertaining roles. Fox takes on more than the role of 17 year old Marty McFly from 1985. He is also his son Marty Jnr., the older Marty (the father of the family) and his daughter Marlene. Fox commented that the process of being the many different characters was an arduous task, but one that makes the whole BTTF experience worth it. Yet the standout role in BTTF 2 has to be Lloyd, who as the Doc has many headaches when he goes from the future, the present and the past. He is breathless as he flies about trying to repair the damage that is caused to the &#145;space time continuum'. Many times I had to laugh as the Doc is rambling on about what chaos has been caused by the latest disaster.There are other reprising roles that are most noteworthy in BTTF 2. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is back, as is his older version in the year 2015, along with his grandson Griff, who is as much a &#145;butthead' as his grandfather was at his age. In fact going back to see Biff as a billionaire and a teenager was even more enjoyable this time around, as he is the tough guy that Marty McFly does not like. There is also Marty's mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), who is very old in 2015 and placed into a horrible life when the present is ruined by her son. I feel that she was a great choice for this role and I am glad she came back. A new actor to the cast is Karate Kid and Leaving Las Vegas star Elizabeth Shue, who is Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer. Her role in the movie is funny as she is taken on a ride that will show her future.Being behind the scenes of this movie must have been a nightmare, as you would not have known where you were from one day to the next. Perhaps that is the reason that this movie would have been so much fun to work on. I like what this movie points out about the past and the future. It shows you can go into the future and straighten out what little idiosyncrasy that you or your family might have. But it also shows what damage can be caused to the present, when one mistake is made. &#145;Back To The Future II' might not be as classy as the original movie, but what it lacks it in originality, it makes up with in comedy and humour.  With that in mind, fans of the series would have to be happy with a most satisfying of sequels.CMRS gives &#145;Back To The Future II' 4 (Very Good Film) ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 January 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Although it is not as good as the original movie in my view, the sequel &#145;Back To The Future II' is a movie that fans of the genre will always enjoy.

This big budget movie version of the Mattel toys and comics is still one of my best. I never liked the toys much, but I've always loved the movie since I was about six years old. I always thought Dolph Lundgren is by far the most underrated action star alive, even though he's a veteran now and still makes some action movies, but back then he was the best thing since Arnie. First appearing in Rocky IV, this was his first major role in a movie and arguably the one that set off his career. The story is rubbish, to say the least, about He-man's collosal battle with Skeletor on the planet Eternia, and later getting sent to earth with some friends via a 'cosmic key'. Most of the action takes place on Earth, where our heroes search for the cosmic key before Skeletor and his forces can find it. Throw in the traditional idiot kids (including pre-Friends Courtney Cox), and the rest is a showdown where they almost trash the whole city. There are some great camp performances, especially from Frank Langhella as Skeletor (under loads of makeup) and Billy Barty as Gwildor, a sort of troll-like creature who found the cosmic key. The movie is mainly cue for some expensive special effects and massive setpieces, and a score by Bill Conti that is good but borrows heavily from Star Wars. The set for Skeletor's throne-room was supposed to be one of the biggest sets in movie history, which is a pity because we see so little of it. For those that don't take every movie they see on a critical level, this movie is loads of fun. I recommend you see it and take a welcome trip down yesteryear for some great, undemanding entertainment.

Made back to back with BTTF 2, BTTF 3 loses the magic that the first two movies captured, to its detriment. Marty McFly, the hero of the first two movies is now in a bit of bother as he is left stranded in back in 1955. When he receives an urgent letter from his good friend Doc Brown, Marty is told to leave him alone where he is. Marty is dumbfounded as to what he should do. However, more devastating news is about to be discovered by our junior time traveler.Fulfilling a long-time fantasy, Doc Brown has decided to live in the old West of the 1880s. But when he is in danger of meeting an untimely end, Marty travels back in time to rescue him. There is just one problem Doc Brown is smitten by a school teacher Clara Clayton that he can't think straight! Now, it is up to Marty to keep Doc out of trouble, the DeLorean running, and the past, present and future on track so they can all get back to where - and when - they belong!Again the story of BBTF 3 is a highlight to this film. Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale cleverly interweaved love and time in such a sweet and romantic way in all BTTF films. In the first it was Marty's parents, in the second it was Marty's own romance that needed help and the third focuses on Doc Brown and his love at first sight with the beautiful school teacher Clara Clayton. This movie is also placed in the old west of the 1880's, showing Hill Valley in the olden days. While I feel I have seen better western settings, the way the actors went about creating the 1880's feel, seemed accurate enough.The cast was back once again, to finish off the BTTF story. Michael J. Fox is one great actor. He once more shows why he was the perfect choice as Marty McFly. Marty has been through so much as a character that in no way would his character have been boring to portray. Again Fox had to learn how to do many of the talents that his character has to show off in the old west. Such things as Gun shooting and horse riding are just two of the new editions to the long bow that Fox had to learn. I feel for a guy like Fox who has succumbed to the horrible side effects of Parkinson disease. He has stopped doing full-time acting, which is a great shame.Doc Brown was once again performed grandly by Christopher Lloyd. He is so involved as the Doc, always warning of the dangerous effects that could go wrong if they interfere with the past or the future. Putting on his old west shoes in this movie, Lloyd does a good job in showing that he is not just able to be a wacky 1950s or 80's scientist. The way Doc gets Marty back to the future here is clever and one of the movies high points. The Doc's love interest is the local school teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen) who was again well suited to her role. I have recently seen Steenburgen in the new release movie titled 'Life as a house', a movie that I really enjoyed.Other cast members include regulars such as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who was another actor who made the transition from the first two movies into the old west beautifully. The rivalry that Tannen and the McFlys have on this film is one of the highlights of the entire series. I love it when 'Mad Dog' says to 'Clint Eastwood', `Nobody calls me 'Mad Dog', especially not some, duded up egg sucking gutter trash!'  Lea Thompson is back as Marty's aging Mother and long lost relative of the west, 'Maggie McFly'. With all of these actors taking on various roles making them incredibly interesting to watch, as you want to know how different they will be next. There is one another character I want to point out to you that I find interesting. Although he only has a minor role, Chester, the palace saloon bartender (Matt Clark) and I, have somethings in common. We share the same name oddly enough, in addition to the fact that I one day want to be a bar tender as well. Is that ironic? I feel it is!Overall the 'Back To The Future' series was and is still a delight to watch, 'time and time again'. The only problem I have with the second and third movie being made back to back, is that they each take a bit away from each other. I would have preferred a small gap between each one, so they could have both been given the attention they deserve. Robert Zemeckis is a great director and I am sure gives most of the credit for his success as a director to the BTTF trilogy. I am another fan of Zemeckis' work. I would love to have gone through the experiences that Marty McFly did with time-travel into the past and the future.  Yet I will always remember what Doc Brown says at the end of this movie `You're future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.'
