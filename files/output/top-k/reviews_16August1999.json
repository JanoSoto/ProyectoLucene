I counted the days until the first showing in my area. After reading reviews that declared it scary as hell, terrifying, and the scariest film ever, I was almost certain I was going to be frightened for the first time since watching The Omen and The Exorcist.As a young boy, who sincerely believed in the devil (thanks to my mom), the two films were especially terrifying because I truly believed what I was watching was real, or at least possible. That, I believe, is the only sure way of scaring an audience. The Haunting was such a disappointment because there was no way you were going to 'buy' those blatantly apparent special effects. Moving books and opening cabinets with fishing line is more frightening than rendered graphics (didn't those episodes of Sightings make you at least a bit more uneasy?)And that's why The Blair Witch Project appealed to me. A horror movie that feigns reality, achieving frightening effects with simplistic techniques (or so was claimed). A documentary film-crew of three investigates a local witch legend. The three disappear and a year later their footage is found (probably within a bundle of wood or under a pile of rocks opposed to a film can). Great! What a concept! But the film isn't executed properly.The film was shot with very little preparation, relying mainly on improvisation. The result is a film that is very funny, but not very suspenseful or shocking. Humor is something that can easily be improvised, but not suspense and horror. They need to be brought about by the manipulation of sounds and images, not by running frantic with a video camera.I in no way doubt the integrity of the actors' performances, but I need a little bit more than their fright to make it my own fright. Piles of rocks and bundles of wood just don't cut it. Sure, they along with the stick figures that are discovered are freaky as a preliminary, but I require something more dangerous. Phantom hands, Shadows, two points of light that could be evil eyes off in the distance, even grasping branches would have satiated. I spent most of the time scanning the screen looking, hoping to see SOMETHING.Sadly, the filmmakers give you nothing. You leave the theater unsure of what exactly accosted the three. Was it sadistic practical jokers? Rednecks or devil worshippers? A witch or malevolent spirit? I'm afraid you'll never know. I didn't want full disclosure, just enough to make me think Maybe Mom was right, the devil IS out to get me! Less is sometimes more, but nothing will always be nothing. After all, a house isn't haunted if it hasn't any ghosts.Some argue the point that if I were one of the three lost and haunted filmmakers I would be scared. No doubt. But I would just as soon be afraid of what happens in a Will Smith movie if it were happening to me.So, is this movie worth seeing? Sure. I did laugh quite a bit and any movie that does that is no waste of time. There are two very tense scenes, but they are quickly over before they can be called terrifying (the final scene is especially disorienting). Although, be warned, those likable characters soon become annoying as they get lost in deep, deep Maryland and begin fussing and fighting. You may be longing for their deaths and find what does befall them disappointing. So, see this movie, but don't tell me it'll make you afraid to go into the woods. Deliverance has already done that.Last Note Here's a funny thing you can do in a packed movie house showing The Blair Witch Project.

Steve Martin wrote it so he naturally had ears listening to him before he even got through the door.  So he goes to Imagine Entertainment and let's just pretend that Brian Grazer and Ron Howard are sitting in the board room.  He walks in and tells them the idea of filming a movie without a stars knowledge.  He tells them that it's a satirical look at Hollywood, he has written it, he will star in it and his buddy Frank Oz wants to direct it.  Brian reads the script and then likes it based on what he can see and read.  I'm sure that this idea for a film does look funny.  Especially when you have Eddie Murphy playing the dim witted brother with more naivete than a a young woman coming to Hollywood.  It all looks great.  But something happens when this film is transfered from paper to screen.  It really isn't that funny.  And most of the funny parts really are in the trailer.  It's not that this was one of the worst films ever but it certainly wasn't the best either, or even really that good.First off, Eddie Murphy is the wrong guy to play Kit Ramsey ( the star that they are going after ) in here.  There is absolutely no need for comedy in this role and I could see Will Smith playing the straight and narrow character with more conviction that Murphy.  As the dim wit however, Murphy is priceless.  So we are one for two here.  Heather Graham is perfect as the seductress who just cares about getting her career started without worrying who she sleeps with or who she hurts in the process.  Martin is good as the producer that will do anything to get his picture made.  And that is what I did enjoy about the film.  I liked how much energy and drive Bowfinger had to getting his film done.  He had a dream and he was going to stop at nothing to complete it.  So you have a message there.  And that I am a sucker for.    But the rest of the film was pretty bad.  And perhaps you are supposed to suspend all disbelief here but there is no way that this film that they are shooting would sell.  First of all they are using one camera, there are all long shots of Ramsey and they have one take to make the shot work.  They also film some of the movie off of a security camera and that just wouldn't work.  I just didn't buy it.  Maybe that is just the stuffy film critic guy coming from me, but hey, I just didn't buy it.Is this film funny?  Yes.  Is it funny more than what you see in the commercial?  Not really.  There are a few humourous moments but nothing to get you excited about.  The inside Hollywood stuff isn't really introspective either.  Producers are sleaze and cut throat and woman sleep their way to the top and stars are spoiled and sex starved.  Yea.. and?  We all know that.  You can get that just by reading an article in Premiere magazine.  So that wasn't earth shattering either.  Really there wasn't that much to like in the film.If you want to laugh this summer, go see South Park or American Pie.  Bowfinger is short on laughs and really doesn't entertain that much either.  It's not really worth the time.  This is a not so great film that had potential to be really great.  Oh well.  Maybe next time.

This story about military injustice somewhat differs from Stanley Kubrick's Paths of glory for two reasons because it shows how two G.I.'s are bullied whereas Paths of glory shows how careless the army is towards its soldiers and it deals with other themes than military injustice like adultery for example.      From here to eternity is a little ahead of its time because of its heavy references to adult themes like prostitution, alcohol abuse, violence, and murder.  Lancaster and Clift lead a terrific cast which also includes legends such as Deborah Kerr, Frank Sinatra, and Donna Reed (who is as beautiful as ever).

Okay, here we go a scene in a parking garage and the click of high heels is wonderful and provides a concrete context for a wonderfully surreal image; Jiff crossing the highway is very funny and tense (and the punchline is ironic, as its the only time we see Bowfinger ask for a second take).  The highway scene also supplies a wonderful how-the-heck did they do that? bit of stuntwork and masterful editing.The film has a couple of spots which, while not exactly deadly to the pace, certainly slowed things down the brief romantic evening Bowfinger has is the main culprit, though his own duplicity (first the wine innocent enough, then the credit card whoa!) adds a certain spin.Eddie Murphy surprised me in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, so I was prepared this time, and I think this is an even better performance.  In PROFESSOR, Murphy's Buddy Love didn't work for me at all, but the professor was wonderful.  Here, Murphy's Jiff is a marvel, and the action star Murphy plays is -- flamboyant paranoia notwithstanding -- more believable than his previous Buddy Love.  It's tough to say, because the exaggerated personality, paranoia, fetishes and quirks make the action star in BOWFINGER a little unreal anyway, whereas Jiff's character is generally rooted in reality.  Murphy plays him with honesty, sweetness, and no condescension. As the gang sits around at a restaurant and Jiff expresses gratitude that the troupe likes him just for being himself, the film's emotional core deepens, if only for a while, and for a few scenes the movie has nearly lifted to a new level, like the best of Sturges' comedies have done.  The penultimate scene in the theater is supposed to do that as well, methinks, and it comes close.I wish the casting had been uniformly strong.  Martin is okay -- I've never thought he was much of an actor, but sometimes he manages something besides his superb physical comedy -- but characters like the young hunk don't ring properly true.  For instance, the girl who plays the nymph is a bad actress, but in the scenes in which she plays real life, she is completely convincing.  In the hunk's real life scenes, he is only a little less phony than when placed before Bowfinger's camera.Overall, I would recommend the movie as a fun matinee ticket which will deliver some genuine laughs without insulting the audience.  It has memorable moments -- the ones listed above, Bowfinger explaining that all movies are made for $2000, the deepening eroticism of the kiss between the young couple during casting (and Bowfinger's discomfort and subsequent punchline)  -- but probably won't last in the public's memory or cinema's.Maybe I'm expressing too many reservations for a movie I genuinely enjoyed; perhaps I'm also expecting too much from Steve Martin's pen.  Like Albert Brooks, his pieces have a certain dependability and quality.

What this one lacks, and what the first excelled in the most, is radical originality.  After watching the first, I felt like it was filled with evil, like I never wanted to watch it again it was so scary.  But after some time passed, I learned to appreciate what Ridley Scott had created, what the movie had become; a classic.  Not only was the direction, writing, acting, suspense, casting, SFX, and production design top notch in the first, but the impacting originality.James Cameron's sequel lacks that, but it still is a very good movie.  This time, after Ripley is picked up by a ship full of marines, on its way back to the alien planet, they set out to destroy all of the aliens.  But there is more to it this time.  Plot twists and turns are great in the sequel, and the action nearly makes up for the lost suspense and scares.  Micheal Biehn is great as the marine Corporal that takes Ripley under his wing.  And Bill Paxton does a nice job as the mentally unstable private, who, in my opinion, should have survived the movie.  Overall, if you can get your hands on the director's cut, it will be well worth it.  One dislike I have about the movie, is the dumb addition of Newt, played by Carrie Henn, a nine year old girl who the marines find and are forced to take care of.  Of course Ripley acts as the loving mother once she finds Newt, and bonds with her throughout the movie.  While this fails to surpass Alien in many areas, the action field is where it come through with flying colors.  The end is not to be missed.  9\/10.

One was a tribute to his late father, a memorabilia of things that his father loved. Secondly, and to be sure I'm presuming here, for the rich, ample supply of great comic material. The idea of a sexually liberated 60s swinger adjusting to the more reserved 90s is quite amusing and what chiefly drew me in.When I saw Austin Powers International Man Of Mystery in theaters, I thought it was fantastic fun. I also found myself having to defend the film as many nay-sayers proclaimed the film moronic and lame. Many of said individuals would also recite memorable dialogue as though it was their favourite film at a later date. I also feel that the opening dance sequence was worth the price of admission alone. Soon enough, most people came round.The Austin Powers DVD is also quite an impressive example of the benefits of the new medium. Whenever I wish to show off the features of a DVD player to the uninitiated, I usually pop in Austin. It has everything from an audio commentary to deleted scenes and much more. And with repeated viewings, I can safely proclaim that yes, the humour is quite base at times, but it is fun, and after frequent showings, most of the scenes still have me laughing.Suffice it to say, I'm a fan. That is why it was so disappointing to take in the sequel to this fine satire. Going in to a sequel, your expectations are (usually) lowered. I had heard talk of a sequel not long after the first offering had completed it's run, and I'll admit that even then, I was dubious of their chances to recapture the same magic of the first film. In this case, I had been assured by a couple of people that it was good, and the trailer preview looked promising. I couldn't believe how much regurgitation was going on. But more importantly than that, the comic timing was way off. Every so-called punch line felt like a simple warm-up to a bigger punch that never came. An inappropriately long pause after each joke only drew more attention to it's ineffectiveness and lack of uniqueness. I hate to say it, but it seems as though the filmmakers weren't sure what made the first one popular, and kind of missed it on this second go.To be sure, there were enjoyable moments, but it seemed as though everything was off kilter. The story line which interested me enough to see it, involves time traveling back to the 60s to retrieve Austin's stolen Mojo. But this comic potential opportunity was passed up. It seems they could've come up with a lot more comic material on that angle, but didn't bother to explore it. And as silly as the story was, the pace of the whole film seemed transparently formulaic. Like a shopping list of what was popular in the first film, thrown in to the bag without much consideration for originality or appropriate placement.I'll admit that part of my experience for the sequel was hampered by a pack of sixteen year old girls who laughed maybe a little too much at the ultra-mildly amusing bits to the point of annoyance. But I can't say  they bothered me too much, I was literally tempted to walk out on it, but I suspect Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell stopped me. Quite ironically, Austin's quest to recover his Mojo mirrors the effort to recapture the magic of the first installment, and sadly fails. I sincerely hope it won't taint my affinity for the first film next time I watch it.

Please, PLEASE, Hollywood Take a lesson and make more of these intelligent, absorbing movies that can take your breath away in one moment and leave you with a tear in your eye the next. Conclusion Very well acted, Great plot and pacing, A movie you will want to talk about for a few days after seeing it.

Why did THE MAN, Arnold Schwarzenegger, even CONSIDER doing this Bat-Bomb?! There is absolutely NO story to this movie. Batman Forever had a very small and lousy story, but at least it had one! This was just Batman and Robin fighting Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, with some pointless love triangles which go NOWHERE, and Robin arguing with Batman. That's it. Some scenes in this movie were flat out unwatchable( i.e., the Robin Signal, the sky boarding scene, and the Batman credit card scene). It's so sad. Batman and Batman Returns, in my opinion, were the best comic book\/superhero movies of all time. Then came Batman Forever, an atrocity to Bat Fans but still a passable movie.

In fact, most of these so-called flaws can be explained in a satisfying way.Nicholas Cage's character Tom Welles could have been developed a bit more, but I think there is enough subtlety in his character to draw us into the decisions he makes later in the film.  He is not a moral giant, he obviously has some struggles as he lies to his wife about his resumed smoking habit and takes the case that drives him to the edge initially for the money. He is a complex character who loves his wife and child but also has a very dangerous career. Although he is at times very wooden, he is effective at convincing us that his struggles are mainly going on inside of him.What Tom Welles witnesses during his well crafted investigation is truly disturbing to a relatively new-jack P.I. and to the audience watching his journey into the pits of darkness. The reason that 8mm works is because it is a slice of life film that makes no apologies for its raw portrayal of its harrowing, perverse subject matter.  Most people do not sit around at the dinner table and talk about the lifestyles of people engaged in the hardcore pornography industry but nevertheless it is a subject that needs to be dealt with to some degree.Not only does 8mm reveal this gut-wrenching sub-sector of the mainstream, but it also shows us that all kinds of people contribute to its existence even the filthy rich upper crust of society. The point of 8mm is to show that these types of people and events are real and sometimes the only motivation people have for the evil they do is because they like it.I do not think Tom's wife's role was as pointless as most people think. His wife was not necessarily supposed to be a three-dimensional, well-rounded character. In a sense she represented the side of Tom that was pure and innocent, the only thing that probably kept him from going permanently insane.  She was opposite to, but served a similar purpose to the character Jezebel played by Elizabeth Pena in Jacob's Ladder who represented evil to Tim Robbins' character. As Tom descended into the evil realms of society, those cliched phone calls to his wife served a moral purpose to keep him from ingesting all that he had witnessed. She is the anchor that his soul desperately needs to tie him to the part of society he represents.The pace of 8mm is excellent as the tension gradually builds and the ugliness of the characters behind the snuff film is demonstrated.  I also agree with those who said that when Tom called Mary Ann's mother to ask her permission was a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  Rather or not you agree with Tom's actions towards the pornographers, you should at least understand them.  The story was not supposed to be a feel good movie where Tom just calls the police, the criminals get prison time, and Tom walks away from the case.  We are supposed to see how his journey affected him and the results are just as unpleasant as the things and people he was so repulsed by.What is so horrifying about 8mm is the fact that Tom Welles' quest for answers as to why these men did what they did goes unsatisfied.  To realize that there are people out there who kill just for pleasure and exploit the naive & desperate for the almighty dollar is a truly sobering experience.8mm is a film to remind us that there are individuals in this world that become victims to the evil that lurks inside of some people and that we should care what happens to them.  Granted, the answer is not for everyone to take justice into their own hands but this was just a film to spark us into some thought and action on what should be done.I do not understand how some viewers saw the ending as being happy.  In comparison to Seven where the end is clearly ominous and a no-win situation, 8mm is just as bleak.  After all, Tom Welles vengeance cannot bring back the girl who was murdered and his conscious must bear the marks of the evil he witnessed but also the viciousness that his own soul carved out.  We can all imagine the torment that Brad Pitt's character endured long after his ordeal, why can't we see the same torment that will plague Nicolas Cage's character for the rest of his life.As said before, Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular.How would you respond if taken down this dark path?
