Even when the songs are good, they often lack an interesting plot, or are filled with shallow characters or stupid attempts at comedy. So a movie like My Fair Lady that has a great story, deep characters, a terrific score, belly laughs front to back, is worth treasuring even if it isn't so much a movie as a straightforward transposition, with one notable exception in the casting, of a classic stage musical to film.That one exception makes for a lot of difference, not to mention much of the debate to be seen in this comments section. To wit, it is the issue of why Hollywood decided to replace the stage Eliza, rising star Julie Andrews, with gamine clotheshorse Audrey Hepburn.I've never really been a big Hepburn fan. Most of her screen performances leave me cold. Andrews was the voice on the Broadway album I grew up with and loved, especially her performances of Wouldn't It Be Loverly? and Show Me. Yet for me, My Fair Lady biggest strength as a movie is Hepburn's brave, hilarious performance in the title role. Even though she may not sing more than a couple of verses herself, she shines in her pantomime like a silent-film clown. She nails her Cockney character's voice so well that when she turns into a princess, it feels like a genuine transformation rather than Hepburn's reversion to form. She sells the simple joy and grace of Eliza so well, it seems to me like Hepburn was underutilized for most of her career trading cool come-hither banter with the likes of George Peppard.Otherwise, this is the same production that wowed London and Broadway theatergoers, with Rex Harrison in his signature role as phonetics professor Henry Higgins, Stanley Holloway as Eliza's amoral father, and the great Lerner-Loewe score. Even the set design and staging seems to have been transferred with little alteration. The only difference is the camera-work, which bathes in the sumptuous spectacle even if it seems a little herky-jerky with the jump cuts.The flaws are minor, though, and don't detract from the joy of one of the best screen musicals. The film slows down in the final third, yet that's also the time we get the gems Get Me To The Church On Time, Show Me, and I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face. The pace is sluggish, but there is such depth to the script its hard to mind too much. I love the many casual cruelties Eliza is put through. You simply cannot keep working the woman this way, saying her alphabet from sunup to sundown, even during meals, complains Higgins' maid. You'll exhaust yourself. People may complain about misogyny in My Fair Lady, but it's all a send-up, and of course Higgins is wearing the target. Anyone sincerely watching My Fair Lady to see men getting the upper hand in the war of the sexes is like watching a John Wayne movie rooting for the Indians.Ultimately, this is a great musical faithfully reproduced on stage, with the glorious bonus of a sublime lead performance by Audrey Hepburn. Not singing her own songs may have cost her an Oscar nomination, but I have it on good authority that the Best Actress winner that year didn't do her own flying in Mary Poppins.

There is a certain truth to this like the Raymond Chandler novel on which it is based, the plot is extremely complicated, and it requires the viewer to mentally track an unexpected number of characters--including two characters that never appear on screen, a pivotal character who doesn't actually have any lines, and a character who is frequently mentioned but doesn't appear until near the film's conclusion. There is not, however, as much truth to the accusation that the film never exposes all the killers only one killer is not specifically identified, but even so his identity is very clearly implied.All this having been said, THE BIG SLEEP is one helluva movie. In general, the story concerns the wealthy Sternwood family, which consists of an aging father and two pretty and pretty wild daughters--one of whom, Carmen, is being victimized by a blackmailer. P.I. Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer, but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendo--much of it lifted directly from Chandler's novel--and the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors, but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart, who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation; with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career; and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative, all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hit-man Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really pre-dates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degree--it would be tremendously influential--and director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight, but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story, it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience; it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones, and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue, but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems, but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film, and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending it--be it on the big screen, television, video or this DVD.

Dolph Lungren has gone on record saying that he hates this movie so much that he would be willing to kill 200 pounds of cute puppies just so he never has to see this movie again. Or wait ... I'm sorry. I got myself mixed up with Dolph again (!).On the bright side, it is amusing to see Jean-Claude handled by a totally inept director. I can imagine Albert Pyun thinking aloud right before filming this movie You know, there are a lot of flashbacks in this script, but I don't want to do anything cliché. Black and white photography would be too obvious. Changing the music or adding graininess to the film would just be dumbing it down for the audience. I know! To signify a flashback, I will just have Jean-Claude stare blankly for a few seconds! And I'll have him wear a mop head to kind of sort of look like he really has long hair! Brilliance! Now, how to get rid of earwax? I think I have a gun around here somewhere... The villain in this movie has a ridiculous voice, but is certainly ripped enough to handle Jean-Claude.

Sure, it suffered from bad acting and a poor plot, but that could have been redeemed with another, say, thirty slow-motion kicks to the face. That would leave the movie with maybe twenty minutes of plot, which could be boiled down to someone saying, Oh. I guess Jean-Claude doesn't like those guys. This script is terrible. Jean-Claude is in a movie called Cyborg that features him NOT being a cyborg. Instead, the cyborg is a woman. A kick-ass woman? That would be cool, but no.

With some powerful punches, Rocky lays out Apollo as they both fall to the arena floor. Rocky manages to get up so he wins. He is the new Heavyweight Champion of the World! And since then, Rocky has been traveling the world, fighting in numerous and rigorous boxing matches. He's appeared in commercials, TV shows, even The Muppet Show. Yes, these past 6 years, Rocky Balboa had become a household name. But unbeknownst to Rocky, a tough, gritty, southpaw boxer named Clubber Lang had been watching Rocky for 6 years and demanded to fight him. Clubber has won match after match, pummeling each opponent beyond recognition, and he desperately wanted to challenge Rocky for the title of Heavyweight Champ. Meanwhile, Paulie began losing a lot of respect for his friend Rocky and wanted nothing further to do with him, until he offered him a job. Rocky, Adrian and Rocky Jr. have moved from their townhouse into a giant mansion, and invited Mickey and Paulie to move in with them. Life was great. Then one night, Rocky would be fighting in the ring for charity. His opponent a wrestler. Yes, 6'6, 390 pounds Thunderlips!Now a match between a boxer and a wrestler is never pretty. Thunderlips climbed into the ring and wanted nothing more than to twist Rocky's head from his shoulders. The fight was on. Thunderlips proceeded to crush Rocky, slam him against his knee, slam him to the floor and jump on him, and finally chucked him right out of the ring. But Rocky bounced right back and finally played out some old school boxing. He successfully laid out Thunderlips and tossed HIM out of the ring. It was a tie and they raised $75,000 for charity; Rocky had a statue of himself dedicated to him, and as he spoke to the crowd, Clubber Lang approached him and demanded a fight, but Rocky had decided to give up the ship and retire from boxing. But when Clubber crossed the line taunting him, the fight was on. But Mickey wanted nothing to do with it and decided to leave. Rocky pleaded with him so he agreed to train him. But instead of doing it at Mickey's gym, they trained in an area filled with Rocky's fans, Rocky merchandise, and a band! Finally, the night of the fight was on. Clubber Lang was driven by anger and sheer hatred. The fight was over in the second round, Clubber had won and Rocky had lost his title of Heavyweight Champ. Worse to come, Mickey's health was failing quickly and he died later that night. After the funeral, Rocky was inconsolable. He didn't know what to do. It was then that his former opponent, Apollo Creed, approached him and offered to train him for a rematch with Clubber.So, Rocky, Apollo, Adrian and Paulie head for Los Angeles to the neighborhood gym where Apollo started out. It was in a trashy neighborhood which didn't appeal to Paulie at all. Rocky's heart just wasn't in to training. He blamed himself for Mickey's death. It wasn't until Adrian confronted him that he suddenly found the courage and the strength. So, Rocky and Apollo engage in rigorous training. They ran on the beach, swam laps in the pool, even pummeled the old punching bag. And before you can say, It's the eye of the tiger, the thrill of the fight,Rocky Balboa had once again become a lean, mean, boxing machine. And so, the rematch with Clubber Lang was on in Madison Square Gardens. Apollo gave Rocky his old red, white and blue trunks to wear. Clubber was even angrier and filled with even more hate than before. He was going to paint the arena with Rocky's brains. Round 1 Rocky had the advantage, but Clubber quickly countered with jab thrusts. Round 2 Clubber had the advantage and pounded on Rocky with numerous blows to the face. By Round 3 both men stained in sweat and blood, lunged at each other. Clubber laid out Rocky with some death-defying blows. It seemed like it was all over for the Italian Stallion, when suddenly he bounced back and pounded Clubber like there was no tomorrow and laid him out with an vigorous, angry blow. The fight was his! Rocky Balboa was once again the Heavyweight Champion of the World! After the fight, Rocky and Apollo do a little sparring for old time's sake.Well, what can I say about Rocky III? It was good. Just as good as the 1976 original and 1979 sequel. Sylvester Stallone is back as Rock, and is as good as ever. Talia Shire is back as Adrian, Burt Young is Paulie, Carl Weathers is Apollo and Burgess Meredith is Mickey. All turned in great performances. This was sadly the last movie for Mickey, even though he makes a short appearance in Rocky V. Too bad, Mickey was a great character and Burgess Meredith was so good as him. We have Mr. T, famous boxer and future star of The A-Team as Clubber Lang, and WWF wrestling champ Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips. This one has a lot more fighting than the last two movies. It focuses more on Rocky boxing than Rocky outside the arena. And Eye of the Tiger  is an awesome song! So, if you've seen Rocky and Rocky II, by all means, see Rocky III! Sly Stallone wrote and directed. Then see Rocky IV and V. I recommend Rocky III.

And so, the rematch with Clubber Lang was on in Madison Square Gardens. Apollo gave Rocky his old red, white and blue trunks to wear. Clubber was even angrier and filled with even more hate than before. He was going to paint the arena with Rocky's brains. Round 1 Rocky had the advantage, but Clubber quickly countered with jab thrusts. Round 2 Clubber had the advantage and pounded on Rocky with numerous blows to the face. By Round 3 both men stained in sweat and blood, lunged at each other. Clubber laid out Rocky with some death-defying blows. It seemed like it was all over for the Italian Stallion, when suddenly he bounced back and pounded Clubber like there was no tomorrow and laid him out with an vigorous, angry blow. The fight was his! Rocky Balboa was once again the Heavyweight Champion of the World! After the fight, Rocky and Apollo do a little sparring for old time's sake.Well, what can I say about Rocky III? It was good. Just as good as the 1976 original and 1979 sequel. Sylvester Stallone is back as Rock, and is as good as ever. Talia Shire is back as Adrian, Burt Young is Paulie, Carl Weathers is Apollo and Burgess Meredith is Mickey. All turned in great performances. This was sadly the last movie for Mickey, even though he makes a short appearance in Rocky V. Too bad, Mickey was a great character and Burgess Meredith was so good as him. We have Mr. T, famous boxer and future star of The A-Team as Clubber Lang, and WWF wrestling champ Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips. This one has a lot more fighting than the last two movies. It focuses more on Rocky boxing than Rocky outside the arena. And Eye of the Tiger  is an awesome song! So, if you've seen Rocky and Rocky II, by all means, see Rocky III! Sly Stallone wrote and directed. Then see Rocky IV and V. I recommend Rocky III.

With some powerful punches, Rocky lays out Apollo as they both fall to the arena floor. Rocky manages to get up so he wins. He is the new Heavyweight Champion of the World! And since then, Rocky has been traveling the world, fighting in numerous and rigorous boxing matches. He's appeared in commercials, TV shows, even The Muppet Show. Yes, these past 6 years, Rocky Balboa had become a household name. But unbeknownst to Rocky, a tough, gritty, southpaw boxer named Clubber Lang had been watching Rocky for 6 years and demanded to fight him. Clubber has won match after match, pummeling each opponent beyond recognition, and he desperately wanted to challenge Rocky for the title of Heavyweight Champ. Meanwhile, Paulie began losing a lot of respect for his friend Rocky and wanted nothing further to do with him, until he offered him a job. Rocky, Adrian and Rocky Jr. have moved from their townhouse into a giant mansion, and invited Mickey and Paulie to move in with them. Life was great. Then one night, Rocky would be fighting in the ring for charity. His opponent a wrestler. Yes, 6'6, 390 pounds Thunderlips!Now a match between a boxer and a wrestler is never pretty. Thunderlips climbed into the ring and wanted nothing more than to twist Rocky's head from his shoulders. The fight was on. Thunderlips proceeded to crush Rocky, slam him against his knee, slam him to the floor and jump on him, and finally chucked him right out of the ring. But Rocky bounced right back and finally played out some old school boxing. He successfully laid out Thunderlips and tossed HIM out of the ring. It was a tie and they raised $75,000 for charity; Rocky had a statue of himself dedicated to him, and as he spoke to the crowd, Clubber Lang approached him and demanded a fight, but Rocky had decided to give up the ship and retire from boxing. But when Clubber crossed the line taunting him, the fight was on. But Mickey wanted nothing to do with it and decided to leave. Rocky pleaded with him so he agreed to train him. But instead of doing it at Mickey's gym, they trained in an area filled with Rocky's fans, Rocky merchandise, and a band! Finally, the night of the fight was on. Clubber Lang was driven by anger and sheer hatred. The fight was over in the second round, Clubber had won and Rocky had lost his title of Heavyweight Champ. Worse to come, Mickey's health was failing quickly and he died later that night. After the funeral, Rocky was inconsolable. He didn't know what to do. It was then that his former opponent, Apollo Creed, approached him and offered to train him for a rematch with Clubber.So, Rocky, Apollo, Adrian and Paulie head for Los Angeles to the neighborhood gym where Apollo started out. It was in a trashy neighborhood which didn't appeal to Paulie at all. Rocky's heart just wasn't in to training. He blamed himself for Mickey's death. It wasn't until Adrian confronted him that he suddenly found the courage and the strength. So, Rocky and Apollo engage in rigorous training. They ran on the beach, swam laps in the pool, even pummeled the old punching bag. And before you can say, It's the eye of the tiger, the thrill of the fight,Rocky Balboa had once again become a lean, mean, boxing machine.

This totally original and fun film boasts an all star cast and tells the tale of a woman who was raised Catholic but works in a planned parenthood clinic, and who feels like her religion is empty and her faith in God has only let her down. Yet she is handed down a duty that, at first, seems ludicrous. Just go to a church in New Jersey on the day of its centennial celebration.God told Noah to build a big boat because it was gonna rain really hard for a long time. He told Adam and Eve not to eat a certain kind of fruit. He told Abraham to kill his kid and offer him up as a gift on an altar. God tells people to do weird things, and his requests really seem like they make no sense at all, but everything he asks is for a reason. I'm glad Kevin Smith didn't make Bethany's mission into some big, grand obvious thing, but rather a strange, simple thing that at first seemed ridiculous, and had to be explained little by little.The script is full of dialogue that is nothing but love of God, especially the dialogue of Rufus and Metatron. The two rebellious, clueless, and sad angels, Loki and Bartleby, begin as beings who really love and miss their relationship with God. Loki is angry and hoping to regain the favor of God by slaying wicked people (He used to be the Angel of Death) and Bartleby, once a peaceful-minded angel who convinced Loki that what he was doing was cold blooded, becomes so angry and resentful that God won't ever forgive angels like he does humans, pretty much turns into Satan Jr., willing to make war with God even though nothing he does will ever get him back into Heaven.Of course, Jay and Silent Bob are on hand, singled out to be prophets for God, at least for a while, and they accompany Bethany on her journey from Illinois to Jersey. En route, they meet Rufus, the 13th apostle who was never mentioned (surely there are plenty of apostles and heroes of the Bible who never got their limelight); Serendipity, an abstract who became semi-solid and stripteases to New Edition tunes!!!; and the stinky Golgothan Dook-Demon (not for weak stomachs!!!) The cast includes Linda Fiorentino, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Jay and Silent Bob, a hysterical Jason Lee as Azrael, a demon who likes to play from all sides; and the always wonderful Alan Rickman, whose elegant presence blends in curiously well with characters who cuss and smoke weed. It all goes together in this wonderful, strange, but very sincere love letter to organized religion and its many flaws.More importantly, though, it's a love letter to God, not to a faction, a church, or list of man-made by-laws, but to God him\/herself, containing what should be common sense knowledge that we all have, but sadly do not. That makes Kevin Smith a very perceptive voice for a generation who wants to know and love God without all the man made stuff getting in the way...Watch it without prejudice.

As the film begins, Vito is receiving business guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again? The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to 11 doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of oscillating dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting\/distancing, control\/lack of control, benevolence\/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) zoom out from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a historical family saga as a crime or gangster film.

His influence on cinema - his technique and style in particular - have inspirationally spawned countless copy cats, most famous of which have been the likes of John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Wes Craven. He instilled famous images in our heads - images that will scare future generations of showers, birds, ropes and airplanes. Many wouldn't even know he has done so. His films are instantly recognizable around the world. What is most fascinating, is that he could overwhelm you with suspense without much to it, for he didn't need blood, gore or very loud music to get the audience scared, because it was the timing, subtle camera movements, use of light and the extraordinary music that made audiences around the world tremble. Hitchcock's vision set standards much like David Lean set it for the epic scope and John Huston for adventure - much like Spielberg and Lucas would set it for the imagination. 'Vertigo' is the perfect example of his gift to the world. It is his masterful and complete compilation of the standards that people recognize him by.It is about a San Fransisco Private Eye named Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) who following a police chase, where his partner falls to his death off a building, develops a fear of heights and is forced to retire. To his surprise, he is one day approached by an old friend from school who begs him to investigate the strange happenings of his wife Madelaine who he claims is possessed by some ghost. Initially hesitating, Scottie soon is personally drawn to Madelaine's situation, following her around San Fransisco. However, nothing prepares him for what lies ahead when lust, deception, conspiracy and murder unravel in a complex plot, in which he is determined to find the truth.I believe 'Vertigo' was Hitchock's definitive master work, because none captured his brilliant touch quite like it. Everything that you could throw into a suspenseful thriller was in it. Above all the story was the most engaging. The actors were flawless. The music and cinematography were splendid. None captured the essence of 'fear' as powerfully as it did. It is in my opinion a PERFECT film. From start to finish, you can't take your eyes off the screen. 'James Stewart' is perhaps the most mesmerizing and commanding presence ever to grace the silver screen. You could feel his anger, excitement, fear and sadness through his famous eyes and gestures. The scenery of San Fransisco was magnificent and truly added to the already overwhelming atmosphere Hitchcock is famous for. Music was never over indulgent and suited incredibly well with the happenings on-screen.What really impresses me is that few films have had as many plot twists and turns that 'Vertigo' showcases. You would learn something new every time you'd watch it. None have such an engaging plot as does this beautiful, atmospheric Mona Lisa of a film.Recommendations are useless. SEE THIS MOVIE NOW if you haven't done so. Forget about our contemporary film directors that excite you. No film in my opinion excites quite like Hitchcock's definitive masterpiece 'Vertigo'. It has everything you could hope for. This is a classic in every meaning of the word and should be a definite addition to everyone's video library.Hitchcock...........we miss you.....................forever!

The story starts with inventor Randall Peltzer(Hoyt Axton) makes his way in a Chinese shop and tries to sell one of his inventions, comes across a sweet creature called a mogwai, he wants to take it home to his 23 year old son Billy(Zach Galligan), who is an out of luck bank teller. Billy also has a crush on his co-worker Kate(Phoebe Cates). Billy is excited when he receives the mogwai. He then names it Gizmo. He is then told that he must follow three rules. One don't expose it to sunlight, two don't get them wet, three never feed it after midnight. What happens when Billy breaks all three rules? I enjoyed the movie it was very creative and show why its important to take care of your animal.

Anacondas are among the most ferocious -and enormous- creatures on Earth, growing, in certain cases, as long as 40 feet. Unique among snakes, they are not satisfied after eating a victim. They will regurgitate their prey in order to kill and eat again.' Documentary filmmaker Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) & her boyfriend Professor Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz) decide to make a documentary on an Amazonian tribe called the Shiroshama also known as the 'people of the mist'. Along with a cameraman named Danny Rich (Ice Cube), a sound-man Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) & his girlfriend Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer) who's a production assistant & an English host Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde) to present the documentary they set off in a boat along the Amazon river to reach the tribe. On their travels they come across a sinking boat & a stranded man named Paul Sarone (Jon Voight) who claims to be an ex-Catholic priest but is now a snake hunter (don't ask me how someone would make that sort of career decision!). Things start to go wrong for the expedition when Cale is injured by a wasp (again, don't ask) & ends up critically ill. Sarone says he knows the area & can show them a shortcut so they can get Cale back to civilisation quicker & proper hospital treatment. On the way more bad luck follows as they stop to check a run down houseboat possibly for fuel when Mateo (Vincent Castellanos) their Captain, mysteriously disappears. Eventually Sarone reveals his plans & forces everyone on board to help him capture his ultimate prize, a rare 40+ foot long Anaconda that he feels will be worth millions of Dollars. Tension on board heighten, Sarone lures the Anaconda into the open with some bait but only succeeds in getting Gary killed & eaten. As the crew continue to be reduced in number the survivors begin to question who is hunting who exactly...?Directed by Luis Llosa I throughly disliked Anaconda, where did the $45,000,000 go exactly?! Certainly not on the script by Hans Bauer, Jim Cash & Jack Epps Jr. which is atrocious, it's about as clichéd as you can imagine, it's filled with unlikeable stereotypical characters, it has ridiculous plot devices & coincidences to keep the already thin material going, it's unoriginal & predictable as well as taking itself far too seriously. The whole set up is poor, wouldn't Cale notice a huge poisonous wasp in his scuba mask? I think I would. Why does Sarone want to capture this Anaconda? He is never given sufficient motivation in my opinion especially since he murders people without a second thought to achieve this goal. If Anacondas hunt by heat, which is clearly mentioned during the film, why does the Anaconda go for a dead monkey on a line behind the boat? An hours old dead monkey isn't going to give off any heat while being dragged through the Amazon river, is it? I hated the ending as well. I could probably go on all day... The dialogue is terrible & just doesn't work for me, having said that the performances definitely don't help which are all uniformly awful. Even though she is given very little to do Lopez still manages to mess up & is simply awful. Voight puts in an seriously over-the-top performance, that pony tail, that awful accent & what's that facial expression all about Jon? Ice Cube is about as good an actor as someone named Ice Cube could be, the guys as wooden as the Amozonian rain-forest itself. The only decent actor Eric Stoltz is totally sidelined in bed with an injury for most of the film & is ignored. The character of Westridge is ridiculous too as he constantly plays golf on the boat, he must have an infinite supply of golf balls somewhere. Even if it is another example of the poorly written dialogue I did like his line the last time I was in water like this I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum though. The special effects on the Anaconda itself are mixed indeed. Some of the CGI shots look awful, as do some of the animatronic ones. While others look alright, as I said their a mixed bag. Forget about any gore as there isn't any apart from a quick throat operation involving a knife & empty pen. Generally speaking most of the Brazillian locations look nice & it has decent production values throughout even if there are various mistakes like the famous waterfall goof which is embarrassing to watch as is the changing pick-axe\/axe sequence at the end where Danny kills the Anaconda. There is a really cool shot where the Anaconda opens it's mouth in preparation to swallow someone & the camera is placed in the back of it's throat looking out of it's mouth as it stretches open & few shots of the thrashing, burning still alive Anaconda at the end looks quite good as well, but that just isn't enough to save Anaconda from being a blatant & terrible Jaws (1975) rip-off with a large snake instead of a large shark. Anaconda sucks on all fronts, simple as that. There isn't anything I can recommend about Anaconda & I will let the ever awful Jennifer Lopez's (Anaconda was one of her first starring roles) character Terri have the final word this film was supposed to be my big break... but it's turned out to be a big disaster - never a truer word spoken!
