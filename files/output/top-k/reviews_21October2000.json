'Legends of the Fall' is a great, moving film.  In case you're wondering whether I am just someone who loves this type of film, in fact, I hate overly sentimental films.  In my book, for a film to be considered overly sentimental, the emotions usually feel manipulative and calculated, which in 'Legends' is not the case.  Movies such as 'Forrest Gump,' Saving Private Ryan,' or 'The Green Mile' all fit this category.  These are the types of films that usually answer all questions one could possibly ask about the character's intentions and emotional conclusions, which 'legends' most certainly doesn't do.  For all of the people who laughed throughout this film, my guess is that you probably either went in wanting to hate the movie, or you just weren't paying attention to it.  The performances are very subtle.  The film does not rely on long explanatory speaches (leave those for Spielberg) to show the characters emotional developments, but on quiet, honest portrayals of very realistic characters.  None of the characters are saints and none are devils (once again, you can leave that to the Spielberg school of film), they are flawed, and make difficult, realistic decisions.  The story is about characters who hold in their emotions, which drives the characters into their own tragedies that moves along the dark, and very, very engaging story .  The film is a sweeping epic, with epic music, and all the other attributes that could bring people to criticize it for being overblown, but it is an epic story, so why the (curse word) not?  The acting is great, the story is moving and engaging and the charaters are well-thought, complex, interesting, and most of all, very human (just watch how Aidan Quine makes the character that could have easily been the stereotypical enemy\/anti-hero into one of the more moving, relatable characters in the movie).  I found the relationships between the brothers and with the father to be quite beautiful, realistic and moving, and the real underlying theme of the movie (not Julia Ormond's character). On top of all this, it has some of then best photography seen in  the last twenty years.  Yes, the movie does ride the line between melodrama and somber epic in a few scenes, but I never felt it slip into that trap. In fact, because of that, I found the film extremely clever and brave. I am disheartened that the deafening cynicism that is moving through America has found its way onto this board and is unjustly criticizing a very good film.

It shows in unflinching detail why Mark is still one of Australia's most notorious criminals, as well as the fact that something is seriously wrong with Australia as a society. Australia likes to tell itself that it is the greatest country on Earth, and every citizen has everything they need. The mere existence of Mark Brandon Read, as well as the confirmable facts of his life story, is a direct slap in the face to people who buy this myth.Kudos are also due director Andrew Dominik. A lesser director would have portrayed Read in more glowing terms for fear of angering the man himself, but this film elevates itself by sticking to the facts between certain birthdays that occurred and can be verified, portraying them with an objective viewpoint. The film is neither pro-Chopper nor anti-Chopper. It is just, as the title indicates, Chopper.The film covers three distinct periods in Read's lifetime. The first is one of his early incarcerations as a young man. Here, a gang war turns nasty when Chopper kills a rival in the daily power struggles that constitute prison life. Anyone who thinks that Quentin Tarantino has a clue about depicting violence of any kind, leave alone an ear-removal, would be well-advised to catch this section of the film. The accuracy with which stab wounds and impromptu amputations are depicted is really quite frightening. The second part of the film depicts Chopper on the outside, and it is interesting to see how just because he doesn't live behind bars anymore doesn't mean he doesn't behave like a caged animal. The third phase shows Read back in prison, closing the film with a rather despairing shot of Read, as impersonated by Eric Bana, sitting el solitary in his prison cell. They say crime doesn't pay, but this is the first film to make the message so hard-hitting.The only real problem of Chopper is that it doesn't go into enough detail about who the characters are and why they do the things they do. Everyone in the Australian audience knows who the title character is, but the other characters, and by extension the reasons why Chopper kills some of them, are left vague. This is okay if you know who these people are and what they did, but to understand that under any other circumstances, you would probably have to read the books. It is also important to remember that a lot of the characters in the films are combinations, rather than renditions, of different people from Chopper's accounts.Still, if I can go through an Australian film and only find a single fault, it's amazing. Chopper is highly recommended as long as you don't take it seriously (as some of its critics seem to be doing).

To those people I say this, You are a fiend and you are not worthy of good things like stuff that is good. This movie was brilliant!!! It was so damn funny. I think that you have to have a good sense of humour, perhaps too much expectation came from the all star cast. Maybe if it were a bunch of no name rubbish actors, the movie would've had better success, either way, screw that, the movie made me laugh my ass off! I mean, everything was so silly!

We all agreed this place had a strange magic in it, a redeeming quality that went beyond its 100 acre site and went deep into your subconscious. We were grinning the minute we went in, and we were still like that 12 hours later. We went 2 days in a row to the park, and we were delighted.  OTOH, we all think Disney World is the blandest, most artificial theme park ever.Tarzan, Pocahontas, Hunchback and everything else after Lion King seems to be like Disney World to me. Excess, excess (CGI animation, hyper-expensive songs by worn-out semi-pop stars (Phil Collins? how can you have Elton John do Lion King and then Phil Collins???), an ultra-expensive cast) doesn't mean a good movie. Beauty and the Beast is a hauntingly beautiful movie. Lion King is a very good movie. Tarzan is not.The only hope I still have is that the Disney Studios sometimes release very, very good stuff (Toy Story 2 has to be the best animated feature I've ever seen in my life). Sadly, people seem to ignore them in favor of the commercial, safe features.I can only hope my kids can still see Disneyland the way my grandmother, my mother and myself saw it. Yet, Disney wants to corrupt this park, too. Have you seen California Adventure, the new park opposite Disneyland?

It has everything action, humor, good performances by its cast, and spectacular special effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in one of his best films as a man who finds out that something's not right. He's a construction worker named Quaid, who lives on Earth and keeps having dreams about the planet Mars. He goes to a place called Rekall, where the doctors there implant their clients with memories of the most unusual but exciting sort. Quaid wants to have memories implanted that have to do with Mars. But just as he's about to take his trip, he goes berserk, and finds out that he's a victim of mind-tampering. A couple of sociopathic killers under orders from the dictator of Mars try to do him in. Quaid escapes, however, and travels to Mars to confront the evil Martian dictator as well as his hencemen. Total Recall is one amazing thrill ride that is spectacular to look at. The special effects are incredibly awesome. The movie deservedly won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects as a special achievement award, but I would have let it compete in the category with two other movies. If it had, I think Total Recall would have still won the Oscar. Schwarzenegger is terrific in one of his best roles; Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside are effective as the main bad guys (the dictator of Mars and his right-hand man); Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone are fetching as the women of Quaid's life (one good, the other bad). Director Paul Verhoeven knows how to direct great action, and he also knows how to work with great special effects teams. He's done a good job with sci-fi material as he has proven with two other science fiction movies that were very good RoboCop and Starship Troopers. Total Recall is an outstanding science fiction movie.

The infamous cameos are a time capsule of genius that will never be duplicated.  If you've seen it, you love it.Best scene?

The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby's Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful _Pather Panchali_. This film has got to be the best ever made about, well, life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film, Zhang Yimou's _To Live_, which was good, but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. _Pather Panchali_ feels as real as life itself. To be sure, it contains great moments of sadness, but, for the most part, it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman, maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over, has no teeth, and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family, and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful.I could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see a DVD version of this film, and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy, and only Criterion could do this effectively, which is kind of disappointing, since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay; a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film, along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course, I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture, so I was able to catch a little, but there is so much I don't know. A commentary track on a DVD would help me understand the film better, and thus love it even more.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"21 October 2000","score":"","review":"  This is another vastly underrated film that is dismissed by everyone but is actually an excellent movie. It is a very powerful nuclear horror film, a sort of Japanese Dr. Strangelove. Ships are being mysteriously destroyed at sea for no apparent reason. A group of Japanese researchers travel to an island which is located near where all these strange things are happening. The natives believe that it was a demon who has been doing all these things but the real creature who did these things is soon found out. A dinosaur that mutated into a 50 meter monster by US H-bomb tests appears on the island. The creature is dubbed Godzilla after the demon that the natives said was responsible for this. The military wants to destroy him because of his destructive abilities while Dr. Yamane, a palientoligist wants to study Godzilla. Godzilla makes his way to Tokyo where he causes ghastly destruction quite like that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tokyo lays in burning hellish ruins, millions are dead. Poor Godzilla, who only destroyed Tokyo because of his curiosity, is put to death by a horrible weapon of destruction called the Oxygen Destroyer, a device created by the tragic Dr. Serizawa, who wanted to keep the weapon a secret. This film is dismissed as a cheesy sci-fi movie by virtually everyone because of the quality of some of the sequels but that is WRONG. This film is actually quite good. Godzilla is a very tragic character, a misunderstood monster who can't help but be destructive because he was born that way. Dr. Serizawa is also quite tragic, a scientist who was pressured into using a weapon which he knew couldn't be used and is forced to destroy himself. . This film was very powerful when it was released ten years after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and right at the start of the Cold War and the film is still powerful today. Especially haunting is the song O Peace, O Light Return. sung by a choir of girls and shown over footage of Tokyo in ruins and bandaged, bleeding, radiation poisioned people suffering in a hospital so crowded it's patients are all on the floor. Clearly, this masterpiece shows that weapons of destruction are a very bad thing and could easily destroy mankind if we don't put an end to them. The US version wasn't all that bad and the scenes with Raymond Burr actually mix in well and those who didn't know that there was a Japanese version without him couldn't tell the difference. Still, the Japanese version is the best and helps show the message against weapons in a way the US version just couldn't. My rating ***** out of *****.
