[{"date":"24 December 1999","score":"","review":"  Hello. I am Andy. From the intro alone, and a hilarious one, this movie really captured me and I am now totally into it. Jim's performance is so convincing that I'm beginning to appreciate Andy now. I really luv this movie and I can't imagine why some critics would attack this movie. CNN (Showbiz) Online called it The most disappointing film of 1999., while Entertainment Weekly named it the No. 1 movie of the year.Though a 50\/50 chance of good and bad reviews, they all admit that Jim Carrey's performance is a revelation. I agree and I hope he won't be overlooked by the Academy (Oscars) again. Otherwise, everyone will never stop thinking about why Jim has been snubbed. Speaking of Jim, how will he act at the Oscars 2000 and the controversial 2000 MTV Movie Awards? Either way, I wish him luck. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 December 1999","score":"","review":"  Hello.
