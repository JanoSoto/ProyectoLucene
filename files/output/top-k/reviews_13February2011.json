[{"date":"13 February 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1998 film Rushmore is categorised as a comedy drama and stars Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams. The film was written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson. Wes Anderson also directed the film and I can't praise him enough for his impressive and unique talents. This was the second film he directed and I feel that Rushmore is his finest production in comparison to all of his films. Credit is also due to Jason Schwartzman in his debut acting role. He was only 18 when Rushmore was released and he is still acting to this present day. I can't imagine how surreal it would have been for him to co-star with Bill Murray in his first debut film, especially as Schwartzman was the lead role.Schwartzman plays the character Max Fischer, a rather unusual 15-year old schoolboy who attends the prep school Rushmore. He is failing in most of the classes at the school but manages to balance his rebelliousness by being very active in extracurricular activities. Very early on in the film Max ends up getting expelled from Rushmore resulting in him to joining a local high school. This is pretty much a downward spiral for Max as Rushmore was his life. Before his exclusion he becomes close friends with Herman Blume (Bill Murray) a local wealthy man who has two twins in the same class as Max. Max and Blume form an unlikely friendship and Max also finds himself obsessed with the new elementary teacher at Rushmore Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). However, he soon discovers that having these friends much older than himself leads to him becoming involved in unexpected dramas. I love the soundtrack throughout the film. The music felt very original, which is something I hadn't noticed before. I will definitely have to purchase the soundtrack for this. The songs featured in the film are mainly late 60's\/early'70s British pop and rock music, and they all cogitate Max's current mind- set. I was most impressed with the originality of the film in general. It's difficult to compare it to anything else as there isn't anything quite like Rushmore. I think one of the biggest shocks was discovering Owen Wilson started his career as a writer and then gradually made his way into acting. He has only ever co-written along with Wes Anderson but it's been a while since they collaborated as writers and I would be very keen for them to start a new project together in the future. The first time I watched Rushmore I wasn't that involved with the film and felt it was rather mediocre. I had heard great things about it and I felt rather disappointed with my perception. However, it wasn't until recently that I rewatched Rushmore and made a really strong connection with the film. I also paid more attention to the plot which certainly helped me follow the film and receive a better understanding. It makes me want to watch more films I didn't enjoy first time viewing. I also strongly recommend to film buffs out there. It's not the type of film any average Joe would enjoy simply because it's so original and also quite dated now.

This is the last film directed by Quentin Tarantino that have to see (as of 2\/11), as I've seen all the other films he helmed. This is surprising, actually, as I love most of his films and I really love blacksploitation movies--and this film would seem to combine the two. That's because the film Pam Grier--a lady who made a name for herself in the early to mid-1970s blackspoitation genre. However, after seeing the film it really seemed like a Taratino film from start to finish and, aside from the presence of Grier, had nothing to do with blacksploitation. Now to me, this was a bit of a disappointment--as I really wanted to see the over-the-top crazy action for which Grier was famous in the 1970s--in such films as Coffey and Foxy Brown. This film, while violent, is much more refined than these earlier films...and I would have loved to have seen more of this sort of action.Grier plays the title character--a lady who uses her job as a flight attendant to bring in money to the country to Samuel L. Jackson--who plays a guy who deals in illegal guns. When the authorities catch her, she has the choice to either play their game or go to prison--but she decides on a third course of action no one else anticipated.In addition to Grier and Jackson, there are a lot of other interesting characters in the film. To me, the most interesting is the laconic guy played by Robert Forster--a bailbondsman who is instantly taken with Jackie. He's older but handsome--and I appreciate that the whole interracial aspect of their relationship is never really discussed or exploited--they are just two people. Also of some interest is the violent guy played by Robert DiNero (imagine that!) and the rather annoying (deliberately so) character played by Bridget Fonda (in a nice change of pace).Overall, it's a good film but also one that can easily get overlooked because some of the director's other films before and after were so memorable (and simply better). Following Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and preceding Kill Bill was tough and by comparison Jackie Brown is an inferior film--though one its own it's a very good film--one that is still well worth seeing provided you like violent films. To me, it lacks the style and uniqueness of these other films...but it's still quite good.By way, there are alternate spellings for blacksploitation--also commonly written as 'blaxsploitation'.

Its influences were immense, especially in the way adventure films were made after 1933. Moreover, over the years, it naturally became the yardstick against which monster movies would be measured. Directors Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack's achievements with King Kong still remained astonishing till today, nearly eighty years since its theatrical release.Though it might appear that way, King Kong is not a full-fledged monster movie; it's essentially a love story between two beings, a beauty-and- the-beast tale set in the hostile jungle of fictional Skull Island. While the plot is at times testing the limits of credibility (dinosaurs and all), the special effects take center stage when necessary. King Kong was one of the first films to use stop-motion technology, a technique still practiced today by the creators of the popular Wallace And Gromit series. The effects might seem too jittery and B-grade by today's standards, but they still continue to astound viewers new and old alike. Acting is above average, but that's not a surprise. Kong is the star of the show, and though he appears like a miniature clay model with varying heights in most of the scenes, there's a human side to him that can only be felt with the most subtle of observations. The score by Max Steiner set groundbreaking standards in film music in the early 30s. Nearly four-fifths of King Kong is accompanied by Steiner's music, driving the film along with a deep sense of adventure and mystery. King Kong has one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history - the final battle atop of the Empire State building that leaves a despairing Kong to futilely defend against a fleet of attacking warplanes. Moreover, unforgettable sequences such as the duel between Kong and a T- Rex are stuff of schoolboy fantasy. Though personally, I prefer Peter Jackson's extended version of King Kong because the characters are developed with more verve and feeling, the 1933 original take is undoubtedly a masterpiece of its time.GRADE B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.

Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction.When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's.What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying.Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole?A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre.

The rating sky-rocket and Beale is given a free-reign to rant about anything he wants, but his best friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) quits when he see the company are exploiting him because of his descent into madness. Within the upper of epsilons they only care is profit and ratings, with the President of the network, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Head of Programming, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) leading the charge. They turn the news into a showcase for the Mad Prophet and turn into a circus. At the same time Diana starts to develop more edgy programming, include a program about revolutionary terrorist group and embarks on an affair with Max.Paddy Chayefsky writes a really clever screenplay about the battle between the management of program makers and the owners of media outlets only care about profit and ratings. Program makers want to have independence, owners care about advertisement and sponsorship. They turn news from being an important institute and public responsibility to something cheap and commercial. It is still an issue now with the idea of tabloidisation and the decline of Chinese Walls (where the editorship and ownership are meant to be separate from each other). Network would be even more poignant because the nature of television today is looking to make cheap reality shows looking for different types of people (e.g. a open homosexual and a homophobe) just so they could exploit an easy conflict. There is no intelligent in this type of TV and ownership looks for a easy profit and shock rather then quality, which Diana and Hackett represented.The acting is great, particular from Finch, Holden and Duvell. Chayefsky wrote a very witty script with great but the actors made it even better by playing their roles absolutely seriously, they don't know they are funny. Finch is really believable as a man descending into madness and being used. He certainly did deserve an Oscar nod, but I do think Robert De Niro and Holden were very deserving to win as well. Duvell is an actor I generally really like and he was effective as a corporate man who only cares about profit. Dunaway's character is intelligent but cold character, always looking for ways to increase ratings regardless of ethics or taste, like getting a psychic to predict the news and treat news like it was entertainment.Sidney Lumet is a great director, he knows how to handle drama and made sure that Network was a fast, well pace film with no moments of boredom.

Night Shamalayan's The Sixth Sense, one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that The Sixth Sense didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed The Sixth Sense creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's Exorcist and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in The Sixth Sense  there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with The Exorcist is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking. The mother and son relationship is the heart of the film when the dorsal spine is Dr. Malcolm Crowe's back-story with Bruce Willis in one of his most underrated out-of-character performances as a mysterious doctor who tries to help and assist Cole in this painful experience, which seems to be a two-ways therapy inhabited by a profound will of redemption. Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock (Psycho being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young débutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder The Sixth Sense made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films.The Sixth Sense is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big Wow at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because The Sixth Sense still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.

Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock (Psycho being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young débutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder The Sixth Sense made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films.The Sixth Sense is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big Wow at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because The Sixth Sense still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"13 February 2011","score":"","review":" The amazing climax of the 90's have enriched our cinematic knowledge with extraordinary movies, from the immersion into a parallel universe named The Matrix and the unforgettable heart-breaking Green Mile, to the powerful social commentary of the pre-millennium consumerist society in American Beauty and Fight Club, not to mention the resuscitation of the legendary Star Wars saga &#x85; and still, only one movie managed to get so rapidly and deeply rooted in Pop-Culture M. Night Shamalayan's The Sixth Sense, one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that The Sixth Sense didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed The Sixth Sense creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's Exorcist and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in The Sixth Sense  there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with The Exorcist is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking.

However I thought it was interesting, as in an interesting adaptation of the NES game. But the movie just could not hold up. It seemed to drag on for longer than it should have, and it seemed rushed. The intro is just wrong, it starts off as animated and the animation itself is jerky and scratchy. Then the film states that dinosaurs used to rule the world, which is true; but then it states the idea of the possibility of another dimension in which the dinosaurs thrived. Well that certainly was interesting, but it just did not feel like Super Mario Brothers. But then again I had to watch this movie with an open mind. So as we all know Mario is the older brother, and Luigi is the younger brother. The movie brought a good adaptation of the two but then the movie progressed. I noticed how Mario wore a green jacket but had a red shirt, and also noticed that Luigi had a green hat, but a red shirt on. The colors just felt a little mixed to me. So then we meet Princess Daisy...well wait a minute, wasn't the point of Super Mario Bros. to play as Mario and rescue Princess Peach? It just astounds me how they could have messed that up. So more useless plot filler happens and then Luigi winds up asking Daisy out on a date, but not just a date a double date with Mario. Now I reveal this little bit of the movie for one main reason...Daisy tells the two brothers that she never really knew her family after being questioned by the rock around her neck. She also states that she was abandoned and left at an orphanage. So then Luigi shocked goes into detail about how Mario has always been there for him and then he states basically that Mario had raised him and been his Father, his Mother, etc. It just blows my mind. So basically what this movie is claiming is that Mario and Luigi are not brothers, but Father and Son? This just is incredible. Back to the overall movie, The Academy Award Winning Actor, Dennis Hopper played Bowser or King Koopa in this movie, and I have to say it was an interesting choice, but it just did not work for me. There is only so much Hopper could do to try to make the character work, but he just cannot accomplish this goal. Yoshi also makes an appearance but it was just a disappointment so I shall not go into that. All and all this movie is just a disgrace, its interesting I agree, but other than that, its awful. The perspective is just odd, and the characters do not portray the characters in the game even half as good as they should have. It just seems rushed and half-baked. This movie should have given us insight into the Super Mario Brothers, this movie should have been for the fans, and yet its just another failure. I do not recommend this movie at all, I do however recommend it for the fans, as they will be sure to get a kick out of it. Anyone else, just avoid this movie at all costs because it is certainly not worth your time.

Not a theater but a courtroom...where the drama appears to combine thrill with sympathy and where illusion is so daring to achieve the mockery of the law. Yes, that is what we encounter in one of the greatest cinema productions, WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION.The movie can boast of several top aspects including its powerful and thrilling source novel by Agatha Christie, a top notch British crime writer, the vibrant power and magnetism of Billy Wilder's masterful direction, the overwhelming acting by the cast, the secret riddles that seem to intensify while one after another is seemingly being divulged --- in short, the movie that, by itself, deserves to represent a special genre --- a courtroom drama --- and deservedly so. Let me focus on certain points in this review, particularly the factor that, perhaps, has the greatest impression on the viewers the performances.Agatha Christie tended to dislike seeing her works on screen. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, however, was an exception from that rule. Why? Most probably thanks to performances. It is right to say that a mockery of Agatha Christie's genius would come out if it were not for the stunning acting given by the cast. The specific nature of this drama and the stagy location intensify that cry for perfection in acting skills. Who, if not the very best cast, can supply us with the necessary thrill, with the stunning curiosity, with the awesome desire to figure out the still existing 'banana peel?' And thanks be to the cast for supplying the drama with inevitable vitality of skills and desirable generosity of talents.As there are flawless performances from the female and male cast, let me remain a gentleman in this review and say honestly Ladies first. Yes, the female role needs a special attention from the viewers here because it is MARLENE DIETRICH. I agree with the people who claim that this is one of her very best roles though I have not seen all of her films yet. You as a viewer wait for her impatiently to turn up as you did wait to hear Garbo talk in Anna Christie...and after all these moments...there she is...with her sex appeal and coldness, with her magnetizing power combined with lustful sweetness. And this unforgettable voice! Ms Dietrich seems to reach the heights of genuine acting and almost illusive bliss. You tend to believe her character in the exact moments you are supposed to believe her...Her sex appeal goes beyond her memorable song I may never go home anymore! the accordion play, great legs and kiss. Just one note more not to spoil much...there is one image of, or rather one moment with Ms Dietrich that will leave to speechless. Unforgettable! Meanwhile, the male actor who absolutely stuns is Charles Laughton who appears here with his wife Elsa Lanchester (the hilarious nurse Miss Plimsoll). Basing his character's interpretation upon his real-life lawyer renowned for distracting witnesses, he does a terrific job as Sir Wilfrid, the barrister. His character has other appeals than the one by Ms Dietrich he is a distant gentleman devoted to his work, the one who tends to substitute cocoa with brandy and useless infections with pleasant cigars...doctors and over-caring women are a true nuisance for him...they deprive him of every solid pleasure. Mr Laughton is given some basic moments in the film, some witty moments as well (consider the joke about hats), some crucial points of the drama and he manages like a true genius. The sequences with pills and a cigar are unforgettable once you notice them and find the right interpretations.All other cast do splendid jobs as well though it is difficult to analyze all in one review. A necessity, however, appears to be a mention of Tyrone Power, whose role of Leonard Vole here is his final role for the film. He portrays the accused, the prisoner himself who is seemingly the only one who can shed a new light on this tragic riddle... He is the man absorbed by his secrets, distracted at certain moments and indefatigable to defend his motives. The moments he depicts tragic hopelessness are worth attention. Tyrone Power, unfortunately, died soon after he played this role. Among the character roles, pay attention to memorable acting by Una O'Connor who portrays Miss Janet McKenzie, a witness in need for hearing aid...The true revelation, however, about this film is the most unpredictable ending you can ever encounter on screen. The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture, you will not divulge, to anyone, the secret of the ending..., the viewers have heard at the end. An interesting fact is that the principal cast members themselves did not know how the film is going to end until the last days of filming when the ending was presented to them.Keep alert, keep keen...draw near and give your attendance until the final hour, until the final moment. That is what the courtroom is all about...in this very spirit, that is also the major pleasure of WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION...and it is really worth not to know what will happen finally until you yourself decide to see the film. But believe me...it is well worth waiting for since the long wait finally leaves you rewarded, astonished, surprised and shocked at the last moment. 10\/10I have seen this wonderful film thanks to my friend's help and recommendation and I am most grateful to him.

His character has other appeals than the one by Ms Dietrich he is a distant gentleman devoted to his work, the one who tends to substitute cocoa with brandy and useless infections with pleasant cigars...doctors and over-caring women are a true nuisance for him...they deprive him of every solid pleasure. Mr Laughton is given some basic moments in the film, some witty moments as well (consider the joke about hats), some crucial points of the drama and he manages like a true genius. The sequences with pills and a cigar are unforgettable once you notice them and find the right interpretations.All other cast do splendid jobs as well though it is difficult to analyze all in one review. A necessity, however, appears to be a mention of Tyrone Power, whose role of Leonard Vole here is his final role for the film. He portrays the accused, the prisoner himself who is seemingly the only one who can shed a new light on this tragic riddle... He is the man absorbed by his secrets, distracted at certain moments and indefatigable to defend his motives. The moments he depicts tragic hopelessness are worth attention. Tyrone Power, unfortunately, died soon after he played this role. Among the character roles, pay attention to memorable acting by Una O'Connor who portrays Miss Janet McKenzie, a witness in need for hearing aid...The true revelation, however, about this film is the most unpredictable ending you can ever encounter on screen. The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture, you will not divulge, to anyone, the secret of the ending..., the viewers have heard at the end. An interesting fact is that the principal cast members themselves did not know how the film is going to end until the last days of filming when the ending was presented to them.Keep alert, keep keen...draw near and give your attendance until the final hour, until the final moment. That is what the courtroom is all about...in this very spirit, that is also the major pleasure of WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION...and it is really worth not to know what will happen finally until you yourself decide to see the film. But believe me...it is well worth waiting for since the long wait finally leaves you rewarded, astonished, surprised and shocked at the last moment. 10\/10I have seen this wonderful film thanks to my friend's help and recommendation and I am most grateful to him.

While these are important elements of haunted house horror movies, 'The Haunting' have very little of these. Yet, is one of the most important and brilliant haunted house movies of all time.In 'The Haunting' you don't have ghost running around, or beautiful women constantly cowering in the corner, in fact, the viewer sees very little, yet this movie still contains an eerie presence and still manages to keep interest alive and still grabs attentionThe main character in this film is Eleanor Lance - played by Julie Harris - who is shy, insecure young woman with very little to live for; she has spent most of her adult life caring for her now late mother and being bullied and belittled by her older sister. As a result, it is hardly surprising that an offer by Dr. John Markway - played by Richard Johnson - to take part in an experiment in the supernatural in a supposedly haunted house grabs her attention, offering her the somewhat form of escapism she so desperately needs. What makes this film so gripping is the fact that, even when there is only dialogue on the screen, it is still interesting and watchable. Also, even with the absence of any visible scares an eerie feeling is still present; the long corridors, the long periods of silence,and the many shadows seen.The character of Eleanor has not had a good life, and coming to Hill House helps her to escape and try something new. The forces in the house however want her, and at first she battles then eventually gives in. She experiences fear from the house yet at the same time enjoys the attention it offers.This film is a drama as well as a horror, as we follow the emotional and social well being on Eleanor.

Mitchum's mistake was falling for her. He couldn't help himself and the result ties him to both Greer and Douglas. Douglas, because Mitchum took his money and didn't report he had found Greer, living it up in Mexico among other places. Greer, because Mitchum and her had the affair and he cannot seem to sever the tie that binds them. What makes OUT OF THE PAST wonderfully noir is the crackling dialogue, twisty plot, and a cast to die for. All the parts, from the leads to the supporting players, are expertly cast, especially Greer, who uses her looks and phony innocence as tools to manipulate and destroy. Mitchum has a multi-faceted hero who uses his smarts in an attempt to stay one step ahead of Douglas and Greer, ultimately doomed because of his association with them. While trying to outsmart Greer, Mitchum underestimates her skill at maneuvering out of a sticky problem when he believes he has her in a trap that is fool-proof involving the shooting of his slimy partner (Steve Brodie) who was wanting the $40,000 as hush money to keep her location from Douglas. With Virginia Huston as Mitchum's other love interest, Ann(he was hoping to start over with her, running a gas station in her small town), Richard Webb as a local in love with Ann and who believes Mitchum's Jeff is bad news, Paul Valentine as Douglas' hook(Joe, also working a scheme with Greer's Kathie, probably another flunky she was working over) and Dickie Moore as deaf and dumb kid who works at Jeff's gas station, a marvelous cast can work wonders.

Unfortunately, the past has a way of resurfacing, and interesting enough, Jeff accepts that he will have to once again meet Whit(Douglas) and Kathie, not putting up a fight because he knows it would be futile. And, perhaps, Jeff knew during his conversation with Whit's hood Joe that his fate could end grimly. I like Mitchum's scenes with Huston because she represents the ideal candidate Jeff would like to substitute for Kathie, because she has no agenda or ulterior motives. The idyllic area near Jeff's gas station, the stream, hills, rocks, is the perfect substitute for the urban city and the crime that thrives within such a setting.

Director Burton rightly re-does Batman as a solo night-time crime fighter, with Gotham City as his bleak but monumental backdrop, haunted by the memory of his parents' slaying in front of his childhood eyes, even re-writing Bat-lore by making their assassin The Joker in an earlier incarnation as a young hoodlum before his metamorphosis.The story centres on both the main protagonists desire for beguiling photographer Vicki Vale which makes for a straightforward conclusion as both fight for her atop a church tower, rather than giving the Joker some world-domination schtick. In fact if it wasn't for the fact that both the mains are costumed characters, the plot would play very well as a realistic crime-thriller.But we do love those costumes and all the accoutrements that go with them. The Batmobile is sensational, especially when it cloaks itself in armour and while I missed the old Bat-cave, director Burton I think draws a pretty good line at what he allows in from the comic-book origins. Certainly Robin wasn't missed.As for the casting, I really like Michael Keaton as Batman \/ Bruce Wayne. His gamine appearance at first seems too slight to be our muscle-bound hero until you realise it's his costume which beefs him up. Kim Basinger is fine too as Vicki Vale, sexy but credible. I have long had a problem with Jack Nicholson's acting, all ham and no bone. Here he gets all the best lines and gets to dominate screen-time and while he gets some terrific scenes in which to extemporise (pretty freely I'd say), he never looks like the Joker should and in fact just looks like Jack Nicholson with a manic grin, in fact just make that Jack Nicholson.Better I focus in the plotting and cinematography which are both excellent. The story moves forward credibly at all times plus I liked Burton's sly references to other Hollywood classics like White Heat (very apposite, here), Vertigo and even Gone With The Wind, which in itself reveals the director's ambition. The set design is eye-popping, Gotham looming out if the blackness like El Greco's Toledo, while the interiors of Wayne Manor and Vicki Vale's apartment are sumptuous.On other fronts, I didn't feel Prince's music belonged in the movie at all. Quite who thought pop's fey-est character tied in with the darkness here is anyone's guess. All that said, this was a terrific update of the Batman character, wiping the slate clean from the camp 60's version.

Director Burton rightly re-does Batman as a solo night-time crime fighter, with Gotham City as his bleak but monumental backdrop, haunted by the memory of his parents' slaying in front of his childhood eyes, even re-writing Bat-lore by making their assassin The Joker in an earlier incarnation as a young hoodlum before his metamorphosis.The story centres on both the main protagonists desire for beguiling photographer Vicki Vale which makes for a straightforward conclusion as both fight for her atop a church tower, rather than giving the Joker some world-domination schtick. In fact if it wasn't for the fact that both the mains are costumed characters, the plot would play very well as a realistic crime-thriller.But we do love those costumes and all the accoutrements that go with them. The Batmobile is sensational, especially when it cloaks itself in armour and while I missed the old Bat-cave, director Burton I think draws a pretty good line at what he allows in from the comic-book origins. Certainly Robin wasn't missed.As for the casting, I really like Michael Keaton as Batman \/ Bruce Wayne. His gamine appearance at first seems too slight to be our muscle-bound hero until you realise it's his costume which beefs him up. Kim Basinger is fine too as Vicki Vale, sexy but credible.
