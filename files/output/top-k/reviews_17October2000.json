I remember saying several times while watching the movie that Dr. Gonzo, is a man that is too big to deal with let him be. Johnny Depp sounds like Elvis at times and a weird caricature full of every drug you can imagine. He wheels and whirls through this movie never stopping to experience the world of sobriety. They say their looking for some piece of the American dream, if they would get off the drugs maybe they could realize they are the ones to be feared and loathed for freaking everyone out(including themselves) on their drug binge.

However, I definitely do not think that the film is as good as the Scientology cult shills are making out, either. If anything, I would describe this film as being hopeless in its mediocrity. It also makes me wonder how a man who wrote something this stupid could possibly have formed a new deathcult... oh wait, the Christian bible is even worse.Anyway, the plusses of the film are extremely simple. I went to this film wanting to be entertained, and apart from a few moments where the film drags, I was entertained. The leading lady was wonderful to look at. I'd repopulate the planet with her any time she asked me to, that's for certain. The special effects were nowhere near as bad as I was led to believe they were, either. Sure, they were patently unconvincing, but I didn't mind that at all.The bad points of this film? Well, the acting is attrocious, even from Travolta, which leads me to believe that the real problem was with the script rather than the actors. Instead of trying to verbatim copy a portion of the novel, it would have been more prudent to make an independent story of its own and, should that prove more successful, get a more talented writer to translate the actual novel to the screen. Then there's the Psychlos, who seemed to be about as menacing as a schoolteacher and about as frightening as a child abuser. No offence meant to other people who've been victims of either, but once you take away their weapons and technology, these guys would really have been as weak as a Catholic inquisitor without an army.Another low point of the film is that we are never given enough opportunity to form an attachment with any of the characters. Their dialogue is recited in a very contrite and false manner that prevents any connection, making it very hard to want to root for the cavemen. Firing at the week-long training in jump-jet flying is a bit weak... obviously they had to make some kind of shortcut like that in order to get the story moving ahead. Shooting at Terl's constant superiority pose is another weak move on the part of critics, as this is exactly what weak little bullies do in order to reassure themselves of their position. Trust me, I should know, having recently confronted one of the teachers of my boyhood and suddenly finding that I outweighed them by ninety pounds (not because I am fat, either). It's just a self-assuring pose, guys, it's actually a nice touch.All in all, I give this film two out of ten. It's entertaining both in spite of and because of its stupidity, and that's more than what I can say for such films as the Blair Witch Nazi Propaganda, which still makes me want to perpetrate violence upon the directors because I value my own freedom to think.

Horror movies are interesting because so many of the films that were scary back then are not anymore.  I rented this film with my girlfriend promising her an old cult horror movie.It turns out I didn't remember the movie at all.  I'm not even sure I'd seen it.  I think the film just resonated in my memories because people spoke about it and so many sequels were made.  If I had remembered it, I would have never rented it again.The film has the look of a low budget made-for-tv-movie.  My girlfriend and I were reading the DVD box trying to figure out if this was ever shown in a theater.The film was surprisingly funny.  Special effects of 'the horror' seemed to have been made by hanging red lightbulbs out a window.  The acting consisted of two emotional states; talking in a normal voice or dramatic yelling. Every character had to yell at some point in the movie, even if it seemed inappropriate.  One character would make a loud and convincing point only to beaten down by the overacting (in other words, the other character yelled more)of another.  It was very funny.It was never truly scary.  I can't say I was entirely bored.  I was kept interested the entire time because I kept thinking the next scene would be the one that made this movie famous.  Also, we laughed quite a bit.  That famous scene never came.  Just more laughs.The only positive thing I credit to this film is that it may be the first film to use what have now become cliched haunted house conventions; bleeding walls, muck in the plumbing, etc.  In reality, I am only speculating about this.  Perhaps this was cliched even then?  Yet, it's the only way I can figure that this movie had any popularity and spawned sequels.If you rent it, do so to see a film artifact that has not aged well. Also, rent it with a bunch of friends to laugh.  But if you want to rent a horror classic and hope to be scared, rent the Shining or the Exorcist.

Previous comments have compared it unfavourably to Disney but this seems unfair - it is clearly a separate product, darker and more cynical than the works of that other company. The song by dragons Devon and Cornwall -  'Without You'- stands in stark contrast to, say, the sentiments of 'You and Me Together' in Disney's Oliver and Company. Neither could I imagine Ruber, with his particular vein of sarcastic villainy, appearing in the products of that more family centred studio.The weakest individual moment, for me at least, is anachronistic. Devon and Cornwall sing about their mutual hostility, and their song is animated with some twentieth century props and in-jokes. This is a jarring note in a film which otherwise tries to maintain some sort of historical integrity. It is funny but creates a disruption that is hard to forget. (More acceptable is the 'Do you feel clucky?' line later on)There has been some criticism of the animation quality, and it does seem to vary. Some of the movements of animals, in particular, seem jumpy at a distance. However balancing out these weaknesses are such scenes as the evocation of a cold morning, when Kayley hears of her father's death, and Ruber's splendid witchcraft scene.Overall the film suffers from being underwritten - one wishes more time was taken in filling out character and incident before the final attack on Camelot. Cayley and Garrett fall in love too  easily, while Devon and Cornwall (delightfully witty and charming creations) have too little to do. And what happens to Merlin? He's reduced to flying a bird. It's a shame as other supporting characters, like the Gryphon and the axe chicken are very well judged, and completely memorable. More unforgivable is the character of King Arthur, who is just bland.On the plus side, this is still a good film, utterly free of pretension. Ruber's magical creation of his henchman is a highlight, a demoniac sequence that is quite thrilling, a brilliant musical set piece that moves the plot forward, sparking huge suspense. His creations are delightfully original in themselves, frightening and intriguing in equal measure. Watching it again I was reminded of how little of this quality of real wonder appears in another non-Disney animation, Prince of Egypt - a much more favourably received work, and far more earnest in tone.This Arthurian adventure can be quite revealing in comparison when taken this as an unofficial sequel to The Sword in The Stone, throwing stereotypical Disney values and methods into greater relief.

That's a myth created by a generation of film writers and professors who enjoyed popular culture when they were kids and were concerned as adults to elevate it to the status of art to befit their newly acquired pretensions. Psycho was a good suspense film that became slightly less good as it went on. There is no reason to regard it as sacrosanct. Better films--Wages of Fear to name one in the same genre--have been remade without cries of sacrilege. Why not Psycho? Van Sant seems to treat it like a seedy crime story, which captures an aspect of the novel's atmosphere that the first film doesn't. But he's hampered by his strange resolution to chain himself to that film.The worst mistake is the reuse of Herrmann's score, which fit perfectly there and doesn't fit at all here; the composer would have been the first to see that. The Hitchcockian moments of surprise--Marion's boss in the crosswalk, Mother in the shower, Mother on the landing, etc.--are all muffed. Polanski or De Palma could have brought them off but for some reason Van Sant can't. In the crosswalk scene we're unclear for some reason that Marion isn't where she's supposed to be. In the shower scene the curtain obscures Mother's entrance a little too much. In the landing scene she appears a little too early, giving the effect of an unintentional glimpse into the wings. The dogged re-creation of the original shot sequence might--perhaps--be meaningful in a different type of film (e.g. a parody, or a remake of a film like October that seeks to make an opposite political point); here it was effort wasted. In the dramatic scenes I couldn't have told the difference, and in the murder scenes, where Van Sant could have established most clearly the distinctiveness of his approach, he can only repeat tricks that were designed to work once. In the first film the house was not as well used as it might have been because of the limitations of the set. Sticking to the original storyboard, Van Sant is able to go only a very little beyond that But I thought it a fair movie.

That's a myth created by a generation of film writers and professors who enjoyed popular culture when they were kids and were concerned as adults to elevate it to the status of art to befit their newly acquired pretensions. Psycho was a good suspense film that became slightly less good as it went on. There is no reason to regard it as sacrosanct. Better films--Wages of Fear to name one in the same genre--have been remade without cries of sacrilege. Why not Psycho? Van Sant seems to treat it like a seedy crime story, which captures an aspect of the novel's atmosphere that the first film doesn't. But he's hampered by his strange resolution to chain himself to that film.The worst mistake is the reuse of Herrmann's score, which fit perfectly there and doesn't fit at all here; the composer would have been the first to see that. The Hitchcockian moments of surprise--Marion's boss in the crosswalk, Mother in the shower, Mother on the landing, etc.--are all muffed. Polanski or De Palma could have brought them off but for some reason Van Sant can't. In the crosswalk scene we're unclear for some reason that Marion isn't where she's supposed to be. In the shower scene the curtain obscures Mother's entrance a little too much. In the landing scene she appears a little too early, giving the effect of an unintentional glimpse into the wings. The dogged re-creation of the original shot sequence might--perhaps--be meaningful in a different type of film (e.g. a parody, or a remake of a film like October that seeks to make an opposite political point); here it was effort wasted. In the dramatic scenes I couldn't have told the difference, and in the murder scenes, where Van Sant could have established most clearly the distinctiveness of his approach, he can only repeat tricks that were designed to work once. In the first film the house was not as well used as it might have been because of the limitations of the set.

John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton play two air traffic controlers who are trying to get one up on each other by either guiding the planes in to perfection or sleeping with each others wives! Both actors plat their roles very well as do the actresses who play their wives. I wouldnt say it was rib ticklingly funny but what it lacks in laughs it makes up for in an interesting story and good acting.

These issues have been explored more times than anyone would like to remember, but in 'Rebecca' they find voice through Rebecca's ever haunting and ever intrusive presence within the house. Indeed, her memory has found itself to be present in every element of the film, including the sea of course, the letters, statuette's and most importantly every character makes her return into the present. Maxim is the only break in the chain as he wants to forget his past, repress it to the deepest recesses of his mind, whereas he finds this impossible due to her memory almost controlling his future on behalf of those other characters opposed to his ideal.This film begins as a sort of fairy tale in respect to the hauntingly relevant opening shot (again recalling a memory) with its long, slow camera zoom crawling along the twisted driveway to Manderlay, all of which is shadowed by the voice of Joan Fontaine who speaks in a sad and sombre tone attributing to the kinetic effect of this scene with her own dreamy commentary.Although there are many scenes of this film that deserve great merit, and it is still mysterious to me how Hitchcock's directorial maturity and hauntingly simple visual deftness was never recognized by the Academy in terms of best director, the other immortalised scene featured in this film is that which finds the culmination of the relationship with Mrs. de Winter and Mrs. Danver's which takes place, unsurprisingly in Rebecca's bedroom. Again the memory of Rebecca creeps into reality through the cruelty of Mrs. Danver's and the symbolic representation of the sea. The effect of the presence of Rebecca from this scene on firmly roots itself into the present- I won't spoil this entirely brilliant movie more than that.This is, to put it simply, an absolutely unblemished film and in my opinion, is in no doubt Hitchcock's greatest achievement (perhaps in part due to the innocently beautiful Joan Fontaine, not that the other actors aren't great also) or in the least stands next to his other greats 'North by Northwest' and 'The lady Vanishes' - although I must admit I haven't seen some of his films. Hitchcock's use of expressionism (most notable in his earlier films) was not pioneered by him but he certainly brought it more prominence than it had with the average movie go-er. Do yourself a favour and watch this movie NOW!
