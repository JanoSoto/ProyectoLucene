But of course! Show me one fairy tale which does not have gigantic holes in the story.  But see, that's not the point.  The ending it's not the point.  Though in this case it is enormously important and overwhelmingly powerful.  You never judge a fairy tale by it's credibility, do you?  Magic or dragons or robots-- What's the difference, really?It was Frank Darabont, working on a Stephen King movie, who said that Kubrick makes movies from his head, from his cold intellect, while Spielberg makes them from his heart.  Thus Spielberg can convey emotions better, while Kubrick's intellect never stops for mercy.  Both men are masters of their craft. Kubrick's movies have always been controversial -- never unanimous praise, never unanimous disdain, never a financial success; hell, even Blade Runner was a flop! And now it's a cult movie, and even 2001 was sharply criticized in its own time and it needed decades to be condsidered an absolute classic. So in this sense, A.I. follows the Kubrick tradition, but this time it has more heart.  Spielberg made a tribute to Kubrick, who would have hated it if Spielberg, as a good slave, made the movie exactly as Kubrick wanted.  I think Kubrick expected no less, than Spielberg adding his own idea, personality, emotions into the picture.Making this movie was a very brave thing to do, it required a serious decision because it is such an ungrateful subject.  There are few directors in hollywood who can dare to make such a film - of course, this is the serious fault of Hollywood's intellectual dictatorship.Also, as a parent, it really made me unexpectedly, extremely aware of my children, even more than I was and thought possible, and every time I look at them, get annoyed or angry, or just watch them _be_ I am reminded of A.I.  I think the pure existence of my children will not let me forget A.I. for a long long time, maybe until they grow up.  Still, I will be relieved, that this emotional burden will hopefully be lifted from my shoulders 30-40 years from now.

This movie brings up the interesting moral question of whether humans can ever truly come to terms with machines being smarter and more advanced then them. And whether those machines will ever be human. Can the two mix and live together, or will they always stay separate with boundaries wide as an ocean in-between. When I first saw this movie my immediate reaction was that, although it is done very well in terms of acting affects and plot, something was just not right. More precisely, it was hard to understand just what to set your response to. Is this a touching family drama, as it starts out and ends, or is it a futuristic science fiction? At first this sudden change in atmosphere in several parts of the movie made one feel discomfort. Then thought kicked in and I started to wander. Could it be, perhaps, that this in its very stile attempts to show the clash of the robotic and human societies? Is the discomforting feeling that so many (judging by the reviews) felt meant to be there to show how the world of the humans and robots is not to be the same? Another aspect that troubled me was how the in the movie the robots were shown as totally good and peaceful, while the humans, with their emotions and love and hate and conflicts of spirit, where shown as the wicked ones. The only robot that had his hard edge points was the main character, who, of course, was supposed to be the one programmed for emotion as well. This aspect, whether accidental or purposeful interested me because, if one thinks about it. One needs emotions to hate. With ought emotions one can't really do anything that is based upon them which includes ambition, love, hate, determination, jealousy, exc. The last aspect I would like to discuss is the ending of the movie which so many did not like. There is a conflict of opinion in my mind about it. On one hand it was unnecessary and I would have probably preferred the would be ending during which I am sure everyone was ready for the movie to end. On the other hand it is an interesting concept that the popularly proclaimed `aliens' would use this boy that always wanted to have a soul to learn about the soul.

I'm sorry to see that one of my favourite directors of all time has now jumped on the Gus Van Sant bandwagon (I'm referring, of course, to that normally amazing director's stinker of a Psycho remake). If there was anything good to be said about this movie, I would tell you.

While this makes it plausible to argue that it is in fact a documentary, it is actually proof that Ben Stiller is one of the best satirists working in movies today.  Okay, so it's a narrow field; but he is still a funny, funny guy, especially when you eliminate the Farrelly brothers, who would be lost without their casting director.Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a famed male model, a man so shallow that he's actually convex.  Crushed at being eclipsed by a younger rival, he is recruited into a shadowy plot to become a brainwashed assassin for the international clothes cartel.  It's kind of like The Manchurian Candidate as imagined by Details magazine.Naturally, much is made of Derek's dimness, and that of male models in general.  Though much of it is funny, it does wear thin after a while. The movie is a lot funnier when instead of mocking fashion types as empty heads, it aims at the conventions of the industry itself, as in a scene where Derek and his fabulously-dressed buddies' magazine-spread romp at a gas station spins hilariously out of control, or a Bloodsport style confrontation between rival models at the old Members Only warehouse.  The best gag in the movie concerns the concept behind a new fashion line, which is at once screamingly funny and scathingly true.  The numerous movie references are also well-brought off, and it is great fun to see familiar spy-movie conventions transplanted to the world of style, as in a meeting of faceless international villains of fashion (I trust you want to live to see your spring line.)  The brainwashing takes place in a special day spa overseen by a Rosa Klebb-style dominatrix (Milla Jovovich) and her impeccably-clad goon squad who are always perfectly posed, even when tossing intruders out the steel doors.The cameos by notable real-life Beautiful People are a tad excessive, and lend Zoolander an in-jokey quality that it doesn't need, and dulls the edge on the sendup until the darts are more like Nerf arrows. Fortunately, most of the cameos are too fast to count, and they often do little more than walk by the camera (the movie often feels an annoying urge to name-drop and flash labels on the screen, lest you miss a card-carrying glitterati).  An exception is David Bowie's funny turn as a kind of haute-couture Mills Lane. But the central cast is the real show here.  Stiller's evocation of Zoolander's patented looks are hysterical. Owen Wilson's blank stare, misshapen nose, and ludicrous New Age claptrap make him a great foil as Hansel, Zoolander's scooter-slinging upstart rival.  David Duchovny does a great parody of his X-Files persona, just as he did in Evolution (I get a feeling this will be the arc of Duchovny's future career, at least until he gets a better agent).  Christine Taylor also makes a fine straight man as a reporter covering the Zoolander beat.  However, Will Ferrell does his level best to steal the show as Mugatu, a crazed designer, who plots political murder without batting an eye, but gets all hissy when there's too much foam in his latte.Oddly, Zoolander is helped somewhat by the ineptness of its trailers, which for some reason chose the more lackluster jokes to showcase, the ones that display Stiller's weakness as a writer and director he is too often shy about trusting the audience to get a joke, and feels a need to over-explain or over-stage a gag until it ceases to be funny.  This instinct has hamstrung more than a few dynamite jokes in his career, and he needs to muzzle it.  Some of the funniest gags in Zoolander are the ones we see in brief, subtle passing, not the ones that have giant neon arrows reading Comic Moment.Zoolander may or may not be more amusing to those who are hip to the world of fashion.  I frankly wouldn't know.  But even those of us who couldn't pick Donna Karan out of a police lineup or wouldn't know a Manolo Blahnik if it kicked us square in the face, can appreciate the satiric skewering of those who do.

I guess Nirvana was out of town in the 3 days it took them to shoot this tripe.I also am growing way too tired of Crowe's overly conversational style of writing.  So many words come out of his characters mouths, and 50% of them are fluff.  It's like a dern episode of Friends.  Blah, blah, like soooo, blah, could we be any more, blah.  There are so many throw-away lines in this film they should've just hired extras to do the film and had them say the 5 lines that carry the plot.
