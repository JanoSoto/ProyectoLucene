In it were news clips of the three of them disappearing and a guy talking about how the film reels were found buried in the rubble of that house in the woods. I am having a really hard time figuring out whether or not it is real. I thought that it was real actual footage that they took before they came up missing...and that they are still missing...and that the movie was made by whoever found the film and picked up where the three of them left off...which would explain why there is a crew and a producer and such. Is that incorrect? Even if the whole thing was made up, it is still a scary movie that was well-made...but I just want to know the truth! So did it really go down the way that the film leads you to believe, or was the entire thing just a pretend thing that is entirely fiction?

You can't have mixed feelings about The Long Good-bye; you'll either love it or hate it. I started the movie with what I pretended was an open mind, but a secret hope that I'd be fully justified in hating it. In my defense, The Maltese Falcon is my favorite movie and Bogie is my favorite actor. Noir is my favorite film genre and I love Howard Hawk's The Big Sleep wihich had Bogart as the definitive Marlowe.Altman's take on Chandler's other book with private eye Marlowe, The Long Good-bye, updates the action to the 1970's. He introduces a very 70's theme song and finds as different an actor as he can from Bogart for the role of Marlowe. From the opening frame, Elliot Gould plays Marlowe like a push-over. He's a man who constantly mutters to himself, suffers nervous tics, can't even fool his cat, is afraid of dog's and seems to be the only man not attracted to his sexy hippie neighbors despite their friendliness towards him and obvious promiscuousness.However, Gould really creates a unique persona with the way he walks, talks, wise-cracks and operates. He becomes a believable person - which is why the uncharacteristic ending is so impacting. The photography, especially the night scenes, are beautifully filmed. The theme music plays everywhere - a Mexican funeral, a doorbell, a car radio etc and with different singers. There are other layers of flesh added to the telling that really work - like the compound security guards impressions of James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, Cary Grant and best of all Walter Brennan aka Stumpy from Rio Bravo.This movie worked great for me and the plot, intricate though it was, was understandable. I will not compare this Marlowe to Bogart's, but do find it admirable that Altman just stuck to the goal of making a good movie without trying to ape or make obvious references to the noir genre.

My brother got a copy off a friend before it was in the cinema and it had all the scenes that were cut from the UK version (now seen in the DVD release) and the original ending. I later owned the cut UK version. I loved both versions, just as I loved the cartoon.Last night I watched it with my nephew, a huge ninja turtles fan. I asked my sister if she minded him watching it, because he is young, but she said he'd be fine and I went through it with him before, telling him it's not real, they don't really kick each other etc. Just as I thought, he loved the film as much as I did when I first saw it. Having grown up watching Sesame Street and Rainbow, when I first saw the film I couldn't believe that there were actually turtles fighting on the screen in front of my very eyes, but I guess to my nephew it wasn't quite such a big deal. You don't even see the first fight scene (it's in the dark) and this is very deliberate, because at the time the director must've known that people would want to see the turtles, they'd want to see how they looked. When they do appear it's no disappointment! These effects are great and if I've said it once then I've said it a million times; a guy in a well made suit with time and care put in looks a billion times better than some useless CGI character designed by some company that are only in it for the money. Compare Ja Ja Binks with one of the turtles and you'll see the turtles look more real, because they're actually there and the light that is on them is real, the shadows are real - it looks believable. A lot of time and effort has gone into making their skin look just right and it shows. I've seen a lot of comments about lip-synching etc. It's a minor point, deal with it. I think it's only even noticeable in about two or three scenes and even then it isn't that bad.My nephew was totally blown away by it. He loved the jokes, the fighting and I didn't hear any bad language (damn is only considered offensive if you're extremely religious). Anyone on here who slates the soundtrack is clearly on another planet. It was made in 1990! Listen to other music of the time - it's electronic, it's sharp, concise and it pulls no punches. I like the soundtrack, always have. It does what it's meant to. I'm sure people will look back on the 'urban'\/'r&b' soundtracks to current releases in years to come and laugh at them (although I personally believe they should, because it isn't to my taste).I've read a number of extremely positive reviews and a number of extremely negative reviews. I want to give it 10 because I'm certain that 5.9 isn't a fair reflection of the movie. I should give it 9.95 (if you know and enjoyed the movie, you'll appreciate that). Instead I've given it 8\/10, which deep down is what I think it deserves. It's a great film that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, the fight scenes are great, the camera work is needlessly good (they could've got away with much less effort), there's comedy, drama etc. It really is so much better than a lot of the CGI super hero movies out today and it's a shame that the sequels were so poor.

Anyone on here who slates the soundtrack is clearly on another planet. It was made in 1990! Listen to other music of the time - it's electronic, it's sharp, concise and it pulls no punches. I like the soundtrack, always have. It does what it's meant to. I'm sure people will look back on the 'urban'\/'r&b' soundtracks to current releases in years to come and laugh at them (although I personally believe they should, because it isn't to my taste).I've read a number of extremely positive reviews and a number of extremely negative reviews. I want to give it 10 because I'm certain that 5.9 isn't a fair reflection of the movie. I should give it 9.95 (if you know and enjoyed the movie, you'll appreciate that). Instead I've given it 8\/10, which deep down is what I think it deserves. It's a great film that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, the fight scenes are great, the camera work is needlessly good (they could've got away with much less effort), there's comedy, drama etc. It really is so much better than a lot of the CGI super hero movies out today and it's a shame that the sequels were so poor.

Margaret, who lives with his son and her other kids in a house on Tahoe lake, wanted Reese to stay away from his son. After Margaret heard the boys fight earlier on, she finds the dead body and without ever talking to Beau about it, she disposes the body in broad daylight using her boat's anchor to weigh the body down in the water. She wants to protect her son. Many reviewers complained about the fact that she should have at least spoke to Beau about it but I find this not unrealistic and like this use of unconditional love. The movie takes a promising start.Back to the plot A few days later a guy (Alek) shows up at their house and blackmails Margaret. He wants her to pay $50.000 and threatens to hand a videotape to the police who have found Reese's body in the meantime. The tape shows Beau and Reese having sex. Maragret tries to somehow get the $50.000. Now comes the part of the movie that I found really annoying and stupid. She cannot tell her children anything about the blackmail so she has to keep doing her maternal duties while she desperately tries to get the money. Margaret explains to Alex why she does not have the money yet and their dialog is really laughable Margaret Hall We don't have the money. Alek 'Al' Spera You have to get the money.

You don't have three kids to feed, or worry about the future of a 17-year-old boy who nearly got himself killed driving back from some kind of a nightclub with his 30-year-old friend sitting drunk in the seat beside him.

Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much is happening between all it's characters, that the film never gets dull. The supporting cast is one of a kind. Talia Shire, Burgress Meredith, Burt Young, along with many others, all play roles that can be found down most streets whilst Carl Weathers wonderfully paints a picture of the ego that goes with fame and fortune as the Champ determined to give Rocky a hard time.Unfortunately, this film has been overlooked in terms of great films because of it's lesser sequels. It's a shame, because when you watch the film on it's own merit, it truly is one of the best romantic sports dramas ever made. I dare anyone to find a more heartfelt climatic ending in a film than this one. It's climax; a battered and bloodied Rocky frantically calling out for his real true love...Adrian! The memories that viewers take home with them however continue to be director John G. Alividsen's training montage sequences, and of course, the final climatic fight.

But I never really had an interest in this film, but my mom told me what a great comedy it was and that I should give it a chance. So, finally, today I got some time and watched it and I'm glad I did. Private Benjamin is a great comedy staring then new comer Goldie Hawn. I didn't realize how much she was meant for comedy, I've seen some of her work like Overboard and Death Becomes her, but usually she has the supporting cast helping her in the comedy, this time she was on her own and did great.She plays Judy Benjamin, a 29 year old whose been married twice, her last husband died on her, literally, had a heart attack while he was making love to her. So, since she has always been taken care of, a stranger helps her out and recruits her in the army showing her the AFTERMATH of what she could have in the future, but she thinks that she's getting all the good stuff immediately. Therefore, she becomes the princess of the boot camp, but after a harsh talk with her folks, she realizes she needs the army and to become strong. She ends up meeting a suave French man and gets transferred to Paris after graduation, but she soon realizes who she needs most in life herself.Private Benjamin is a great comedy that I think anyone could get a little kick out of. It has great jokes and fun moments that I had a good time watching. Not to mention, Goldie Hawn is just so adorable and you definitely want to keep rooting for her during the film, she's just great.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2006","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Gosh, I don't know how many times I passed this movie up in my mom's collection.

King even penned the screenplay himself (from his short story 'The Cycle of the Werewolf'), but since he was also responsible for the awful Maximum Overdrive, that's no solid proof of quality. But it a damn cool movie.What makes it so different and unique is that it's horror movie told from a child's perspective (though I admit that the retrospective narration seems out of place) and has a brother\/sister dynamic that's quite cute and makes you really care for the characters.Corey Haim plays Marty Coslaw, a young boy who is confined to a wheelchair for reasons unknown. His older sister Jane is forced to take care of him and throws tantrums whenever the mum and dad take Marty's side (which is always). But the chair doesn't stop Marty from being mischievous. Especially when his manic, reckless Uncle Red (a fat Gary Busey-absolutely brilliant, as always) builds him a motorized wheelchair\/bike called the Silver Bullet.There is killer in their small town who strikes every month when the moon is full. The townsfolk gradually become more and more weary as autumn rolls on and Marty takes a personal offence when his best friend is murdered, his best girl is run out of town and a fireworks display is cancelled. Then he witnesses what the killer really is. But who is going to believe a kid's story of a werewolf? Despite the red-herrings, it's easy to figure out who it is before the main revelation. But it's still a fun mystery.Filmed with the little-used JDC-Scope process, Silver Bullet has brilliant cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi and a wonderful score by Jay Chattaway. There's not much horror to it, but I don't think it was ever the intention to dwell on the violence. Even though I would call this film suitable for kids (despite the 18\/R-rating) it's still way better than the PG-13 junk we get these days.The film is also notable for Everett McGill (so evil as the baddie in Under Siege 2), an under-rated and under-used actor in a typically eccentric role as a charismatic Reverend. Doesn't he look like a cross between Christopher Reeve and David Hasselhoff? A perfect Halloween movie or any night with the curtains drawn and lights off.

No jury would convict me, as long as we kept Gen Xers off the panel.Now I'm sure I would have found this mindless heap of treacle screamingly funny too when I was twelve years old, but I had the misfortune to see it for the first time at age 46 as part of a nostalgia haul my wife brought home from the library. Not a great movie? If it were even *passable*, but it's grainy, often not quite in focus, the dialog pauses between the principals sound so patently like they're reciting painfully memorized lines, the alleged cool Rufus has about two minutes total screen time, and you'd have to be drunk or stoned to swallow the premise.If you can ignore all of that ... the movie still reeks.Now there were a few amusing lines, the sequence of the historical figures in the shopping mall was genuinely humorous, and the oral presentation had legit energy, but that's what keeps this flick from getting a rock bottom rating. I thought in the Eighties based on the trailers that this film was for subhumans only. I wasn't wrong.3\/10. ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Music"}]
