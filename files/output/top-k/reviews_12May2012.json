[{"date":"12 May 2012","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" James Cameron's epic 1997 Titanic is a visually spectacular, captivating and beautifully told love story set amongst the backdrop of the doomed débutant voyage of the 1912 RMS Titanic. With superb performances, tremendous special effects contributing to the famous and absolutely mind-blowing sequences of the Titanic during it's final two hours as it sinks, Titanic is a timeless masterpiece, and I was fortunate enough to have seen it in all it's glory in 3-D in the cinema two weeks ago. The film details the journey of the Titanic from the beginning of its journey to its final resting place at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron directs this very emotional and captivating film with such a hold on us, that its no wonder that it is often hailed as one of the most breath-taking dramas ever made.It begins with some amazing footage of the wreck of the Titanic, which Cameron himself went down to film at the bottom of the Atlantic. It's no surprising really as the man directed the underwater epic Sci-Fi film The Abyss in the late 1980's which featured some spectacular underwater imagery. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) has a dive team down here searching for a rare diamond necklace that legend has it is still down amongst the wreck. It's priceless today. A 101 year-old woman named Rose hears about this on the news, and gets in touch with him. It turns out that she was a passenger on the Titanic and she meets with the team and tells them her story. When Rose (Kate Winslet) was 17, she boarded the ship with her mother along with her future in-laws, the Hockley's. Rose had been pressured into a marriage with Cal (Billy Zane) because all her father's money was gone and he had left them with a string of debts, leaving Rose with no other choice but to marry this arrogant and abusive man. The narration carries the flashbacks along, as we meet a young woman who is extremely depressed and feels as though she is 'screaming at the top' of her lungs but no one is hearing her. One night, she contemplates suicide by diving off the back of the ship, but she is rescued by Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio) a young, poor man from steerage. Over the next two days, Jack and Rose become close, eventually falling in love as they make promises to keep despite the obstacles ahead of them, with Rose swearing that she is getting off the ship in America with Jack. But then the ship collides with an iceberg, and everything goes to hell.It had been at least ten years since I'd last seen Titanic before I caught it in 3-D a few weeks ago, but still, I was quite surprised as to how much of it I remembered once it was salvaged from the back of my mind. Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio are superb, and have great chemistry together. It's funny now to watch Di Caprio back when he was just a young man, after his recent films in the last view years in which he has asserted himself as quite a tough guy (Shutter Island, Blood Diamond). Billy Zane plays an absolute bully, but I love his performance the most in the film because of how well he performs. Kathy Bates plays an American woman who is 'new money' as Rose's mother calls her because she would be in steerage only for her husband finding gold somewhere in America years ago. She's the 'unsinkable Molly Brown', and proves to be the only decent, humane person in first class after Rose. Titanic was the most expensive film of the 20th century &#x96; with a budget of $200,000,000. Despite the romance coming across as a bit corny in places (and a bit far-fetched that they'd be so in love after just two days) Titanic holds up because of the amazing performances and the superb direction by James Cameron. The special effects are truly magnificent, and the music composed by James Horner is beautiful and adds to the emotions that run right through the entire film. The supporting cast are all superb, and everything from the sets, the props to the editing are flawless. One needs to see it a few times before they can truly appreciate everything that is on offer here, and realise how well it was made. Titanic is deserving of every bit of praise it has received, and is a timeless masterpiece.

You will literally fall into confusion, dizziness, and mental retardation within 5 minutes of watching this. Johnny Depp is insane as can be, and proves it brilliantly within this film.Based on the novel by Hunter S. Thompson, The story follows Raoul Duke, (Johnny Depp) a photographer for a magazine, and attorney Dr. Gonzo (Bernicio Del Toro)to a trip to Las Vegas to shoot pictures for a bike race. From the whole trip to their time in Vegas, they are stoned with several doses of mescaline. Their trip turns for the worst when they experience several bizarre envisions due to their doses. Through several different situations and conflicts, they continue to struggle between the boundaries of reality and illusion.You will find nothing in this movie anywhere else. It's literally like nothing you've ever seen. Every scene is a crazy mad house full of random bizarre pictures. Each scene is more random than the other.From comparison to the novel, the best part is the detailed narration of Johnny's character, describing his experiences while they're being shown. It's so interesting to listen to. The movie would not be as good without the narration. I haven't read the book yet. A lot of people say it's better because it has more descriptive narration. Some criticize the film for having not much story arc, and focusing on the results of the doses. But that's the point! Thompson appreciated the film so much that when he watched it for the first time, he literally relived the trip for each scene, jumping up and down on seats. The things that the character's see make the film work, and the narration makes it work even better. Johnny does an amazing job capturing the actions of a dosed up hot head. Bernicio del Toro is completely insane! Everything he does get them deeper and deeper into the psychological despair they experience. He is completely random at all times. You never know what he'll do next, almost scary. But he pulls off a solid performance.Director Terry Giliam's purpose was to create a mood just like the novel, which he successfully does. This film is very underrated, and doesn't have the praise it deserves. This film entertained me from beginning to end, and will always stay fresh and crazy. If you want to watch something crazy and let your mind slip away from reality, then check this out. You won't be let down.

I really dig the noir genre, and this one had it going all the way until it U-turned into sci-fi territory with the first reveal during the gym locker scene, and then going all out at the finale. I would have gotten more out of the picture if the MGM DVD I watched offered English sub-titles, too many times the dialog was muffled enough that I probably missed some helpful narrative.I guess if you want to go the sadistic Mike Hammer route, Ralph Meeker did a decent enough job, but what I really think the screenplay needed was some of Bogart's repartee cracking wise with guys like the two Jacks - Elam and Lambert. There weren't any light spots in the story to render the players as having any dimension to their characters other than being good guys or bad guys. Except for va-va voom mechanic Nick (Nick Dennis), he was a trip. A little more nuance for someone like Lily Carver\/Gabrielle (Gaby Rodgers) would have been welcome, so that by the time she went on her shooting spree at the end, we would have been more astonished by her actions.Still and all, I'm intrigued enough to watch this again while trying to block my memory of the nuclear stockpile in that little black box.

That's his magic touch, the plots of his movies are not complex but the characters always contain a level that makes them slightly more dimensional then most. Hughes is mostly known for adventures involving teens and adults like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, Planes Trains and Automobiles and The Breakfast Club, films that are simplistic in their plots but wonderful in their humanity.Those films stayed pretty close to the ground, plot-wise, but Home Alone is a little different. It is not about teenagers, but about a plucky little kid with a story that leans more toward fantasy. This one involves possibly the greatest kid in the history of the world and his adventure foiling two burglars who try to break into his house on Christmas Eve. This is an adventure that The Little Rascals might have gotten involved in decades ago. That's a good thing.The kid is Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin), a cute 8 year-old whose over-large family is getting ready to take a trip from Chicago to Paris to spend the holiday with relatives. The night before their departure, the power goes out and the family wakes to find that they have only 45 minutes to catch their flight. In the rush to get to the airport, the family inadvertently leave little Kevin behind.Kevin is an amazing kid. He's resourceful, mature; he remembers to take a bath and even does the laundry. He even goes to the store on funds pilfered from his older brother Buzz. However, he also has free reign of the house, especially his brother's room where he makes use of the bee bee gun. There's no reality to Kevin, but I don't think that was the point. No kid would do many of the things that Kevin would do, and if indeed a kid were this smart, he might even think to call the cops and let them know that he's been left at home by himself. This is a fantasy, so we just have to sit back and enjoy it at that level.Meanwhile, two separate events are taking place elsewhere. On a plane somewhere over the Atlantic, the realization dawns on Kevin's mother (Catherine O'Hara) that she has left her son behind. As she does her best to get back home, a potential threat is looming for the pint-sized hero in the form of two idiotic burglars Harry (Joe Peschi) and Marv (Daniel Stern) who are taking advantage of the fact that the people on Kevin's street are away for Christmas. Harry sees the McAllister's luxurious house as a gold mine. Kevin finds out their coming and sets up a series of booby traps.Home Alone is a fun, good-hearted movie. Director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes do a nice job of creating a film that is both heartwarming and very funny. The heartwarming stuff comes from a relationship that Kevin develops with the old man next door. They seem to have a mutual problem, but in a touching scene in a church they talk about the meaning of their problem and of the meaning of family.What makes the film really work is the performance by Macaulay Culkin, a cute kid but not a cloying one. He has pitch-perfect timing in his comedy and there are moments when he hits his mark so perfectly that you wonder if the filmmakers worked with him for days on end or if he really is that good. I like to think he is.The funny stuff comes in the film's third act as Kevin attempts to defend the house against the burglars using traps that no 8 year-old kid in the world could ever devise. They involve a lot of carpentry, engineering and foreknowledge of where the burglars are going to stand when he springs the traps. It is violence on par with the Road Runner cartoons, or more accurately with the Inspector Clouseu pictures. It is violent, but not bloody or unpleasant.You have to put that stuff in the back of your mind. Home Alone isn't a perfect movie, but it is a good one. You have to take it at face value. As I said, this is all pure fantasy, and it's a lot of fun.

Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid. Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house. As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck. He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris.The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group. In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag. At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home. The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car. That means they will have to search them all one by one.Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away. The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower. Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag. Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4. We'll see.

Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who regards Dormer as one of her heroes, is tasked to work with Dormer and Eckhardt. With that setup I was expecting the usual police procedural but the plot thickens early on when we learn that Dormer and Eckhardt are being investigated by the L.A. Police Department for some shady dealings regarding a previous case. And Eckhardt confides to Dormer that he is about to cut a deal that would implicate his partner, a confession that Dormer does not take with gentlemanly grace.Things get interesting when, in pursuit of the murderer in a heavy fog, Dormer shoots Eckhardt. Did he do it on purpose, or was it an accident? Complications ensue when Burr starts to smell a fish when investigating Dormer's story of the shooting. I liked the concept of the investigator being investigated. When the murderer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams), senses that Dormer is getting hot on his trail he preempts the pursuit by calling Dormer and saying that he has seen the shooting of Eckhardt and can use that for blackmail. The cat and mouse game that Finch and Dormer play is well scripted and engaging.The main thing that separates this from average are the deep insights given into Dormer's psychology. The confusion in his own mind as to whether he purposely shot his friend Eckhardt makes him a haunted and guilt-driven man. His situation is almost identical to that of Gene in A Separate Peace after having caused harm to his friend Finney. Dormer's behavior in the case that he is being investigated for in L.A. also weighs on him. With the death of Eckhardt he has no one to unburden to and having the need to talk about his past he finally tells his story to the woman who runs the hotel where he is staying. This may be a plot device in order for the audience to know just what Dormer is being investigated for, but, given his state of mind, it is believable.Pacino does an admirable job in portraying the gradual decay of Dormer's mental health accompanied by his slide into total exhaustion due to insomnia precipitated by being where it never gets dark. Robin Williams is a standout in the role of the bad guy. The thing that makes his portrayal so chilling is his calm confidence and seeming detachment when talking about his crime. The contrast between him and Dormer sets up a nice contrast. Hilary Swank is good in playing the young enthusiastic detective. All together a good cast.The final fight and shoot-'em-up scene was at odds with the restrained tone of the rest of the movie. I was not aware of the Norwegian original before having seen this version. Many people point to that as being better, so that is encouragement to see the original.

The cat and mouse game that Finch and Dormer play is well scripted and engaging.The main thing that separates this from average are the deep insights given into Dormer's psychology. The confusion in his own mind as to whether he purposely shot his friend Eckhardt makes him a haunted and guilt-driven man. His situation is almost identical to that of Gene in A Separate Peace after having caused harm to his friend Finney. Dormer's behavior in the case that he is being investigated for in L.A. also weighs on him. With the death of Eckhardt he has no one to unburden to and having the need to talk about his past he finally tells his story to the woman who runs the hotel where he is staying. This may be a plot device in order for the audience to know just what Dormer is being investigated for, but, given his state of mind, it is believable.Pacino does an admirable job in portraying the gradual decay of Dormer's mental health accompanied by his slide into total exhaustion due to insomnia precipitated by being where it never gets dark. Robin Williams is a standout in the role of the bad guy. The thing that makes his portrayal so chilling is his calm confidence and seeming detachment when talking about his crime. The contrast between him and Dormer sets up a nice contrast. Hilary Swank is good in playing the young enthusiastic detective. All together a good cast.The final fight and shoot-'em-up scene was at odds with the restrained tone of the rest of the movie. I was not aware of the Norwegian original before having seen this version. Many people point to that as being better, so that is encouragement to see the original. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"12 May 2012","score":"","review":" The story has L.A. detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhardt dispatched to Alaska to help solve a brutal murder of a young woman. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who regards Dormer as one of her heroes, is tasked to work with Dormer and Eckhardt. With that setup I was expecting the usual police procedural but the plot thickens early on when we learn that Dormer and Eckhardt are being investigated by the L.A. Police Department for some shady dealings regarding a previous case. And Eckhardt confides to Dormer that he is about to cut a deal that would implicate his partner, a confession that Dormer does not take with gentlemanly grace.Things get interesting when, in pursuit of the murderer in a heavy fog, Dormer shoots Eckhardt. Did he do it on purpose, or was it an accident? Complications ensue when Burr starts to smell a fish when investigating Dormer's story of the shooting.

The way Malick uses imagery is quite stunning sometimes. The film hinges on the performances of the two central characters and both Martin Sheen as Kit and Sissy Spacek as Holly stepped up to the mark and put in stellar performances (IMO). In fact Sissy Spacek was nominated for the Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles BAFTA in 1975 on the strength of this performance.A very slow deliberate pace is one of the hallmarks of a Terrance Malick film and this is no exception. If anything, I did find it a little too pedestrian for my taste, however, the strength of the characters was enough to keep me interested. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film was, especially the cinematography.
