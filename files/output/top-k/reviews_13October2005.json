[{"date":"13 October 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" RAVENOUS is honestly one of my favorite modern American horror films. A strange little film that seems to slip under a lot of peoples radar, and it's a shame...it really is an original, extremely enjoyable film.Lt. Boyd is a war hero, depending on how you look at it. He successfully killed a whole battalion of opposing troops, but was only able to do so by playing possum while his comrades were cut down around him. His superiors realize that while his act of cowardice bordered on treason, he also did single-handedly take an enemy compound. As a punishment\/reward, Lt. Boyd is sent to a remote outpost in the hills of California, basically to get him out of sight. Once at the outpost, Boyd meets up w\/several other colorful characters, including drunken, dope smoking David Arquette, and his boss Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones, the Principal from FERRIS BUELLER). One night a stranger stumbles into their camp - starving, freezing, and spinning a strange tale of adventure, cannibalism, and mayhem...Boyd, Hart, and crew (with the mysterious stranger in-tow...) decide to investigate the claims - and it all goes downhill from there...RAVENOUS perfectly combines elements of adventure, horror, occult lore, and pitch-black comedy into an extremely entertaining mixture of a film without ever becoming too self-indulgent. I think this movie was in the theaters (at least here in the States...) for all of about 15 minutes, so many people missed this one. If I remember the commercials correctly, they tried to pitch this as a straight-comedy, but no one seemed to get the punch-line. The best part about RAVENOUS is you can now typically find this wonderful film in the $5 section of most of the larger Audio\/Visual store chains. That is in fact how I came about this great film a few years ago, as a blind-buy, only remembering the 1 or 2 commercials and reading the back cover. One of the best $5 I've ever spent. Highly Recommended 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" RAVENOUS is honestly one of my favorite modern American horror films.
