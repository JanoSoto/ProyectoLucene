Mission accomplished, they head out to town but Principal Ed Rooney doesn't believe this 'illness' for a second and is determined to catch Bueller out this time.For 75 minutes this film is a slick, enjoyable, silly fantasy that is great fun as it exists in a completely different universe that we all wish we were in. Only in the final 10 minutes does John Hughes suddenly remember that, hey, he's John Hughes and launches into a message ending where endings are made, lessons learned and the 'kids are alright'. Ignoring the inevitable mush this is not a great film anyway &#150; it is silly, it is total fantasy and it has no logic to it whatsoever; but, damn it, it's a lot of fun! This is why it has stuck in so many people my age minds, because it is pure teenage escapism and, as such, it is silly and a lot of fun to watch. Matching the fun\/silly tone of the material the film delivers everything with a knowing wink at the audience the whole way.In doing this it put a lot of weight on Broderick's and Ferris' shoulders.

A fresh-faced Ruck is also good and it isn't his fault that he is dumped with the hard work of delivering the films last minute lesson and losing the fun.

This is especially evident, starting with Escape from the Planet of the Apes and on to Battle for the Planet of the Apes which closely resembles a TV movie.Pity, because the entire franchise would have been worth a much bigger effort. Even though I may understand, for various strategical reasons, the choice of having The Planet of the Apes as a post nuclear holocaust backward society, in the the original 1968 movie, I still am wondering why the same choice was made by Tim Burton in his remake.Pierre Boulle's (the author) Apes' Planet, was far more advanced than human society on the Earth, the astronauts had left behind. This was meant to show that, no matter what man could destroy, other, probably more developed and advanced species (not necessarily Apes, but I guess this was a more poignant metaphor), could rebuild and by far, better than humans ever could.This is why, although in the 1968 version, as I already mentioned before, I could still conceive the post-nuclear theme, which was far more in the minds of people involved in the Cold War, than just a more generalized critique against human kind, in the new version I simply cannot accept it.Lack of imagination? Probably. Lack of means? Not at all.As the Star Wars franchise has shown, Cities and environments can be recreated through CG technology at much lower costs than ever before. So why then not opt for the Pierre Boulle's original novel? Your guess is as good as mine.Anyway, the classic Planet of the Apes is far better and original in contents and storyline and has the advantage of an excellent cast, one could only dream for nowadays.Even the music, of all five movies, reflected a much higher level at inventiveness and freshness. These restored versions, bring back the original flair they possessed when they appeared in movie theaters everywhere. Images are sharp and clear, colors are vivid.The sound is another matter. While every effort was made to restore Planet of the Apes in its most minute detail, including its sound, with an excellent Digital Dolby 5.1 remix, not so happened with the other four movies.Again, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, is the most dubious example, being the only one that doesn't even sport a Dolby Surround Mono mix, but just a polished Mono one. I can only assume that the only original copy remaining is available like that. In which case, I think it was wise not to digitally attempt at fussing with the sound, as it was the case with other movies and in which it totally failed. But, should a stereo copy emerge, I would suggest to use that one to re-release this movie.And yet, I suspect that this particular movie was plagued by the same financial restrictions of the others, probably more and might therefore have had a mono treatment. The other ones, like Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle... could have deserved the attention that their forerunner had.All in all, the five movies are more entertaining and well-made than the latest concoction by Tim Burton.If you truly want to be astonished and thrilled by a science fiction movie series, than I would suggest to stick to the originals. They had creativity, imagination, solid stories and excellent acting, all combined into a firework of surprises beyond which today's remakes pale miserably away.A note about the complete Planet of the Apes TV series. If you are really enjoying retro-spectacles, especially '70s style, then you may be well served. But, be warned, the series, having suffered the same financial restrictions as their movie counterparts, lack luster and are even dull in comparison. There is no more development of the characters (besides, the original ones, have long disappeared and been replaced by others) and the plots, except for two episodes out of fourteen, are always the same.

While he tries to explain the popularity of his show, several groups of guest arrive for his newest show. Angel lives in a trailer with her mother and stepfather &#150; but is sleeping with him! When her mother Connie finds out she gives Angel's boyfriend a blowjob in revenge. Meanwhile Starletta catches boyfriend Demond sleeping with both Vonda and Leshawnetta. The natural step for both groups is to appear on Jerry's show &#150; even if it makes the conflict greater.I started watching this film once but didn't review it because I gave it up as a bad job once it turned into nudity for nudity's sake, however I decided that I'd give it another try despite my better judgment. Of course, it is not any good but this is not to say that it was one of the worst films ever made because it wasn't. The plot focuses around two sets of trash that emulate the guests on Jerry's real show and this is part of the problem. The characters here seem to revel in ignorance and trashiness and it makes it hard to really care about any of them. This isn't helped by the fact that they have no real story to speak of &#150; their bits are set up and then they all flirt\/fight in the hotel on their way to the recording of the show.Not enough happens to justify a 'story' so called so it resorts to 'sexy' clinches, fighting and vulgarity.It is a shame because the film does have a few interesting moments &#150; although you wouldn't think it from the reviewers on this site. One interesting point is the character of Connie; she is damaged and hurt and wants more than the vulgarity she has &#150; but when the fighting and swearing happens, this interesting part of the character is forgotten aside from a few all too rare sensitive moments. The film has a few interesting lines about the show but it doesn't throw itself open enough, instead it uses its platform to defend itself and attack its critics; I don't mind it doing this but there was no balanced view to be had here &#150; although it is hard to disagree with Jerry's speech near the end that defends the fact that people are like this&#133;even if we don't like it. Parts of it are a little funny but this, and some other qualities are just lost in a plotless film that is vulgar rather than interesting and noisy rather than really funny.The cast are average as you would expect from the material they are given. Hagan manages to create a few good moments but she is betrayed by the film for her good work. Pressly is very sexy &#150; even as white trailer trash! She doesn't have much to do apart from be sexy, so it is just as well that she does it well. Robinson, Ambrose and Micheaux have all done some good jobs in other films\/shows but here they are loud, brash black stereotypes and they embarrass themselves. Why action star White bothered to do this is beyond me, he has nothing to do apart from flirt around and get to kiss a couple of girls. McNamara is pretty good and sends himself and the show up equally well. Springer is so-so and he overdoes the 'world-weary' thing and never lets interesting moments, where he seems bothered, go anywhere of value. Like the material itself, the cast throw up some OK moments but these are lost in a sea of bad stuff.Overall this is a bad film although it has moments that show it could have been more interesting (if not actually good per se).

When her mother Connie finds out she gives Angel's boyfriend a blowjob in revenge. Meanwhile Starletta catches boyfriend Demond sleeping with both Vonda and Leshawnetta. The natural step for both groups is to appear on Jerry's show &#150; even if it makes the conflict greater.I started watching this film once but didn't review it because I gave it up as a bad job once it turned into nudity for nudity's sake, however I decided that I'd give it another try despite my better judgment. Of course, it is not any good but this is not to say that it was one of the worst films ever made because it wasn't. The plot focuses around two sets of trash that emulate the guests on Jerry's real show and this is part of the problem. The characters here seem to revel in ignorance and trashiness and it makes it hard to really care about any of them. This isn't helped by the fact that they have no real story to speak of &#150; their bits are set up and then they all flirt\/fight in the hotel on their way to the recording of the show.Not enough happens to justify a 'story' so called so it resorts to 'sexy' clinches, fighting and vulgarity.It is a shame because the film does have a few interesting moments &#150; although you wouldn't think it from the reviewers on this site. One interesting point is the character of Connie; she is damaged and hurt and wants more than the vulgarity she has &#150; but when the fighting and swearing happens, this interesting part of the character is forgotten aside from a few all too rare sensitive moments. The film has a few interesting lines about the show but it doesn't throw itself open enough, instead it uses its platform to defend itself and attack its critics; I don't mind it doing this but there was no balanced view to be had here &#150; although it is hard to disagree with Jerry's speech near the end that defends the fact that people are like this&#133;even if we don't like it. Parts of it are a little funny but this, and some other qualities are just lost in a plotless film that is vulgar rather than interesting and noisy rather than really funny.The cast are average as you would expect from the material they are given. Hagan manages to create a few good moments but she is betrayed by the film for her good work. Pressly is very sexy &#150; even as white trailer trash! She doesn't have much to do apart from be sexy, so it is just as well that she does it well. Robinson, Ambrose and Micheaux have all done some good jobs in other films\/shows but here they are loud, brash black stereotypes and they embarrass themselves. Why action star White bothered to do this is beyond me, he has nothing to do apart from flirt around and get to kiss a couple of girls. McNamara is pretty good and sends himself and the show up equally well. Springer is so-so and he overdoes the 'world-weary' thing and never lets interesting moments, where he seems bothered, go anywhere of value. Like the material itself, the cast throw up some OK moments but these are lost in a sea of bad stuff.Overall this is a bad film although it has moments that show it could have been more interesting (if not actually good per se).

This is one of the most touching, short, perfect films ever. Nobody should have to pass their childhood without seeing it.The story is incredibly simple. It isn't cluttered by subplots, it doesn't have more than one story line, it's just a straightforward fable of how a baby elephant rises to fame, but not before being ridiculed for his foolishly immense ears, named Dumbo, and worst of all being ostracized from his mother. But he is rescued by Timothy Q. Mouse, a fast-talking rodent who is the one guy who pities Dumbo. In the end, Dumbo finds his ears are perfect as wings. After the animators so perfectly portray his innocent joy, we see a great change in Dumbo. He suddenly punishes the clowns who made fun of him, shoots peanuts at the nasty elephants like a bombadier circling overhead. I know everyone who was punished for their horrid conduct towards the mute protagonist deserved what they got. But still, I can't help thinking Is this really Dumbo? I would have expected him to just smile joyously and simply speed-dive into his mother. I just didn't seem like the kind of guy to punish wrongdoers. That's what most heroes do, they beat up the baddies, but Dumbo seemed more like the kind of character to mind his own business, content to be with his mother and not be picked on, not giving a hoot whether the rest of the world ran amok or not.Despite the last bit, I love Dumbo. The animation is very rounded, warm and welcoming. The cuteness of Dumbo knows no bounds. This is made even more noticeable when Dumbo's ears are revealed when he sneezes, as they were previously tucked back neatly. After everyone sees his ears, the scenes don't look quite so happy. After his mother tries to protect him from a redheaded brat, Skinny, she's labelled mad elephant and locked up. After the loss of his mother, all the layouts are dark and sad, reflecting how Dumbo feels. Even the circus' obligatory brightness seems in some way menacing, although the look isn't really different at all. The animation is very simple, not bothering with great detail, but just portraying a cartoon animal, without the added bother of fur, wrinkles and such like.The character of Dumbo is groundbreaking. It's a great achievement to make a pure, meaningful film without the title character uttering a single word. The medium of animation often expresses emotion better without verbal support. Add to that that the movie really emphasizes Dumbo as an innocent baby who isn't responsible for his long ears, and dialog would ruin the baby image. What makes the meanness of the outside world look even worse is the fact that Dumbo can't even say anything about it. Timothy is a great character. That's nothing more than what you'd expect, for mice are always portrayed favorably in Disney, for obvious reasons. You just love him for helping Dumbo when no one else will. He's also quite the talker, persuading the ringmaster to use Dumbo as his climax, and bringing a bunch of nasty Afro-American crows to tears with a dramatic rendition of Dumbo's tragic story. Which brings us to the crows, presumably cousins of the vultures in The Jungle Book. Both are outcasts themselves, both make fun of the outcast hero before accepting him with an excellent song and then helping him. Mowgli and Dumbo develop friendships with their feathered acquaintances the same way. No one could ever talk about Dumbo without mentioning the Pink Elephants On Parade sequence. A year too late to make the cut for Fantasia, but certainly a surreal, colorful, innovative sequence. It's one of the best animated sequences ever, with lots of strange shots, like when you only see highlights of two waltzing elephants. Timothy and Dumbo endure this nightmare after accidentally imbibing the clowns' champagne. The crows' song When I See An Elephant Fly is one I battled with for a long time, trying to get it out of my head. I failed, needless to say. Baby Mine is one of the most touching sequences in animation history. The eyes and and the trunk (!) of the two elephants express the mother and son's feelings far better than words. All Dumbo can see of Mrs. Jumbo is her trunk, which cradles him through the bars of Mrs. Jumbo's tiny cell window, as he cries.Okay, enough of the sadness and despair, the movie! Dumbo is one of the great Disney movies, immortal. Short, simple, basic, yet spectacular in its own simple way. It doesn't try to be Fantasia or Pinocchio. It doesn't go for extravagance. It doesn't wanna be the immortal masterpiece. It just aims to tell a good animated story. Yet in its unambitious SIMPLICITY it manages to do most of that.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"19 July 2004","score":"","review":"  Unless you're a Hammer Horror Fan, this is THE Horror Collection you were waiting for.Good acting, mixed with good and chilling stories make these the one to own.This is a TRILOGY. Unfortunately Fox Studios tried to rehash it for TV a fourth time without even coming near to the first and only three original ones. It is divided like an opera in three acts.Remember that the caliber of cast members in the first three ranges from Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner to William Holden, Lee Grant and finally Sam Neill.A cast who could never be assembled for a TV movie.The first act, The Omen, is perhaps the best of the trilogy because it introduces us to the Evil one. The protagonists are as shocked and horrified when they learn, step by step as we do, who and what the Evil one is and is planning to do. >From there on we are involved in an intensive investigation and a race against time to save the world from what is to come, if at all possible...The second act, Damien - Omen II, is the natural evolution of the first one, in which we follow the growth in strength and power of Lucifer (or Satan if you prefer, although his name is never openly pronounced in all three movies). The interesting part is when the Evil one gets confirmation of who He really is and suddenly has a panic attack followed by sheer despair!Act three, Omen III - The Final Conflict, is the Apotheosis of the Trilogy in which Damien is at the top of the world, literally. He is finally ready to take possession of his Kingdom on Earth. People are ready, conditions are ready and it seems there's nothing able to stop him. Nothing, except...Less gory than the Exorcist, The Omen Trilogy still has vicious and very graphic death scenes. The beauty of them is that there is no direct murder involved, at least not in the first two. They all happen by accident and very conveniently...The Horror doesn't come in the form of monsters or decaying flesh, but is brought to us by angelic beings and natural coincidences, which make this even more controversial and eerie than any other Horror movie ever made.Also consider the haunting Evil Messianic Chants for Choir and Full Symphonic Orchestra composed by Jerry Goldsmith for all three movies. They all are masterpieces in musical composition and if the movies won't scare you, then the music will.Everything is well balanced. The acting, the stories, the effects and the music, they all promise you a true ride through Hell on Earth.Truly not for the faint-hearted.

Chinatown is a unique and fairly impressive noir piece that I was only recently able to see. Much like L.A. Confidential, CT throws us right into the mix of the old days, very convincingly, through great cinematography and perfect set pieces.  Chinatown is fairly effective creating a mysterious atmosphere by using shady characters of questionable backgrounds and a story that holds much more to it than what's merely on the surface. Somewhat hard to follow when compared to most films, you really must pay attention during this one. This is not one to get up and go to the bathroom during unless you hit the pause button. I found this slightly annoying at first, but then it quickly grew on me. I like how everything here isn't spelled out for you in bold letters. One must pay attention and piece things together for themselves, which is exactly how a mystery should be. It keeps you on your toes. You never seem to know which direction the story is going to take you next.Technically, the film is close to perfect. The cinematography, the score, and the acting are all top notch. All of these elements are combined into a screaming mystery flick. Some may be tempted to get bored at some point, but don't, you must pay attention. I personally enjoyed it quite well and think it's an excellent film. My one and only qualm with it though is the seemingly anti-climactic ending that, while realistic, simply comes out of nowhere without warning. I felt a tad let down at the end after all of that buildup, but the more I think about it, the more I actually like it. This, as I have heard from many people, is not a film to judge on it's first viewing, but one that must be viewed several times in order for the viewer to absorb everything. For this reason alone, and the fact that I've seen it only once, I can't bring myself to take too much away from it simply because of my one qualm with it. I must view it again and see if I like it better. I think I will do just that.Overall, a great, beautiful, classic noir that won't soon be forgotten.

I had no idea that the movie was about a woman who had survived a concentration camp.

At certain points I almost gave up on the film, because it seemed to drag at points, and then throw unexpected curves at me that I couldn't quite follow.  I just couldn't understand why Meryl was having such a difficult time choosing to stay with Kevin Kline, because Peter MacNichol seemed like such a geek I could hardly stand him.

They think their problems are over until an examination of the bite marks on some bodies and they realize that the shark that did the killing is much, much bigger than the one they caught.I saw this film as a child but couldn't remember if it was any good or not &#150; my childish fears may have made it scary even if the film was poor, so I decided to give it a go again recently. The first thing that struck me was the sheer rubbishness of the effects. In the original Jaws, Spielberg had hidden the shark as much as he could because the effects didn't work (and also therefore upping the tension); however here the makers just decide to show anything &#150; a poorly superimposed image, a rubber shark, fake severed arms and so on &#150; none of them are concealed, they are all shown up in all their rubbish glory. I could forgive it this due to its age but two other films had already managed to handle this issue before this film so I don't see why they went this route when it so clearly didn't work. Some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken for being a spoof (witness the shark swimming towards the control room).Of course, after the poor effects the second thing that hits you is the laughable plot. True it is not as bad as part 4 in terms of plausibility but it is still pretty thin. No attempt is made to really give the characters any sort of, well, character and the very basic sea world plot just about manages to give the shark enough high profile feeding scenes to keep the film moving &#150; just don't hold your breath for any logic or sense. In fact, the opposite is true and this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what the writers were thinking when they conceived some of this stuff! The manner of Jaws' death here would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn pathetic. Even with the plot being poor the film should still have had at least a few moment of fear and tension &#150; many of us fear being eaten alive so it isn't hard to draw on that, but this fails to have any tension or excitement to speak of. The effects suck a lot of this out &#150; but a director who's name is listed in the dictionary alongside the work 'workmanlike' didn't do anything to stop the rot either.Without characters the cast are set adrift with nothing to do &#150; how Quaid must have envied Roy Schnieder in the first films, at least he was a good character. Quaid runs around the place, Armstrong screams, Putch broods, Thompson screams and Gossett tries to act tough in the middle of a script that gives him nothing to do. I don't blame the cast but I am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was to make a happy ending out of the dolphins surviving while so many other people had not!Overall this is just a bad film. I'm not a big one for lists so I'll not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone.

However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.Whether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on &#150; did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.Even with this section, the flaws are rife &#150; the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation &#150; the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature &#150; having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.Even the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.Another reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director &#150; clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.Overall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending &#150; one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it. Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had.

The reluctant hero recruited to take down a mad terrorist, the hard as nails boss, the love interest who has a few secrets of her own, the absolutely nonthreatening Russian bad guy and not forgetting the geeky, and very annoying comedy side kick who provides Vin with his tools.It's got plenty of action, and while I do like a good dose of mindless violence now and again, there is a limit to how much bullet time style, CGI manipulated action scenes I'm willing to sit through before they all start looking the same.

She is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids. Like a dumb 50's romance comedy, Greg Kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality, no independence, and from us, no interest.They are the two most boring and often annoying characters, and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps, which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant. Except, they really don't do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own (except for that in vitro fertilization number). The plot hardly allows for any mishaps, because well, the couple don't do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. So what?The subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple, a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend (played by Joan Cusak), and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays the intrested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friend's product. The subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested (although Joan Cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene).Danny (Kinear) is an architect, who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills, by taking on a job in Seattle, where his boss is the crass seductress (also another hopeless, helpless female character) who tries to influence Danny (as dumb as he is) to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I don't care to give away). Jill Hennesy is good in the role, but her character is too predictable, and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for Danny. It is stupid and once again, hardly interesting.

Except, they really don't do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own (except for that in vitro fertilization number). The plot hardly allows for any mishaps, because well, the couple don't do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. So what?The subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple, a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend (played by Joan Cusak), and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays the intrested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friend's product. The subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested (although Joan Cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene).Danny (Kinear) is an architect, who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills, by taking on a job in Seattle, where his boss is the crass seductress (also another hopeless, helpless female character) who tries to influence Danny (as dumb as he is) to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I don't care to give away). Jill Hennesy is good in the role, but her character is too predictable, and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for Danny. It is stupid and once again, hardly interesting. The overall movie itself is utterly boring, and hardly funny at all (save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight). The plot offers nothing that is really attention-grabbing. Even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive, the writers could've figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that. Second, the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband. So, even without mishaps present in the plot, the characters themselves offer nothing interesting, let alone funny.Joan Cusak should've been in the lead and someone else should've taken Kinnear's part. Cusak would've made even a lousy story outrageously funny (as she sometimes does in her co-starring role here). This is definitely one to pass up.

This is one of very few sequels that really deserve the title of the original classics. Fievel Goes West may not have as many touching moments as the original, but that's because it's more of a fast-paced western comedy rather than a heartwarming, sometimes tragic tale (tail?) as An American Tail was. A by-product of the comedic approach is the look of the movie. Instead of the dark, dull, forbidding color scheme of the first movie, the sequel is supposed to be bright, funny, and altogether welcoming. Thus, you get bright sunshine (sometimes a bit too bright from the characters' point of view) and varied color. The animation hasn't changed all too much, unlike The Land Before Time's sequels for video. The animation retains a bit of Don Bluth's touch, though still a bit different. Altogether, the animation is just about as good as it could be in 1991. The film as a whole is a gem, but the one thing truly, wonderfully beautiful thing about Fievel Goes West is James Horner's immortal soundtrack. The songs are just as good as An American Tail, which is saying a lot; besides, you have a brutally edited reprise of Somewhere Out There from the first film, sung by Tanya. Speaking of Tanya, she's voiced by someone different, presumably to allow for her great singing. For proof, all you need to do is listen to Dreams To Dream. Great though the aspiring singer is, the end credits rendition of the song by the crazy Lindstradt lady is beautiful.In Fievel Goes West, our title protagonist is lost on the way to Green River, where he will supposedly find a new lease on life with his family and lots of other hopeful mice. But the dream is shattered when Fievel explores the train, and finds a bunch of cats and a huge spider, led by the smooth talking Cat R. Waul, plotting to befriend the mice before turning them into mouse-burgers by means of a mysterious better mousetrap! But Fievel is found out, and the spider knocks him off the train, leaving him hopelessly lost in the desert. I thought they might have made up something different, not the whole mouse-gets-lost-must-return-to-family routine. I couldn't help feeling they'd done that before. However, Dom DeLuise returns for a bigger part alongside the legendary canine sheriff Wylie Burp.So, overall, what of this sequel? Well, it certainly does the original justice. Yes, it does lack the heart of the original, but having less heart than An American Tail does in no way mean being heartless. Don Bluth might not have had a hand in this, but Fievel Goes West lives up to Bluth's classic story of a little mouse called Fievel.Animation-9\/10; Story-7\/10; Plot-7\/10; Comedy-8.5\/10 = Overall-8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2004","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Fievel, the cute little mouse from An American Tail, is going west for Fievel Goes West.
