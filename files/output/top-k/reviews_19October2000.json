It had me laughing all the way, from beginning, the hospital practice marriage all the way to the end! This story directed By Jay Roach (Who directed Austin powers 1 & 2) is original and hilarious. It revolves around Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). To make Pam fall in love with Greg was easy. Before Greg could propose, he figures he needs to get the parents' approval. So he goes to Pam's parents' house in long island. I know it's Long island because a certain scene was filmed in Manhasset.Greg tries to impress Pam's father (Robert DeNiro)and mother (Blythe Danner),but each step he tries to make,is one bad step he messes up. Then, Greg finds out he can't be with his future wife. He must sleep in the basement. He finds out Pam's father, jack Byrnes, is with the CIA, resulting in a very great game of.. Lie Detector. That's basically the plot, I don't want to spoil it for you.DeNiro gives a great as protective father with a cat,Ben Stiller in his best role ever, so far. Blythe Danner is marvelous, reminding me of Sissy Spacek from Blast From The past.DeNiro and Stiller have the funniest roles, and always give a good hearty laugh. I have never heard an audience laugh this hard. I watched the movie 5 times and I can't get enough of it! The audience roared with laughter at Stiller's funny antics, and DeNiro's comeback to shine.This movie is pure genius. Even better than Happy Gilmore. I can't help but laugh. My sides burst out as well! I recommend it to anyone. So if you haven't seen it on the big screen, see it NOW. Better than Scary movie. Scary Movie is nothing compared to Stiller and DeNiro. Two BIG stars, one great movie you have to see. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2000","score":"","review":"  When I first saw every preview, I'd think I've seen every joke there. But am I wrong!

In fact, if you look, everyone is cracking a grin in this film because Peter Sellers is a GAS! His disguises are far and away his best than in any of the films and the gags are still fresh (in future films some would become, unfortunately, overused and stale). This is the film that started the ball rolling for the 70s sequels to the ultra successful 60s achievements The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, the latter of which defined the archetypal Clouseau image. Years after A Shot In The Dark came this marvelous return to form, which I believe was never paralleled. Face it; after Return of the Pink Panther things just got WEIRD. Dreyfuss got pushed way over the edge; tacky, phony sci-fi elements were introduced; and then along came Dyan Cannon, the surefire Kiss of Death. In Return we have lots of great comedy with a certain restraint that keeps things believably eccentric, but never so over the top that you're shaking your head at the impossibility of any of it. No tacky sci-fi gags, etc. Later efforts became (by necessity) too broad and unbelievable, and at least in this feature there is a foothold on reality against which Clouseau's antics can be gauged; and absurdity is only truly funny when it is still held within a frame of believability. This film does it, beautifully, and the films to follow only have intermittently funny set pieces. The cast in this film is marvellous all-round, all very much normal against which Clouseau's ineptitude and silliness plays magnificently. The hotel room farce is among the best and most memorable of any comedy film I can recall (that poor masseuse!). Pure and true farce played well and with impeccible timing by all involved. And it is in this film we have the privilege of seeing Chief Inspector Dreyfuss slowly driven mad by Clouseau (again, films after this could only take Dreyfuss's madness for granted -- not nearly as funny). I'll never forget going to see this film in a theater with my mom and the both of us practically wetting our pants it was so funny. Return of the Pink Panther wears well, and is probably on my list of most favored films. I can watch Peter Sellers breaking door bells, repairing phernes, driving his truck into swimming pools, and acting the bon vivant as his ridiculous playboy character Guy over any of the later efforts! ;-) Watching this film over again is like visiting an old friend. Buy it for your collection, or at least rent it once in a while. It's good natured fun, and the best of the (later) Clouseaus.

He is a great actor; this movie doesn't deserve him.  I guess he was low on cash, and the script could have looked good on paper.Basically, if you want an entertaining yet stupid sub movie, rent this.

For international movies, Amores perros is but another piece of film noir gore rendering tape.Sexo Pudor y lagrimas, another example but of a different kind. in general I don't think Mexico will ever acquire the level we once had with comedy films like those with Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Joaquin Pardave, just to mention some. This is a shame, I'm twenty-six and can see that already.Mexico, wake up, we're still swimming in mud when it comes to film industry. Let's wait and see what other piece of c**p is rendered by our corrupted industry. Even more of a shame it s to acknowledge that this movie will become a school that will finish killing every instinct of a good movie with young filmmakers who get to break into Mexican cinema.Any objections, there you have my e-mail address so be my guest, I welcome all feedback.

I totally agree with it being an intelligent attempt to reach super production levels, of course, stealing ideas of Film Noir with no remorse. This comes as proof that Mexico, if attempting to ever reach a deeper level in cinema, have to rely in items that sell  Cruelty, blood, gore, etc... commercial items. nowhere good enough for a well-crafted story.

There is something very strange about these words because, if you ask me, no other movie stuffed up Hollywood more. I do, however, agree with all the above comments used by IMDb users, except one...Star Wars is not the greatest film of all time. Star Wars Special Edition is one of them. I believe it has the potential to be the greatest film  of all time, but we must wait for another update. I think there is more in Star Wars to be said tan any other film, but to actually say it would be doing it injustice. This is a film that you analyse to the nth degree but always come back to the same circuit of analysis.I can understand why some IMDb users didn't like this film. It is corny, predictable, slow-moving and more of a space opera than an action-adventure. But when you think about it, these are the things that make it so great, because we know what to expect and we are able to view it a million times over.To explain the storyline would also be injustice. There is an attention to detail so strong in this filom and all the others that takes our attention off the story and allows us to focus on the journey. Another reason is because it creates a world of such infinite possibilities, myths and legends that even a simple domestic dispute would make it interesting. This film tells the story in the most simple way, focusing mainly on the journey and letting the rest speak for itself (in some of the corniest one-liners ever).This is a gem. A real original film. It is unlike any film made before. It is inspired by the old Flash Gordon adventure serials but does not satirise them like Raiders of the Lost Ark. It does not even pay much homage to them. It just uses them as the basis for what unfolds - an epic, dramatic, operatic and elaborate masterpiece.Variety is another word I use to describe this film. There are more types of actors in this film than any other, from stage actors to character actors, traditional actors to method actors, puppets to computer generated...things. This movie has - and is - everything! It is traditional, yet before its time. It is original yet contrived. It is slow yet entertaining. It is objective yet subjective. How can anyone not like this film?No review of Star Wars would be complete without mentioning John Williams' musical score. That, to me, is what holds the film together. Without THAT music, it would have been a disaster. Yes, the special effects are superb. Not everything revolves around special effects, you know!I said at the beginning that this film stuffed up Hollywood more than any other. To be honest, I think that was a good thing. After a few decades, it took the attention off the place, which is what I think George Lucas would have wanted (I was never in Hollywood geographically). This was not the epitome of moviemaking. Hollywood just thought it was and has tried to make something better ever since.Critic Roger Ebert once said in an essay that Hollywood has given us three kinds of film genres the Western, the musical and film noir. In a strange way, Star Wars is all three of them and so are the other films. Yes, I think the other films are great. Yes, I thought The Phantom Menace was underrated. To be honest, I don't think George Lucas could go wrong and I think the updated versions of all SIX of the films will be superb. Maybe Star Wars will end up being the best film of all time!
