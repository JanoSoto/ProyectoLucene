Otherwise I don't really like Christmas movies, they all have the same let's make it touching slimy, greasy feel to them, and I feel a bit old for that. But this one - I found it very enjoyable, and - most surprisingly, even for myself - touching in a very special way.The story is about a poor family, especially about the mother, who doesn't believe in Christmas, and thus, doesn't like it. A Christmas angel is sent to make things right, and through a quite simple, but very twisting story (somewhere in the middle I was very surprised, and it got even better towards the end), he, of course, succeeds. The whole thing is so special, so unusual, so emotional - it's hard to describe. In the middle, just before you start to be bored by the poorness of the family - which is very deeply described, altogether with its impact on the parents' emotions -, the story breaks, and from then on, at first you'll be depressed (or at least, I was), and then, as the unbelieving mother gets back her faith, you're getting more and more cheerful too. I don't know how this film got to me so much, but it did, and since it's done in an unique way (not the usual cliches for kids), I don't mind at all.The positive aspects are Harry Dean Stanton (I saw him in Alien, and at first, it was very unlikely that he'll make a good angel after being eaten by a space monster ;) ) as Gideon, who is a perfect Christmas angel misterious, but very-very likeable, and you can't help feeling some simpathy for him from the beginning. At first, I thought about Mary Steenburgen as a negative point, but I figured that she was so annoying because it felt much more dramatic when she changed in the end, when she became a totally different, very nice person. Also, Elisabeth Harnois, playing Abbie, is very-very cute and plays just fine. And, I like the happy end - however, it's a Disney after all. )***Here come some major spoilers, be advised!*** Negative aspects are the happy end to begin with, however the change in the mothers beliefs is not quite realistic after you've lost your husband, and almost your kids as well, you're not gonna change because of a mere letter sent back by Santa. Also, the ending is VERY overdone in my opinion why does everybody got to be happy? Harry, the would-be robber getting 50 bucks is okay (he was a great character by the way, simple, but very original), but Herbie, the shop manager, keeping Ginny in and giving her a break - most unlikely. Why didn't she get a raise all of a sudden? Then I really would've shaken hands with the director... )) And, the very end with the money was also soooo predictable (however, it's the least I expected, so well done. ) )But hey, it's Christmas, you go all with these things, and don't get disturbed, 'cos it's a very-very nice movie after all, and once it starts to twist and turn, you begin to wait what's gonna happen next, even tough it has a pretty simple story. I really recommend this movie for everybody, even kids (despite someone mentioned the shooting scene... my message to worried parents concerning this movie Beware, reality may cause damage to your children's minds! )) ), and Christmas-movie-cliche haters, like me.

Let's get the flashlight and turn it on!In fact, had Sissy NOT done this, there would have been no story. Everything was hinged on her foolish actions. Junior would slam the door. Another stupid act.

We saw them right here.I guess Missy thought Rex was disrespectful of her vegetarianism because it ate the goat. Ah, she can go complain to ACLU.So what happens next? Sissy screams at Rex.

But John Carptenter's take on the revenge tale was somehow different. Perhaps it's the mixture of sea faring folklore combined with a brilliantly creepy musical score. Perhaps it's something else. All I know is this movie is genuinely frightening and entertaining. The supernatural elements of the film are believable. In fact, you even sympathize a little with the killers in this movie because they were indeed wronged.I strongly suggest renting this if you haven't seen it before. And if you have seen it and it's been a while, why not rediscover a classic horror movie from the golden age of the 1980s?

Hardcore Kitano fans might see this film as a mediocre work, but I would highly recommend this movie to everyone new and old to the Kitano movies.

I must admit that I found some of the words and quotes used by the characters in the film to be hilarious. However, the main things I hated to see were the black kids picking on and beating up on the white kids, and I especially hated to see Edward Furlong getting shot to death in the end (this was for no reason at all, if you ask me). It would've been something else if there were more to the movie (or perhaps a sequel) after Edward Furlong was shot, for the viewers would've known more about how Edward Norton (as well as the rest of the cast that made up the Vinyard family) dealt with it. Although this film is controversial and labeled as racist by some people, I personally think that it's a very strong and important film because it does tell the truth about how some parts of society operate.

Though don't for a second think I mean that in a bad way &#150; take 'Yellow Submarine' for example, the real animated feature of its age; cheerfully pacifist, and a glorious little flick that defines freakiness at its most dazzling and far-out.One of the hardest things about being the true-blue Beatles fan I am is admitting that 'Yellow Submarine' was undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made in their name (though 'A Hard Day's Night' makes for a close second).

I made the mistake of getting my hopes up over Grease 2. I didn't watch the entire thing, just the first 30 minutes, but I will say this I want my thirty minutes back.What little part of this film I saw, I watched while babysitting the kid next door. She's, what, five, give or take a year? And this is one of her favorite movies. I pity her. This movie is a piece of junk, no two ways about it! That's where the disappointment came in.Now, you may be wondering about the appalled part of my summary line. That's easily enough to explain. You see, the little girl I babysat has two older siblings--one about 8, and the other 10. They really like the movie too, and that bothers me. Some of the lines in the songs are very frank in their sexuality. That's not so bad for a five year old who simply won't understand them, or the equally suggestive dance moves that accompany them. A ten-year-old, however, will. I'll be the first to admit that I am literally one of the most liberal, open-minded people you'll ever meet, so it isn't the content itself that I object to. What bothers me is that it's contained within a musical that people let their kids sit down in watch without thinking to worry (since the parents themselves probably wouldn't be able to stomach much more than the first 10 minutes). What I'm basically saying is this the movie might amuse very small children that aren't paying attention to the lyrics. The tunes themselves aren't too bad, and the dancing can be amusing, especially when you *aren't* paying attention to the lyrics. Older children--about ages 7\/8 to, oh, 11, probably don't need to watch this.

The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy futuristic effects we are seeing today.  The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film, he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards.  The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup, they shadow it in as much darkness as possible, cover it in mudd and grime, which hides what could have been very obvious makeup guy in a suit effects.  The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature, to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end.  Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.As we watch the downfall of summer popcorn movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.

The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy futuristic effects we are seeing today.  The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film, he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards.  The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup, they shadow it in as much darkness as possible, cover it in mudd and grime, which hides what could have been very obvious makeup guy in a suit effects.  The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature, to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end.  Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.As we watch the downfall of summer popcorn movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.
