God, I had to turn off 'Gettysburg' after a few scenes. A lot of scenes are simply pedantic, and they assume that all the viewers are history morons who don't know jack about the battle. In terms of drama, or lack thereof, let's all remember the scene where Colonel Chamberlain (one of the pivotal figures in the Civil War), takes on those rag-tag, near deserters near the beginning. Where is the drama?! Where is the conflict? The film is simply rampant with a lot of melodramatic scenes such as this. Most of the battle scenes look like they were made by high-school film crew; they lack any suspense, build-up, and suffer from awful direction and editing. The acting is so-so, but these talented actors were burdened with such a mediocre script. If you want to study an excellent war movie script, just download 'Saving Private Ryan'...

Real nice. Except it was not the first movie to do so. It sure became more popular than the rest, perhaps because of the spectacular fighting scenes. I agree with others that here fighting is not per se; however, we see way much more of it than needed to bring the message home. No, let's face it all the fighting scenes (and the half-naked shots of Brad Pitt) were included to sell the movie.There are certainly good things about it - my six stars mainly go to the acting, both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, but also my rarely-seen favorite Meat Loaf. His character, and in fact the whole beginning of the film is really creative. The problem is, towards the end it gets too creative - the twist of the story is downright stupid, and not exactly credible looking back. To me it feels like they had to find a solution and couldn't think of a better one. It was not even a new idea - Oscar Wilde used it, to mention just one.As for the message of the film what disturbed me most was its stereotypical, traditional masculinity. The idea that there is some innate violence in men (not women - they are hardly present, except for sex objects or dying cancer patients), and this is supposedly a good thing, a way to escape being controlled by the System. Also, the popular (but false) belief that you can get rid of your tension\/aggression by expressing it in, for example, fighting sports (whereas research shows that violence raises adrenalin levels and leads to more aggressivity). It (re?-)creates a myth of masculinity, where real men are fighters who torture themselves and each other; men who have emotions and even express them are so feminine they even have breasts. I see some danger in this movie becoming a cult film.What I did learn from this film I think it gives some insight into how people can be recruited to support an oppressive, destructive system, such as in Nazi Germany. The way the terrorist brigade evolving from the Fight Club functions is a pretty credible image of this process.

The general consensus- on which one might dub a film like Rebel Without a Cause overrated- is that this film is THE film on teenage angst and dislocation from the adults of the period, and that it's essential because of James Dean, or that it might be considered director Nicholas Ray's best film. For me though, essential is a very subjective term, and one person's essential being this film is another one's essential being Bigger Than Life or In a Lonely Place, films that get some notice in the film circles but not enough when placed against a film like the one here. It's the kind of picture I end up recommending, but not exactly under the terminology of how I would find it to be essential or not, because I don't really. It's not a sort of seminal, staggeringly entertaining and artistically satisfying work about being an outsider in the 50s like On the Waterfront or even one most people wouldn't think of like Ikiru. From a historical perspective, however, and for the significance of James Dean, it is worth a viewing, at least once, if you want to know at least what the industry leaned towards in the 50s.Now, on to the actual film- it's the story of Jim Stark, who is disaffected and with a sort of glow about him (if glow is the word, maybe just, um, malaise), and its more of a reflection on his parents (Jim Backus, who is actually quite good here, and Ann Doran as his mother) than on society as a whole. Not that society doesn't have a part in Jim's emotional downward spiral. He's a kid who ends up getting connected to violence ('Don't call me chicken' is coined famously, and maybe unintentionally amusingly, by Dean in this film), and all the while Dean plays him very calmly and coolly, with his big emotional bursts strong and piercing. But as I've yet to see his other two big cinematic roles in East of Eden or Giant, I can't compare one to the other or not. On its own, his turn today almost borders on being too melodramatic, even too stuck in the period (Brando, as mentioned before, had the 'normalcy of detachment and cool' down to a T unlike Dean here who is good if not great). He's followed along by compelling supporting work by Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood, as equally disaffected youth, but in different ways that end up clinging the three of them together.The story, as much as it tries to, isn't really as convincing as it tries to be, and unfortunately to me doesn't hold up like it should. The convincing bits are still there, and some scenes are revelatory into the little things about teenagers, like the trip inside the planetarium- no matter how tough they think they are or act or anything, they can still be amazed by some things, the unknown that is. And the fight that happens after-wards- along with the 'chickie' drag race at night that leads to a tragic turn of events- are classic Ray-directed moments. But the classically trained style of film-making by Ray, with the level of subversion still there under the surface of the immediate context, isn't as fulfilling when given to the story and characters and acting. Some characters are just outright silly or so one-dimensional that you can't believe someone like Dean's character would have to deal with them at all. Even an emotionally complex scene like the it's tearing me apart speech doesn't hit quite as hard as it might have in 1955. By the end of it all, I knew Rebel Without a Cause was worth viewing, but as an immediate masterwork of the Hollywood system? I'm not really sure on that, and certainly not if one's talking about essentials from the director.

He's followed along by compelling supporting work by Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood, as equally disaffected youth, but in different ways that end up clinging the three of them together.The story, as much as it tries to, isn't really as convincing as it tries to be, and unfortunately to me doesn't hold up like it should. The convincing bits are still there, and some scenes are revelatory into the little things about teenagers, like the trip inside the planetarium- no matter how tough they think they are or act or anything, they can still be amazed by some things, the unknown that is. And the fight that happens after-wards- along with the 'chickie' drag race at night that leads to a tragic turn of events- are classic Ray-directed moments. But the classically trained style of film-making by Ray, with the level of subversion still there under the surface of the immediate context, isn't as fulfilling when given to the story and characters and acting. Some characters are just outright silly or so one-dimensional that you can't believe someone like Dean's character would have to deal with them at all.

The general consensus- on which one might dub a film like Rebel Without a Cause overrated- is that this film is THE film on teenage angst and dislocation from the adults of the period, and that it's essential because of James Dean, or that it might be considered director Nicholas Ray's best film. For me though, essential is a very subjective term, and one person's essential being this film is another one's essential being Bigger Than Life or In a Lonely Place, films that get some notice in the film circles but not enough when placed against a film like the one here. It's the kind of picture I end up recommending, but not exactly under the terminology of how I would find it to be essential or not, because I don't really. It's not a sort of seminal, staggeringly entertaining and artistically satisfying work about being an outsider in the 50s like On the Waterfront or even one most people wouldn't think of like Ikiru. From a historical perspective, however, and for the significance of James Dean, it is worth a viewing, at least once, if you want to know at least what the industry leaned towards in the 50s.Now, on to the actual film- it's the story of Jim Stark, who is disaffected and with a sort of glow about him (if glow is the word, maybe just, um, malaise), and its more of a reflection on his parents (Jim Backus, who is actually quite good here, and Ann Doran as his mother) than on society as a whole. Not that society doesn't have a part in Jim's emotional downward spiral. He's a kid who ends up getting connected to violence ('Don't call me chicken' is coined famously, and maybe unintentionally amusingly, by Dean in this film), and all the while Dean plays him very calmly and coolly, with his big emotional bursts strong and piercing. But as I've yet to see his other two big cinematic roles in East of Eden or Giant, I can't compare one to the other or not.

The second time I watched it it didn't feel slow at all, and I found myself more impressed with it.The movie revolves around three gunmen looking for a fortune of gold hidden in a cemetery during the Civil War. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (The Good)a guy who though not really good, has probably the most morals of the three and a sense of honor. Eli Wallach plays Toco, (The Ugly). He is a man looking out for himself and nobody else, but I never got the sense that he was totally evil. Selfish and distrustful but not outright bad. That's probably why Toco is the most beloved of the three. He also gives the best performance in the movie. Then we have Lee Van Cleef who stars as Angel Eyes (The Bad). His character name is totally misleading because he is the most outright evil of all three.Each of these characters knows a bit of information about the gold, and so they have to rely on each other to find the location. Of course neither one is inclined to share. So this all leads to an ending which boasts one the best showdowns in any cowboy western.Though the story is mainly about these three characters, director Sergio Leone never lets us forget about the horrors involved with war. Even though these three men are hunting for treasure, the war surrounding them as they make their way is shown in good detail to remind us what it might have been like back in those times. It is definitely a great movie.On top of all this, Sergio Leone is an expert with the camera. He uses close up shots of character's facial features where we see every tick and expression, but he is also able to expand out and give us panoramic views of the land surrounding these people. The opening scenes were excellent, as were so many more that followed.

Unfortunately, it's not all that good, either. The director, along with his production team have created a unique and amazing world in Sweethaven, populated by bizarre and amusing live-action cartoon characters. It's an awesome film just to look at. Unfortunately, the script is very weak. I wonder if Altman insisted upon his regular method of film-making, in coming up with a lot of it on the spot, having his actors create the scenes. It feels like there was at least some level of improvisation, and it doesn't work because these characters are all two-dimensional cartoons. Neither Altman nor the actors are ever able to convince that these people are real, even in their fantasy world. When asked to improvise, I imagine the actors had a hard time imagining what their characters' motivations were, as there's not much psychology in your average Popeye cartoon. A lot of the characters' interactions consist of moaning, shouting and jumping up and down angrily and it gets annoying. The film might also have worked better if the music were better. Harry Nilsson's songs are almost all poor, except for the two performed by Shelley Duvall, perhaps only because Duvall's Olive Oyl voice sounds so good in song (remember how brilliantly P.T.

The lines and the emoting in this film are pretty close to being hammy at times,and the volume of characters crammed in here suggests that there may have been more to this novel than the movie allowed for,but I suppose that may be unavoidable.

(They're pretty crummy, what with patients having to pay for their own medical care from a corrupt doctor, insurance premiums paid to cover non-existent tractors but not collapsing roofs.) After ten or fifteen minutes he reveals his true identity and begins snapping out orders and cleaning things up. At this point it's rather like Superman emerging from the phone booth that Clark Kent entered, or Destry finally picking up a gun.But Redford learns that prisons, like wars, must operate within political constraints. He is told of a field full of buried bodies and begins to dig them up, despite the entreaties of his political friends and advisers, who try to talk him out of it or buy him off with the prison improvements he's been fighting for. It's not even clear that the bodies have been illegally buried, much less murdered as he suspects. The place used to be a pauper's graveyard, he's told.But nothing will wreck a reform agenda faster than zealotry. Before you can say Reign of Terror, Redford is relieved of his job and is driven away -- to the sad but appreciative applause of the prisoners he's leaving behind. That should leave the viewer uplifted alright.What a complicated and dynamic place a prison must be to be properly run. Some of the inmates have been railroaded but most of them have been (or have become) the cold-blooded psychopaths they're so often labeled. A warden must walk a tightrope between seeing that the men are treated decently but not given Jacuzzis. Redford, as it turns out, has pretty good balance in this regard, but if he were really concerned about getting his job done he would have compromised and stopped digging quite so hard.Nice cast of supporting players. Jane Alexander is always good. Matt Clark is effectively devious as Redford's clerk (he's about the only inmate who can read and write) who participates in the murder of a helpless and naive old prisoner. Redford is about as authoritative as he can be in his minimalist way. He's not George C. Scott playing Patton.The movie rolls along smoothly and takes us with it. We WANT Redford to succeed. But the box-office stuff just doesn't ring true. The sudden emergence of Redford's latent identity as the warden, a shootout with shotguns resulting in two deaths, the inmates applauding and whistling for the disgraced warden as he leaves. It detracts from the more important story and leaves us happy but with an armful of unanswered questions. (Just who ARE those guys buried on prison property?) The inmates may now respect themselves as human beings, as Redford claims, but how long will it take the new replacement warden to reduce them to their original rags and despondency?

That should leave the viewer uplifted alright.What a complicated and dynamic place a prison must be to be properly run. Some of the inmates have been railroaded but most of them have been (or have become) the cold-blooded psychopaths they're so often labeled. A warden must walk a tightrope between seeing that the men are treated decently but not given Jacuzzis. Redford, as it turns out, has pretty good balance in this regard, but if he were really concerned about getting his job done he would have compromised and stopped digging quite so hard.Nice cast of supporting players. Jane Alexander is always good. Matt Clark is effectively devious as Redford's clerk (he's about the only inmate who can read and write) who participates in the murder of a helpless and naive old prisoner. Redford is about as authoritative as he can be in his minimalist way. He's not George C. Scott playing Patton.The movie rolls along smoothly and takes us with it. We WANT Redford to succeed. But the box-office stuff just doesn't ring true. The sudden emergence of Redford's latent identity as the warden, a shootout with shotguns resulting in two deaths, the inmates applauding and whistling for the disgraced warden as he leaves. It detracts from the more important story and leaves us happy but with an armful of unanswered questions. (Just who ARE those guys buried on prison property?) The inmates may now respect themselves as human beings, as Redford claims, but how long will it take the new replacement warden to reduce them to their original rags and despondency? I wish it had been better, though it's involving enough. It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg who injected a lot more life into Don Pearce's Cool Hand Luke. Pearce, by the way, like Warden Brubaker, was a true original. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"4 December 2006","score":"","review":" A very good movie. A classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of aliens. We see the Rebel Alliance leaders and much of the Imperial forces. The Emperor is somewhat an original character. I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and...his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. I felt there was much more than meets the eye. And as always the John William's music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe.
