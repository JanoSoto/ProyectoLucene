I only heard somewhere that it's a good movie. I didn't know anything about the director,cast or the plot. From the title I supposed it might just be another stupid teen-comedy. How totally I was astonished! All kudos should go to the first-time director (and screenwriter as well) who in some intelligent and charming way done this uniqe movie. The plot of the movie is a real awesome puzzle as the story runs towards the end of the movie. On the other side the director couldn't handle all this without some magnificent cast. Jake Gyllenhaal's title role is one of the best young actor-role in recent history. Playing a boy with some real problems with his personality he gave us some haunting and mature performance. Right next to him is awesome young actress Jena Malone, which amazing talent we could see f.i. in Contact as young Ellie Arroway. There is a magical chemistry between Gretchen Ross(Malone) and Donnie when we see their relationship on the screen. The director shows an impressive sensivity while filming those scenes. Gyllenhaal and Malone are supported by some old veterans like Mary McDonnell, Katherine Ross and Patrick Swayze in very not-in-his-style role. The strong vocals used in score of the film (piece Ave Maria) make this movie both unforgettable and moving. The picture also brings us a great feeling of the 80's (the time setting of the film) also by using the songs from those times. We've got to do here also with time travels and problem of our destination, but I won't reveal anything here about that ) .The brilliant combination of sci-fi and romance led this film straight to the bests of just begun decade. The next day after watching it I must see again some key-scenes to partly understand the amazing idea created by Richard Kelly, and right now I'm not sure of understanding every detail of this incredible story, because my mind is still full of questions. I'm looking very much forward to the next film of Richard Kelly, who did here some ethereal job. I'm recommending this one for everybody who are searching some really true emotions in cinema, not only f\/xs and shootouts which feed us today's movies. And sometimes it is really worth not seeing any trailers and knowing anything about the movie. I consider this one along with Memento and A.I. as the best picture of 2001. Truly memorable.

So, as the story goes, he selected three scripts that were about to go into production and gave them to Disney Music Maestro Alan Menken and asked him which of the scripts could be turned into a musical.And that's how NEWSIES was born.It's a great story, too, being a fictionalized account of the newsboy strike in New York at the turn of the century.  It follows the exploits of a ragtag band of teenage boys, including Cowboy (Christian Bale), who dreams of becoming a ranch hand in Santa Fe, and David & Les (David Moscow & Luke Edwards), brothers who take up selling newspapers when their father is injured on the job.Conflict arises when Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duval) gets greedy and raises the price of his newspapers to the newsboys, but not to the public.  The outraged newsies decide to go on strike, which eventually galvanizes all the working children in the city to stand up for themselves.It's a fun film, with Duval playing his villain to the hilt, but Ann-Margret is wasted in her role as a showgirl (both of her musical numbers are badly edited down to just snippets of song).  Bale is the real wonder here, though, singing and dancing with surprising aplomb.  The songs overall are quite good, but a couple of them are hard to distinguish from each other. My favorites are the opening number, Carrying the Banner, and the rousing The World Will Know.  It seems odd, though, that Duval doesn't get a musical number of his own, considering in Disney's animated musicals the villains usually get the best songs (Poor Unfortunate Souls or Be Prepared anyone?).It's a shame that the film didn't do better financially, since as a result of its dismal box office Disney declined to ever make another like it. First time director Kenny Ortega, who also choreographed (he was known for his choreography of DIRTY DANCING), directed one more feature after this, the underrated Bette Midler flick HOCUS POCUS; since that film also failed to find an audience, he hasn't directed a movie since.

Well, not this user.  I didn't see the 1968 version of this film, I like everything Charlize Theron is in, I think Keanu Reeves is fun to watch, even though he will never be recognized as one of our great actors. My wife and I enjoyed Sweet November. Sure, the premise is far-fetched, and the storyline is manipulated to get them together, but tell me which fictional movie doesn't rely on these very same things. Not too long ago American Beauty won best picture. A far-fetched premise? You bet. A manipulated storyline? No doubt.Charlize Theron is beautiful to look at, and she is one of our fine young actresses, in the same league as Angelina Jolie. The only flaw is that her character probably should have been a bit more ordinary-looking.

Simply put, he was all right, but the movie itself was rather weak and uninspired.The first thing I wondered about was the premise. A teenage girl is murdered in a place called Nightmute, Alaska, and the local police department there calls upon the LAPD for assistance, who end up sending two detectives to help out - Dormer (Al Pacino) and Eckhardt (Martin Donovan). They have no detectives in Alaska? I mean I'm sure that murder isn't especially common up there but they had no one who could help? The cities of Anchorage or Juneau wouldn't have had a detective who knew something about  murder investigations? I just thought that whole idea was problematic.Second problem was the characters themselves. Frankly speaking, there wasn't a single likeable character in the whole movie. There was no one to root for. There was killer Finch (Williams), irritating hero-worshiping local Alaska cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) - no wonder they had to go out of state - corrupt Dormer (Pacino) and his squealing partner Eckhardt (Donovan.) Is there anyone here to feel sympathy with? NO!Third problem was the storyline revolving around the title. Yes, Pacino has the right look for a guy who's gone 6 days without sleep. But so what? The movie would have worked just as well if Dormer had been well rested, but we have to have this story about how it's hard to sleep when one first goes to Alaska in the summer because the sun is always up. OK. That's exciting.Anything good about this movie? Well, the opening musical score was quite good and really drew me in (until the movie actually started anyway); it sets the tone quite well for a suspense cop thriller. Problem is there's not a lot of suspense or thrills coming up. And Williams came across well in this very out of character role for him.

The boy wanted to be like the risk takers, but it got out of hand.  When the boy jumped, he got hurt.  The cops showed up, and the teenagers started to scram, and left the boy there to die. On Monday at Beauford High, the principal punished Landon Carter who got caught.  He was to tutor a young student at a poor school, and participate in the Drama Clubs Spring Play.  Jamie Sullivan was known as an out cast, because she wasn't like everyone else.    Everybody, including Landon, would make fun, of her.  But, when Landon was punished, they were brought together, and he asked her for some help.  They started to work together, and he started to see her as a real person, and even fell in love.  One day at school, his friends cut out her head from a yearbook picture.  They put it on a picture of a girl in a bathing suit.  They past it around school, and when Jamie saw it she got up set.  When Landon saw it, he grabbed her, and left school, and took her home.  He quit talking to his friends.  They went on a date to a restaurant.  Then they walked by the ocean where she told him her dream to be married where her mother and father was married.  Afterwards, he told her that he loved her.  She got upset, and told him he couldn't love her.  He was hurt and didn't understand why until later, when she told him that she had cancer.  He got upset and didn't come around for a couple days.  When the other kids found out, they were so sorry for what they said, and felt sorry for her.  He decided that he wanted to make her dream come true.  He bought rings, and then asked her to marry him, and she accepted.  They were married, and got to spend one summer together before.The intention was to teach us that cancer is not something anyone can see or get from others.  The director was also trying to show a person who has cancer that they should be brave, to love or hurt someone, and live life to its fullest.

Some just don't understand what the movie was about, so they try to find a different interpretation than the obvious meaning.People wonder why a destructive situation like infidelity could have entered the lives of a couple whose lives seemed perfect, a couple who had a plush mansion outside New York and a son that makes them both happy, without a shadow in their future, a couple who have stylish suppers, go to charity meetings and engage in long love sessions.  Most critics also wonder why a woman like Connie Summer (Diane Lane,) who has control over her life and is envied by her friends, is capable of cheating on her husband (a very successful man) with a Frenchman, accepting this devastating and dangerous affair, derailing the emotional stability, quiet and prudence of her marriage and violating her husband's trust.They also wonder why even in the most wonderful couples infidelity comes like an unexpected virus that, on occasions like this, leads to the most tragic results.Inspired by a French classic by Claude Chabrol, `La femme infidele'( `The Unfaithful Woman'), this Hollywood story about one of the worst things that can happen to people, begins with a simple premise to be unfaithful, a man or a woman doesn't need to be unhappy with their mate or suffer from dysfunctions or sexual disappointments or be going through unresolvable crises or facing situations that are out of control. It's simply enough that the opportunity to be unfaithful is presented to the woman.  In this case, she accepts the risk while fully realizing she can get very hurt.The opportunity comes with a background of New York streets full of galleries, bookstores, art theaters and small restaurants.  The woman is walking along loaded down with a lot of bags.  She's struck by the heavy wind and runs into a man (Olivier Martinez) carrying a lot of books.  They help each other and he invites her to his place to wipe the blood off her knees; they exchange nice words, he gives her a poetry book and they say goodbye to each other.  When she calls him to say thanks, he invites her to his place again.Fox asked the director to have the couple go through a crisis so that the infidelity would have an acceptable cause and the decision of the husband at the end of the movie would be clear.  It seems like Lynne preferred an ambiguous ending.The cinematography in `Unfaithful,' like that of most of Lynne's movies, is so vivid that it makes you almost able to smell the bodies of the three main characters, and it allows you to travel over the skin of Diane Lane.  The New York atmosphere is well created too. After the deceit and the some mild erotic scenes, the provocations, the reaction of the husband and the behavior of the lover, the viewer is left with a bitter sensation.  The cruelty is not that the woman derails everything for her sexual addiction to the Frenchman, but to realize that infidelity has helped her to know how little, after many years of being a married couple, the two people know each other, how little grasp they have of each other's inner worlds.  A selfish, irresistible stranger had to appear to make them learn to talk frankly to each other and look each other in the eyes.Despite its good qualities, the movie was a disappointment.  It doesn't make clear what it wants to show.  Some of the scenes with Lane are unnecessary.  She seems to think that showing her naked body will save her, but it doesn't.  Perhaps she saves us from tedium, but that's all. The whole movie is farfetched and it doesn't have a message where we all can learn something good from. 3\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"5 December 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  All viewers wonder about the ending of `Unfaithful.'

(Stumpy to Cobb) realized what he was doing in telling this story, how much of himself and his own dilemma he was revealing. Frustrated because Cobb has final editorial approval of the biography in progress, Stump tells us in voice-over that he decided to do the one thing that Cobb never did -- lie. He would write one bio almost solely about baseball for Cobb to read, and another secret one, hidden away on scraps, that showed the real man and would be published after Cobb's death, which is never far away. How can Stump make the statement that Cobb never lied? He seems to lie about anything, whenever the whim moves him, including the darkest aspects of his character determinants. Exaggerration, dissembling, hiding or shading the truth, it happens all the time with Cobb. Even about baseball, which was the most important thing in his life. He's dismissive of people like Babe Ruth. When Stump forces him to say SOMEthing good about the man, Cobb allows, He could run okay -- for a fat man. It leaves us wondering just how much of the story we're watching is true and how much was limned and polished after the fact since, after all, what Joyce Carol Oates called pathographies sell much better than hagiographies. We'd rather read about a bastard than a saint. It's corrupted our scholarship, but never mind. The movie is made watchable by Jones' performance. That's about it. Lolita Davidovitch is beautiful but her part is almost unnecessary. Stumpy combines nicely a particularly kind of Jewish Angst with an equally ethnic tendency to be pushed only so far before counterattacking on his own behalf. (I don't think I minded him as much as some other commentators seem to have.)The script doesn't give poor Jones much to do except mutate into a Teppischfresser every few minutes, screaming, shouting, laughing hysterically, shooting off pistols, and in general carrying on like some animal in a zoo. He's given scenes that are simply not true to the character as otherwise written. Visiting his daughter's house in his home town, he sits in the car and watches while she looks out the window, identifies him, and draws the curtains closed. Tears trickle down his cheeks, but why? He hasn't bothered to contact her for fifteen years. A family get-together while they sit around the dinner table and trade compliments? The Cobb we see in the rest of the film wouldn't have given a damn about his daughter or anyone else except himself. But maybe it has something to do with facing mortality. If so, it's not made clear. Still, the most affecting scene is one in which Cobb begins to vomit blood and cough up lung tissue in a motel bathroom. This is how it starts, he mutters to his mirror image. This is what it looks like. He might be scared as hell but he's never sorry for anything he's done and has no capacity for self pity. Some people may find this trait -- not sparing anyone's feelings -- admirable. I don't. Social life is a tissue of lies from beginning to end, and if you don't make some minimal effort to play by this simple and somewhat silly rule of the game -- well, others are liable to treat you as if you had slid into second base wearing shoes with razor-sharp cleats. Al grows to like this old curmudgeon, but let's not forget that Cobb was Al's meal ticket.

Visiting his daughter's house in his home town, he sits in the car and watches while she looks out the window, identifies him, and draws the curtains closed. Tears trickle down his cheeks, but why? He hasn't bothered to contact her for fifteen years. A family get-together while they sit around the dinner table and trade compliments? The Cobb we see in the rest of the film wouldn't have given a damn about his daughter or anyone else except himself. But maybe it has something to do with facing mortality. If so, it's not made clear. Still, the most affecting scene is one in which Cobb begins to vomit blood and cough up lung tissue in a motel bathroom. This is how it starts, he mutters to his mirror image. This is what it looks like. He might be scared as hell but he's never sorry for anything he's done and has no capacity for self pity. Some people may find this trait -- not sparing anyone's feelings -- admirable. I don't. Social life is a tissue of lies from beginning to end, and if you don't make some minimal effort to play by this simple and somewhat silly rule of the game -- well, others are liable to treat you as if you had slid into second base wearing shoes with razor-sharp cleats. Al grows to like this old curmudgeon, but let's not forget that Cobb was Al's meal ticket. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"5 December 2002","score":"9 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" I wonder if Al Stump (Stumpy to Cobb) realized what he was doing in telling this story, how much of himself and his own dilemma he was revealing. Frustrated because Cobb has final editorial approval of the biography in progress, Stump tells us in voice-over that he decided to do the one thing that Cobb never did -- lie. He would write one bio almost solely about baseball for Cobb to read, and another secret one, hidden away on scraps, that showed the real man and would be published after Cobb's death, which is never far away. How can Stump make the statement that Cobb never lied? He seems to lie about anything, whenever the whim moves him, including the darkest aspects of his character determinants. Exaggerration, dissembling, hiding or shading the truth, it happens all the time with Cobb. Even about baseball, which was the most important thing in his life. He's dismissive of people like Babe Ruth. When Stump forces him to say SOMEthing good about the man, Cobb allows, He could run okay -- for a fat man. It leaves us wondering just how much of the story we're watching is true and how much was limned and polished after the fact since, after all, what Joyce Carol Oates called pathographies sell much better than hagiographies. We'd rather read about a bastard than a saint. It's corrupted our scholarship, but never mind. The movie is made watchable by Jones' performance. That's about it. Lolita Davidovitch is beautiful but her part is almost unnecessary. Stumpy combines nicely a particularly kind of Jewish Angst with an equally ethnic tendency to be pushed only so far before counterattacking on his own behalf.
