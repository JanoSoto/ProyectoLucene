It transcends all efforts made before and after it. What we have here truly is the great American film. The black and white cinematography is to die for. Kane is by far the most visually appealing film ever made. I find something new in it's shadows with each viewing and it takes a really great film to offer that to a viewer. American movie making really owes it all to Kane. It really is the only film I can think of that fails to break into a sense of monotony. And of course Welles' performance must be praised. Here we have a twenty six year old man fresh off of a lucrative stage career make a seamless transition into film. To see Charles Foster Kane is to see the perfection of characterization. There are no loose ends with this character he is wrapped perfectly. Of course he is a metaphor for the joys and evils of capitalism. We must ask and why did he become what he did? The great thing about Kane is that it still proposes questions that require answers.howIn each viewing of Kane I just think to myself what bias cinema come to? There was a time when motion picture making was a challenge and it meant something. Kane should be studied because it is a perfect film. It gives the viewer something to think about and yet offers dynamic characters. And to think the lobotomized masses of American cinema goers would rather be watching a Transformers film. Now there's a series I would care to forget about. I mean what kind of movie has stupid robots? And that isn't even the problem with those poor excuses for celluloid. Each film in that series is a blood curdling experience. I absolutely hate the parent characters and Shia whatever his name is. The racial stereotypes are offensive and the idea of a Transformer heaven where Shia goes to in the first sequel is beyond ridiculous. I mean come on! And what about that stupid government organization? Really? You expect me to believe that they were able to keep a giant robot within the Hoover dam without nobody knowing about it? Or how about the fact that they actually had the transformer ship crash into the moon? You might infer that some telescope would catch wind of it. And the actor they got to play John Kennedy in the beginning of the film was doing the worst stereotypical Massachusetts accent ever. Transformers is dumbing down America pure and simple. All it exists to do is sell toys to idiot kids. Michael Bay makes millions of dollars while Orson Welles was abandoned by the Hollywood system. Really! It infuriates me.

A movie about cross-dressing homosexuals just clearly isn't everybody's cup of tea. But the homosexual aspects of the movie really wasn't to me what the movie was all about really. I saw it more as an ode to all of the free-spirited and open-minded people of this world. People who are simply doing their thing because they like it and feel comfortable that way, no matter what everybody else says or thinks about it and those who respect people for being 'different' and not living by the normal rules and standards. It's all what makes our world even more divers and also more of a joy to live on.And that's really the foremost thing I got out of this movie. The story itself seems to be secondary, since it's a quite simple one and can be seen as a typical road trip movie, in which the main characters come across all kinds of persons, get into trouble, while traveling through Australia. And as far as road trip movies go; this isn't the best example of it that I have ever seen. You feel that with some better writing the movie could had been a bit more fun and clever and witty to watch.One thing I also wasn't too fond about was its pacing. It's often going way to fast, which causes some things to not develop- or make an impact properly enough. You could perhaps 'blame' it on the fact that this is of course different from a normal Hollywood movie, since it's of course an Australian production, that uses a completely different approach and way of storytelling. I often have similar sort of problems with other Australian movies, so perhaps it's fair to say that I'm just not the biggest fan of Australian cinema.But still another thing that I can highly respect and appreciate this movie for is its acting, or rather said the courage and professionalism that the actor's show in this movie. The three main leads, who are all in drag throughout basically the entire movie, are being played by Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. All three very manly and tough looking men in real life, who also have families of their own and clearly aren't homosexual. Yet they have absolutely no problem with it to show themselves from a more vulnerable side and also aren't afraid to walk, talk and act like as if they are actual females. I really respect it when an actor does this and plays a character that is totally the opposite of who he or she is. You could of course question it though if Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving would had still agreed on their roles if they had been the well known and much acclaimed actors that they are today. Not that they now would complain about this movie though, since it was the one that put them in the international spotlights and they have appeared in many big Hollywood projects ever since. The haven't forgot about their home country though, since every now and then they still appear in an Australian production. It was also refreshing by the way to hear them speak in their natural accents but it's arguably still Terence Stamp who steals the show, as the elder, once very successful drag queen, with still the very deep and distinctive Terence Stamp voice.So ultimately not a perfect movie, that I could still really enjoy and appreciate for the way it was handling and celebrating its themes.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" While I wasn't crazy about the movie, I could still really appreciate it for everything it did- and the way it handled its themes.Seems that it are mostly the persons who can't handle the movie its themes are the ones who don't like this movie.

To start, we have the late and great John Hughes directing and writing this hilarious film. Then there are the two stars of the film which have more than staked their claim as comedy legends. Steve Martin and John Candy, another late legend, couldn't have been more perfect here. Planes, Trains, & Automobiles is a wild and wacky story about a man who is just trying to get home for the holidays. Steve Martin plays Neal Page, and uptight businessman who desperately needs to make it home in time for Thanksgiving dinner. He has his first run in with John Candy's character, Del Griffith, when Del steals his cab. But then, through extreme coincidence, he ends up sitting next to Del on the flight back to Chicago. Del is a talkative, loudmouthed, shower ring curtain salesman who Neal initially wishes had never stumbled into his life. When the plane has to make an emergency landing because of the snow, Neal reluctantly teams up with Del to find a way back to Chicago. Hilarity and wackiness ensue in this uproariously fantastic comedy.This is the kind of movie that if you hate it in any way you must not be human. I mean, what's not to like about this charming, hilarious, and even heartfelt film. It's not a gross out comedy, it's not overly vulgar, and it's not the kind of film that is only about the jokes, leaving the story to rot. It's a comedy for everyone. It's an honest, funny, and heartwarming film about friendship in the most unorthodox of places. It's a situational comedy that never gets dull and every scene strives to be more absurd and ridiculous as the previous.

But he hones the other side of the comedy spectrum so well and it fits perfectly with John Candy's character. Candy plays his character at such a perfect level. He is over-the-top, but not to the point where he is a gimmick, rather than a character. We see this role in comedy duo films all the time now, but the role John Candy plays in Planes, Trains, & Automobiles is always played up way too much and everything they do is just for a laugh, not to develop a character. Candy's portrayal of Del Griffith is just weird enough to make his a very bizarre character, but not ridiculous enough to keep him from being incredibly lovable.However, I'm always struck with a tinge of sadness when I grow to love a John Candy character because his absence from the comedy world is painfully depressing. The world lost a genius in 1994 and it's incredibly sad to think where his career could have gone if he hadn't been taken from us. However, there is a lot of rejoice and consolation in the fact that we can preserve Candy's memory through great films like Planes, Trains, & Automobiles.

And it's just the beginning of this epic trilogy. This has got to be one of the best trilogy I have ever seen. Peter Jackson did a amazing job with the adaptation from a classic book to the big screen. I don't see how anyone else would have directed this movie any better. This movie is just beautiful plain and simple, from the gorgeous landscape to the vivid and fantasy like atmosphere. I have just never seen a movie like this before and seeing in theaters when it first came out was a amazing experience. If you like movies this is a movie that most definitely shouldn't be missed. But I highly recommend anyone that watches this movie to see the extended edition most definitely. It has important bits that was missing from when it was released in theaters. Which is mostly the fellowship and bonding aspect of it all and these are really important fellowship scenes. It literally helps in understanding the characters a lot better and why the characters are the way they are. And it will help understand the future installments a lot better as well. Anyways I highly recommend anyone that want to experience this epic and amazing journey to watch the extended edition, it really does add a lot to the film. The movie is more than just about a group of warriors and villagers such as humans, hobbits, elves and dwarfs getting together to fight there way to destroy a ring of power that was created by an evil villain Sauron. Although that is the main plot there is just way more to this movie and has important messages. This story is just simply well crafted into a movie and has epic written all over it. The actors that played each character is just perfect for there role and I just couldn't think of anyone better to play those roles, the casting for this movie was just perfect. Yes, some of the main characters aren't entirely fleshed out but they all stand out in this movie and the story itself will keep the audiences occupied since it's simply engrossing. Plus they are all mostly likable and you care for these characters because they are strong characters and not just physically either. This movie is simply nothing short of a masterpiece. Yes, I know some parts were cut from the book and some scenes weren't even in the book but those added scenes was a cool idea and added many positive aspects to this film than it being negative. Those scenes are very well integrated into this epic film. Jackson and his crew achieved making a movie of this magnitude that most people thought was impossible and he did it for the two other movies in this trilogy as well. The special effects, the props they used and the set pieces are just wonderfully crafted and it really does bring Middle-earth to life.

Despite critical praise,it didn't fare well at the box office and just barely got a DVD release. When people think of Tim Burton, they're more likely to think of films like Batman or the Nightmare Before Christmas. Personally though, I think Ed Wood is the best film Burton has made so far. Most of Burton's films are great simply because of things like the acting, the camera-work, the sets and the music, but Ed Wood is one of the few Tim Burton movies to have a great plot as well.Ed Wood tells the mostly true story about the man who wanted to be just like his greatest hero, Orson Welles, but eventually became known as the worst director of all time. The film follows Ed Wood, played by Johnny Depp, as he directs three of his most infamous bad movies Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Apart from Wood fighting his producers and arguing with his girlfriend over his own transvestitism, a very important part of the movie is Wood's relation with the former Dracula actor Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau. Lugosi has lost the shine he once had, and is now an aging drug addict. It is because of Wood, who becomes his friend and asks him to perform in his movies, that Lugosi begins to enjoy life again.What makes this film especially great in my opinion, is that instead of mocking Wood over the many failures that he created, the film successfully portrays Wood as a kind and likable character. Normally, we'd hate him for making so many bad movies, but this film actually manages to sort of make you feel sorry for him. Of course, Johnny Depp's great performance is also a big step up. It's beautiful to see Wood being hooked by how perfect his own creations are in his own experience.Great acting, great writing, great music, great cinematography, and above all, a lot of fun. It's everything that makes a movie great. I know this film came out a relatively long time ago, but I personally think it deserves a lot more attention. There are a lot of references to cinematic history that might distract you if you're not familiar with them, but even then, I'm still positive you will like this movie.

Instead it counts on the childish humour of a bunch of male friends most likely trying to test their girlfriends' gag reflexes, almost like a fictional Jackass or Dirty Sanchez movie. It's a boys film that cuts out all the unnecessary plot and dialogue and goes straight for the knives, guns, bazookas, chainsaws, blood and guts and vomit gags, nothing more, nothing less.I may be biased in voting it a 7 out of 10 but still I tried to be fair. It's badly acted, badly produced, badly offensive and pure bad taste in every way possible but still, the performers in the movie are likable and they provide you with a lot of laughs.

Elias (Willem Dafoe in a very emotionally memorable role) and his pot smoking troops and the hard-edged Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger in an equally powerful but darker role) and his beer and whiskey drinking ass-kickers. He immediately chooses to side with Elias' squad, just wanting to make it through the war with his mind in tact but that hope doesn't last so long as the deeper into the jungle they roam, and the more horrors they witness, the powers that be and their backers become corrupted by hatred towards the Vietnamese and one another.Soon enough, the conflict rages out of control and when the enemy launches a massive offensive, the platoon is barely able to fight their way out after communication between them has completely broken down.Platoon boasts possibly the largest number of relatively fresh stars launched into movie stardom and legend status for any film in history although there were some familiar faces that had featured in successful titles some years before such as Keith David (The Thing) and Tom Berenger (Dogs of War).

Why are there undercover videos showing out of control classrooms?This movie is just as true today, and for any country, including the so called well-behaved Asian schools, where they resort to beating children with sticks in the hallways to maintain classroom discipline, not entirely successfully. Treating each other with respect never goes out of style. I saw a classroom for lower-income students where they taught students good manners, how to eat properly at a table, etc. The self-respect it instilled spilled over into their schoolwork. But it seems so long ago. Now they would be teaching to the standardized tests, making sure they can fill out the blanks for math and reading tests. What is dated is the optimism and idealism of 1967, the feeling that there were answers to our problems if we approached them with good will and a willingness to change things. Today, in 2011, 44 years later, there is a deep pessimism and resignation, a feeling that the world has spun out of our control, that life will keep getting worse. And people these days don't even make the pretense of treating others with respect whom they disagree with. We could use some of that Sixties spirit today.The amusing opening of the movie, on the bus, is at the heart of the problem of teaching the parents and home life of the students. Look at the adults, their behavior and values, and you will get some insight into their children as students. That is a big part of the problem a teacher faces, yet when the students don't learn, it is all the teachers' fault, not the parents. During the first phase of the movie, its strength is conveying the stress Poitier feels, the dread he must feel at facing these monsters again the next morning. And then you can feel his, and his students' joy later in the film. Is this movie predictable? Perhaps, in terms of outcome, but the question is how he will respond to these students, a problem that had stymied previous teachers, and still does today. That is what grabs your interest. It may seem like a hackneyed theme, but only because there have been so many imitators in the decades since this, the original, was made. If you only watch this one film of Sidney Poitier, you might think he is only a good actor. Poitier, who is still alive, was a truly great actor, and a great human being who rose from an even humbler beginning than that of this fictional teacher. What he rose to was a man of great charisma and dignity and humility. It is such character that he brings to this film, for which he was perfectly cast. The performance is powerful, but there is not an trace of over-acting in it. Poitier was one of the earliest leading black actors to be cast in roles that were not primarily race-related; race is only a sliver of the story in To Sir. And the public, even those with some prejudice, fell in love with him. I still remember seeing him in Lilies of the Field in the theater with my parents. It was a powerful experience, a truly great performance, and remains a movie that I truly love today. I did not watch that movie at that age with much understanding of the racial aspect, though I wish I had. Heck, I'm even Jewish, and the movie was about Poitier's encounter with a bunch of Catholic nuns. Great movies transcend race, religion or nationality. To Sir, With Love is one of them. There have been a number of great movies about teaching over the years. This, and Stand and Deliver, are among the best. Stand and Deliver is great because it is true. To Sir is great because of the writing and directing of the great James Clavell. I have heard and seen Poitier interviewed on radio and TV about his life. He is an extraordinarily gifted man who achieved his full potential in life as an actor, despite odds that should have seemed insurmountable at the beginning. He is an inspiration. But more importantly, he is just a fine actor who is a joy to watch. And so I would like to say, Thank you, Sidney Poitier, for the fine films you have given the world. They will never be dated.

When Frank takes part in the most underground,   no-holds-barred, to-the-death fighting tournament in the world, the   Kumite, most people try to stop him. That includes love interest Janice   Kent (Ayres), and Dux's army superiors Helmer (Burton) and Rawlins   (Whitaker). But Dux becomes buddies with Ray Jackson (Gibb), a   charismatic tough man, and they support each other. But will anyone   have what it takes to defeat the sinister, murderous fighter Chong Li   (Bolo)? Man, did Cannon really hit one out of the park this time. Not   only did it set the careers of Van Damme and Forest Whitaker in motion,   it almost singlehandedly set the mold for all the many Punchfighters to   come. Of course, to the Bloodsport people, it's not just fighting, it's   a martial science. I guess martial arts are just too lowbrow for   them. The Kumite has no weight divisions, so hulking brutes fight   against skinny wimps without a second thought.

If, however, you want a b-movie creature feature with a cracking cast then do give Anaconda a watch.It's all about a giant, man-eating anaconda. Simple. The starring players are all, mostly, part of a documentary film crew who wind up crossing the path of the huge reptile as they explore part of the Amazon river in search of a tribe they hope to catch on camera. There's also a stranded hunter (Jon Voight) picked up en route who seems to have his own selfish reasons for directing them closer towards the deadly snake.Eric Stoltz, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, Owen Wilson, Kari Wuhrer, Jonathan Hyde, Jon Voight and even a small role for Danny Trejo - this movie doesn't lack well-known actors.

His life is steady and calm. Until he meets Alex Forrest at a book-release party. When Beth and Ellen go away for the weekend, Dan and Alex have a one night stand that Dan will soon learn to regret, and not just in his marriage. The weekend tryst may be over between Dan and Alex, but she refuses to let the relationship go ignored. Soon enough, Alex's attraction turns Dan's life into a waking nightmare that not only threatens him, but also the lives of Beth and their daughter.Although Clint Eastwood's Play Misty For Me was a nifty romantic thriller, Fatal Attraction, released in 1987, pushed all the right buttons and kept a lot of pants on (not off) men. Once the film found its audience, no man ever wanted to get involved in a one night stand, especially with somebody like blond seductress Alex Forrest.The cultural resonance and heart-stopping suspense of the film still works today, but stuns even more when viewing it from the perspective of an 80's generation moviegoer. AIDS had just been discovered, and women and men alike viewed Adrian Lyne's film as an answer to the disease. Once Dan and Alex have sex, she becomes an infection in Dan that won't go away and nearly kills him.James Dearden's characters are complex and well thought out. His script allows us to view the perspectives of Dan, Alex, and Beth, and they all provide a healthy dose of empathy, especially and surprisingly for Alex. A woman that would come off nowadays as a simple psychopath, we can understand where Alex is coming from. For the first two acts of the movie, Alex, and maybe the female viewer, feel that Dan dragged HIMSELF into this attraction, and he can't just act like it never happened. Then the third act comes around, and a sympathetic, lovesick human being turns into a dangerous femme fatale that we the audience demand to see taken down.Then there's Dan's point of view. With such a happy marriage, there was really no reason to succumb to infidelity. But he knows it was a mistake, and we later sympathize with him more than Alex.And poor Beth. Such a beautiful woman with a faithful marriage and a close relationship with her daughter. Like I said before, why on earth did Dan have to have a one night stand? When she finds out, the scene is heartbreaking and her anger towards her husband is definitely jarring. But knowing of Dan's mistake, she gets the idea that Alex won't leave her family alone, and she's ready to take a stand. With a restrained rage and intense bravery, she picks up the phone, and says to Alex This is Beth Gallagher...If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you! The audience stands up and cheers.Adrian Lyne squeezes some fantastic performances from his cast. Michael Douglas does a perfect job of playing the normal and sympathetic husband that everyone can relate to. The lovely Anne Archer gives a great performance, as well. But I think, after twenty-four years of popularity, it's pretty obvious that people watch the movie for Glenn Close's terrifying portrayal of Alex. Known for such good-natured films as 1983's The Big Chill, nobody expected Close to play a role like this, which makes her performance all the more memorable. She makes Alex the subtly frightening and sexy predator that she is. With just a tiny wink of an eye, or a stare into the camera, or a twitching smile, Close pulls out all of the stops and makes for one of the most iconic villains in film history. This performance guarantees some major shivers.After multiple viewings, my feelings toward Fatal Attraction stay the same. It is a flawless erotic thriller with genuine suspense, some truly shocking moments(you know what scenes specifically I'm talking about), Oscar-worthy performances from Douglas and Close(why didn't she get it?!), and some extremely steamy sex scenes. Movies like Obsessed (an exact replica of Lyne's film with not even a particle of originality) or The Crush fail to measure up, and no movie will ever be able to do what Fatal Attraction did.

He wouldn't be like this for any other role in his career.Barbara Stanwyck(Martha Ivers) was a little girl who's aunt terrorizes until she finally can't take it anymore and proceeds to kill her. Her meek little friend witnesses it. His father is a grubby little character who cashes in on this as he stays on at the home after she dies to take of her and his son. His son, who just loves Martha Ivers, doesn't really care about the murder cause in the end the aunt was a mean ole witch anyhow and deserved it. The father decides to blackmail her into marrying his son so he can be something in life and so they'll be well off. It all goes wrong when years later someone is arrested for a minor crime and Martha proceeds to convince her meek husband (who happens to be the DA) to convict him of her aunts murder years before. The plan works and the man is convicted and hanged. Even though it works both her and her husbands conscience is still bothered. Enter Van Heflin. He was there just before the murder happened years before but actually left before he saw anything but the Martha and her husband...don't know that.This is definitely a noir from beginning to end.
