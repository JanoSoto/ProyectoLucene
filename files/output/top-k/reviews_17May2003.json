The book is excellent, King's best next to The Shining, and has never ending terror. The movie version isn't as good.James Caan is a popular romance novelist, he writes the Misery books, about Misery Chastain, a rich 19th young woman. Millions of fans love her, including Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates, in an Oscar-winning role), who finds Paul Sheldon and brings him to her house after a car crash. At first, she's treating him nicely, but after she reads his first draft of a new book that she doesn't like, and she finds out that in his latest Misery book that Misery dies, Annie gets angry. When Annie gets angry, back away.She makes Paul burn the book she doesn't like, and then Annie keeps Paul captive to write a book Misery's Return. Since Paul's bedridden with no use for his legs, he can't leave, and if he tries to, Annie will do things to him. One is with a mallet.If you haven't read the book, then most of this review will be worthless, since whenever I see a movie based on a book I have read, my review will be a comparison. Now that that's out of the way, let me go on. The book had nonstop thrills, while in this movie adaptation the thrills varied. Obviously, I knew what was going to happen, but what really made this a good film was the acting.Kathy Bates well deserved her best actress Oscar for this demanding role. Not many people COULD play Annie Wilkes, but Bates is the only person who I could imagine for this role. I was looking forward to seeing her do another great acting job, since I had just seen her in About Schmidt. Caan was also very good, but it's obvious why he didn't win an Oscar. It's really a two-person show, except Richard Farnsworth and Lauren Bacall come in as a police chief and Caan's agent, respectively.To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and there is one brutal scene with a sledgehammer, but that's all I'll say. Much of the violence from the book is taken out, which makes it easier to read. To sum it up, Misery's thrills come and go, but there's some great acting here.My rating 7\/10Rated R for a scene of violence.

This film is not that kind of thriller. SAFE is like those chilling dreams where you are being dragged through something somewhat familiar yet otherworldly and just out of reach of total comprehension.  Those sort of dreams are annoying, but we all have them anyway.  Some people shrug them off, some think they can explain it away by analysis, and some just like to bask in the fact that they are mysterious, heart-palpitating, and fascinating.  I'm in the latter category, and such is my love for this film.  This film is like a kaleidoscope where the patterns seem fixed and definable, yet are constantly changing.  There's no doubt that Todd Haynes has something to say about the toxicity of our environment, the toxicity of our relationships, the toxicity of our generic society, and even the toxicity of our venues of healing.  Doctors and psychiatrists for example, are cold and sterile and seemingly wearing blinders and cotton in their ears when it comes to really seeing or listening to their patients.  New Age healers on the other hand are warm and receptive and seemingly interested in seeing you, hearing you and knowing you.  But they trod down the same path that religious fundamentalists do.  If your faith isn't strong enough; you won't be healed.  One recollects New Age &#145;healers' like Louise Hay who claimed that AIDS victims had subliminal desires to hurt themselves, but could be cured with a strong dose of self-love.  An especially nasty ruse, when one considers how most of society has already blamed the victim.  AIDS victims shouldn't blame themselves, but they shouldn't believe that &#145;enough' faith will heal them either.  So we can feel for Carol White (as generic sounding a name as one could imagine!) who knows her illness to be real, but who feels guilty nonetheless because no one will let her own her illness.  They don't even know she exists, really.  And she, from the beginning of this film, isn't sure either.Carol is an enigma to herself.  She's like a fish in an aquarium (her house in fact, looks sort of like a dungeon set in a space-age aquarium), only she never really saw her life as such until she reached the pinnacle of success defined by society.   At the opening of the film, she's &#145;got it all' wealth, security, servants, &#145;friends', &#145;family' and health (well, for the time being).  But what happens when you've reached the pinnacle of success? Just be happy going to dull social functions and decorate your proverbial palace?  Carol begins to see her life &#150;her aquarium- from outside.  It's dull, blue and facile.  A person who has a sense of self could try to survive in &#145;the ocean' of life, but Carol isn't such a person.  So it's not so unnatural that she might become so vilely inebriated by the blandness and inanity of her life that she can barely talk and ultimately, can barely breathe.  One can get literally ill with an overdose of generic, stupefying life.  Ever been stuck in a dentist's waiting room listening to the likes of Tony Orlando and Dawn or Linda Ronstadt?  We're talking real nausea here! So imagine being a person who lives in a 24\/7 world of pastel colours, pop musak, shopping, vacuous conversation with &#145;friends', and being married to a man who has less charisma than a houseplant. Depression of that magnitude would leave any person raw.  Carol's blues (which we can see literally in the lighting of her house and in the God-awful furniture) have broken her.  Once she realized how raw she'd become, she lost all sense &#150;emotionally and physically- in how to cope.  Perhaps the reason that no one could help her was that they were all too busy enjoying the decor of their proverbial aquariums.  Her husband, her friends, her doctors, even the new Age healers, LIKE the limited, appropriately fashioned, seemingly inoffensive world they've found their niche in.  Gosh knows, I've thought myself nuts for not being part of the majority of the population that likes shopping malls, industrial architecture, Nike, Julia Roberts, or franchise &#145;coffee houses' that serve their overpriced coffee in paper cups.  I kind of understand why Carol would want to bury herself in an igloo by the end of the film.  But New-Agey as it may be, there is a glimmer of hope when she stands at the mirror and chokes out `I love you' to her reflection.  It's not exactly Descartes' `I think, therefore I am', but its affirmation enough that she does indeed have a face and a heart.  She does indeed exist.  I think that's what Todd Haynes' message to us is.  SAFE is a cry for us to take a good, hard look at the world around us, to recognize its variety of poisons, and to make a stand to save it and to save ourselves.

The movie starts with the band entering a sort of music amateur competition. Since the drummer injures himself they replace him with the jazz-inspired Guy Patterson (Scott) who is so much better. They win this and begin an incredible journey up to the top ten of the chart. I think you see the whole plot now, and what happens. Pretty obvious actually.Tom Hanks also wrote the movie (and some of the songs!!!), and I wonder where he got the idea. Does he have a musical past? Anyway, he does a wonderful job. The script and the dialogue are fantastic. I really like the way he ends one scene to begin with another. There is always a clever line here, most of them uttered by Steve Zahn. I don't know if this story is based on a real band but frankly, I don't care. This movie is funny, warm and with a heart, it is very entertaining and it puts you in a good mood. Mostly because of delightful characters, who fits well with the colors of the film and the great setting. And of course, the music is fantastic. Keep in mind that this movie is kind of a \/musical. So, even if you aren't that nostalgic you have to somewhat envy those growing up in the sixties, after seeing this movie. The actors aren't Oscar material, but they are casted very good and they are credible. I think Tom Everett Scott (the smart one) does a very charming performance and of all the movies I have seen; the only performance. Hanks himself plays Mr.White, owner of Playtone Records and manager of the Wonders. Jimmy, played by Jonathan with the last name that I can't even pronounce, is the singer and songwriter (the talented one), and the bad guy of the band. Liv Tyler is his girlfriend and she is the kind of actress who you really seriously can fall in love with. (Good for her she doesn't look like her father!).

I have only seen parts of the movie on cable tv, but with the overhyped sequel now in release I feel I had to comment on the original movie.It's something about an alternate reality within a computer, right? Nothing new there, it's been done already with Tron. Dreamscape and Nightmare on Elm Street created alternate worlds within people's dreams, and in those two movies, like the Matrix, when you die in the dreams you die in real life. I guess I will give the filmmakers credit for trying to use science fiction literature for ideas, at least that's what some of the comments say, but most of what I saw was just a lot of long fancy action scenes.  Okay, you can all hate me but I didn't care much for those flying kung fu fights, whatever else in the movie was science fiction those fight scenes certainly weren't.  More on the action later.I didn't find the characters all that interesting, or else I would have wanted to watch the movie all the way through.  I did find Hugo Weaving interesting as the main alien, villain, whatever.  His stylized gestures and line delivery were both intriguing and a bit creepy.  Laurence Fishburne basically just spouted exposition, and then get rescued by Keanu Reeves, and Carrie Ann-Moss just seemed to be there for the love interest aspect. Can't really say much about Keanu Reeves that hasn't been already said here, though i did like the comment about him playing a block of wood.There were some interesting effects as Reeves makes the transformation for being placed into the matrix, or something, but like so many movies nowadays the emphasis seemed to be more on action, and lots of it, than on anything else.  The low point for me in this movie was when Reeves has to rescue Fisburne from the aliens.  Now, since he is in an imaginary world, he can summon up the most outlandish weapons and tools to help him in his task, like the stuff they used in the Mission Impossible tv series, or even better he can use cunning and wits to free Fishburne, but god forbid today's filmmakers fall back on anything that doesn't require CGI.  Anyway, with a whole alternate universe at his disposal, what weapons does he choose? Machine guns, hand grenades, missile launchers and other conventional weapons.  So all this high-faluting pseudo-philosophy is reduced to a high-tech rambo movie.  At least in Tron the heroes used gadgets in keeping with the computer world in which they were trapped, and in the first Star Wars Luke Skywalker used The Force to help him destroy the Death Star!!!Another thing about the kung fu scenes were that they were anticlimactic. Reeves defeats Weaving in the subway station, but then Weaving comes back in the next scene anyway, so bascially the whole scene was a big nothing!!!Sorry to disappoint you folks but I didn't find anything in this movie to alter or challenge my world, or my perception of my world, except to show me how an overblown video game of a movie can be perceived as supreme greatness.  Seen as a colorful action movie it's a decent time passer, but please do not call it the greatest science fiction movie ever or even one of the greatest.  Before you do that, go and see 2001, the original Planet of the Apes, Forbidden Planet, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Village of the Damned, The Day the Earth Caught Fire, Quatermass and the Pit, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and especially The Man in the White Suit, a science fiction movie which depicts a technological change and its impact on society without one special effect!  Hell, go and see Being There, a fantasy film with a greater perception of our world than the Matrix, and there's only one trick shot in the whole movie (sorry, you gotta see the pic to find out what it is).One last closing comment.  Yesterday I was listening to the morning radio, and the announcer was all excited about the opening of Matrix Reloaded. He commented on the 14 minute chase scene and the 1,000 special effects in the film, as if that makes the movie great.  I found it so sad that today's public is so jaded that they can only rate a movie by the quantity of its technical achievements.  Besides, what's so great about a 14 minute car chase?  Did they run out of story that they had to pad out the movie with an extended action scene?  I would probably lose interest after about 4 or 5 minutes anyway.  You want longer?

THE EXORCIST is simply excellent, and has to be the scariest movie of all time. No kidding. If you watch this movie objectively and knowing that the devil exists well you will have a frightening experience.The plot is complex to understand. A 12 year old girl (Reagan) plays the Ouija Board invoking the spirit of a demon that uses the nickname Captain Howdy. This demon is known as Pazzuzu. Let's not get into details about this Captain Howdy.Reagan soon gets possessed by this demon, but little she knows that her soul is in risk. Reagan's mother is desperate because her little daughter has been examined by many doctors and they just can't find an answer to her conduct. Convinced that her daughter has been possessed by an evil spirit, Reagan's mother asks the help of the young Father Karras keeping the faith that the priest is going to exorcise her daugher. After meeting  the possessed girl, and filling the requisites of the Church in order to declare the girl as possessed,  Father Karras realizes that an exorcism has to be practiced immediately. But he cannot perform it alone, so he asks the help of Father Merrin, a veteran priest that performed an exorcism years ago in Africa.Both priests will risk their lifes in a battle with the devil, a battle which purpose is to free the spirit of an innocent girl.This movie is shocking, and I mean shocking because it's based on a real situation... Think about this for a second would you dare to play the ouija knowing that maybe you could invoke an evil spirit? Do you believe in the devil? ... If your answer is yes, watch the exorcist and have a good scare.The excelent acting by Max Von Sydox, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, and Linda Blair deserves a big recognition. Burstyn, Blair, and Miller were nominated for an Academy Award for their acting. The direction is simply masterful, Friedklin gets the feeling of evil and he portrays it with his camera. The scary music and the F\/X are awesome for it's time.  The scene where Father Merrin arrives to Reagan's house is one of the most memorable moments in cinematic history.

It is a rarity in its genre, for it goes deeper than the standard formula horror movie, presenting a story under a story.  While it contains plenty of frightening shocks and gore, that is only the suurface level, and the focus for watching it the first time.  After the first time, pay careful attention to the dialogue and the interactions between Helen and the Candyman.  The Candyman is not what he first appears to be.<SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON...STOP HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!>The biggest complaints I usually hear about this movie are of plot holes. People often ask, Why does the Candyman haunt the black population instead of the descendents of those who killed him? or, Why does the hook make Helen come back when it is not what made Candyman come back? or other similar questions.  These are valid questions about the ghost story concerning Daniel Robetei, but they entirely miss the point of the movie. That point is that the incarnation we see of Candyman in the movie is NOT the ghost of Daniel Robetei.  Forget what the pointless sequels lead you to believe, for in the first movie, as well as the original story The Forbidden by Clive Barker, the Candyman is an incarnation of the faith of those who tell stories about him.  There is no ghost of Daniel Robetei, but rather an entity that is formed by rumor, faith, fear, and the story itself. It seems to me that almost everyone misses this point, but it is there, clear as day, if you listen closely to the dialogue.  Of course, reading the original story helps shed a little light on this as well, and it can be found in Clive Barker's In the Flesh, a collection of short stories. So, Candyman haunts the black population because they are the ones who tell the stories and believe in him.  He is constantly asking Helen to be his witness in order to strengthen their belief, and his offer to her to live forever is literal.  If she does become his witness, she will become a part of the story, and a part of the creative force that allows Candyman to exist.  In the end, Helen returns because the population of Cabrini Green makes her a part of the story.I hope this sheds a little light on the story for those of you stuck on the plot holes.  This really is a fantastic, original story that is much more complex than that of any other horror movie I have seen.  Not to mention that the performances are fantastic.  Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen have a fantastic chemistry that is very convincing.  The only gripe I have about this movie is the p***-poor actress they picked for Helen's husband's girlfriend. So, watch it first for the shocks, but watch it again for the deeper story buried within.Definately a perfect 10\/10.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"17 May 2003","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Candyman is one of my all-time favorite horror movies, and it seems to me that it is often underappreciated and misunderstood.  It is a rarity in its genre, for it goes deeper than the standard formula horror movie, presenting a story under a story.  While it contains plenty of frightening shocks and gore, that is only the suurface level, and the focus for watching it the first time.  After the first time, pay careful attention to the dialogue and the interactions between Helen and the Candyman.  The Candyman is not what he first appears to be.<SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON...STOP HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!>The biggest complaints I usually hear about this movie are of plot holes. People often ask, Why does the Candyman haunt the black population instead of the descendents of those who killed him? or, Why does the hook make Helen come back when it is not what made Candyman come back? or other similar questions.  These are valid questions about the ghost story concerning Daniel Robetei, but they entirely miss the point of the movie. That point is that the incarnation we see of Candyman in the movie is NOT the ghost of Daniel Robetei.  Forget what the pointless sequels lead you to believe, for in the first movie, as well as the original story The Forbidden by Clive Barker, the Candyman is an incarnation of the faith of those who tell stories about him.  There is no ghost of Daniel Robetei, but rather an entity that is formed by rumor, faith, fear, and the story itself. It seems to me that almost everyone misses this point, but it is there, clear as day, if you listen closely to the dialogue.  Of course, reading the original story helps shed a little light on this as well, and it can be found in Clive Barker's In the Flesh, a collection of short stories. So, Candyman haunts the black population because they are the ones who tell the stories and believe in him.  He is constantly asking Helen to be his witness in order to strengthen their belief, and his offer to her to live forever is literal.  If she does become his witness, she will become a part of the story, and a part of the creative force that allows Candyman to exist.  In the end, Helen returns because the population of Cabrini Green makes her a part of the story.I hope this sheds a little light on the story for those of you stuck on the plot holes.  This really is a fantastic, original story that is much more complex than that of any other horror movie I have seen.  Not to mention that the performances are fantastic.  Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen have a fantastic chemistry that is very convincing.  The only gripe I have about this movie is the p***-poor actress they picked for Helen's husband's girlfriend.

On the face of it we have two hardened criminals from an even harder prison who escape with their pursuers hoping to capture them dead rather than alive, but for those looking for this will only find disappointment.Although the original script was changed, it has to be said that the changes that were made were for the better. I am of course referring to the the start of the movie being written back to include the few days in prison preceding the escape and up until they board the train. This added to the character interaction between Manny and Rencken. Manny is the depraved ruthless criminal and Rencken is the equally ruthless warden who believes in what is doing - that is to rid the world of people like Manny by right or wrong methods. To Rencken these men had given up their rights when they had stepped outside the law and he is righteously empowered to deal with them. This is a recurring theme in movies, the most notable one being 'Unforgiven'. Manny is a hero to the other prisoners since he takes a stand against their unjust captors. It also shows that the world is not black and white and Manny and Rencken are evidence of this since sometimes our protectors - Rencken - are criminals who need an excuse, and the criminals - Manny - can become societies unlikely heroes by standing up to people like this.   Manny is caged like the animal Rencken believes he is, but he wins his appeal and the scene is set for a climatic encounter between the two of them.Buck, the willing assistant to Manny, escapes with Manny and they have to face the harsh environment that is Alaska. This is a almost perfect setting for such men since it sets against each other the hardest men humans have to offer against the harshest weather nature has.The introduction of the train is fantastic. A great monolith that reveals itself from out of the shadows and it looks like a monster that man cannot conquer, even through the use of technology as the rail operators were to find out. Throughout the movie it lumbers on seemingly sweeping all before it and ultimately determining the fate of the bitter rivals. The only problem I have with it's introduction is the use of typical 80's action music when the two make their way towards it. But fortunately it does not undermine all what I have outlined above.On the train the differences between the two come to the fore. Manny is man of many hard experiences and has obviously acquired some wisdom from them and thus has no patience with his naive partner whose small times ways is accentuated by the fact that he is in jail for what Manny believes is small time offences. Buck is thus going to have to learn or suffer the consequences - even if it means his end. This is in direct contradiction to his stand against Rencken and it is in the end that Manny learns by letting Buck live as he takes his enemy to the death with him.When Sara finds the two stowaways, we see a woman who has adapted to the harsh conditions of working in Alaska and is therefore not intimidated by them. Although pretty, she is unglamorous, thus mirroring the environment they are set against.The climax was not altogether predictable, although the beginning of the movie made it clear that the enemies final encounter would result in loss of life, it was not clear that both were going to meet a dire end. This is without doubt a fitting conclusion. Manny achieves freedom by killing the man who would have forever hounded him and frees his friend, Jonah, from Rencken's rule. He also achieves true hero status by becoming a martyr. Only Jonah completely understands this and is pleased for his friends freedom. Manny lets Buck and Sara go because this is only between him and Rencken and he gets up on the train and welcomes death - his freedom - with open arms. He knew that this was the only way he was going to achieve victory.The actor's performances - Jon Voight and Eric Roberts - are phenomenal and it is no surprise that they were oscar nominated. Although Eric Robert's mannerisms may annoy at times this was necessary to create a suitable character that Manny would have numerous flare - ups with. Andrei Konchalovsky creates a sublime prison drama and although it will need to go somewhat further before being an intellectual showcase, it certainly makes you think long afterwards.

Redford's style for this brand of movie did not quite fit (the type of movie being bad of course, the only reason it is O.K. is from the headlining names and acting being mostly well done).  To get in depth to the film beyond the obtuse plot and the lack of reality, this story does have a few progressive figures that exemplify some major leadership qualities that I feel pick up the slack created by the producers and storytellers here.  It wasn't what was in the script that held these qualities, but in the actor's demeanor and how they did things. Gandolfini really made me believe he was trying to do what was right by being a hard ass, but his twitchy manner and inherent fear of the prisoners also held that underlying feeling of him playing god.  His manipulations and straight edge by the book rule, made him an effective leader to the guards (of whom several got a kick out of being the captors), but despised by the prisoners; while keeping them all in line.  Gandolfini's character's only flaw as a leader figure was his lack of creativity in battle, for up until the time of the war (riot) he was straight forward and predictable and Redford's character had him chasing his own shadow.  Now Redford's character (Gen. Irwin), was well written, he had inspiring speeches and courage, great networking ability and an excellent reputation.  His coming to the prison made the movie a bit easy though, in my opinion it should have been a lower ranking officer who had to work twice as hard and long to inspire.  Also, if anyone cares, did it seem like Redford was only half into this character? When he was there he was good, but it seemed like the other half he just said his lines and went home for the day.  Some of the best acting came from the lesser-known names, like Clifton Collins Jr. (Cpl. Aguilar). Sometimes the simplest character can be the most stirring as this actor's portrayal was of a mason workers son and the protection of his pride (the wall). Another movie to see how well he acts (even though the movie's concept has been overdone) is 187.  All in all with its good points, it needed something else to juice up the movie, maybe given more depth to events leading to Redford's incarceration or even his family.

It wasn't what was in the script that held these qualities, but in the actor's demeanor and how they did things. Gandolfini really made me believe he was trying to do what was right by being a hard ass, but his twitchy manner and inherent fear of the prisoners also held that underlying feeling of him playing god.  His manipulations and straight edge by the book rule, made him an effective leader to the guards (of whom several got a kick out of being the captors), but despised by the prisoners; while keeping them all in line.  Gandolfini's character's only flaw as a leader figure was his lack of creativity in battle, for up until the time of the war (riot) he was straight forward and predictable and Redford's character had him chasing his own shadow.  Now Redford's character (Gen. Irwin), was well written, he had inspiring speeches and courage, great networking ability and an excellent reputation.  His coming to the prison made the movie a bit easy though, in my opinion it should have been a lower ranking officer who had to work twice as hard and long to inspire.  Also, if anyone cares, did it seem like Redford was only half into this character? When he was there he was good, but it seemed like the other half he just said his lines and went home for the day.  Some of the best acting came from the lesser-known names, like Clifton Collins Jr. (Cpl. Aguilar). Sometimes the simplest character can be the most stirring as this actor's portrayal was of a mason workers son and the protection of his pride (the wall). Another movie to see how well he acts (even though the movie's concept has been overdone) is 187.  All in all with its good points, it needed something else to juice up the movie, maybe given more depth to events leading to Redford's incarceration or even his family.

At a certain point, I was desperate to turn off the VCR, but my English teacher (and the rest of the class) probably would have objected.It's not that the movie is bad, per se. It's just that the play is so much better. Stoppard managed to make R&G into characters that you couldn't help but love. You know the ending by the time you've opened up the book (I mean, it says it right there in the title). But you still kind of hold out hope through the whole thing that he's going to save them, that he's going to let them escape because we never really see them die in Hamlet. It's a brilliant play.The most heartbreaking thing about the movie was that Stoppard didn't seem to trust his own words. Sure, it was still funny - if you cut out all the silliness, you'd end up with a 15 minute play. But he took out a few things - winks at the audience, where he throws in a very 20th century bit of busywork - which made the play a lot of fun. He rearranged passages, so that their context changed. He put them in situations where they didn't belong - they were no longer in the dark about the whole situation. Sure, it leads to some funny moments and good bits of physical comedy. But it also seemed to be an attempt to give Hamlet a motive, and that changed the canon itself. And worst of all, he changed their deaths. It was so beautifully written in the play - understated, but moving. In the movie, he turns the deaths of R&G into one last gag, after a montage that I'm assuming is supposed to be moving. It wasn't. And the music choices were just odd.I really wanted to like the movie. I was thrilled to find out there was a movie version. And maybe I wouldn't have hated it so much had I not read the play.

The use of the sound was definitely noticed. Mystery movies aren't much until you can get the mood right and the sound track on this things helps greatly. From the music to the well done use of the surround channels the sound track puts you right where the director Mathieu Kassovitz (Amélie) wanted. I could go on and on comparing this movies to others of it's type. But I won't all I have to say for now is I'm glad I rented it and I'm glad I watch it in French. 9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"17 May 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I don't think this film would have been as good without Jackson. All the hilarious parts have him in them. The bit where he's takin' a s*** and Estevez comes in, his flashbacks, the way he looks at the freckled chick, the Head and Shoulders bit, and so on. There are a few lame jokes here and there but I still consider this a great comedy. You'll love it if you liked the Naked Gun films and such.

Perhaps that style of heroism was all one needed to get by in the &#145;old west', but even then, death was not an easy thing to face (I bet most gunslingers and sheriffs' boots were filled with liquid just moments before they bit the dust). Finally, here is a film that looks at what courage is really made up of the ability to accept limitations, to accept change, to have humility, and to be able to say, `I'm afraid'.  The Duke is dying of cancer, in reality and within the plot of this film.  He is also a living myth in reality and within the plot of this film.  That he chose to play out his swan song as a human legend instead of as a mythic one, must have taken a lot of courage.  Imagine the Duke propped on a dainty red pillow upon his saddle!  Imagine him showing all the physical signs of the wear and tear that illness and age have bestowed on him.  Imagine him allowing us to hear the weakness of his infirm body slipping in the bathtub.  Imagine his groans of agony.  `Death is a very private thing', his character John Books says, but he is man enough to show us how to do it and do it with dignity, despite the fear.  Just imagine The Duke admitting that he's afraid of the dark!At the period in which this film is set, gunslingers &#150; or `shootists' &#150; were soon to go the way of the horse and buggy.  The queen (Victoria) had just died.  Electricity, modern plumbing, modern commerce, modern transportation, and creature comforts were beginning to take over (check out the electric ceiling fans and mosaic tiles in the saloon!).  Forward to &#145;real life'.  It is 1976.  One by one, the mythic legends created by dime novels and Hollywood movies are being demystified.  From Billy The Kid to Buffalo Bill, to Bonnie and Clyde, audiences have been shown for over decade how legends have always been manufactured.  There are some who may see this demystification as a negative thing, but when people start adoring soldiers, celebrities and gangsters as something more than human, it's time to set the record straight.  That's what all the best films of the seventies did.  They broke the myths but they did not break the spirit, for what they did was let US, not the supermen on the screen, become the heroes.  We could be afraid, old, young, ill, or weak, and we could feel pain and humiliation.  In the process of confronting our limitations we become stronger.  To be a stronger human being is to become civilized.  Like this film shows us, we CAN reject the gun and join civilization.  This film is John Wayne's gift to us.  He is enabling us to grow up, to look at the past with respect, but to face the future with responsibility.  His John Books is worth more to us than all his superheroes put together.  We're all gonna die, we're all afraid, and pain is very, very real.  It is in the process of surrendering to this fact with dignity and humility that we in a sense become immortal.  To try to live as a superman is to die a fool.  Only cowards (and very dangerous people) embrace myths over reality.  That dainty red pillow has made The Duke sit very tall in his saddle indeed!
