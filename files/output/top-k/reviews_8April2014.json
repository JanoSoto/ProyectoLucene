It wasn't really planned to have a sequel but I am very happy they ended up making one. My favorite movie in the whole trilogy.This movie shows Doc and Marty go to the future to stop trouble from happening and then have to go back to 1955 because their time travel caused some trouble in the present as well. I have some problems with the movie. It makes no sense to me that Doc wants to save Marty's son but not Marty from ruining his life as he did. Although for this they wouldn't need to go into the future but just prevent it when life goes on and there would be no movie. I also don't get why them meeting themselves would be such a horrible thing but universe didn't collapse by having Jennifer meet herself in the future. This could be easy to prevent by just not have Jennifer run into each other and there would be no confusion. And have them all play their own kids\/grand kids was a bad idea.But those three issues are small compared to what a great movie it is so I still rate it as a 10, since things that really matter are perfect. There is so much going on and it is very action full and exciting. And have the characters go back to the past to the same day movie number 1 took place was absolutely brilliant as it creates many awesome scenes. And once again the ending is very promising, also giving us a little look into what to expect from the finale.Now, I am watching it almost in 2015, and the future scenes are pretty fun. Pretty much all those things already exist except for clothes, flying cars (almost every movie about the future has flying cars! really need to work on them if we want them so much!) and the many times promised hoverboards. Also the antique shop really does look like an antique shop to me now even though back in the days the joke was ha, look at this awesome technology being antique!.

Sure, the two main characters, Danny and Debbie, fall for each other very quickly. But while they may think they're in love it becomes apparent they have very little grasp of what being in love actually means. If they want their happily ever afters they're going to have to work for them. Is it even worth the effort? Their respective best friends certainly don't seem to think so, doing everything they can to sabotage the relationship. And there are times Danny and Debbie do a fine job of sabotaging things themselves. This is an honest look at an evolving relationship, so many ups and downs. Love is great. But love can cause a lot of pain too.The movie benefits from excellent performances from Rob Lowe and Demi Moore as the two young would-be lovers. Lowe strikes the right tone as a guy who, egged on by his friend, thinks he may just be too cool to fall in love. Danny doesn't want to open himself up, make himself vulnerable. He won't admit that finding Debbie is the best thing that ever happened to him, maybe until it's too late. Don't know what you got till it's gone? Meanwhile Moore has perhaps never been better than she was here. She's absolutely charming when she needs to be and radiant throughout. But when the relationship sours, when the pain and the hurt are too much to bear, Moore captures that brilliantly as well. Your heart aches for her.With Lowe and Moore hitting all the right notes the movie was never going to fail. But there is the sense it could have been a little bit better than it was. As Danny and Debbie draw closer the movie slows down some. The possibility of their being in love was exciting but once they actually were in love, or at least thought they were, things get bogged down a bit. The supporting players don't help much. Playing Danny's friend Bernie is James Belushi. He provides most of the movie's humor, never more so than in the very opening scene which with its crackling, hilarious dialogue may be the best moment the movie has. But as Bernie tries to drive a wedge in the Danny-Debbie relationship he becomes too much of a boor for the movie's good, entirely unsympathetic. Meanwhile Elizabeth Perkins plays Debbie's friend Joan, the iciest of ice queens. It's impossible to warm up to this man-hater. Not the fault of the performance from Perkins, this character was simply written to be too obnoxious to bear. The pressure from their friends causes problems between Danny and Debbie but the relationship was built on a flimsy foundation to begin with. A one-night stand that too quickly became so much more. They weren't looking for love, found it anyway, and didn't know what to do with it. This is a movie which certainly has its flaws but it has notable charms as well. It's worth spending two hours to see if these young lovers want to spend their lives together.

They're either the slasher type or the psychological type. But The Shining is a different type of horror movie. Stanley Kubrick was in his own little world when he made this movie, and the finishing product is something like no one else has done or has done since.Based on the novel The Shining by Stephen King, he really took it beyond what the book was about and made it into his own creation, straying for the most part from the original source material. Even though this film is more of a psychological type of horror movie, it really doesn't follow the formula of other well known films of this genre like Psycho. There's such a wide variety for the surreal in this movie, that Kubrick could've have basically done anything with the film. Other people say it's a slasher movie. I tend to disagree because there's really not much of a body count, and only one character dies. I don't want to spoil anything, but it happens so quickly, that you hardly notice. The only shocking moment in the movie is the old lady in the bathtub scene. It disgusts me. If Jack Torrence wasn't played by Jack Nicholson, this film wouldn't have been as scary or it would've been a totally different movie. You can't take your eyes off of him; when it comes to playing crazy characters he is the best (i.e. Batman, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Throughout the whole movie, he's a ticking time bomb. The movie does a great job in building up the tension of his insanity until he's chasing his family around the hotel with an ax. My favorite scenes are when he's talking to the bartender; now whether it's his imagination or it's a ghost, it's not explained. The way Jack acts in these scenes are priceless and crazy; but Lloyd is oblivious to this, acting like everything is OK. Later in the movie, he talks with the waiter in the bathroom and treating him with respect (despite his psychotic nature). It begins with small-talk, but it gets serious; moreover, the gradual transaction to that is just brilliant.It ends with Danny being chased by Jack. But there's no establishing shots, so we never know if Jack is gaining up on Danny or is he far behind, trying to catch up. The whole idea is to make the audience feel disoriented, and it serves as a great climax to the film. This movie makes me feel like going through that maze in the cold, and being lost. But to be fair, had the plot been more clear-cut and had definitive answers, it wouldn't have the same effect as it does now. The whole movie makes me feel like I'm descending into madness.

Herzog evoked in an uncanny way what it feels like to be at the mercy of people you don't understand and who don't understand you, in other words a crazy situation that has its own rules.

Complimenting the isolated tracking shots,Allen gives the outside scenes a stylish chilly appearance,which shows the cold routes that Judah and Stern find themselves travelling upon.Despite recent events making it appear that the only time she will work with him again will be when hell freezes over,Mia Farrow gives a charmingly kooky performance as Halley Reed,with Farrow showing Reed to have a natural off-beat warmth that Stern finds irresistible.Keeping away from any sense of warm,Anjelica Huston gives a delightfully chaotic performance as Dolores Paley thanks to Huston showing Paley to be unwilling to run away from the fire that is burning her relationship with Judah to the ground.Spending most of the title fighting to get his dream project made,Woody Allen gives an excellent performance as Cliff Stern,with Allen showing Stern to have an uncompromising one track mind,which leads to Stern completely ignoring the commercial opportunities that could help his Avant-Garde project at last get off the ground.Giving the title a bleak Film Noir heart,Martin Landau delivers a tremendous performance as Judah Rosenthal,with Landau showing horror on Judah's face,as he realize to his horror that the only way he can get off his darken path is to commit some deadly crimes and misdemeanors.

Hicks and Newt are both killed in the accident, and Bishop is destroyed beyond repair. Ripley is the only survivor. The prison workers take her in, and she is warned that her mere presence will disturb the cycle of the prison and its inmates, all of which are reborn Christians with pasts of rape and murder. A facehugger makes its way from the escape pod, and impregnates an animal in the prison (a dog or a cow, depending on whether you watch the theatrical cut or the assembly cut), which soon births an alien that wreaks havoc in the prison and Ripley and the inmates attempt to stop it, and the fact is that the prison has little to no weapons complicates trying to kill it. Ripley soon discovers she has been impregnated with an alien queen, and the alien will not kill her because of it, giving her a morbid edge to stop it.Sigourney Weaver's performance is stellar. The highlight of her acting is in the scene where an autopsy is performed on Newt's corpse. Her facial expression and the sadness she emotes is fantastic, she really sells the tragedy her character has gone through and makes you feel really sorry for her. The supporting cast is all around good, the best of them being Charles Dance and Charles S.

No one seems to have any faith in Utah even though he's taking it all seriously.Their first case together is the pursuit of the Ex-Presidents, a gang of ironic bank robbers who pull-off 60-second robberies to fund their hedonistic lifestyle.

Mark Isham's score for this scene is simply wonderful, and, as a teenager, I would watch this scene over and over to the point where the VHS tape eventually got worn-out.Point Break has gone on to be a cult classic inspiring rip-offs such as The Fast and the Furious (and a soon-to-be unnecessary remake that no one wants starring box office poison Gerard Butler) and a spoof stage show. Kathryn Bigelow, who was one of James Cameron's many wives at the time, has only made 5 films since 1991 which is strange for a director so solid with a near-perfect track record. Even her worst films have merit, though she did go on to win big with The Hurt Locker in 2009.It may be soaking in early 90s surf culture, but that's the only thing that dates it and any remake, re-imagining, reboots, or re-interpretation is not needed.

It's one of those movies that I can watch with some friends and have them cracking up, or with other friends and they're looking at me like WTF? This movie is one of my favorite comedies because you can pretty much find something to laugh at in every scene. Whether it's the acting (Depp and del Toro, and even a cameo by Tobey Maguire provide some great laughs), the dialogue (I've never been able to properly explain myself in this climate.), and the wacky visuals, this film has so much comedic genius in it. Depp really does a great job here, and for those that are sick of Depp in Tim Burton's films, or in Pirates, well here is a great example of Depp's ability to act outside of that. Granted, his character in this does share a lot of similarities with Jack Sparrow, but this came out five years before Pirates did. Benicio del Toro is great as Depp's attorney, and friend who accompanies him to Vegas on this LSD joyride. The scenes between them are priceless. This is probably my favorite Terry Gilliam film, not counting the Monty Python films. Most of the time movies about people partying (Hangover, Superbad, etc) are boring, and predictable to me. With Fear and Loathing, the drug scenes are filled with clever dialogue, and great visuals, not pointless sex references and party jokes. This is an intelligent comedy. Some of what comes out of Depp's mouth really is great stuff. Just the sheer nature of the film is enough...it's mental. So relax, sit down, and remember you can't stop in bat country.

I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too). But wow, the Psycho score is really quite amazing. It's so unobtrusive yet brilliantly sets the mood. And I'm not talking about the screeching strings, even though they're the most famous.

This film has everything a sequel should do the same fantastic performances as the first, the stakes raised and also added struggles and revelations for the characters. The 2nd film in the star wars franchise kicks off a few months after the original with the Empire and Darth Vader tracking the rebels and eventually finding them from there Luke goes to Dagobah to learn from Jedi master Yoda while Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO attempt to avoid the empire. This film takes the bold move of splitting the characters up to two stories providing more substance to this film than the previous film even though that is great too. This film is truly when Darth Vader comes into the forefront he is now in full charge of the imperial forces and is awesome and evil at the same time. This film has exciting action, heartfelt moments and one heck of a tense climax with possibly the biggest revelation in film industry. If you haven't seen the original you will be lost at the beginning but what are you doing if you haven't seen the original star wars. Go watch them now!

For a long time it has been on my Movies To Watch list but I've just never had the opportunity or just never got around to it until now, and honestly though it was a good movie, I guess I was expecting more. When you hear about how great a movie is, you have high expectations and you expect those to be met, sadly, this film didn't meet those expectations. The film is a well shot film and the lighting is remarkable how it singles out characters or makes their face look just so, but the story is not necessarily what I expected. I fully expected a sappy romantic movie that you couldn't help but like because the characters were so genuinely in love. Definitely not a man who owns a saloon and is secretly pinning away for a girl that left him at a train station who then pops back into his life very much unannounced and undesired, especially because she is with another man. The story itself is not all bad, don't get me wrong, just not what I was expecting. Though the hero did not end like I would have wanted him to because of his selflessness, he does have a happy ending to a certain degree, and he certainly isn't all that alone in the end. Despite my expectations for the film, it is a rather good film and I would probably watch it again.
