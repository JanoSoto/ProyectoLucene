Its not the best Robin Williams I have seen and parts of this film did remind me of Mrs Doubtfire(since Chris Columbus directed both films). But the real reward that this film has of course goes to the make up effects. I was in shock how the same make up artist who did Mrs Doubtfire and The Mask was able to transform Robin Williams into an old man in the end of the film. It was so well done so thumbs up to this.

It stars young Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton and Dee Wallace as the mother of the three kids played by the aforementioned child actors. The film's plot follows Henry Thomas' character Elliot in particular. One fine evening, he discovers an alien being. The film is about Elliot and his siblings falling in love and befriending this alien and hiding it from their mother and all other adults including the government who are clearly aware that an alien being has landed in the area.I have a love-hate relationship with Steven Spielberg. I am ready to acknowledge the fact that he is arguably one of the most important filmmakers of all time in terms of making films that become box office behemoths. He has always been the box office's darling. I have always loved some of his grittier and personal films like 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan'. But there are other films in his filmography that make me cringe due to the saccharine nature of the direction and the style of storytelling. Some of his other big blockbusters like 'Indiana Jones' or 'Jurassic World' are examples of films that I can appreciate for the technical achievements, but I haven't been able to love them. 'E.T.' is an example of an aberration when it comes to my impression of a Spielberg film. It has all the schmaltz and John Williams' sweeping music that has made me cringe in some of his other films, but those are exactly the aspects I believe that work in this film because 'E.T.' at its basic level is a fairy tale.Like many other fairy tales, the storyline to this film is strictly from the point of view of the kids. This is a story that can't be told without the presence of the kids. In other fairy tales like 'The Wizard of Oz' or 'Alice in Wonderland', etc., the protagonist goes to a new, magical and wondrous world where the story is set. But in 'E.T.' it is the magical element of an extra-terrestrial being which is brought to Elliot's home. Without a shadow of a doubt, 'E.T.' is a children's film. But the best children's films are those that impress adults too. I watched this for the first time as an adult in my twenties and it blew me away. Not just because of the fact that it's adorable, but also because of the rich subtext. It is revealed very early that Elliot's parents have recently separated and clearly Elliot feels the absence of his father. This film is about Elliot, Gertie and Michael trying to avoid premature adulthood and maturity which can be inevitable when your parents separate or divorce when you're very young. The alien being itself represents Elliot's innocence. Elliot's attempt to hide E.T. from the adults epitomises his attempt to restore his innocence and his childish spirit in the face of great mental trauma brought on by his parent's separation. The E.T. is also going through emotional problems because of being separated from the other aliens. There is no real villain in the film except adulthood. Spielberg made an artistic and thematic decision to not show any adult's face for a major part of the film except for the mother played by Dee Wallace. For the most part of the film we don't see adult faces, we only can listen to their incomprehensible science talks.The script written by Melissa Mathison in collaboration with Spielberg is beautiful. It tugs at your heart strings and embodies the magic and the wonder that comes along with a child's view of the world. This is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's most intimate films. There is some special effects work in the film, but they never drown the human element of the subject. The alien in the film becomes a real character instead of remaining a gimmick. John Williams pumps out his characteristic sweeping scores that works beautifully to complement the magical scenes in the film. The acting in the film is also great. Special mention has to go to Henry Thomas. He is adorable and makes it impossible for viewers to not fall completely in love with him. A good aspect about the writing is that the kids actually behave like kids for the majority of the film which is not the case in some Hollywood films. Having said that there is one particular monologue by Elliot that felt a bit mature for his age, but that is a minor nitpick.'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is an intimate and magical fairy tale set in the 20th century. Spielberg consciously attempts to create a film that oozes childish innocence. Children will love the friendship between the alien and Elliot and also the fun chemistry between Elliot, Gertie and Michael. Adults and other perceptive viewers will appreciate the rich subtext of children trying to not get forced into growing up prematurely by sacrificing their childhood due to their parents' separation. 'E.T.' also makes you nostalgic about your childhood and taps the inner child in you. Along with 'Stand by Me', 'E.T.' is one of a select few films that will surely make viewers rue the loss of their childish innocence. Highly Recommended.

The film is about a guy named Jakob Heym (Robin Williams) and it is directed by Peter Kassovitz. My opinion of the film is that the way that the timezone was shown and the way it was screened was good, but personally I did NOT like the story. It was too overwhelming I think.During World War II in Nazi occupied Poland, poor Jewish café owner Jakob accidentally overhears a forbidden radio news, to fight the incredible depression and suicide throughout the ghetto, Jakob tells fictitious news bulletins about Allied advances against the Nazis. These lies keep hope and humor alive among the ghetto inhabitants. The Germans learn of the mythical radio, however, and begin a search for the resistance hero who dares operate it.The theme of this film is Hope v.s. Hopelessness, When Jakob relates this to a friend to keep him from doing something stupid, it becomes assumed that Jakob has a hidden radio. He is then pressed to tell more news. As long as there is news, there are no suicides in the ghetto. But before Jakob was accused, there was NO hope at all, there was at least one suicide each night.The film shows a very dark and gloomy environment it is part of WWII so there is a lot of depression, and sadness, and lots of suicides. People have to work a lot and they are not well taken care of, some of their families have been taken and put on the train, but the only thing that gives them hope is Jakob's radio and the hope that the Russian's are coming to save them.Jakob the Liar is overall an eyeopener. It makes you think WOW! They really did that to people and This is Crazy everything in the film is really a shock! They way it was put together was good, but I didn't like it that much because it just made me sad, I prefer Comedy. But, if you like Historical Fiction\/Dramas this film is for YOU!

But when McFly's mother ends up falling for McFly things get sorta complicated. So can McFly go back to his own time?Bottom line this was a feel good movie and I highly recommend it. The story is a tad bit silly,the music is great by Hewy Lewis and the actors seem to have a great time in this movie.

Night Shyalaman has made some highly disappointing films in the last decade. However, this was a time when Shyalaman was a more respectable director for his supernatural themes and shocking plot twists in his films. This is best demonstrated in his Oscar-nominated horror film Sixth Sense that left many viewers that the edge of their seats in the late 90s. In this film, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a once gifted child psychologist is assigned to a new patient no one other than Cole Sears (played by Haley Joel Osment), a shy and emotionally disturbed nine-year old boy who is discovered to have a mysterious ability to communicate with spirits of dead people. The further Malcolm goes his research, the closer he gets learning the shocking secrets behind Cole's unique gift.Hollywood has made many scary and heart-pounding horror flicks dealing with ghosts and the afterlife. However, none of them come nearly as original or thoughtful as this one. This is not one of those typical ghost movies where characters are possessed or attacked by frightening entities. Directer M. Night Shyalaman takes the paranormal horror genre and takes to some unique directions. With an cogent screenplay and direction, the film brings an insanely scary atmosphere by not spewing the audience with pretentious jump scares, but by steadily lets the suspense creep on the audience. In many scenes, audience watch as people appear out of nowhere as seemingly normal people, but when you take closer look you see that they are not as alive as they appear to be. These scenes aren't type of scenes that audience jump, yet there are still very unpredictable. These scenes can easily give chills to your spine as dead person can appear out of nowhere at any minute when you least expect, and the eerie music score by James Newton Howard greatly adds to the scary tone. The film manages to stay captivating throughout its run up until the final scene when the audience is hit with the one of the most shocking and unpredictable twists that leave many jaws dropping.Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment gave some exhilarating performances. The chemistry between the two is so well that they seem so natural on screen together. The then 10-year old Osment's performance was one of the best performances I have seen by a child at such a young age. The fact that he receive an Oscar nomination for his performance is definitely no surprise. As of Bruce Willis, this is probably the best role of his career aside from John McClane in the Die Hard series. The Sixth Sense is one of the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, and certainly the best film by M. Night Shyalaman. I really hope one day he will return back to the glory days of his film making career and he will making some truly intriguing films.

As far as fantasy films go, it's not half bad, with plenty of action and exploitation to keep things moving along steadily. While lacking the visceral excess of CONAN THE BARBARIAN, it has all the key ingredients for these '80s adventure larks, including a black sidekick, monsters, a muscle-bound hero in a loincloth, some cheesy special effects and a baddie wizard who lives at the top of a giant stone staircase. Okay, so this film is a rip-off, but it's a good one at that.It also has a refreshing twist in the tale our hero is telepathically able to control animals, and has a number of sidekicks. An eagle is handy for flying into his enemies' faces and spying, his (surprisingly tame) black tiger is useful for mauling baddies, and his two pet ferrets live in a satchel and steal stuff. The magical elements are primitive yet memorable, and include a ring with an eyeball in it - what more could you want? There's a race of SWAMP THING-like creatures who act as giant Venus Flytraps and dissolve their prey; some incredibly cheesy brute men with glowing green eyes who run around and kill things; a few hideous witches here and there for good measure, and of course lots of cruel warriors with evil-looking helmets whom our hero battles.The acting? Pretty much as you'd expect. Sub-par compared to mainstream films, i.e. just about non-existent, yet typical for your average barbarian flick. Marc Singer (you might recognise him as one of the leads in V) is suitably lean and muscular as the warrior, although his acting skills leave something to be desired, bless him. Tanya Roberts displays little acting talent, instead plenty of flesh; while Rip Torn goes over the top to make an enjoyably hammy villain. John Amos, who you might recognise from DIE HARD 2, fits the stereotyped role of a black sidekick just fine. Strangely enough, the cute animal stars manage to act their human counterparts off the screen every time...With plenty of action, ranging from sword fights to punch ups, an impressive array of sets and scenery, and some natty costumes, you could do a lot worse than THE BEASTMASTER. Two sequels predictably followed in the '90s, both of which have received a lot of flack - but they sound right up my street.

It was made for about 500,000 Australian Dollars and made about 100,000,000 US Dollars' worth worldwide. Even watching the movie, that number seems unbelievable. It is a good movie, don't get me wrong. But it does not seem to me like the sort of movie that would draw millions to the box office. It is less a Mad Max movie and more of a proto-Mad Max movie, the kind of movie that people nowadays make to capitalize on pre-existing franchising by calling them origin movies.I suppose the violence and wildheart and grim tone of the film would be a factor; at least in those days, before PG-13 became the default rating for pretty much everything in the known universe, it could be a draw, especially when the marketplace was devoid of such. But even that seems tame in the movie. Of course, that's because I watched this film after the other two films of the original trilogy. The people who first saw this movie didn't. And I suppose if you've never seen a Mad Max movie, this movie would incite more fire in you than was in those car crashes. Everything depends on perspective.But if I sound disappointed, it is only partly because this film did not sweep up my spirit and did Road Warrior and, later, Fury Road. It is also because I'm remembering that the first time I watched this film, it cut off about fifteen minutes before the end. Now, if you know what happens in the last fifteen minutes, like I did before I even watched this film, you know how disappointing that is. While this movie is quality, it does drag a bit despite being only ninety minutes long and unlike the other movies in this trilogy, it doesn't have that post-apocalyptic landscape to keep you bust. The last fifteen minutes is where it launches into a climatic fit of adrenaline and Max starts his descent into darkness that will continue in Road Warrior.Max is, as you should know, played by a very young Mel Gibson. His distinctive voice and cool yet crazy attitude are on full display, as demonstrated in an opening sequence in which he kills the leader of a bike gang and sets up the rest of the movie. I will say that it is interesting that the man who would ostensibly be the 'big bad' is fought at the beginning of the movie and the rest is about the antics of his henchmen.It is strange. This movie does not just feel like an origin story, it feels more like one than any of the actual origin stories created. The set-up is there when viewed through the prism of its other, superior brethren, this is pretty much a movie about how Mad Max became Mad Max; about his character arc to the dark anti-hero of the desert. As an origin story, it is spectacular because it feels authentic all the way through. The production values are low, the actor is actually young, and nothing feels forced. It is the perfect origin story. If Hollywood wants to keep making them, they should take lessons from this movie.As a stand-alone movie, it is uneven. It is grim, but not quite grim enough to captivate you. As a fan of the Mad Max series, I am glad there is a good movie about how he became who he is; it gives the other movies more weight. But this proto-apocalyptic world, while interesting, does not immerse you as much as do the sandy landscapes of the other films. The characters could have been a lot less interesting, but they are not enough to sustain the movie. This is not necessarily a bad thing; the Mad Max movies are not about tons of characterization and that works just fine for them. But it does make the film's flaws more apparent.Which is a disappointment, because when this movie works, it really works. There are moments in which you see the brilliance that defined the other movies. Innovative and sweeping cinematography. Clever editing. Just the right balance of insanity and humanity. Sharp lines when they're needed and wordless moments when it doesn't. And even when the movie meanders and drags, you're never completely taken out of the action.

The plot was that harry was sent to Dante's peak to see if there was any volcanic activity. Harry soon finds signs that the volcano is active for example dead squirrels, vegetation begin to die due sulphur dioxide and he found a couple that had been boiled up in hot springs. Harry wanted to send out an alert but Paul (the boss) wouldn't let him because it wasn't scientifically certain that it was going to erupt soon. Harry and Barry then go up to the volcano and send spider down to seen what was going on spider then stopped moving so Barry went down to fix the problem he unhooked himself from his harness and a minor earthquake occurs, rocks fall and harry breaks his leg. Later on in the film there is certain sign that the volcano is going to erupt and so they quickly call the town in to send an alert as they are in the middle of telling people what was about to happen an earthquake occurs soon the roof was falling in and the people panic and rush out the building in fear. The volcano erupts and Rachel Hs to get her kids who have drove up the mountain to save there grandma they then have to face many obstacles as there battle to get back down .when they finally make it down harry makes the decision to ram the car into this building as it was too dangerous to drive about the town ,he then gets Rachel and the kids to a safe spot and then rushes to the car to send a message to tell someone they are down there but rocks fall on top of him and he breaks his arm but pulls through and sends out the message and gets himself Rachel and her kids to safety, then him and Rachel fall in love and that's it. I did think it some parts it was unrealistic and exaggerated but was a good story, I really loved all of the gory parts and would totally recommended it if you aren't squeamish. I give Dante's peak a solid 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"23 October 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I am a Meryl Streep fan.

As if losing the baby wasn't enough. This movie shows the power of media. As soon as people start talking the whole story escalates. Everything went out of control. I find it so sad how everyone has to jump on the bandwagon, and this mom went to jail because of it. I know that with certain murder trials I have had quite a strong opinions of what I believe is true.

It was interesting to see how everyone has their opinion, in the beginning silly things like the name Azaria means sacrifice in the wilderness, and eventually it all turns into a hate for Lindy.

The Freddy here is not as scary as in the first film but not as corny as he would be in the later sequels when he was quoting Nintendo slogans. Probably the best thing about this to me are the interesting visuals the director and special effects teams conjure up.

The plot of the movie revolves around the dysfunctional family of the Tenenbaums and how they try to bond and sort out their personal problems when they all have to live under the same roof because their father Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is dying of terminal cancer. Recently I watched 'Anderson's' 'The Darjeeling Limited' and emphasized on how much I loved the visuals of the movie and the fact that I really needed to watch more Wes Anderson films. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' released before 'The Darjeeling Limited', however, seems to have equally amazing visual direction. Even though I know now that 'Wes Anderson' uses this particular style in almost all his movies, I cannot take this visual style for granted. This style of visual direction is utterly spectacular because it instantly sucks you into this world of the Tenenbaums. The rich color palette in this movie, the almost novel like feel, the sets, the lighting, the production design, the cinematography cannot be faulted one bit. And I can truly just watch this visual style of direction again and again because it is so effective in drawing my attention to this world of characters and tone of the movie. The narrative style of this movie is also very unique and that elevates the movie a few notches higher for me. The novel-style of a Prologue, Chapters and Epilogue really make this movie more believable and engaging, It helps the movie to easily transition between its multiple characters and story lines without seeming disjointed. I also particularly liked how each of these sections had narrations (by Alec Baldwin) inter-cut between the dialogues to make the movie feel much more like a novel, which gives the movie its own unique persona.The movie, as good as it visually and narratively, misses out a bit in terms of characters. The major reason I feel that happens is because there are so many characters and plot lines that need to be covered that we never really explore many of them properly. This reduced some of my interest in some of the stories going on in the movie and I kind of wanted to see more of some characters and less of the others. My favorite character in the movie was easily 'Royal Tenenbaum' played terrifically by Gene Hackman. Hackman's character is easily the most developed character and the one I empathized with the most. Hackman also gets some of the funniest dialogue and shares crackling chemistry with 'Kumar Pallana's' amazing 'Pagoda'. The other interesting characters include Paltrow's 'Margot', Glovers 'Henry Sherman' and Huston's 'Etheline'. Paltrow, in particular, acts really well as the most weird and unusual character in the movie. The rest of the characters in the movie are fine, but just not interesting enough to really explore. The acting is great all round, but the characters just did not engage me as much as I expected. The movie, also suffers because of some very ordinary dialogue. There is rarely anything (save for some of the dialogue between Pagoda and Royal) that makes you really laugh out loud or become really emotionally engaged (save for the last scene between Royal and Chaz) with the characters. The dialogue of the movie is not bad, but it just is not extraordinary or fresh like the movies visuals and some of its characters and this more than occasional imbalance, reduces the movies impact through its characters. Overall, I see The Royal Tenenbaums as a movie that could have truly been extraordinary if it found the right balance between visual and characters. Nonetheless, the movie still makes for a definite watch for its visuals, narrative and acting.

This is the War Room.This is only my third Stanley Kubrick film, but so far it's my favorite. I can't imagine how funny this film must have been when it came out in the mid 60's during the height of the Cold War, because more than 50 years later this black and white comedy continues to resonate in today's modern political world. It's sharp, it's smart, it's dark, but above all it's funny. It seems after so many decades that we haven't learned a thing about the sharp ironies presented here through each character and situation because the story continues to be relatable. The script is hilarious and the delivery from each actor is perfect, with several characters standing out. Peter Sellers does an amazing job playing three very different characters, but I was especially a fan of George C. Scott's portrayal of Gen. Buck. The scenes in the War Room were by far my favorite in the movie, but almost everything worked to perfection in this sharp and tightly written satire. The effects are a bit over the top but I think it simply adds to the overall craziness of the movie. I know I still have a lot of catching up with Kubrick films, but I don't see how his other films will top this one, at least entertaining wise. Satires can become a bit heavy handed after its initial first half, but this film maintains the laughs throughout its entire runtime. I'm surprised that I found this political comedy hilarious considering I'm not into politics at all, but I found it impossible not to watch it with a smile on my face. Is there a better political satire than Dr. Strangelove? I doubt it or at least I haven't come across one yet. What makes this film so relevant is that we are laughing at a nuclear threat in a time when the fear was very eminent. In the opening scenes we are introduced to General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who is giving his pilots secret orders to bomb the Soviet Union. Jack has gone mad and is overstepping his authority after discovering a loophole which allows him to order the attack without having to ask for permission from the US government. He has cut off all communication with the pilots so no one can stop his insane plan. Jack is convinced the communists are poisoning the world and he must stop them. When the President, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is informed of the General's plan he immediately calls his advisers to the War Room in order to try to put an end to Jack's madness. His adviser, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), informs the President how Jack was able to overstep his authority and in a hilarious scene through the big board shows the location of every plane as they are approaching the Soviet Union. Against Buck's advice, the President decides to invite Russian Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) to the War Room in order to discuss what is happening and to prove he isn't responsible for the attacks. Among the men in the room there is also Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a former Nazi scientist who is a specialist when it comes to nuclear weapons. The interactions between these characters and their efforts to stop Jack's plan in order to avoid the world's annihilation becomes the focal point of the film. Peter Sellers delivers outstanding work here playing the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Lionel Mandrake, who is Jack's right hand man and the only one who thinks he can stop him from executing his plan. He delivers three very distinctive characters and I honestly didn't recognize it was the same actor. George C. Scott is the standout however in his overly dramatic and serious delivery. His character was the one I laughed the most at. The things he says in such a serious tone are absolutely hilarious. I don't know how much of the lines were improvised or how much of it was actually scripted from Peter George's book, Red Alert, but all I can say is that every line was executed perfectly by these actors.

This is the War Room.This is only my third Stanley Kubrick film, but so far it's my favorite. I can't imagine how funny this film must have been when it came out in the mid 60's during the height of the Cold War, because more than 50 years later this black and white comedy continues to resonate in today's modern political world. It's sharp, it's smart, it's dark, but above all it's funny. It seems after so many decades that we haven't learned a thing about the sharp ironies presented here through each character and situation because the story continues to be relatable. The script is hilarious and the delivery from each actor is perfect, with several characters standing out. Peter Sellers does an amazing job playing three very different characters, but I was especially a fan of George C. Scott's portrayal of Gen. Buck. The scenes in the War Room were by far my favorite in the movie, but almost everything worked to perfection in this sharp and tightly written satire. The effects are a bit over the top but I think it simply adds to the overall craziness of the movie. I know I still have a lot of catching up with Kubrick films, but I don't see how his other films will top this one, at least entertaining wise. Satires can become a bit heavy handed after its initial first half, but this film maintains the laughs throughout its entire runtime. I'm surprised that I found this political comedy hilarious considering I'm not into politics at all, but I found it impossible not to watch it with a smile on my face. Is there a better political satire than Dr. Strangelove? I doubt it or at least I haven't come across one yet. What makes this film so relevant is that we are laughing at a nuclear threat in a time when the fear was very eminent. In the opening scenes we are introduced to General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who is giving his pilots secret orders to bomb the Soviet Union. Jack has gone mad and is overstepping his authority after discovering a loophole which allows him to order the attack without having to ask for permission from the US government. He has cut off all communication with the pilots so no one can stop his insane plan. Jack is convinced the communists are poisoning the world and he must stop them. When the President, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is informed of the General's plan he immediately calls his advisers to the War Room in order to try to put an end to Jack's madness. His adviser, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), informs the President how Jack was able to overstep his authority and in a hilarious scene through the big board shows the location of every plane as they are approaching the Soviet Union. Against Buck's advice, the President decides to invite Russian Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) to the War Room in order to discuss what is happening and to prove he isn't responsible for the attacks. Among the men in the room there is also Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a former Nazi scientist who is a specialist when it comes to nuclear weapons. The interactions between these characters and their efforts to stop Jack's plan in order to avoid the world's annihilation becomes the focal point of the film. Peter Sellers delivers outstanding work here playing the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Lionel Mandrake, who is Jack's right hand man and the only one who thinks he can stop him from executing his plan. He delivers three very distinctive characters and I honestly didn't recognize it was the same actor. George C. Scott is the standout however in his overly dramatic and serious delivery. His character was the one I laughed the most at. The things he says in such a serious tone are absolutely hilarious. I don't know how much of the lines were improvised or how much of it was actually scripted from Peter George's book, Red Alert, but all I can say is that every line was executed perfectly by these actors.

However, this movie is interesting in the way it depicts the demons of the average man. A successful old man who is married to a woman he clearly doesn't deserve and thinks he is entitled to the world. She knows he is a pedophile and therefore doesn't want him to touch her so they have an estranged marriage, while he goes about looking for prostitutes which are the only women who won't reveal his abusive nature and that he actually likes little girls. He thinks it's OK because they are prostitutes and so he can pretend that they are not real girls. When becoming a suspect of such gruesome murders and rapes of little girls he is clearly sickened by it at first, but as we dig deeper his real thoughts come out and we discover that this rich, intelligent, subtle man could easily be the monster that he is being accused of being. The idea of raping and murdering children is not so far-fetched when we know what he has been doing, and we become aware of the fine line between going to prostitutes, where a man can relieve his gruesome nature and get away with it, and actually killing and raping. The only problem is the ending when his wife actually seemed to have felt remorse because she thought he was guilty. Makes no sense after his atrocious behaviour, cheating and attraction to 13 year old girls, she should have run the other way. Overall it was a nice film worth the time, good acting (apart for Thomas Jane).

This is the only one of three films that I saw that were directed by Jack Nicholson himself, and I really wonder how much help he got. Some cinematography is dazzlingly beautiful, but did he really - for instance - find that exact location (the one with the wooden poles) at the Californian coastline where Rawley and Gittes have their conversation by himself? Maybe that's not what directing is all about, and I'm a bit of a laymen in that respect, but isn't directing also about keeping an eye on the development of the story and coaching your actors? The story is not uninteresting, but it's a somewhat uninspired carbon-copy of its predecessor with rather mediocre acting, and, I guessed straight away that the 'mystery lady' was indeed Miss Mulwray... And that soundtrack could have been toned a bit, couldn't it?Then, there are some really odd scenes, seemingly thrown in for the 'good measure' of simply trying something different, like the sex scene with Stowe and the 'suck my gun' scene with Keith. They cóuld have worked, but they felt (way) out of tune here.I can't say that 'The two Jakes' is a bad film, it is much too easy on the eyes and the story and acting are entertaining enough, but - unsurprisingly - it has almost none of the magic of its predecessor 'Chinatown'. The cinematography is pretty much impeccable, the story was worked out pretty well and the overall atmosphere was more than doable, but that's about it. By the way, did anyone notice Jack rambling on an on (he could talk the balls off a...) while that one tune set in, that same tune that the Coen brothers used in the film noir parody 'The big Lebowski'? Another fun bit was when Jake broke into a house when an old-time commercial was on. I hope it was an original, but I really don't know.Well entertaining, for sure, but also quite bleak compared to the original. 6 to 7 out of 10.

That adds a sadness to the story. A sadness about changing times and the new way of life replacing the old way of life. That is a recurring theme in the film. I loved the use of black and white photography, which helps those themes. The film explores many things all teens go through such as exploring their sexuality, keeping friendships intact, graduating high school, and moving on to the next stage of life. The film explores all of those very well. The film is set in a town where everyone knows each other, which in turn enables the viewers to get to know the characters better.Peter Bogdanovich's film has a plot that is hard to describe, other than to say it is about growing up in a town that weeps of the past. Sonny Crawford is the main character here. He was a co-captain of his football team along with his best friend Duane. Sonny just broke up with his rather tasteless girl, while Duane dates the hottest girl in town. Sonny enters an affair with the middle-aged wife of the football coach, thus showing how far this town can get you.The film has many fine actors in it. Timothy Bottoms does an underrated job as Sonny. I really loved Jeff Bridge's performance as Duane, the guy who seems to have it all. Other performances to keep an eye on are Ben Johnson as the fatherly figure and most important man in town, Sam the Lion. And Cloris Leachman as Ruth, the wife Sonny has an affair with. She has quite a few powerful scenes.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a better film than I expected. A beautiful, poignant film about the pains of growing up. The tone is often bitter and sad. We don't often see happiness in the picture, from beginning to end. But we see our characters make most of their lives and that is what matters. All of the sad moments or in other words, the realism influence just how powerful this movie is, set against the 1950's Texas background. There are many great scenes, but I loved the funny scene involving running away from Texas just to head to Kansas. If you want a movie about growing up, this should be your first film to watch.My Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2015","score":"","review":" The Last Picture Show is a very poignant coming-of-age story set amidst a dying Texas town, culturally and economically.

Sonny Crawford is the main character here. He was a co-captain of his football team along with his best friend Duane. Sonny just broke up with his rather tasteless girl, while Duane dates the hottest girl in town. Sonny enters an affair with the middle-aged wife of the football coach, thus showing how far this town can get you.The film has many fine actors in it. Timothy Bottoms does an underrated job as Sonny. I really loved Jeff Bridge's performance as Duane, the guy who seems to have it all. Other performances to keep an eye on are Ben Johnson as the fatherly figure and most important man in town, Sam the Lion. And Cloris Leachman as Ruth, the wife Sonny has an affair with. She has quite a few powerful scenes.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a better film than I expected. A beautiful, poignant film about the pains of growing up. The tone is often bitter and sad. We don't often see happiness in the picture, from beginning to end. But we see our characters make most of their lives and that is what matters. All of the sad moments or in other words, the realism influence just how powerful this movie is, set against the 1950's Texas background. There are many great scenes, but I loved the funny scene involving running away from Texas just to head to Kansas. If you want a movie about growing up, this should be your first film to watch.My Grade A ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"23 October 2015","score":"","review":" The Last Picture Show is a very poignant coming-of-age story set amidst a dying Texas town, culturally and economically. That adds a sadness to the story. A sadness about changing times and the new way of life replacing the old way of life. That is a recurring theme in the film. I loved the use of black and white photography, which helps those themes. The film explores many things all teens go through such as exploring their sexuality, keeping friendships intact, graduating high school, and moving on to the next stage of life. The film explores all of those very well.
