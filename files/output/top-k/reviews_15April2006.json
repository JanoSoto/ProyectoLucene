Knowing nothing of the artsy stuff in the movie realm, I do appreciate art when I see it and feel it ... and this movie has art written all over it. In viewing the great sculpture of The Thinker, this movie was sculptured with caring hands\/thought and designed by a true thinking and uniquely creative artist.One area of imperfection here is that the sex scenes could have been lessened and shortened as I felt it took much away from the movie's fine craft(iness). Fast-forward 2x, 4x all the way to 8x .. sex scene way too long. Padding or filler .. should have been on the editing cutter's floor.This movie was more of a sculpture made of marble or bronze or perhaps gold? ... or silver? It has a beauty that is not easily defined or describable, but when viewed it leaves one with a distinct impression of stunning and thoughtful awe. After viewing, I asked myself how could the title have been made better, but the symbolism involved of the one scene makes the title appropriate and yet carved with a slight Mona Lisa grin.Harvey Keitel's character was unique and I can't imagine anyone else being able to pull it off as he managed to do. I watched the movie as it unfolded each new particle of new thought to bridge to another, leaving me with using my own skills to fill in pieces and parts .. which was really enjoyable to do! And then, the surprise at the end, which I won't reveal, was charming and captivating. This one I'll definitely watch again before returning it in the mail and am considering buying it for my library. If you don't like symbolism, and are not a deep thinker, you'll not like this movie. This one is definitely a Criterion Collection formula. I can't say enough about it, but yet can't convey in words to properly give it the kudos that it deserves. Not a 10 vote, but a 15 or 20!

I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. I went back to school and got my GED. I went to college for Media Arts and Animation (because I wanted to be GL) and got my bachelors. I moved to Studio City, Ca to go to USC and started my real life, the one I envisioned when I was 5, and within 3 years I own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, I don't do drugs or drink In essence, I have everything I have ever wanted for myself and I have Star Wars and George Lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the SW world and be the best damn Fan Club president anyone can. I have a few ideas for how I can make it better for us as fans  I feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved Star Wars. For the first time in SW history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. For the entire time SW has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to Lucas there will never be another film. Of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new Star Wars film. It's probably the greatest experiences of my life and I don't want it to end! I feel that there is a way around this though. If there were more conventions than SW would stay alive forever. If we as fans can come together more frequently I believe SW would never leave us and its that simple. We need to urge LucasFilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. Not just every 3 years, but every year. Not in just one city but multiple cities. One of the things I found to be disturbing was that because it was in Indianapolis, and only in Indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. They would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. These reasons deterred a lot of people away and that I feel is not fair to them. It should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. If LucasFilm will not cooperate with this I feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as President of the fan club I would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen! I also feel that SW fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet. We at an early age saw the talent that went into making these films and have been trying to find that talent within ourselves ever since, and the best part about it is many of us have but we don't know what to do with it!! Especially in a day and age where there are more film students than law students and a time where the world is the smallest its ever been in the history of the Earth. We as a society are watching films from England, France, Japan and so on and seeing the impact that SW has had on not just the USA, but the world!! I propose that if I become president I begin an organization where people from all over the planet can submit their artworks (not just SW stuff) and gain the assistance of people in the entertainment industry. From writing to storyboarding to CGI to film and all that has to do with it. An organization by SW fans for SW fans!! A way to come up and not need no one but ourselves to make it happen. If we took all the talent that is in the group of people that will read this letter and put it together in a serious way your talking American Zoetrope to the tenth power. Your talking about possibly the next wave of great filmmakers. A way for me to give back.I felt an obligation to do this. If I don't win this contest I want everyone who reads this to know how I feel about everything that has been going on around us in the SW society as an extremely concerned fan. I think that everyone I have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the Weekends at Disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and I am so greateful that I'm a part of it.

If I don't win this contest I want everyone who reads this to know how I feel about everything that has been going on around us in the SW society as an extremely concerned fan. I think that everyone I have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the Weekends at Disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and I am so greateful that I'm a part of it.

I went back to school and got my GED. I went to college for Media Arts and Animation (because I wanted to be GL) and got my bachelors. I moved to Studio City, Ca to go to USC and started my real life, the one I envisioned when I was 5, and within 3 years I own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, I don't do drugs or drink In essence, I have everything I have ever wanted for myself and I have Star Wars and George Lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the SW world and be the best damn Fan Club president anyone can. I have a few ideas for how I can make it better for us as fans  I feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved Star Wars. For the first time in SW history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. For the entire time SW has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to Lucas there will never be another film. Of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new Star Wars film. It's probably the greatest experiences of my life and I don't want it to end! I feel that there is a way around this though. If there were more conventions than SW would stay alive forever. If we as fans can come together more frequently I believe SW would never leave us and its that simple. We need to urge LucasFilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. Not just every 3 years, but every year. Not in just one city but multiple cities. One of the things I found to be disturbing was that because it was in Indianapolis, and only in Indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. They would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. These reasons deterred a lot of people away and that I feel is not fair to them. It should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. If LucasFilm will not cooperate with this I feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as President of the fan club I would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen! I also feel that SW fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet.

The scene of children's burning an ant at the very beginning of the movie shows that every beautiful individual are weak and easy to get destroyed, which is Malena's tragic destiny. The pure love to Malena from little Renato is the most beautiful thing in this wide world, I have to say. And the OST for this emotion is just like another Mozart from paradise. This precious piece of love could remind everyone of his\/her deepest love which has never been spoken out, even to one's death, it's babylish in every aspect, but it's TRUE. About the adults, I really don't want to say anything about them to bring up my feeling of disgust. The point I do want to make is that at last Malena's fitting into the world just because she has lost her charm is in a sense the tragic of human beings. Only Renato's love lasts, which makes the most beautiful memory and feeling for a lifetime. My favourite Giuseppe Tornatore film.

The Devil's Advocate is a really good, quality film that manages to be both highly thought provoking and tremendously entertaining at the same time. I really enjoyed this a lot.The three main performers are all at their best. This film was made before Theron became such a big name and she is as good in this as everything else she's in. She actually steals the movie a few times and more then holds her own with the likes of AL Pacino.Then there's Keanu Reeves. Although his performance has received some not so good reviews, I liked him in this role and thought he does his best work here. Keanu is suited to a certain type of role and he was perfect for the role of Kevin. As mentioned, this movie reminded me, at first, a little of The Firm and I certainly thought Reeves was better in his role then Cruise was as Mitchelle Mc.Deer in The Firm. Just my opinion but I thought it was great casting.And then there's Pacino. Absolutely and completely superb. This is one of the best roles, if not the best, I have ever seen him play and could anyone else really have been as perfect for the role as Pacino? This was a movie where the casting definitely helped make it what it was.One thing I enjoyed so much about The Devil's Advocate is how one doesn't know what will happen moment to moment. In the world of movies, it seems the majority are at least somewhat predictable. Not so in Advocate. It was so very nice to actually be surprised. And not surprised once either. The movie has several zingers which I never saw coming and that's a great challenge in movie land. Advocate was definitely up to that challenge.Then there's the cinematography which was excellent and the story itself which is provocative and thought provoking in it's tale of vanity and human corruption. And though it has a long running time it seems much shorter then it actually is. And the movie has humor as well and that humor makes for some great moments, the conversation between Pacino and the two knife wielding men on the train for example. Devil's Advocate comes close to a 10 for me, though not quite. There were some plot holes and things I didn't understand. Also, though the humor in Advocate was usually outstanding, it was weakened when the film got a little to campy at times which didn't go with the rest of the movie, especially since so much of Advocate was genuinely creepy. This is probably a film best seen more then once and there are several things that are open to interpretation.Then there's the ending. Althoughh this is not the type of ending I like In most films AT ALL, for some reason it fit here. And by the time the film ends, one is in such a high state of anticipation to see what's gonna happen, and so into the movie, that it's ending is almost OK. I say almost because I still think the ending could have been a little stronger but that's just a minor complaint. I'd give this a 9 of 10 and really recommend it.

The plot was very cool which involved many twists and turns. They took the simple plot of robbing a casino and they added this HUGE twist at the end to leave you on the edge of your seat. The music here adds a nice tone with the sensational jazz tunes from David Holmes. Shows like Thief or Heist don't have enough....... originality or plot to entertain you.

I had heard so many bad things that from the beginning I thought it was going to be incredibly stupid. It wasn't...at first. It starts off very clever, and even had my heart racing in a few scenes, and that doesn't happen very often when I watch scary movies. The atmosphere is great, some of the scenes are incredibly scary, and then at about an hour through, the atmosphere takes a dive with the twists, which didn't necessarily ruin the movie in themselves. Being a remake of a Vincent Price movie, I was expecting a little bit of oh, come on! so I wasn't totally bothered at first. However, with the first bit of the corny comes an all out bomb of an ending. I was not so upset with the computer animation being so terrible, I thought they could have made it work if it lead to something of a decent ending...it didn't. Where halfway through the movie I was clutching the seat of my chair and grimacing, at the beginning of the credits I was scrunching my brow in a give me a break, what the hell was that? kind of look. It's as if halfway through the filming of the movie they switched to someone completely amateur both in writing and in filming. The scaryness was wrung out of the entire movie with one of Digg's last lines, which I won't say here, but you'll probably know it when you hear it. I gave this 6 out of 10 because a little more than half of is actually really good, the rest takes a dive into cheesy writing, terrible special effects, and a give me a break ending.

Reassured & taken to hospital by NASA representative Sherman Reese (Joe Morton) both men seem fine & are soon discharged, however Jillian notices a change in Spencer as he seems different somehow. Spencer then accepts a job in New York with Mclaren out of the blue so they both move out there but not before Alex suddenly dies & his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide. Shortly after arriving in New York Jillian discovers that she is pregnant with twins but still has an uneasy feeling about Spencer which gets worse when Reese turns up to tell her that Spencer is not who he says, that Natalie was pregnant with twins when she committed suicide & that he has proof that the two minutes when Earth lost contact with Spencer something sinister happened up there...Written & directed by Rand Ravich I thought The Astronaut's Wife was a decent sci-fi drama. The script is pretty slow going at times & when you break it down very little actually happens but it has one thing going for it, it grips & engages the viewer. We, the audience that is, know something is not quite right with Spencer & the film manages to build the tension up so you want to know what & keep watching to find out, it has that slight hook that grabs you & draws you into the film. The story is told almost exclusively from the point of view of Jillian, in fact this is a pretty much one person film as almost all the running time focuses on Jillian, her thoughts & feelings which helps you relate to her. If your looking for aliens, death & lots of special effects then The Astronaut's Wife definitely isn't for you but if you want something character driven with a sci-fi angle then this may be just what you've been looking for. I must say now that I didn't like the ending that much, it didn't seem to make any sense to me. The final few minutes just doesn't explain anything, were deeply unsatisfying & they left me scratching my head somewhat. Overall I thought the time spent watching was worth it but it's far from the most exciting sci-fi film ever, just imagine the Species (1995 - 2004) series of films but without the action, gore, nudity, aliens or excitement but keep the impregnation theme, which is similar to Rosemarys Baby (1968) as well, & you'll have some idea of what The Astronaut's Wife is like.Director Ravich does a good job & the film looks nice & has a style about it. There's one or two effective moments in here, the scene set in a toy store was well done as are one or two other scenes. Forget about any elaborate special effects or alien creatures as there aren't any here which may disappoint potential viewers, it did me. Ravich seems to shy away from making an out & out sci-fi\/horror film & as such The Astronaut's Wife comes across as a psychological thriller most of the time, there aren't any scares, shocks or gore in it anyway. The sex scene between Theron & Depp is as tame as they come, it's filmed from the waist up & neither seem take any of their clothes off!With a supposed budget of about $34,000,000 I have to ask where all the money went, I just can't see The Astronaut's Wife costing 34 big ones. There are no big special effects scenes & a small cast. Personally I would have liked to have seen a bit more on screen for that sort of cash. The acting was OK, neither Theron or Depp were not yet at the height of their fame when they made this.The Astronaut's Wife was a decent enough film to watch if you stick with it but it hardly set the pulse racing. I have to be honest & say that I expected a bit more, some proper horror & sci-fi which it all but fails to deliver. Definitely worth a watch but don't expect anything brilliant.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"15 April 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The Astronaut's Wife tells the tale of Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) & her husband Commander Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp) who live in Florida & are very happy together, happy that is until one fateful day when Jillian hears on the news that an incident in space has happened involving her husband & fellow astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) who were out of radio contact with Earth for two minutes. Reassured & taken to hospital by NASA representative Sherman Reese (Joe Morton) both men seem fine & are soon discharged, however Jillian notices a change in Spencer as he seems different somehow. Spencer then accepts a job in New York with Mclaren out of the blue so they both move out there but not before Alex suddenly dies & his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide. Shortly after arriving in New York Jillian discovers that she is pregnant with twins but still has an uneasy feeling about Spencer which gets worse when Reese turns up to tell her that Spencer is not who he says, that Natalie was pregnant with twins when she committed suicide & that he has proof that the two minutes when Earth lost contact with Spencer something sinister happened up there...Written & directed by Rand Ravich I thought The Astronaut's Wife was a decent sci-fi drama. The script is pretty slow going at times & when you break it down very little actually happens but it has one thing going for it, it grips & engages the viewer. We, the audience that is, know something is not quite right with Spencer & the film manages to build the tension up so you want to know what & keep watching to find out, it has that slight hook that grabs you & draws you into the film. The story is told almost exclusively from the point of view of Jillian, in fact this is a pretty much one person film as almost all the running time focuses on Jillian, her thoughts & feelings which helps you relate to her. If your looking for aliens, death & lots of special effects then The Astronaut's Wife definitely isn't for you but if you want something character driven with a sci-fi angle then this may be just what you've been looking for. I must say now that I didn't like the ending that much, it didn't seem to make any sense to me. The final few minutes just doesn't explain anything, were deeply unsatisfying & they left me scratching my head somewhat. Overall I thought the time spent watching was worth it but it's far from the most exciting sci-fi film ever, just imagine the Species (1995 - 2004) series of films but without the action, gore, nudity, aliens or excitement but keep the impregnation theme, which is similar to Rosemarys Baby (1968) as well, & you'll have some idea of what The Astronaut's Wife is like.Director Ravich does a good job & the film looks nice & has a style about it. There's one or two effective moments in here, the scene set in a toy store was well done as are one or two other scenes. Forget about any elaborate special effects or alien creatures as there aren't any here which may disappoint potential viewers, it did me.

I left the theatre utterly relieved and having made peace with the fact I someday would forget my ordeal. My friends found the movie good. That amazed me because it just doesn't work. Mr Connery can only play Mr Connery and to be honest that is fine with me. I mean, he does it really well. But not even that can make this film bearable. The scene where the distant angry young man enters Connery' apartment and randomly opens up, speaking about abandonment and neglect without having even seen Mr Bond. Well, that is one way of reaching out. I never figured out what the romance with the high-class poor little rich girl was supposed to establish. Miss Paquin, however, who in the past managed to get wonderfully human performances out of mutes and ducks can do very little with her co-star. In fact one wonders if her better scenes landed on the cutting room floor. One scene which did not land on the cutting room floor was the infamous further\/farther scene. Since I saw that scene I have started using them wrongly in the hope some angry young man will correct me and i can get a cheap laugh. Even bringing in Matt Damon as a nod to Good Will Hunting could only make the situation worse. It was... sad. (Adam Sandler would have been better, well funkier at least.) I have no farther comment!

I thought Brad Pitt, against a lot of people's expectations, performed very convincingly, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, stunned me and transported me. Claire Forlani was the only main actress who suffered slightly but still pulled off a reasonable performance. I personally thought the Jamaican Woman, played by Lois Kelly-Miller was very touching, and the conversations between most of the characters were all interesting and well, some of the advice you could put into use in your own daily lives.The story line is edgy and dwells on sensitive subjects such as Death, Love and Happiness, I suppose. The wisdom behind it is unmistakable. I think this movie is underrated. Despite the disappointing Trailer, the movie will blow you away. I watched it on VCD, something that has low-ish quality on a computer, yet I managed to sit through all 170 minutes, completely stunned and unable to budge from concentration.Overall, this movie is definitely recommended. A bit deep for your kids, I guess- I tried watching it with my niece but she ruined it slightly by everlasting flow of questions.I'm giving it a 10\/10 for it being emotional and funny at times.

Rocky V is one such film that is affected by the &#150; as I call it &#150; Phantom Menace syndrome. This refers to Movies that are interesting in their own way but fail to live up to the hype or expectation of previous instalments, or simply do not follow the formula that everyone derided for being too predictable anyway. For me, Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original, as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one over-sized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches, not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping. The fifth instalment in the anthology goes back to the more personal story of the character, and deals much more realistically with the aftermath of loss and the twisted nature of professional prize fighting.Stallone recruited his own son for the role of Robert (Rocky's son) and the result is one of the best father son relationships ever committed to celluloid. The scene where Rocky realises that he has been a negligent father and must make his peace with the boy is affectionate and heartfelt and could never been as realistic without the real life history behind these two people.OK, there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. The casting of Tommy 'The Machine' Gunn could have been better as real life boxer Tommy Morrison sometimes appears wooden and is never really threatening enough to Rocky for the final fight to have any tangible tension. Similarly, aside from the final tune of Elton John's 'The measure of a man' the music does not measure up to the awesome and inspirational anthems that have accompanied previous instalments. Any Flick in the early nineties that used rap music as its primary soundtrack has ultimately dated for a modern audience.My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. There are some sad moments in this fall from grace story as well as few goofs in terms of weak acting.

At one level, I enjoyed the movie immensely, for its powerful performances (OK - I have this terrible bias. No matter how much I try, I cannot completely dislike a De Niro movie) and the director's willingness to tread off the beaten path and look at issues that are real and disturbing, but which do not necessarily make the cash registers tingle. At another level, throughout watching the movie, I could not contain my disappointment at the inept treatment that is meted out by the script and the sketchy storyline.Was the director trying to document an epic human struggle, crafting out a modern day fairy tale, commenting on disturbing social issues or telling a plain love story? And this is where, I think, the movie fails. John Ford, Frank Capra and a host of others have made epic movies about human struggle; Bergman, Woody Allen and a host of art-house directors have delved on various social issues and several film makers from William Wyler to Stephen Spielberg have had their versions of modern day fairy tales. But none of them wanted to be everything in one movie.The first fifteen minutes of the movie make you think you are about to watch an intense, off-beat social document about burning issues like illiteracy, widowhood, old age, loneliness, teenage motherhood, poverty, mother-daughter relationship etc.In fact they are all hurled at you one after the other in the first reel itself. It's like the director saying - OK, this is CNN. First the headlines....now, let me see, have I missed anything. Oh of course, teenage motherhood. OK...here you go! OK, guys, now I'm done with the social issues bit, let's get to the love story part.OK, now - guys - how about some real fairy tale stuff. A rags-to-riches story that's so improbable. Guys, I have only ten minutes of shoot time left - quick, get him rich...hurry! It's here that I feel intellectually cheated.At one point in the movie, Robert De Niro asks Jane Fonda why does it have to be all or nothing for you?

Intriguing because, despite all this, despite the predictable ending and the lack of character-building (the waster brother-in-law shows up once and then disappears forever, for instance) and general lack of depth - you cannot really dislike it.

No matter how much I try, I cannot completely dislike a De Niro movie) and the director's willingness to tread off the beaten path and look at issues that are real and disturbing, but which do not necessarily make the cash registers tingle. At another level, throughout watching the movie, I could not contain my disappointment at the inept treatment that is meted out by the script and the sketchy storyline.Was the director trying to document an epic human struggle, crafting out a modern day fairy tale, commenting on disturbing social issues or telling a plain love story? And this is where, I think, the movie fails. John Ford, Frank Capra and a host of others have made epic movies about human struggle; Bergman, Woody Allen and a host of art-house directors have delved on various social issues and several film makers from William Wyler to Stephen Spielberg have had their versions of modern day fairy tales. But none of them wanted to be everything in one movie.The first fifteen minutes of the movie make you think you are about to watch an intense, off-beat social document about burning issues like illiteracy, widowhood, old age, loneliness, teenage motherhood, poverty, mother-daughter relationship etc.In fact they are all hurled at you one after the other in the first reel itself. It's like the director saying - OK, this is CNN. First the headlines....now, let me see, have I missed anything. Oh of course, teenage motherhood. OK...here you go! OK, guys, now I'm done with the social issues bit, let's get to the love story part.OK, now - guys - how about some real fairy tale stuff. A rags-to-riches story that's so improbable. Guys, I have only ten minutes of shoot time left - quick, get him rich...hurry! It's here that I feel intellectually cheated.At one point in the movie, Robert De Niro asks Jane Fonda why does it have to be all or nothing for you? That's the same question I'd like to ask the director.I started by saying it's an intriguing movie. Intriguing because, despite all this, despite the predictable ending and the lack of character-building (the waster brother-in-law shows up once and then disappears forever, for instance) and general lack of depth - you cannot really dislike it. The sheer poignancy and the earnestness of the lead characters (they were battling a sorry script along with poverty, loneliness etc. - full marks to them!) makes you forget your cinematic senses for a while and keep on watching.If I get a chance, I'll probably watch this movie again, and it's not because of Mr De Niro alone.Drawing a somewhat (though very different in theme and treatment) parallel - a much more powerful film about middle-aged post-marital flirtations starring De Niro in a similar 'soft' role was 'Falling in love' with Merryl Streep. However, while FIL delivers perfectly, on every count and remains a mini-classic (IMHO), this one comes nowhere close.It could easily have. Pity.

The minor problem that I could predict everything since the formula is so well known held this movie back from a perfect score. Not that this is the fault of the movie, but the other lesser slasher films. But just knowing that this movie pretty much invented a genre makes me admire it on its own. But Halloween still has many scenes that are original, different, and most importantly, SCARY. Carpenter slowly shows more and more of adult Michael Myers in each scene, first starting from a point of view shot, then a man seen from a distance, then a pair of hands, until he is completely revealed in all his terrifying glory. Carpenter also is a master of tension,where in some scenes I look around to make sure I am alone. Halloween is a very worthwhile picture to watch and definitely one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.

I have wanted to express my appreciation for this film for a long time, and I think that today, the 94th anniversary of the tragedy, is an appropriate time to do it...I first saw this film on April 22nd 1998. I wasn't expecting very much...after all, you know how it ends...the ship sinks. But wow...I was absolutely blown away by Titanic. I literally could not think of anything else for weeks on end, such was the effect it had on me. In short, Titanic awakened my interest in cinema.The film is presented as a love story between Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose (Winslet). Jack is a poor, steerage passenger, and his character represents the least likely group of people to survive the disaster. Rose is a wealthy first-class passenger, and she represents those most likely to survive the disaster. They fall in love against the odds. And although some people find their story corny, I found it incredibly touching.The acting is excellent throughout. Kate Winslet is a revelation as the feisty heroine. And Leo DiCaprio is perfect as Jack, the winsome ray of sunshine. The real stand-out performance for me was that of Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews the shipbuilder...his final scenes are truly heartbreaking. Also worth noting is the wonderful cinematography, the beautiful, historically-accurate costumes and James Horner's fantastic soundtrack. And, of course, Celine Dion and My Heart Will Go On.I will admit that this is not a film for the cynical. It is not your typical noisy disaster movie...the over-riding message of Titanic is that self-sacrifice is noble, and that true love can conquer all, even death. I cannot describe how emotional the ending is...Rose makes a promise to Jack, and she keeps it...the ending at the top of the stairs is...gulp...I'm going to start crying now! A fine tribute to all those who died aboard the great ship on April 15, 1912. Thank you James Cameron!
