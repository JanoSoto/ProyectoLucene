I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film was even better than I'd remembered.  It may be my favorite film from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.Given the fact that horror films have become increasingly macabre and disturbing over the years, Psycho does seem to have lost much of it's ability to frighten the viewer.  Just imagine how this movie must have effected audiences in 1960.  They'd never seen anything remotely close to this.  I wish I could have been there.Sadly, I'm a member of the younger generation, who has had the plot twists and famous moments spoiled for me.  I can't appreciate the shower scene as much as most people because I probably saw dozens of rip-offs and spoofs of it before seeing the real thing.  I was immune to being truly shocked by Psycho, but it's an amazing experience, nonetheless.Besides Hitchcock's ingenious direction, the key reason for the film's greatness is Anthony Perkins.  He totally masters the psychotic Norman Bates with understated nervousness and desperation.  Bates is the true main character of the film, and we can identify with him more than we can with any of the other characters.I don't find Psycho to be terrifying; it's more thrilling and fun than scary.  There are a few ominous moments to be found, though.  My favorite is the final scene, with Bates in the asylum.  It is genuinely uncomfortable to look at as the camera slowly zooms in closer to Bates' facial expressions, leaving the viewer in a state of claustrophobia.  His final grin at the camera is truly spine tingling and unforgettable.  It's one of the many images in Psycho that is imbedded in my mind.There is only one set of scenes in the movie which I find to be a bit tedious, and that would be Norman's clean-up of the bathroom.  Not that it isn't necessary, it just seems as if we see him doing more cleaning than we really need to.  But this is a small fault in a nearly perfect film, which is as exciting and mesmerizing as it ever was.  In other words, Psycho hasn't aged a day.

Sometimes you walk out wishing you could have your three hours back. Othertimes, you walk out thinking the experience was *much* better than you'd hoped.That's how I felt after seeing Reign of Fire. It's a rare occurance; Matrix and the original Die Hard were two movies I walked into thinking they would be so-so and they turned out to greatly surprise me. That's a wonderful experience, if you ask me. A tremendous feeling of satisfaction, like you earned the money you spent. You probably know by now the plot of this movie. It's a visualization of numerous science-fiction novels from past decades, where the modern world is thrown kicking and screaming back into the Dark Ages. In this instance, it's a large male dragon unleashed by unsuspecting British construction workers. The dragons breed like locusts, so fast that most of us can't comprehend the extent of the numbers until it's too late.The movie is set in England, another plus. Too many times these movies are spent in America and I think it's nice to transport the movies to other world locales. Britain is the perfect setting because humans, once again, find themselves holed up in castle fortresses, about the only thing that are keeping the dragon hordes at bay. Inside the castle is a refreshing mix of modern technology and 16th Century living, where modern-day gadgets rub shoulders with tales of fantasy, fairy-tale and the supernatural. This is one of the few movies that captures what is can normally be told in the pages of a books, and it's this blending of ages - and an almost intoxicating gritty, dirty atmosphere that blankets this movie from start to end - that makes Reign of Fire work so well.The British are a tough people. They always have been. Probably always will be. And inside their castles that dot the Isle, the scattered remains of the once great British Empire are found struggling and making ends meet even as dragons buzz bomb them from the skies, much like the Nazis did to London and surrounding countryside during the early days of World War II.Down the road in a cloud of dust comes the Americans, making one Britian quip, The one thing worst than a dragon are Americans. Well, as an American, I didn't mind seeing the Americans in this movie portrayed as warriors pure and pure. After all, it seems to be America's legacy to bail Europe and its people time and time again out of trouble, and we don't fail this legacy in this movie. What should keep the Europeans from screaming Americanism at the top of their lungs, however, is that this movie is essentially about Europeans - Britians in general - and how a Britain (SPOILER ALERT) eventually is the one that brings down the baddie.

Kirk Douglas put on a fabulous performance as Colonel Dax, a French Army officer during the First World War, whose troops are ordered to launch an impossible attack on a German position by their commander, General Broullard (Adolphe Menjou), only to then see three of the soldiers arrested as examples and subjected to a court martial for cowardice - defended by Dax - because the impossible attack failed.The portrayal of the upper echelons of the military is not flattering. Broullard (although making frequent visits to the trenches) has little compassion for his men, treating projected casualty estimates as if they were, indeed, nothing more than numbers on a piece of paper. Death in battle is portrayed by virtually all the generals we're introduced to as a glorious thing, with even unjust executions being justified as necessary to build the morale of the remaining soldiers. The best line of the entire movie was spoken by Dax, who - after being subjected to one of those ridiculous arguments about how noble executions are - asks General Miraud (George Macready) do you really believe all that nonsense?The soldiers in the trenches are treated with respect by Kubrick, whose clear bias is against the decision-makers. Dax comes across in the film as the only truly noble officer, who really cares about his men and about justice and who despises the military caste for its insensitivity, corruption and just plain stupidity. (This being accounted for by Dax being a famous criminal lawyer in civilian life, rather than a career officer.) In fact, Dax is so noble that in the end General Miraud can't understand that everything Dax did was because he believed in it; Miraud preferring to believe that Dax was simply out for Broullard's command, and then dismissing him when he discovers that Dax is an honest man as a simple idealist. The clear message is simple there's no room for idealists in the military.It's a well filmed movie; gritty in its realism.

Our story opens in an insane asylum on October 29, 2001. Laurie Strode has been committed--for murder. Yes, apparently the man she decapitated in H20 wasn't Michael. When a paramedic came to collect Michael Myers' body, he woke up and switched clothes with the man, so it was the poor paramedic that got his head chopped off.The real Michael Myers vanished, until now. He's been stalking Laurie and finally comes inside the hospital, killing two guards. Laurie escapes to the roof and tries to get the best of Michael by hanging him by his leg. She had to be sure it was him so she attempted to remove his mask, but he grabbed her and stabbed her. She fell to her death. Myers escapes.         A group of college students at Haddonfield University were planning to set up a live web-cast from the Myers house. The project was headed by Freddie Harris. The students chosen were Sara Moyer, Bill Woodlake, Jenna Danzig, Donna Chang, Jim Morgan and Rudy Grimes. It would be like a reality show broadcast on the Internet. Sara was nervous about doing it, but Freddie assured her it was the right thing to do.        At the Myers house, the doors were locked. The windows boarded. It was just the six kids and Freddie and his girlfriend. What they didn't suspect was Michael Myers was locked in the house with them.He began to kill every person he came across. 'Til finally only Sara and Freddie were left. They tried to take him down but it didn't work. Finally, all the electrical wires in the house and gasoline spilled from an old lawnmower set the house ablaze and Michael Myers is electrocuted.        Is this the end of Michael Myers? No. And those of you who are counting on seeing Michael's face are going to be disappointed. They don't show his face. There were several attempts but they all failed. But keep in mind his face was shown in the first Halloween. Michael isn't a monster like Jason Voorhees, he just looks like a normal person. I suspect there will be a Halloween 9. But what would it be about? Michael going after more family? The way it looks, there may be no end. But anyway, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. It was better than I thought. And, according to this movie, Halloween III, 4, 5 and 6 never happened, so techically, this movie is Halloween 4.So if you haven't seen this movie yet, you gotta check it out. It'll top anything else playing at the box office, like Stuart Little 2, the first one wasn't any good so how would this one be any different? K-19 The Widowmaker, probably a good film. Has Star Wars veterans Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson; Road to Perdition. Take The Godfather and put Tom Hanks in it, you got Road to Perdition. The Powerpuff Girls Movie, sheesh! Don't get me started on that sloppy cartoon. Just goes to show you. If you don't do something good with your life, you turn out poorly drawn junk like that.          Anyway, I'm rambling. The point is see this movie!! It's better than H20! It's also a unique Halloween movie. For example in the first 7 Halloween movies, subtitles telling us the day have always appeared. Not in this movie. In this movie, they just leave it to us to guess the date. But this movie is good! It's gotta be good. It has to be!

I wrote a review for it!-            ","genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"20 July 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, SO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T YET SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, DO NOT READ ON         It has been 3 years since the events in Halloween H20. Our story opens in an insane asylum on October 29, 2001. Laurie Strode has been committed--for murder. Yes, apparently the man she decapitated in H20 wasn't Michael. When a paramedic came to collect Michael Myers' body, he woke up and switched clothes with the man, so it was the poor paramedic that got his head chopped off.The real Michael Myers vanished, until now. He's been stalking Laurie and finally comes inside the hospital, killing two guards. Laurie escapes to the roof and tries to get the best of Michael by hanging him by his leg. She had to be sure it was him so she attempted to remove his mask, but he grabbed her and stabbed her. She fell to her death. Myers escapes.         A group of college students at Haddonfield University were planning to set up a live web-cast from the Myers house. The project was headed by Freddie Harris. The students chosen were Sara Moyer, Bill Woodlake, Jenna Danzig, Donna Chang, Jim Morgan and Rudy Grimes. It would be like a reality show broadcast on the Internet. Sara was nervous about doing it, but Freddie assured her it was the right thing to do.        At the Myers house, the doors were locked. The windows boarded. It was just the six kids and Freddie and his girlfriend. What they didn't suspect was Michael Myers was locked in the house with them.He began to kill every person he came across. 'Til finally only Sara and Freddie were left. They tried to take him down but it didn't work. Finally, all the electrical wires in the house and gasoline spilled from an old lawnmower set the house ablaze and Michael Myers is electrocuted.        Is this the end of Michael Myers? No. And those of you who are counting on seeing Michael's face are going to be disappointed. They don't show his face. There were several attempts but they all failed. But keep in mind his face was shown in the first Halloween. Michael isn't a monster like Jason Voorhees, he just looks like a normal person. I suspect there will be a Halloween 9. But what would it be about? Michael going after more family? The way it looks, there may be no end. But anyway, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. It was better than I thought. And, according to this movie, Halloween III, 4, 5 and 6 never happened, so techically, this movie is Halloween 4.So if you haven't seen this movie yet, you gotta check it out.

Films of this nature usually split up the time frame to add confusion (as in Nolan's Memento), needless complexity (as in Lynch's Muholland Drive), or simply to tell many stories simultaneously (as in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction).

The question of what if? plays itself out beautifully as Lola confronts her father, Manni, the police, and past friends and acquaintances.The hard part of the film, as far as I can see, lies in two areas  the soundtrack and the jump-cut.  For those who feel that a soundtrack is necessary to flesh out emotions and dictate a kind of meaning to the images, then Lola Rennt is your film.  The hard driven techno score literally pounds you as Lola runs through three possible fates.  I must say that I cannot stand techno music, and yet I found that I was very pleased with its presence in this film.  The second possible flaw is the jump-cut.  In an effort to keep the audience on their toes, much as Lola is, director Tom Tykwer often uses long series of quick cuts, which can be disorienting and, at times, remove the audience from the film.  For example, as Lola runs into various characters throughout the film, quick cuts reveal the possible future paths (often quite disturbing and in my opinion quite unnecessary) of these people.

I found that these quick cuts were an interesting experiment that should have been fleshed out more.O.K. enough of the bad.  What I loved about this film are the small details and subtleties.  For example, the simple repetition of the opening sequence with the slight alteration of the dog\/Lola interaction.  It is subtle, but one has to understand that in a what if picture little things like a dog attacking or sleeping are left to chance too.

The story begins in London in 2008, when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who, like most of us, is a little cranky first thing in the morning.  The dragon, oddly, sleeps through the breaching of its den with a massive roaring drilling machine, and only wakes up when it is nudged.  All of a sudden dragons are greeting the dawn all over the world and torching things with more reckless abandon than the U.S. Forest Service.  The world is shortly destroyed, as we learn in a drawn-out opening sequence involving an unseen narrator writing in a journal, though he doesn't seem to be writing what he's saying.  Most of the story takes place in 2020, where a society of refugees led by Quinn (Christian Bale) lives in a decrepit English castle, hiding from the dragons.Things can only get so bad in Europe, of course, before the Americans show up, and show up they do, in an armored column of the Kentucky Irregulars, led by tattooed, bald nut case Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey).  He has a crazy idea that entails killing the boss dragon, since it is the only male dragon of the millions around the globe (must be a busy fella).It's critical in post-apocalypse movies to establish a credible and vivid world, with a balance of the modern and the primitive, and a sense of how societal priorities have changed to suit the new reality.  The classic case was the jury-rigged ingenuity of the Mad Max movies, where V8 engines were prized and gasoline more precious than life.  They weren't necessarily realistic, but they were believable, because they established a set of rules and stuck by them.  Reign of Fire is all out of whack in this department the castle-dwellers are on the brink of starvation, but seem to have a limitless supply of electricity, without even a cursory explanation of where it comes from.  As part of their security net, they use massive searchlights to monitor the night skies.  Uh, way to keep a low profile, guys.  Van Zan's people, on the other hand, apparently have an endless supply of fuel, enough to maintain a gas-guzzling tank and a helicopter(!) with again, no hint of how.  Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons, yet the word radiation never so much as passes anyone's lips.  Plus, the movie can't even keep track of its own timeline.All this could have been forgiven if we got some gut-wrenching army n' dragon smackdowns.  Van Zan is supposed to be a fearsome dragon killer, so you would figure that he and his militia would have some savvy anti-dragon tactics figured out, from the painful lessons learned by the doomed struggle of the world's armies, but no.  When they take on a dragon in the castle environs, their plan of attack is so suicidally ludicrous it would take a minor miracle to work just once.  Without going into too much detail, it involves ground-based radar monitors, a high-tech computer tracking system, and skydivers, all to try and bring the beast to earth so McConaughey can kill it with an axe.  Seriously.The movie has its good points, though it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman, who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension.  The climactic battle is pretty impressive, and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings.  Wolf Kroeger's production design isn't bad, the landscape is suitably scorched and desperate, though it looks like they might have swiped some sets from Enemy at the Gates.  The dragons themselves, of course, are amazing.  They are truly mean hombres of fluid reptilian grace, whose jaws leak flaming liquid as they breathe.  They (almost) convince you that they really could have destroyed the world, that they wouldn't have been swatted from the sky in two seconds by any F-18 pilot with half a brain and a rack of heat-seekers.  But then you expect great effects from even the most dim-witted of movies these days.Like most monster movies, Reign of Fire suffers badly when the monsters are offscreen catching a smoke break, and we are left with flat characters speaking silly dialogue in a tepid story.  Bale is all right, though his character comes off as something of a weenie.  McConaughey, meanwhile, has no chemistry with anyone or anything on screen.  He's a buffed-out paramilitary psycho, but not an interesting one.  You can't figure out how he became the leader (maybe he was the only one who could drive a tank). The most engaging character is Alex, the helicopter pilot, played by Izabella Scorupco (the luminous computer expert in GoldenEye), who isn't given much attention by the script, but who seems like she would have been a better choice to lead the militia.  Too bad she wasn't the main character.But the humans aren't the real stars anyway.  I sort of picture a dragon, guzzling an Evian bottle of lighter fluid, and barking into his cell phoneI'm telling you, Marty, I've had it!  C'mon, I can fly!  I can breathe fire!

He's a buffed-out paramilitary psycho, but not an interesting one.  You can't figure out how he became the leader (maybe he was the only one who could drive a tank).

The story begins in London in 2008, when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who, like most of us, is a little cranky first thing in the morning.  The dragon, oddly, sleeps through the breaching of its den with a massive roaring drilling machine, and only wakes up when it is nudged.  All of a sudden dragons are greeting the dawn all over the world and torching things with more reckless abandon than the U.S. Forest Service.  The world is shortly destroyed, as we learn in a drawn-out opening sequence involving an unseen narrator writing in a journal, though he doesn't seem to be writing what he's saying.  Most of the story takes place in 2020, where a society of refugees led by Quinn (Christian Bale) lives in a decrepit English castle, hiding from the dragons.Things can only get so bad in Europe, of course, before the Americans show up, and show up they do, in an armored column of the Kentucky Irregulars, led by tattooed, bald nut case Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey).  He has a crazy idea that entails killing the boss dragon, since it is the only male dragon of the millions around the globe (must be a busy fella).It's critical in post-apocalypse movies to establish a credible and vivid world, with a balance of the modern and the primitive, and a sense of how societal priorities have changed to suit the new reality.  The classic case was the jury-rigged ingenuity of the Mad Max movies, where V8 engines were prized and gasoline more precious than life.  They weren't necessarily realistic, but they were believable, because they established a set of rules and stuck by them.  Reign of Fire is all out of whack in this department the castle-dwellers are on the brink of starvation, but seem to have a limitless supply of electricity, without even a cursory explanation of where it comes from.  As part of their security net, they use massive searchlights to monitor the night skies.  Uh, way to keep a low profile, guys.  Van Zan's people, on the other hand, apparently have an endless supply of fuel, enough to maintain a gas-guzzling tank and a helicopter(!) with again, no hint of how.  Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons, yet the word radiation never so much as passes anyone's lips.  Plus, the movie can't even keep track of its own timeline.All this could have been forgiven if we got some gut-wrenching army n' dragon smackdowns.  Van Zan is supposed to be a fearsome dragon killer, so you would figure that he and his militia would have some savvy anti-dragon tactics figured out, from the painful lessons learned by the doomed struggle of the world's armies, but no.  When they take on a dragon in the castle environs, their plan of attack is so suicidally ludicrous it would take a minor miracle to work just once.  Without going into too much detail, it involves ground-based radar monitors, a high-tech computer tracking system, and skydivers, all to try and bring the beast to earth so McConaughey can kill it with an axe.  Seriously.The movie has its good points, though it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman, who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension.  The climactic battle is pretty impressive, and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings.
