Curses on his head, though, for producing such a sentimental postcard of what should have been a pageant.Robbins is certainly ambitious, presenting a dozen or so characters -- some lifted from history (Nelson Rockefeller, Orson Welles, John Houseman) and others created for the story -- and following them through as they commission or support or patronize or, for the most part, create socially-relevant works of art.  In a more experienced director's hands, this would have been a sweeping and crisp production.Unfortunately, CRADLE WILL ROCK slogs along with a list, with some of the character played straight (John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray, John Turturro, Emily Watson) and some of the character weirdly two-dimensional and cartoonish, such as Houseman and Welles, as well as the Vanessa Redgrave character.  The Houseman and Welles scenes are particularly disastrous, as the two actors, Angus MacFadyn and Cary Elwes, lurch and mug and cut up, but never bring a real dimension to two of the great personalities of American stage and film.Worse, the film is sluggishly paced, and Robbins' camera work is unimaginative.  The opening tracking shot is, in particular, way too long, too uniform and uninteresting.  The script, also by Robbins, never gives its characters (other than Ruben Blades, as Diego Rivera, and Cherry Jones as the Theater Project director) any real passion for their work, other than the clownish passion exhibited by Welles and Houseman.  What they want, what they're willing to fight for, never is fully presented in the story, thus draining the brash ending of any impact.Note  Susan Sarandon is absolutely awful in this film.A great subject to film, but sadly, a big swing and a miss.
