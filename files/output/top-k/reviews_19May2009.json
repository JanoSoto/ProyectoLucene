Although this movie was mainly about Mozart's life it was also about Antonio Salieri's life as well. The movie compared each of these two composers and described the apparent rivalry between them. Though I doubt Mozart felt he had any competition. Both actors played the roles effectively; I even started to associate them with the real men of that time. Also the movie depicts Salieri as a suffered man who loved music but was only an average musician compared to the born musician Mozart. The movie is very effective in persuading people to believe this story, because in reality Salieri really didn't plot to kill Mozart. I must say though that some parts of the movie are very true to Mozart's image, especially the fact that his Requiem became his unfinished piece. I really enjoyed watching this movie and each scene seemed to fit in perfectly with the music that was being played. The movie flowed very well. I would have liked to see more of Mozart's childhood in this movie because it only shows glimpses of his past performances. I do understand though that the main focus was his adult life and career. I don't think many people notice where the movie took place was not in Austria but in the Czech Republic. I really liked the portrayal of Mozart as a genius yet light-hearted man. I also liked the costumes. The costumes were so elaborate, colorful and elegant made me want to get some of those clothes. Some scenes are too dark to tell what is happening. In the opening scene I couldn't tell what was happening because it jumped too fast and was there was not enough light.I really did like the actor Tom Hulce as Mozart. He seems to have studied his part in order to do a great role in the movie. Every time he laughed was very comical and I wonder if he laughed at himself for laughing that way throughout the movie. I really didn't like Salieri, the character, but this was because he was shown as in a bad light. I don't believe he was so hateful and envious of Mozart that he would have tried to ruin him. He is pivotal in getting the point of the story across, so I see his importance. F. Murray Abraham did an amazing job as Salieri I almost did believe he was full of envy. I think that the audience will grow to hate but also understand Salieri.I was most captivated by this movie through the music. I would have liked to have seen this movie before actually visiting Salzburg, Austria. Salzburg was the birthplace of Mozart, as I found out while being there. I even went to his birth home and childhood home, not actually knowing all of his life's details or even seeing this movie. Now I want to visit Salzburg again because I feel that after watching this movie I better understand my view of Mozart's music and life. While I was in Salzburg I knew very little of this man. I know that this is just a movie but it really made me research and learn more about this brilliant man and his rival.

Not everything he did was perfect , far from it , but you cant deny that he had a directing style all of his own. Usually his films contained lots of close up portrait shots, a haunting and memorable soundtrack and usually his movies were very long. Once upon a time in America was the last film Sergio Leone ever directed and without doubt was one of his finest.When he was a boy, Noodles and his friends would roll drunks and make trouble in their Jewish immigrant neighbourhood. His life changed, however, when he met Max . Together the two of them and their gang began planning more complex jobs and successfully making money. As they grow up learning about crime together, they also learn about life and love.Their friendship is interrupted when Noodles is sent to jail as an adolescent, but although he is a young man when he is freed, Max is there to collect him. He discovers that his partners have been busy in his absence, taking advantage of the money to be made illegally during prohibition, and for some time he joins in with their business. But prohibition isn't going to last forever, and when it ends Noodles is concerned that Max's next job is a step too far.I have heard it said by some people that Once upon a time in America is the greatest gangster movie of all time. In my opinion this is way of the mark. It may have been the best up until 1984 ( Godfather fans will disagree) but six years later Martin Scorsese paired up Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again to make not only the perfect gangster movie but the greatest movie ever made - GoodfellasIn some ways this film is very Scorsese like. It reminded me a lot of Mean Streets. Robert De Niro is fantastic as Noodles as is James Woods as Max  don't call me crazy Bailey. Neither of which turn out to be very nice people. I would have like to have seen the Joe Pesci Character a lot more but he just disappears from the movie without explanation. The timeline drifts quite a bit and it does get a little confusing in the latter part of the film especially due to the extremely poor make up job done on Elizabeth McGovern who played Deborah Gelly . At one stage she is supposed to be the same age as Noodles expect he looks 60 and she still looks 21 . Another problem is the length of the film 3 hours 49 minutes . I'm sorry but that's just too long for a film. Apparently there is a version that is just 144 minutes made for the American Audience but it is cut in chronological order that makes very little sense.I found this to be a very sexually charged movie. Some scenes are quite graphic and i am surprised they got past the censor back in the eighties. The rape scene and the peeping scenes are two that i wont forget in a hurry. As with all Sergio Leone films i loved the soundtrack. Those haunting panpipes sound like they have come straight from one of his spaghetti westerns. the cinematography also looks fantastic. Especially the scenes set during twenties and thirties. This is an epic film about , innocence, trust, passion, honor, Friendship , betrayal, and guilt and was a fitting finale to the career of a great director. 8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Sergio Leone was a fantastic film director.

The movie opens with an old man in a wheelchair, whispering Italian. This man, Saleri, plays a key character. Saleri plays as the narrator for some parts in which he is telling about his past and being with Mozart. He then has flashbacks of when he was a court composer and Mozart was just in his youth. Saleri was in love with the music that came from Mozart and was somehow always around Mozart when he had come up with new music. Saleri, himself, being so intrigued with the music and melodies, came up with his own composure's to try and please the Emperor. The Emperor is pleased, however, has Amadeus play it and while doing so, he changes a few keys here and there. This made Saleri upset because Amadeus did this quite often and leads us to believe that Saleri should've been the real celebrity. A lot of Mozarts ideas are inspired by Saleri but with no credit given to him. Amadeus is married and has four children but the movie only portrayed one. He is quite the drunk, he spent all his time writing material and the moment he got paid for it, he spends it all on going out and getting drunk. He has the nice house and all, but his only happiness is coming up with music for everyone to hear. Even though this film is historical, I enjoyed the plot. Describing someone's life is definitely not easy, but Peter Shaffer did a great job with coming up with the plots and screen work. And showing the inside drama within each of the leading characters (Amadeus and Saleri) was interesting and led you into each of their lifes. The acting and music was great, I liked that they actually used his own works and used them correctly. The dramatics between roles were extreme but not the point where it was too much. And having Amadeus have a ridiculous laugh made it more enjoyable and more humorous. Some things I think the director should've pushed more for would be a better German accent. These characters seemed to have more of an English talk. The way they made Amadeus seem like nothing more than a drunk, turned me away. In many scenes in which he was coming up with plays, he always had some sort of drink in his hands, making it seem like it was his only getaway. They made Saleri seem more of like the jealous type and that the only thing he was living for was to get revenge on Amadeus, when in fact Saleri was quite the composer himself and is well-known. With the time transition, they should've made the characters age as years went on. Amadeus looked just about the same the whole movie. The choice of the cast was great, to me there were no actors that are too well-known and would be more favorable than others just because of their acting experience. They made acting seem effortless Amadeus is obviously a story about Wolfgang Mozart and his life. its factual, yet comical. The acting is great and holds drama you don't want to miss. If your into music, biographies, good humor, and a man's jealousy, this movie is definitely worth your time. I would rate Amadeus, by Milos Forman 8 out of 10. Great movie with a killer laugh!!

They made acting seem effortless Amadeus is obviously a story about Wolfgang Mozart and his life. its factual, yet comical. The acting is great and holds drama you don't want to miss. If your into music, biographies, good humor, and a man's jealousy, this movie is definitely worth your time. I would rate Amadeus, by Milos Forman 8 out of 10. Great movie with a killer laugh!!

In 1972 a little novel called First Blood was written which set out to be an anti-war novel and its affects on people. 10 years later this novel was made into a successful film, commerically and critically, starting Sylvester Stallone.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), is Vietnam vet, a green beret. He discovers that he is the last of his unit and has become a drifter. Whilst walking he goes to a town called Hope in Washington State. The redneck sheriff Will (Brian Dennehy) warns him to stay away and drives him through the town. Rambo is pushed and ends up getting arrested. Whilst in police custody Rambo suffers from police brutality and flashbacks of being tortured by the Vietnamese. He snaps, attacks the officers, and makes a run for it in the forest. There his guerrilla warfare training kicks in, and easily fires of the local police and national guard. He starts a one man war against the sheriff as he trauma is brought back.First Blood kicked off the very successful Rambo series, sporning 3 further films. Rambo 2 and 3 became very right wing, with America re-fighting and winning in Vietnam and then with Rambo beating back the Soviets in Afganstan. However, First Blood had more of a heart and a message about the treatment of veterans and the trauma they suffer (admittly taking it to the extremes). It's a bit more psychological then the other Rambo films. The direction by Ted Kotcheff, he handled the actors and the action well. I personally enjoyed how Rambo was able to camouflage himself, and able to fight with instinct. It gives you a good insight in the style of war, and how the survival skills were transfered to forests of North-West America. The writers and director also made sure that to keep Rambo a moral and sympathetic character he never killed anyone directly. That was a wise more so the audience can support him. It's a little like Jason Bourne before Bourne came to the cinema. Out of the 80s actions stars, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme (80s and 90s), Steven Seagal (admittly 90s), etc... Stallone is the best actor out of all them and this was a strong performance by him, especially his final speech. Kotcheff made sure he didn't make a clichéd action film.However there are two major films. Firstly the premise is a little thin. Why did Rambo bother going back to the town in the first place? But there are worst ideas and Rambo is a decent film. Second is sadly the film is dated nowadays compared modern actions films (Bourne films) and war films (Saving Private Ryan). But it is a standard of good to 80s auctioneers.It's worth watching if you want something short to escape the world.

He was very immature, and irresponsible in a number of ways. He had many adoring fans but the fame and attention goes straight to his head. Not even the kind words of his lovely wife could take him off of his high horse.From the very beginning of the movie, Mozart was shown as a very childish young man. Not only was he childish, but he was also disrespectful. There was no one above him as far as people to respect. His father tries to steer him in the right direction but goes with no success. After being banished from his original home he seeks redemption in a new country. He goes to try and conquer another city with his remarkable musical talents.The film itself was well written and well executed. The music was good and the majority of the actors fit their roles very well. Costumes and makeup were perfect; they really did a great job of giving you an idea of what people looked like in those days. The overkill wigs and the extreme dresses put me in the mind set so I could better understand the setting.The major cause for my overall dislike of his movie was the character Wolfgang Mozart. The fact that Mozart was so obnoxious and immature made me happy to see the conclusion. His humor was never funny, his laugh was brain wracking, and his arrogance was angering. The only thing good about Mozart was his ability to crate music. I have no sympathy for people with his character.For people who are interested in the life of a legend this would be a great movie. The director got the story right. The actors brought out the characters very well. The character Salieri was played very well. For the most part his is an overall good movie.

Salieri begins his story as a confession to the death of Mozart to a local priest many years after the fact.Salieri, portrayed by F. Murray Abroham, recalls his initial meeting of Mozart and how he could not believe that someone of such great musical genius could be so immature. A man of God, Salieri, could not believe that the God would make his chosen child such an ignorant buffoon. The plot thickens as jealousy enrages inside of Salieri for Mozart's incredible talents, and his inability to match them.I believe the acting by both the lead roles in this film were top notch. Tom Hulce and F. Murry Abroham did an excellent job portraying men that no living generation ever new. The comic relief added to keep the film light I think was an ingenious move, Mozart's laugh, while no one really knows what it sounded like, kept the movie light and not as dramatic as it could have been. The music in this film I think just added to the film, I not only enjoyed the fact that they used actual Mozart compositions, but also that they used the perfect selections at the best points in the film. When the movie was dark and somber they chose a piece that reflected the same, when the film was light and playful the music reflected the mood.While I enjoyed the acting of both leading roles, I believe that Tom Hulce should have at least attempted a German accent as that is where Mozart was from.

While the film's historically inaccuracies added to the drama of this film I would have enjoyed a little bit more accurate portrayal of Mozart's life. He had four children, in the movie they only depict that he had one. Also, Salieri in his own was extremely famous for his time, as was probably more famous than Mozart, at the time. The jealously that is described on screen was most likely never present. Overall, this film is a must see. While most people know the name Mozart, not many know the tragic, short life he lived. This movie does a fantastic job at portraying what kind of man Wolfgang Mozart was and what a musical genius he still is.

The film depicts the troubled life that Mozart led and the people who affected his career most significantly. I thought the movie was put together well, with quite a few comedic moments which helped to soften the movie's heavy plot.The movie is constructed in a flashback method from Salieri's perspective. Mozart believed Saliari to be a trusted friend. It tells of the life of Mozart and how his brilliance often hindered his ability to have social relationships with his peers. Don't be scared yet though. The movie is not a dry documentary on the life of Mozart. It is a story about his life. I really enjoyed the movie. The costume design was fantastic. The wigs and costumes were very elaborate and set the mood for the movie. The humorous parts of the movie were well placed. They sustained the movie through its dark parts. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the opening scene. I do think that the scene with Salieri trying to commit suicide could have been more detailed. I felt as though I had to piece together the beginning instead of just enjoying it. My favorite character in the movie was Constanze Mozart, played by Elizabeth Berredge. I thought she did a great job of portraying the relationship between herself and Amadeus as sincere. During most of the movie, when their relationship seemed to be teetering on the edge of destruction, they continued to have a deep understanding of one another. I especially felt as though I could relate to her character, because it was realistic. Often times in films, relationships are characterized as always having a happy ending. It was refreshing to see a role where the relationship between two people is so troubled and yet we sense a feeling of acceptance between them.If you haven't seen this movie I definitely would recommend it. It gives a new twist to the story of Mozart's life. It is certainly not boring and mundane, as some films about historical figures may be. It has dramatic parts and very funny parts which combine to create a movie that almost anyone (with taste!) would enjoy. ********* nine out of ten stars!!!!

The Movie Making You Want More 2. When I heard about the film Amadeus, I was not very thrilled about seeing it. I didn't think I would be very interested or even like the movie in the end. As I watched the film I started liking it more and more. I feel this film deserved all the Academy Awards that it won. 3. Amadeus is a film about Mozart's life while in Vienna. Antonio Salieri is out to kill him because he is jealous of his success. The film starts out with Salieri in an insane institution looking back and telling a priest the whole story of Mozart. Mozart starts out in Salzburg, but soon gets kicked out of the town and decides to move to Vienna to further his career. With the help of the emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Mozart is composing many various operas and writing symphonies. Mozart meets the love of his life Constanze and they have a child together. She is by his side the whole time, supporting him and praising him for the work he is doing. Mozart thinks that Salieri is actually trying to help him and one of his friends, but little does he know that Salieri is hoping that he dies. In the end, Constanze leaves him to decide and take some time away because Mozart has a very bad drinking problem. She eventually comes back, but doesn't come back to find the happiest thing. 4. I really enjoyed the film because of all the colors and settings. The settings were very broad and stood out. All the costumes and makeup were bright and catching of the eye. The scenery really used big props and had spectacular visual effects. The music was another big factor. The sound was enhanced to keep the viewer interested and wanting more from the film. When something bad was about the happen the music got really loud and the opposite when something good was about to happen. The transitions in the movie were very smooth. The movie didn't switch scenes really fast without warning. 5. I didn't really like how the film wasn't fully portrayed to the fullest. There were a couple things missing and things turned around to make the film more interesting. In real life, Mozart and Constanze actually had four kids. Salieri was not actually jealous of Mozart and he was famous at the time in composing his music. I didn't really like how the movie portrayed Mozart as being a bad person because he went out and partied all the time. This was what kept him going and focused on his music. It also wasn't portrayed well that his wife was nagging him all the time. 6. I really liked all the characters. The actors were all selected very well for playing the characters in this movie. I don't think anyone could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce. He had the serious times when it was needed and he had a sense of humor. I think certain audience members would be able to relate to certain characters. 7. I would love to see this film again and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't want the movie to end. I thought there was more to come and it just ended. You don't have to appreciate music to see this film. It has much more to offer and is a lot more interesting than someone would think. You also want to see this film to find out what happens at the end. This film is a must see. I would give this movie 8 stars.

However, to really appreciate the deeper messages in the film, I think one would need to be a little familiar with Lewis's whole life and his writings.

I think in real life, Joy was already aware of her cancer before she even travelled to England the first time, because it was very far advanced when it was finally diagnosed.

I had nothing more to say than WOW!. Mozart's life is presented in such a dramatic, interesting way, that it makes one hunger for knowing more and more of this genius musician life. But the movie is not a mirror image of his life. When I read his biography I got to the conclusion that the movie is much more entertaining. The film presents Mozart with a playful, weird kind of funny laugh and the personality of a child with a lack of manners that cares greatly about his music. He married and had a child in the movie, but actually, he was a father of four in real life. One of my favorite performance on the movie is the one done by Abroham in the role of Salieri, this strange and obscure actor really does a great job when it comes to explaining his feeling of jealousy and his plan of vengeance against God for denying him the talent that Mozart possess. Salieri always asked God to make of him the greatest musician because of his love for music. But, God denied him that talent and gave it to Mozart. Consequently, Salieri created a plan to steal Mozart work and finish with his life. In the other hand, the film present Tom Hulce in the role of Mozart, a character of poor, immature personality, not much of a talker for being the principal character. He will keep one entertained with his comical laughs, sharp movement during the operas presentation, and finally the deterioration of his health and weaken of his character through the films. Over all, The Producers of these films made the films much more entertaining for the audience by taking you back in time with the elaborate costumes, fashionable wigs, Mozart 's music, and the humorous scenes performed by Wolfy.

It is actually about Salieri and his obsession with the great composer. But why this film is called 'Amadeus'? In fact the word Amadeus in Latin means 'Loved by God' which is Mozart's middle name. It is a perfect title because Mozart has so much talent that one would believe that he is loved by God so much.When Salieri first wants to meet Mozart, he is looking for a sophisticated young man. Then he finally meets him, he thinks he is crude, rude, out spoken child. During the whole movie Salieri starts to question God and why he does not give him talent, but yet Mozart. Salieri wonders why God loves Mozart and gives him so much talent when he is such an ignorant man. I loved the film and how Tom Hulce portrayed Mozart. He did a wonderful job and was so out there. I believed him and really thought I was in that time era. Also the music was fantastic and so dramatic that it added to the movie greatly. The setting was amazing and the costumes were so detailed. I loved the fantasy hats!! F. Murray Abraham did an outstanding job at playing the role of Salieri. He did the perfect job at holding back the hate of Mozart, that you would in fact not think he was acting. It was a very inspirational film!!What I didn't like about the film is that they did not get all the facts about Mozart correct. One of the things was that he had four kids and not just one. Also the fact that Salieri was not much older than Mozart, but in the film was portrayed a lot older. There wasn't much that I did not like. What I did not like about Salieri is he was a very grumpy man. And the fact that he hated Mozart but was yet there for him. Mozart was a fascinating character and a little crazy&#x85;. maybe a little too crazy. Again Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham did amazing jobs on playing the roles of these two characters. Overall the movie is inspirational and captivating. The music that Mozart writes in this film is amazing and wonderful on the ears. It is a true story of jealousy and love.

Mozart was a fascinating character and a little crazy&#x85;. maybe a little too crazy. Again Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham did amazing jobs on playing the roles of these two characters. Overall the movie is inspirational and captivating. The music that Mozart writes in this film is amazing and wonderful on the ears. It is a true story of jealousy and love. I would recommend everyone to see this movie if you like music. I rate this film 9 stars out of 10!!!

Worthy of all eleven Academy Award nominations, and definitely deserving of the eight won, Amadeus is a dramatic telling of the life and death of the eighteenth's century greatest composer , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The film begins with an old and delusional Antonio Salieri, once a respected composer of the court, now in a lunatic asylum meeting with a young priest. The purpose of their meeting is so that Salieri may seek peace through confession for allegedly being involved in Mozart's death. Salieri tells the events of his life dealing with his jealousy over Mozart through flashbacks of the years leading up towards the event. F. Murray Abraham gives an Oscar winning performance as the conniving antagonist Salieri who once a devoted religious man, decided he will become God's enemy whom he believes had cheated him by making him the mediocre composer. Upon seeing Mozart for the first time, Salieri believes to have been mocked by God who has blessed Mozart with an enormous talent and genius towards music. Salieri sees Mozart as an undeserving, vulgar opponent whom he must destroy in order to defeat God. Tom Hulce also delivers a credible portrayal of the late Mozart as an arrogant musical genius with a unique high pitch giggle who is aware of his capability to astonish everyone from the streets of his hometown Salzburg to the royals of Vienna with his musical compositions. Though financially irresponsible and even holding the standards of an alcoholic, Mozart is a hard working composer who puts all his energy into his work and tries his hardest to also be a husband and father throughout his years of musical achievement. Hulce provides the comedic relief to the film in times when even Mozart's wife Constanze Mozart, portrayed by Elizabeth Berridge, cannot seem to break through the ice whether it be through their financial struggles or his father's disapproval of their living conditions. Though Amadeus lacks some amount of historical accuracy in the telling of Mozart's life, the overall plot holds suspense and unexpected twists that captivate the viewer. The difference between Mozart and Salieri only put aside by their love for music could not have been better portrayed by any other actors, Murray in particular who steals the show with his love and admiration for Mozart's music, yet disgust and hatred for Mozart's self being . We can all relate to Salieri, even develop some sympathy for his devotion and hard work that is out shined by the natural talent bestowed in Mozart. It is an eye opener for those that also believe all composers to be like Salieri, so strict and conservative, whereas Mozart proves to be the exception for he is free willed and always energized and full of joy even at the moment of his death. I was overall impressed by the film and belie anyone with an eye for great acting would be as well.

Okay, I thought, Here is a film early in his career- you know like before Jennifer Aniston and the bromances like Dodgeball and The Wedding Crashers. He seems to be in every movie that has been coming out in the past 5 years.I understand the appeal of Vincent D'onfrio, if you see his work in Full Metal Jacket Men In Black and Law and Order Criminal Intent are all I need to show why he has a career. He plays monsters and disturbed people well - gives them a soul rather than making them into frightening behemoths. His reminds you of the dude at the reunion BBQ\/pool party who works in the mail room and not the cougar bait neighbor who suns himself by the pool.Jennifer Lopez? I am not so sure either - I can't say she is a terrible actress and I wanted to pin the blame of why this movie could not be awesome but she was adequate - not as good as I think Cate Blanchett would have been.This movie was used as a star vehicle and really should have been acted by more experienced actors- you can see Vaughn trying play the devoted detective and Lopez playing the kind yet seriously devoted child psychologist. Both fall flat because of experience - I don't think that Vaughn knew that he was meant to be a bit crude or the unrefined types. The writers tried to make up for the acting by putting things into the script to explain the story rather than letting the acting and the film explain the story.I could not get into how the invention that got Lopez into the criminal's mind- it almost seemed forced rather than like a graceful way to show us how they will get in. They were almost apologetic for it being science-fiction. Explaining how it got there is not good sci-fi. Saying, yeah we got this nifty tool, because this is what we use it for- keep up nerds! and instead fumblingly explaining in the dialogue how it works and came to be. Yes, sci-fi lovers care about plot holes- but not about tool props. (Levar Burton wore a gold painted banana clip over his eyes to play Geordi LaForge in Star Trek The Next Generation. We knew why it was there, but never quite how it worked until later seasons.)If you have ever watched The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind you can see the right way to explain the use of imaginary technology, how it worked and never explained how it came to be unless it was a plot point to make the story arc work.I liked the imagery - D'Onofrio was not wasted in this film and made the script work like the master he was. He couldn't save the film in the same sense that Hopkins couldn't save Hannibal - they both played their roles well but the hole-y script combined with a weakened female costar made the movie weak.Miss Jenny from the block is not a terrible actress, Selena is proof of the ability to show a tender side which was what she was meant to show -but she has not been allowed to show her strong side in a more appropriate way - her sharpness has been blunted by the director who is amazing at visuals and stringing together plot with pictures but never quite sure how to get her to show she means business an seems unsure of herself in some ways here. Perhaps this is why Vaughn may have been a wasted resource here too, because if he was more of a bully- in the here he would have balanced the cruel nature of the D'Onofrio character- seeming more cocksure- he would have been great here. Lopez fit into the imagery, especially in the end- a fitting self image especially for Latinas- Scenes shown in this movie could be described as amazing eye candy and I would be remiss to say it helped make the film watchable.

The greatest mystery remains why this movie is so overlooked? This is a comedy that has got all the right elements, took the beloved classics of mystery genre, looked at them from different angle and retold them in the most enjoyable way. Two of the great modern actors were perfect as beloved characters that were created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and became real for millions of fans. In the movie, though, we are presented with the situation that it was Dr. Watson who not only had documented his celebrated friend's most famous cases but who actually had the outstanding deduction, analytical, and observation skills and had solved the great mysteries of his time. Dr. Watson also had the writing talent and created his alter ago, the eccentric detective, Sherlock Holmes. The stories of Holmes' adventures had become wildly popular. Dr. Watson hired the local actor named Reginald Kincaid to impersonate the legendary detective. Kincaid (Michael Caine) certainly looked the part but by his own confession, he couldn't detect horse manure if he stepped in it! In addition to that, he was drunkard, womanizer, and a gambler. As played by Caine, he is absolutely hilarious and very charming. The best and funniest scenes belong to him. How he was trying to figure out the meaning of the evil Professor Moriarty's name is one of all time's funniest scenes. I've been fascinated by Caine's versatility for many years. If there is an actor who can play practically any role, be dramatic, moving, chillingly scary or comically brilliant and always convincing and joy to behold - it is Caine. Ben Kingsley (not a Sir at the time but Oscar Winner already) was also exceptionally good as easily irritated but brilliant, brave though greatly underrated Dr. Watson. As a huge admirer of two gentlemen from 221B Baker Street, London, I am happy to recommend the film to any fan. I believe that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would've enjoyed it. He had a wonderful sense of humor which shines through all Sherlock Holmes stories even the darkest ones and I believe he would've appreciated the idea of Holmes and Watson switching roles.

I watched The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, two shocking terrible movies and thought I'd better give this one a viewing after having never really seen it properly. I grew up in the wake of it and it's sequels, it was the talk of the school yard, I was very familiar with the story line, the general principles and even how Freddy got to be the way he was, I even went dressed up as Freddy to a fancy dress competition at the school summer fête one year, to my dismay not winning but I did get my picture on the front page of the local newspaper. Why didn't I win? I don't know, probably because the idea of a ten year old dressing as a homicidal mass murderer was a bit sick. But still I don't think I'd ever watched the film all the way through in one viewing.I was presently surprised. I thought the power for this film to shock or scare me was lost long ago but I was wrong. There were some pleasant twists and turns in the plot that I did not expect. Like Johnny Depp's death for one. I didn't see that happening, and the way in which it happened did make me jump a bit I must say. Also the ending was very surreal and unexpected classic bit of cinema. The idea is genius. You can't go to sleep or he'll get you and no human being can stay awake for ever. Unlike the acting in Craven's earlier films he actually manages to get the actors in this one to do some decent work. It's still not brilliant, but it is an improvement. I myself have had times in my life when I've stayed awake without any sleep for 3-5 days. At the end of these spells I was sweating profusely, paranoid, delusional, and hallucinating, so when lead girl tells us she has been awake for seven days it is just not believable. I can forgive Wes this because of the beauty of the film as a whole, but it really is a shame. He could have gone so much further with the idea. It is far from perfect but probably as close as Craven has ever gotten to a masterwork This is one good, classic, horror film. Do not miss. I am eagerly looking forward to the 2010 sequel and if the other recent remakes of Craven's films are anything to go by it will surely be a lot better and hopefully fix some of the holes in the original.

I liked a lot of his movies like Hard Target, Sudden Death, Kickboxer, Bloodsport, Death Warrant, Universal Soldier, In Hell etc but if there was one movie I had to single out as Van Damme's worst it would have to be Cyborg.Story Gibson(Jean Claude Van Damme) is out for revenge after a gang of punks lead by Fender(Vincent Klyn)killed his family. He ends up having to look after a cyborg that holds a cure for a disease that has wiped out half of the world.We could talk about how bad the acting is but that's preaching to the choir. The sets look like crap and the whole film reeks of low budget. The villain Fender(who looks like a rejected Garbage Pail Kid) wins the ham of the year award in 1989 hands down. He is some cornball that beats up on people and is used to spouting silly lines like take you to the murder show and I like the pain, I like the misery, I like this wooooorrrld!. The fights scenes(which are usually the bread and butter of JCVD movies) suck horribly and top it off the movie is boring. Everybody looks like they've been mud wrestling all day and for a hero of the movie, Gibson spends most of the time getting his butt kicked. The final battle between Gibson and Fender is downright cheesy(and not in a fun way I might add). In short Cyborg is JCVD's worst movie and yes, I've seen, The Order, Street Fighter and Universal Soldier The Return. Even JCVD most cheesiest films have an entertainment value to them but not Cyborg. Its a boring mess that is quite possibly the worst post-apocalyptic film of all time. I guess I shouldn't expect a decent film under the same director that gave you Adrenalin Fear The Rush.

Movies of this type usually come across as either too sentimental, overly contrived, or both for my taste. Lean on Me would probably have been a likewise forgettable experience if it had not have been for Morgan Freeman's perfect casting for the role of Principle Clark.Based on true events, the film takes place in Eastside High School, one of New Jersey's worst public schools. When a bombardment of graffiti, drug dealing, riots and low grades threaten to pull the institution apart, superintendent Frank Napier (Robert Guillaume; The Lion King, Big Fish) decides to hire his most controversial teacher, Joe Louis Clark (Morgan Freeman; The Shawshank Redemption, The Dark Knight) as principle to clean things up.The best part of this picture was undeniably Morgan Freeman's role. The concept of an eccentric and short-tempered character has been, to say the least, overdone; However, Freeman's portrayal of 'Crazy Joe' feel new and, surprisingly, relatable.That is not to say that the Morgan Freeman's casting was the only saving grace of this film. The relationships played out between the teachers, administration, parents, and students were fairly well done on all parts.Ultimately, Freeman succeeded in stealing the spotlight throughout. He carried something that would have been average and made it not a just a brilliant film, but his brilliant film. If anything, Lean on Me was a movie that leaned on Morgan Freeman in order to be as great as it was.
