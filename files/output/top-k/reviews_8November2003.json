Well,the thing is; this is a pretty good actionmovie and no one can take that from it! Its independent, entertaining, tough, highly dramatic and interesting. Sylvester Stallone delivers one of his best performances ever (together with the first Rocky).STORY A home coming soldier, former Special Forces Nam vet. John Rambo has got some serious mental wounds after the war, his only remaining friend lives out on a depressive countryside, when he finally reaches the place he gets to know that his Nam friend died of cancer last year. Rambo is alone. While walking in the wilderness he soon gets in trouble with the local cops, he kicks down the sheriff and his helping men and soon he runs out in the wilderness, out in the forest, alone. He gets the cops after him...and they're pretty p*ssed off on the Vietnam soldier...now, Rambo has started his own war...Very amusing! Very nice piece of action! We get a lot of different kindof nice genre flashes here we get flashbacks from Vietnam showing Rambo getting tortured, we get a lots of nice characters; we get Rambo showing of his best bits from Nam experiences - but the ending scene is very nice I think, showing Rambo sitting in a totally smashd up house talking out about his mental problems to his Colonel Trautman, that was in the same group together with him back then. That's a very nice scene I think, maybe Stallone doesn't do his best performance right then, but the mood and Vietnam - psycho rubbish, really gets you thinking about the poor bastards.Rambo First Blood stands alone as a one hitter very nicely, allthough the sequels aren't that bad it maybe had got a better reputation if it had been a outsider sort of. I recommend this movie, it is after all thee original one-man-starts-getting-angry movie! STARS **** 4\/5 (it pushes to the fifth star!)

Robert DeNiro's acting is superb, as is Cybill Shepherds, and Jodie Fosters. All of them play their respective character convincingly. All of the minor characters are also interesting; most of them are either a psycho, racist or just plain despicable, in some way or another. The transformation that DeNiro's character undertakes, from being a nice, gentle guy, to being a gun-toting self-help psycho, is amazing.

Like all films by James Cameron, Titanic is visually stunning from the sets to the special effects. Yet while Cameron's films are great to look at they usually have more going for them than this one. Titanic was unworthy of many of its oscars and is one of the most overrated films of all time.The first problem with this film is its script. James Cameron is not a professional at writing love stories and this clearly illustrates that point. The dialogue is corny and stupid. It makes me wonder why he didnt have Aliens invade Titanic. Yes the idea sounds horrible but I will take Get Away From Her You Bitch over Your gonna live on and your gonna have lots of babies I mean how corny and dumb is that.Strong Acting is a requirement for a film to succeed over a flat scrip. However, this is where Titanic fails again. I had no clue what Dicaprio was trying to do with this character. I am glad Spielberg taught him how to act in Catch Me If You Can. Kate Winslett is also horrible but her character is treated badly by the script. However, Billy Zane is actually quite good. Kathy Bates also holds her own, though her screentime is limited. Gloria Stewart is horribly irritating as the older Kate Winslett character.James Cameron is a filmmaker who has great skills. Yet those skills are not on display here. His direction comes across as inept and uninspired. His skills here are better than his skills as a screenwriter for the film but thats not saying much.Like I said, Titanic succeeds as eye candy but not much else. The Sets are glorious looking. The cinematography is beautiful. The Costumes are breathtaking to behold. The Sound is top notch. The Visual Effects rank as some of the most impressive to come out of the 90s. Titanic is nice looking in pretty much everyway. If only everything else came into play Titanic would have been a good film. The visuals of the film were something not wasted in the making of this film.Titanic suffers from two other flaws Unconvincing Chemistry and an OVERLONG running time. The chemistry between Leo and Kate was hailed as some of the best of the 90's but I found it flatter than a pancake. Titanic is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy tooo long. It has a very uninteresting and sluggish two hours. The only excitement I got was seeing Kate Winslett's boobs, which are more impressive than the film. During its final hour, the pace does pick up. The Sinking is a glorious sight yet Leo and Kate's characters are still there. The last shot of the film is stupid, that has deleted scene written all over it.James Cameron has a solid resume of films. He created Terminator I and II, Aliens, and True Lies. All these films showed the work of a skilled director, even though The Terminator gets the lowest rating it was a good film and showed a director with skill. Titanic shows a cocky asshole who should give his oscar to Curtis Hanson(director of the superior LA Confidential). This is easily the worst I have seen from Cameron.

I guess when he gets it right, he gets it right, because the direction here is fantastic. This is one of the most romantic romances, and one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a while, told with such a sense of style and wit that I enjoyed it more than I believed possible. Audrey Hepburn stars as a young student of the cello. Her father (Maurice Chevalier) is a private detective, and she loves to follow his sordid cases. One particular character appears in many of his cases as a cuckold, Gary Cooper. When one of Chevalier's clients plans to shoot Cooper, Hepurn overhears and sets out to warn him. Afterwards, they begin a romance. She's very inexperienced, and obviously a little afraid that he'll so thoroughly outclass and manipulate her that she decides to play some head games with him, telling him that she has had many lovers. By driving him to insane jealousy, she thinks she can see if he can possibly be in love for real. The biggest fault of the film, one that everyone agrees on no matter at what degree they love the movie, is that Gary Cooper is horrendously miscast. This has got to be one of the worst cases of casting in history. He's a thousand years older than Hepburn. Well, a lot of Hepburn's co-stars were far too old for her, and it harms any number of her films. Weren't there any actors in their 20s, 30s, or, heck, even 40s who were good enough to match Audrey? Why did directors and producers of her films think she would rather sleep with someone 30 years her senior? Has it something to do with her as a person? You know, this might have been the perfect opportunity to put Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn together again for a reunion. Fortunately, Cooper's presence (or poor performance) doesn't hurt the film anywhere near as much as you would suppose, or as some have suggested. I guess Cooper is such a blank actor that you can more or less ignore him. The movie is, after all, about Audrey; Audrey is everything to the film. And she is perfect. She plays it so subtly and wonderfully; it's really one of her greatest performances. The humor is very good. I love the picnic scene, the way that chicken leg is used as a prop. And those gypsies are great. I might have been annoyed at them in a lesser movie, but they are always used very well. The scene where Cooper is becoming obsessed with a recording that Audrey has made, which lists all of her love affairs, is a highlight, with Cooper and the gypsies rolling a cart full of alcoholic drinks on it back and forth in his hotel room. This is a gem, one of the best romances ever. 9\/10.
