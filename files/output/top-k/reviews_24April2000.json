The Muppet Movie was one of the first movies I remember seeing as a child, and it certainly enhanced my childhood and gave me a lot to think and dream about for a little kid, but the good news is that even now, it has lost nothing for me.The Muppets have always had a tremendous and subtle sophistication about them-- it's the type of thing that Disney always shoots for and rarely perfectly gets- that cast of characters who for children are endearing and accessible, but for adults have a whole different dimension of wit and personality that is hard to come by for even human actors half the time. And yet every muppet in this movie posesses that- even Animal! In fact, the movie- where the Muppets seem to be doing battle with every bumbling human to come along and attempt to take advantage of them (usually Doc Hopper but occasionally the excellent cameo cast)- is a metaphor for what I'm talking about. At the end of the day, the only characters we really believe in are the Muppets, not the humans- the humans come across flatter, less imaginative, far less inspiring. Kermit's combination of an existential dilemma and drive to succeed within himself are still chock full of beauty and honor, even to someone long since past grammar school. It's easier to care deeply about these Muppets in this film than hundreds of real human protagonists I've seen on the big screen.And as for emotional power- there are some movies that will cheer you up when you're down, and then there are films that will under no circumstances let you be down no matter how hard you try. This movie is definitely in the second category. It seems to achieve this firstly by the excellent script and aptly placed, well-written songs (when was the last time you could say that about a children's movie?), and secondly, oddly enough, by the directorial feel of the movie. Its pacing, its rambling-down-the-road quality, and its cinematic embellishments (the coziness of the restaurant that Kermit and Piggy go to, the eerie comfort of the desert fire, the smoky comedy club) all create this sort of intangible warmth that just radiates right off the screen. I wish someone today could recapture that again.So yeah, make sure your kids see The Muppet Movie. But don't commit the sin of growing out of it yourself. We miss you, Jim...

Manhunter is a very good film, and I personally recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Harris, crime movies, or movies in general. But it has strayed from the novel in many points in favor of telling a more traditional crime story, leaving out much of the personal anguish and spiritual torture which was the soul of the book. However there is this pervasive ideas that large budget, famous, Hollywood movies cannot possibly be great cinema, an idea which is both narrow-minded and hopelessly ignorant of the filmmaking process. Surely there is someone out there who can make a good film with a seemingly unlimited budget, the best available talent, and still render something an audience would like. (Of course, since part of the audience is American, I guess they would say an ignorent audience) The Silence of the Lambs is proof positive that this marvel of a feat can be accomplished. As all of the positives of the film have previously been accounted, I will take this opportunity to refute some of the criticisms of the antagonist.     My personal favorites are the criticisms of the character of Hannibal Lector and his portrayer, Anthony Hopkins. The oft voiced gripes about his overacting are silly, as are the criticisms of the unreality of the character, at least to those who have read the novels. Hannibal Lector is presented within as a modern Mephistopheles, an incarnation of pure evil. He is smarter than you, stronger than you, more cultured than you, wiser than you. Worst of all, the character knows you better than you could ever conceive, your lies, your weaknesses, and your failings. He is just as interested in destroying your soul as well as your life. That is what Hopkins conveys in his Lector, an all knowing, all seeing being (NOT person, as noted in Red Dragon) who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything but himself. The only flaw that the character possesses (again, as noted in Red Dragon and Manhunter) is that he is insane, just like the Devil in Western folklore. Keep this in mind when you see Hopkins in Hannibal.     Incidentally, I loved the critic who pointed out that they had never heard violins chime in during a dramatic scene in their life. Not only is that the most asinine argument I have ever heard for deriding a film (have you ever heard of suspension of disbelief?), but it is an argument which calls into question the validity the very foundations of all art.

Many social issues are brushed upon throughout the movie. I could mention several of these social themes easily, some of note; trust between father and son, broken mother daughter relationships,stereotypes of female athlete's, infidelity in marriage, I could go on and on.What really takes this movie over the top though is the bond between Quincy and Monica that stems all the way back to childhood. The movie starts off with Monica and Quincy at 11 years of age and amazingly the special bond seemed to exist between them then too. Although Quincy comes within 2 weeks of marrying his Fiance(played by Tyra Banks) it is obvious the Quincy and Monica were simply meant for each other. Quincy and Monica's relationship teaches us the importance of couples being there for one another no matter what obstacle.Quincy and Monica have almost a fairy tale relationship but experience the usual woes that plague young couples. Director Gina Prince does an outstanding job of conveying the plight of the two young stars.

And what a wonderful tower it is, constructed by those two magic lantern architects Stephen King and Frank Darabont.  They were the responsible parties behind the majestic edifice of `The Shawshank Redemption.'  Stephen King, the chief architect of `The Green Mile,' seems to draw unction for his greatest writing from the Bible.  One of his most popular works, `The Stand,' is nothing more than a possible explanation for the book of Revelation.  Whether you believe that the book of Revelation is a true prophecy or not, one cannot honestly deny it's incredible ability to fire the human imagination unlike any other words put to paper during the past two millennia.  It is quite obvious Mr. King has once again has gone back to the Bible to gather kindling to light the fire known as `The Green Mile.'   But rather than John the Revelator's fantastic visions of future mayhem, he goes back to the beginning of the New Testament, and gathers his sticks amongst the rich woods of the four gospels.   Unlike Revelation, the four gospels are a straightforward telling of the life of Christ, as witnessed by many of his disciples.   These accounts are not meant to be, nor are they written as an allegory.   Hence, much room is left for later wordsmiths to describe the life of Jesus in more poetic terms.While one may either appreciate or hate `The Green Mile' without having ever read any of the works of Matthew, Mark, Luke & John; it is a far more interesting film when one watches it with the knowledge of the gospels in the forefront of one's mind.   The gospel paradigm is almost an essential filter to distill the essence of what King and Darabont are trying to say.      Though the main character is a prison guard played by Tom Hanks, the true story of this film concerns the fate of a giant black man named John Coffey, as played by Michael Clarke Duncan.   Here we have our messiah; falsely accused of a crime he did not commit, and sentenced to die for it.   Not only is he innocent, but much like Jesus himself, Coffey is blessed with the gifts of healing and prophecy.   (Careful viewers will find the Coffey character to have a demeanor very similar to Hank's Forrest Gump!)But what's an allegory of the life of Christ without a Pharisee to shout `crucify him!'   Mr. King does not disappoint in this regard, but supplies several Pharisees to counter the innocence found in John Coffey.   We have a perverted prison guard, Percy Wetmore, who seems to have sadomasochistic tendencies.   (He definitely being more of a sadist&#133;)  and a prisoner named `Wild Bill' who hints at being demon possessed&#150; by choice.   Not surprisingly, these two don't care much for the big African American messiah in there midst, and choose to torment rather than learn from him.One also needs disciples for a proper messianic tale, and these are supplied by the characters of the `good' prison guards, played by Tom Hanks & Co.   They have wisdom enough not to judge their wards, but do there best to care for them until the final judgment of the state of Louisiana is carried out.   Having been in charge of violent men for several years, they quickly realize that John Coffey does not fit the profile of those who are routinely sent to their final resting place courtesy of `Old Sparky.'   This realization creates an unwanted dilemma, for how can one, in good conscious, put to death an innocent man for crimes he did not commit?  Themes like these are not the talk of the local coffeehouses, but are critical to our advancement as moral agents.    If nothing else, I can salute King and Darabont for pushing this issue into the forefront of our lives, that we may, if only for a few hours, contemplate the seriousness and finality of capital punishment.   Those politically inclined have proclaimed that this film to be blatant criticism of capital punishment, but I don't see it that way.   Too me, this film goes beyond that issue, and forces us to think critically about our own lives, and our own need for a Savior. Frank Darabont, in his efforts to help construct this magnificent tower, shows just how much a film can impact us when a man with the proper temperament and talents is put to the task.   His direction is tight and his techniques are subtle.   He allows the story the room it needs, not cropping or chopping, as many would be tempted to do.   The pace of life in the Deep South is slow and steady, and Darabont does a marvelous job of capturing that feeling in the confines of an impatient medium.Stephen King did a fine job crafting the story the film is based upon, but leaves just a few too many loose ends that would have been best trimmed before publication.   There are certain actions and scenes that just don't make sense, and though they don't majorly detract from the main story, they do detract somewhat from our understanding of the film.   It's a bit distressing when I find myself rewriting a movie in my head while I'm watching it on the screen; and I admit doing it while watching `The Green Mile.'   There were a few scenes where I found myself saying, `If only he would have said `B' instead of `A' &#150; what impact it would have had!'

I have to say I had sympathy for hapless Guy until the very end, which I will not give away here, but will say that it left me with a creepy feeling.

Matt's Tom Riply is an amazing portrayal and I am personally offended he wasn't as credited as Jude Law, who also gave a smashing performance as the ultimate guy, with whom Tom is obsessed. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a great performance as well. Her scenes of ultimate confusion, fright, and desperation has really put her up there with my favorite actresses. Cate Blanchett, as always, makes the perfect choice about her performance as well. Her Meredith is a total flake, but the performance is toned down and real, with the audience believing everything she says and does as if she were real.The technical aspects of the film are extremely well done. The cinematography was stunning, using every bit of the wonderful sets and scenery of 50's Italy.

And once you realize that, and note similar instances as the movie progresses, isn't it obvious?Perhaps because I saw no surprise, this movie seemed very slow to me. A lot of worried looks on the kid's face as he avoid various feelings or actual encounters with dead people. And very few interactions with the dead people. To me, the best scene by far was at the wake for the little girl who died. The movie should have had 2-3 additional examples like that, instead of a lot of peeking around corners by the boy.Still, the actors did a very good job. For that reason alone I gave this movie a 5.

I had tried very hard to avoid any discussion of the movie (as I always do with any movie) until I had a chance to see it. The one thing I had heard (before I could change the TV channel) was that there was a big surprise at the end.Now, I am an average guy, maybe a bit above average in education. And I will try not to give away the surprise here, in case you haven't seen the movie, yet. But the big surprise was obvious to me 17 minutes into the film. It was so obvious to me by the time it was revealed that I had thought, in a scene where the boy and the doc agree that their therapy is over, that both parties *already acknowledged* the surprise in that scene and were saying goodbye. At the time, I thought, with some admiration, This is a pretty subtle way to make that realization occur. So imagine my confusion when a few minutes later we get the big, dramatic scene where one of the characters *finally* does realize what's what. I was in disbelief ... You mean he *didn't know*? I wondered.I don't get it. The Crying Game had a big surprise that was obvious as soon as they showed the female character's face. And now this.

The outback video cover summary of the movie as a portrayal of a buss-crash and its judicial aftermath does the film little, if any, justice. Where Egoyan's masterpiece true strength lies is in its ingenuous portrayal of grief. People usually talk about something called `The Hollywood model moviemaking' (a term as vague and irrelevant as, for example, `The New Economy') where plot and character portrayal usually follows a set path. Without getting into a discussion of anomalies to this rule, what the Sweet Hereafter so masterfully accomplishes is to get beyond the usual portrayal of sorrow as something tangible and predictable. Nothing wrong with that, when you deal with one or two-dimensional film characters. But real people grieve in real ways. There are no ways to tell how people react to trauma, such as a bus crash or the death of a child. This is the element that Egoyan so beautifully takes advantage of in The Sweet Hereafter. The result is a film that may either bore you or leave you breathless depending on how much liberty you allow filmmakers in their portrayal of human emotions. Like sorrow, The Sweet Hereafter is at once fascinating, boring, painful, frustrating and peculiar.

The book was bad to begin with...why try to film it?  The plot is thin and stretched out to 105 minutes and the point is made early on in the film...and then there's no where to go!  There was nothing well new or exciting in this film.  What kept it interesting was the direction and the acting.  Mary Harron is one a hell of a director--she gets inside her characters' heads and lets us know all about them visually.  The acting is superb--especially Bale.  He's playing a sociopath and a serial killer, but he makes you understand and (believe it or not) actually care for the guy!  Everybody else is great too, but Bale is just incredible.  So, good job all around, but there's no way this could ever be a good movie.  Still, it's worth seeing for the direction and acting.  Hopefully, this will bring bigger and better things for Bale.
