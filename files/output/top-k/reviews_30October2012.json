Discovering he is cursed and will turn into a werewolf, Larry struggles with what to do as the villagers hunt for the wolf. The Wolf Man has its charm and is very memorable with some great scenes and dialogue, like the gypsy poem. Lon Chaney Jr. gives a decent performance of a many struggling with a curse that will forever change his life. One thing that always bugged me about the movie was they seem to have struggled with setting it in one century or time-period between the 1800's and the 1940's. I guess it's not a huge deal, but just seeing cars driving around in this particular movie does feel a bit odd. Now before someone goes crazy on me, I do appreciate this movie a great deal.

Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him If you build it, he will come.This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of Field of Dreams it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919.And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is.And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. Are you a ghost? asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. Is this heaven? he asks in return before leaving for the night, No, It's Iowa. replies an overwhelmed Costner.The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice' Ease his pain, Go the distance. A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game.Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in Field of Dreams as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen.And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, Field of Dreams ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit playing, sharing, connecting you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film.There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them &#x85; because as enchanting and inspiring as Field of Dreams is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

The movie solely relies on it's simple plot of revenge. Vengeance seeking Locke goes after a nasty bunch of San Pedro folk, including a lesbian, who raped her and her younger sister, years prior, under the boardwalk. We see this in a few short and sufficient flashbacks. Sadly her younger sister now resides in a mental facility, hence Locke's motive for blowing these scum away. Her motiss operendi is great. She blows them once in the genitals, then the head, a fitting justice, wouldn't you say. Put Harry Callahan on the case. Before arriving on the first crime scene, he shakes up a young punk in an elevator, who we all know is guilty, after this case is thrown out of caught. Not a good start for Harry. Again the guilty go free, something that doesn't digest well with Harry. Speaking of digestion, the next scene which saw the birth of that legendary line Go ahead, make my day, has Harry shooting four out of five guys who hold up this diner. If it wasn't for the waitress drowning his coffee with sugar, he would of still gone about his day. What's funny is she's almost in his face, while pouring the sugar, and he, this non sugar drinker doesn't notice it. C'mon. Then there's this old mafia guy, another example of justice sucking. Harry goes to this scumbag's daughter's wedding, to purposely induce the guy into a heart attack, even getting the reception lady to call an ambulance before he does. Surviving two more murder attempts (I don't know how you do it Harry) one, from other mafia figures, another from those scumbags at the court house who try to burn him alive in a car, for his own protection, and to lift the big headache he's giving the department, he's sent to good ol' San Paulo on the revenge case. There he butts heads with the chief. His son, now in a vegetative state, just happened to be one of the hoods, the less participating, in Locke and her sister's rape. Swamped with guilt he drove himself into a brick wall, hence his state. I didn't think he really deserved to die, the others yes. And San Paulo being such a small city, who should Clint run into? Angry artist Locke. They form a relationship, their sex scene is about non erotic as you could get. It almost ceases to exist as part of the movie. So those walls are set to close in. About the violence It's kept pretty minimum. There's just the one moderate scene, with a close up of Victim one's bloodied hands over his less bloodied, shown testicles, as he bought it in his car at a lookout point, over the bay of San Francisco.

There are another couple of goof ups in the movie, but I will just dismiss it all, for this is great entertainment where you'll be rooting for Locke, lady avenger. There's not one boring scene in Sudden Impact and the much deserved justice for all in the end, will leave you more than appeased and send hearts a cheer.

What's funny is she's almost in his face, while pouring the sugar, and he, this non sugar drinker doesn't notice it. C'mon. Then there's this old mafia guy, another example of justice sucking. Harry goes to this scumbag's daughter's wedding, to purposely induce the guy into a heart attack, even getting the reception lady to call an ambulance before he does. Surviving two more murder attempts (I don't know how you do it Harry) one, from other mafia figures, another from those scumbags at the court house who try to burn him alive in a car, for his own protection, and to lift the big headache he's giving the department, he's sent to good ol' San Paulo on the revenge case. There he butts heads with the chief. His son, now in a vegetative state, just happened to be one of the hoods, the less participating, in Locke and her sister's rape. Swamped with guilt he drove himself into a brick wall, hence his state. I didn't think he really deserved to die, the others yes. And San Paulo being such a small city, who should Clint run into? Angry artist Locke. They form a relationship, their sex scene is about non erotic as you could get. It almost ceases to exist as part of the movie. So those walls are set to close in. About the violence It's kept pretty minimum. There's just the one moderate scene, with a close up of Victim one's bloodied hands over his less bloodied, shown testicles, as he bought it in his car at a lookout point, over the bay of San Francisco. We see that one of Clint's Cronies working the crime scene, has a strong stomach, when chowing down a hot dog. The showdown with it's effective score, has the perfect setting, an amusement park, where that favorite line's uttered again. Eastwood is in fine form. A standout, is Paul Drake (what the hell happened to this actor) great as the main hood, looking and smelling of immorality. He gives his character that perfect flavor it deserves. There are another couple of goof ups in the movie, but I will just dismiss it all, for this is great entertainment where you'll be rooting for Locke, lady avenger. There's not one boring scene in Sudden Impact and the much deserved justice for all in the end, will leave you more than appeased and send hearts a cheer. And then we have Roberta Flacks song, This side and forever as a fine finish. Another is the up tempo music score at the movie's start.

The upside to that is that now there's blu-ray and hopefully, a few extras included..? Well it will be a real sin if that turns out not to be the case! Sorry, I can't help myself. This film is fantastic, in my Top 5 list of '90s films for certain. John Cusack reportedly co-wrote the script, and that makes sense because it's clever and built on witty dialog -- playing perfectly to his strengths. His electrifying chemistry with Minnie Driver, Dan Ackroyd and what the heck, the entire supporting cast, demonstrates pure casting genius and ensures GPB will remain fresh and memorable upon many repeat viewings.The plot reads like an understated Quentin Tarrantino joint. Martin Blank is a professional assassin who is invited to his 10 year High School reunion in Grosse Pointe, MI. Urged by his therapist on the premise that it might be good for him, he decides to attend. Martin contacts old buddies, attempts to reconnect with his long-lost love, reminisces a bit about his childhood, visits his ailing mom in her nursing home, and what the heck--decides to complete an assignment while he's there. He runs into a few glitches on his journey of the soul, but exploding convenience stores and murderous rival assassins can't deflect Martin' growing moral conscience and his determination to win back the girl he stood up on Prom night.Grosse Pointe Blank is hard to pin down. This is a black comedy, but strangely uplifting at the same time. It has plenty of shooting action, martial arts and a dash of James Bond coolness, but it's not about that, really; it asks deeper philosophical questions of the sanctity of life and the power of love and forgiveness. And of course at the heart of it all, there's the relatable conundrum of those torturous High School Reunions.GPB is John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Dan Ackroyd and Joan Cusack at the top of their forms.

Ronnie looks quite dull but he's got a beautiful girlfriend named Donna who offers him an original NY cap. It's Ronnie's birthday, his mother tells him with pride-irradiating eyes You're my little Yankee Doodle boy. During a night illuminated by the fireworks, Ron and Donna kiss, a privilege that small boys rarely get at 10, but it's Ronnie, Ronnie who makes his baseball team win and victoriously lifts his pumps in the air, so perfect it's unreal.There is yet a reason why the opening of Born on the Fourth of July possesses this disorienting dream-like aspect, for it's too over-the-top from a director like Oliver Stone not to be deliberate. It starts like a fantasy because it's exactly into this that American values were turned after World War II, the idea that whatever America does is right, and any American boy should be proud to defend his country, to win, to be the best. It echoes General Patton's words the very idea of losing is detestable for America. Yet Patton fought in a war that, no matter how devastating it was, was necessary. The Vietnam War was not and now, it's a wound forever carved in America's heart, a stain in its soul, for which Oliver Stone's film works on a cathartic level.Fittingly Born on the 4th of July, Ron Kovic incarnates the spiritual destruction the Vietnam War applied on America's youth, before it turned into a generation-defining realization. That realization is the emotional core of the film and it's powerfully carried by Tom Cruise's performance. Cruise's good looks always played a significant part in his films because they helped to build a misleading feeling just to be contradicted by the evolution of his character (Rain Man, Jerry Maguire&#x85;). Born on the Fourth of July also features an extraordinary evolution, but in terms of acting, it transcends every other performance from Cruise. As Kovic, he personifies the patriotic enthusiasm of a youth that grew in a star-and-stripe clad cradle and its transformation into anger against the system that fooled them.And the higher Kovic went in the expression of his patriotism, the harder he fell. What is fascinating in Kovic is that he isn't necessarily perfect before the War; he loses at a wrestling game and sobs like a baby under the booing of a heartless crowd. Kovic is so 'Americanised' that losing a game is as upsetting as losing a war. So when the first recruitment's program for the Marine Corps comes to his school, he takes it as a chance to prove his value. Kovic loves his country and will serve it, even if he has to die. The 'trick' is that he didn't explore the eventuality of ending crippled and that's crucial when a man lives, he's proud of having done his job, when he dies, he's not here to express any regrets, but on a wheelchair, it's another side of the show he's going to discover.The film's scope is so big that Stone rightfully keeps the essential from each episode of Kovic's life, especially since Platoon was eloquent enough about the war. The fight scenes show that GI killed baby and civilians&#x85; accidentally but so was it when they killed each other in battles far from the usual epic exaltations. Then, Kovic is shot and spends a long time in the veteran's hospital one of the film's highlight, an invitation to discover the treatment, crippled soldiers received the last rites (just in case), bathing in their own filth, incapable to clean themselves, sharing the place with rats. Kovic is told that he can't walk anymore, can't even have children; he endures a rough treatment to prevent amputation. But what he can't stand, more than pain, stink, rats or his disability&#x85; is one carer's anti-war comment. His condition didn't earn him any respect or compassion, and the worst is yet to come.Returning at home, Kovic realizes that life has changed, hippies give him the finger; the American flag is burned instead of being proudly raised in the air. Love it or leave it! still shouts Kovic in denial. The attitude spread to his Family, his own brother doesn't believe in the war, and the trip to self-awareness doesn't end here. Wherever he goes, Kovic is confronted to disrespect and carelessness, a friend who didn't believe in the War, is doing well in fast-food business, a WWII veteran reminds him he's got no reason to be angry about, he fought, he lost, and gives him the ultimate insult by calling him a traitor. The anger's burning in Kovic's heart reaches its heart-breaking pinnacle when he wakes up his whole family, submerged by his drunkenness, he -for the first time- understands that this war destroyed him, for nothing, because the very America he fought for, is now acting like an ungrateful bitch.But the courage of Kovic is not to stand alone in his own blindness. During a trip in a Mexican whorehouse where he encounters veterans living in the same condition, he's left alone with a vet played by Willem Dafoe in the desert, they fight, insult, spit on each other, but it's probably the last step before self-awareness. Symbolizing through his character's arc a real revolution in America's society, Kovic becomes the spokesperson of a whole generation against the war. Not because one shouldn't fight for his country, but because there were no values noble enough to fight in Vietnam, to destroy America's spirit, no matter how supposedly 'evil' Communism was, America was no better in that war. Kovic said that who fought there, and Oliver Stone showed that, who fought there, too. Intelligent, thought provoking and uncompromising, Born of the Fourth of July is one of the most important American films, and one of the best of the 80's.

The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations.Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree.(In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic.Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife.The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it.At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs.Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back.Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech.The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals.The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property.Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying.Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him.Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained.The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute).The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex.'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here).

Hitchcock had done creepy Gothicism before, such as in Rebecca, and he'd done charming murderers before, such as in Strangers on A Train, but he hadn't done a slasher.Psycho is what it says on the tin it's about a psycho. Exploring the deep psychosis of a murderer was not something that had been done in Hollywood film before. We all know the shower scene but not everybody knows the nature of Bates' psychosis so I won't say anything on that topic. The psychiatrist at the end is a clumsy clunky Hollywood addition explaining the blatantly obvious. I fail to see that in 1960, the audience wouldn't have worked it out. It's a testament to Hitchcock that he still manages a creepy final scene. Bates may be a psycho but we can't dismiss him in the way that we may have dismissed previous psychotic villains.Of course, the star of the film is Anthony Perkins. Everybody else is either bland or annoying and quite frankly, you want them all to die (maybe not the hot guy). Janet Leigh as Marion Crane...thank god we didn't have to spend too long with her. She spends most of the film in her bra (now a horror cliché)and steals loads of money from her boss. It's interesting that Hitchcock chose to make her so unsympathetic.Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, the proprietor of the motel that Marion checks into. He looks just like a creepy bird but initially he's quite sweet. It took me a minute to clock that he was going to be our psycho. One thing I will say on his psychosis was that the psychiatrist says he is straight, which I don't entirely buy. I think that's just to placate the audience.Now, Psycho has been compared to Peeping Tom (or rather, Peeping Tom has been endlessly compared to Psycho. See my review on Peeping Tom for more info). Peeping Tom came out a few months before and on the surface it has a lot in common with Psycho both have a handsome man who is psychologically disturbed with parental troubles and murders women. However the major difference is that Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation and Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's illustrious career. So what gives? Psycho has lingering shots of a woman in a bra, gore and explicit horror; Peeping Tom has no blood, only brief nudity and no explicit horror. Surely if any film was going to shock the critics, it would be Psycho? Yet the only thing that the British censors objected to in that film was a flushing toilet.Actually, no. Hitchcock was famously the master of suspense and had dabbled in types of horror before- it was obvious that he would progress to something like Psycho. Powell was known for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger, making beautiful innocent British films (although at times some of them are very dark). He threw a curve ball and we couldn't take it. In some ways, Psycho is a mystery story and in the moments when the boyfriend and Marion's sister are exploring the motel, it brings to mind some of the creaky mystery moments Hitchcock had in his earlier films (Stage Fright, for example). Peeping Tom is not a mystery story. Bates is a main character but Mark Lewis is our protagonist. We see everything through his eyes. Both characters are handsome and polite but once we know something's up with Bates, we don't view him in that way. We always know that something's up with Mark Lewis and yet he's so adorable and polite and we never want him to get caught. Ironically, there are many moments where he almost gives himself away and we're shouting at the screen telling him not to.As for the psychology, Psycho explains everything. Bates is a classic textbook psycho. Lewis is a very disturbed pervert but he's more than a Psycho. His problems stem from the sadistic experiments his father does on him. We see some, but not all. What we do see is horrible but it's only scratching the surface. It's a more interesting imaginative bit of psychology than Psycho.Finally, the cinematography. Both films do brilliantly here- there's lots of creepy jump cuts and close-ups in Psycho. A particularly creepy moment is when Bates is framed by lots of stuffed birds glaring down at him. And it's all in scary black-and-white but not the cliché lurking in the shadows. But for my money, the cinematography in Peeping Tom is better. It's filmed in garish seedy colour, which makes it all the more scary. There's a clever bit of filming where Mark is looking through a grill with a birds eye view of the room and then the angle changes so we see the pens from his pocket falling down. The whole premise of Peeping Tom is a guy who kills with his camera and the cinematography takes full advantage of this. Filming in shadows and gloom is a cliché- luckily neither film does that.Psycho is still a scary film- dated in its treatment of the secondary characters but modern as ever with its treatment of the psycho. Loads of thrills and chills to be had here. This film changed the horror genre in America forever.

She spends most of the film in her bra (now a horror cliché)and steals loads of money from her boss. It's interesting that Hitchcock chose to make her so unsympathetic.Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, the proprietor of the motel that Marion checks into. He looks just like a creepy bird but initially he's quite sweet. It took me a minute to clock that he was going to be our psycho. One thing I will say on his psychosis was that the psychiatrist says he is straight, which I don't entirely buy. I think that's just to placate the audience.Now, Psycho has been compared to Peeping Tom (or rather, Peeping Tom has been endlessly compared to Psycho. See my review on Peeping Tom for more info). Peeping Tom came out a few months before and on the surface it has a lot in common with Psycho both have a handsome man who is psychologically disturbed with parental troubles and murders women. However the major difference is that Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation and Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's illustrious career. So what gives? Psycho has lingering shots of a woman in a bra, gore and explicit horror; Peeping Tom has no blood, only brief nudity and no explicit horror. Surely if any film was going to shock the critics, it would be Psycho? Yet the only thing that the British censors objected to in that film was a flushing toilet.Actually, no. Hitchcock was famously the master of suspense and had dabbled in types of horror before- it was obvious that he would progress to something like Psycho. Powell was known for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger, making beautiful innocent British films (although at times some of them are very dark). He threw a curve ball and we couldn't take it. In some ways, Psycho is a mystery story and in the moments when the boyfriend and Marion's sister are exploring the motel, it brings to mind some of the creaky mystery moments Hitchcock had in his earlier films (Stage Fright, for example). Peeping Tom is not a mystery story. Bates is a main character but Mark Lewis is our protagonist. We see everything through his eyes. Both characters are handsome and polite but once we know something's up with Bates, we don't view him in that way. We always know that something's up with Mark Lewis and yet he's so adorable and polite and we never want him to get caught. Ironically, there are many moments where he almost gives himself away and we're shouting at the screen telling him not to.As for the psychology, Psycho explains everything. Bates is a classic textbook psycho. Lewis is a very disturbed pervert but he's more than a Psycho. His problems stem from the sadistic experiments his father does on him. We see some, but not all. What we do see is horrible but it's only scratching the surface. It's a more interesting imaginative bit of psychology than Psycho.Finally, the cinematography. Both films do brilliantly here- there's lots of creepy jump cuts and close-ups in Psycho. A particularly creepy moment is when Bates is framed by lots of stuffed birds glaring down at him. And it's all in scary black-and-white but not the cliché lurking in the shadows. But for my money, the cinematography in Peeping Tom is better. It's filmed in garish seedy colour, which makes it all the more scary. There's a clever bit of filming where Mark is looking through a grill with a birds eye view of the room and then the angle changes so we see the pens from his pocket falling down. The whole premise of Peeping Tom is a guy who kills with his camera and the cinematography takes full advantage of this. Filming in shadows and gloom is a cliché- luckily neither film does that.Psycho is still a scary film- dated in its treatment of the secondary characters but modern as ever with its treatment of the psycho. Loads of thrills and chills to be had here. This film changed the horror genre in America forever. ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"30 October 2012","score":"","review":" There's no denying Psycho's classic horror status. Hitchcock had done creepy Gothicism before, such as in Rebecca, and he'd done charming murderers before, such as in Strangers on A Train, but he hadn't done a slasher.Psycho is what it says on the tin it's about a psycho. Exploring the deep psychosis of a murderer was not something that had been done in Hollywood film before. We all know the shower scene but not everybody knows the nature of Bates' psychosis so I won't say anything on that topic. The psychiatrist at the end is a clumsy clunky Hollywood addition explaining the blatantly obvious. I fail to see that in 1960, the audience wouldn't have worked it out. It's a testament to Hitchcock that he still manages a creepy final scene.
