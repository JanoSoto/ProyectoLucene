However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive...It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

When Otis goes out for a drive with Otis to pick up a couple of prostitutes, the date ends with Henry calmly and passionlessly killing them both and leaving their bodies by the road.

The film opens with violent images and in terms of narrative the structure is not an unusual one. In the same way as Neo was our guide into the world of the Matrix and many TV series will use begin with the main character being as new to an environment as we are, so we join Otis as he enters Henry's world of killing. The parallel is not that good though because of course the viewer is never asked to relate to, or care about Otis in the way other films using this device would do. The story has been understandably criticised by some viewers because it does seem to go nowhere and just rather wallow in the pointlessness of the lives of the characters. However I liked this approach, I enjoyed that it forced me to watch it for what it was and not as part of some horror or action movie.

The bus driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) must take over. But not aware of the bomb, she tries to slow down before Jack gives the reveal of the whole situation in front of all the passengers.Keanu Reeves gives probably the best performance of his career. Jeff Daniels supports really well, and Dennis Hopper is the classic bad guy. When it comes to the action, it is really amazing. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time because you don't know how in the hell they will keep the bus above 50.The score is wonderfully crafted and goes together very well. Joe Morton also supported really well and added depth to the plot when his big scene came up. He delivered all his lines with great emotion as well as mainly all the rest of the cast. Alan Ruck is a passenger providing comedic relief.The directing and a the script is all top notch and definitely dramatic when the action gets slow paced. No matter what, the tension is high and you can feel it throughout every character - except Annie.Three paragraphs and I still haven't discussed Sandra Bullock - I bet you wonder why. It should be fairly obvious that I despise her. Her acting is less than par level and her voice is dreadfully annoying. She is barely decent looking so it's hard to care for her at all. Her lines have no emotion as far as I can tell, which makes the Annie character pointless. The only reason why the driver was shot was to bring in this character. She quickly becomes romantically linked with Keanu's character. I just think the film would have done a lot better without her character. The only satisfaction I got from Sandra in this movie was her line What you thought you needed another challenge or something? Sandra is the reason I refuse to give this a perfect 10. It is unfortunate that Forrest Gump, Interview With the Vampire, and Pulp Fiction came out the same year because Speed could have gotten more awards.Overall, the a-list actors, the incredibly intense ride the movie gives, the few laughs you have, the superb acting, the amazing plot, the dazzling special effects and props and the Oscar-Winning sound are all wonderful reasons to watch Speed at least once.

After a confrontation, Jack and Harry think the bomber exploded and are awarded medals.

However his marriage and his work still leaves him unfulfilled and he is touched with jealousy and regret when he sees a colleague stepping out with a younger woman. On his way home from a work presentation, Cross comes across Katherine Kitty March in a spot of bother and comes, in his own way, to her aid. Walking her home Cross is giddy like a schoolboy, seeing a future with this pretty young woman. So blinded by this enthusiasm is he that Cross does not see that Kitty and friend Johnny are really trying to take him for a fortune they believe he has.This film is best known to me for a couple of scenes with very famous dialogue but I had not seen it for ages until recently. The film has a great character at its heart and the story is more or less about this man's mid(ish) life crisis that sees him falling under the spell of a younger woman who really offers him nothing but ruin and despair . This is the strongest part of the film by far and the character of Cross is well enough written to carry the film forward. The downside of this is that, when the film fills in other aspects of the plot that do not directly involve Cross, I found it to be a little dull despite the fact that a lot of the action occurs with Kitty and Johnny because really the value was within Cross. The moral is well delivered at the end and, because of how it is down I did take to it more than some of the films of the period that had to have similar endings.A big reason for the character aspect working is Robinson's performance who happily plays himself as a convincing old fool who, to put it simply, is turned out by a young woman. I can see what attracted him to the role and he plays it very well, with his body and delivery showing him to be just outside of the reason and logic that made him successful in his job. He also plays the conclusion of the film very well and makes that work as well as it does. Bennett is pretty good by avoiding the typical sultry femme fatale cliché and playing it a bit more normal while also letting the exploitation she is involved with changing her character. Duryea is OK for the most part but cracks convincingly and enjoyably at the very end. Lang directs with a touch of melodrama but he seems to understand the characters and brings them out well while also working with the atmospheric cinematography.Overall then this is a good film but perhaps not the classic I had hoped for. The character of Cross is fascinating and really well played by Robinson throughout and the film is at its best when it is focusing on him but, perhaps understandably, it is not as good when it moves away from him to work with the rest of the characters.

However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead?

Who knows...Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable.

This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement.Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed.

It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? I think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion.

But, given these constraints, Malick still delivered whatm, to me, is one of the few definitive anti war films out there.Okay, in my slightly annoying over-analysing of this film i came up with a few things I call flashes of brilliance, moments in a movie that make me go whoah...that was COOL! basically...Anyways, some flashes of brilliance in Thin Red Line 1. Capt Staros (Elias Koteas) close up shot of his face as he wonders aloud The Japs gotta have something protecting those approaches... The scene immediately cuts to a POV from a Japanese machine gun bunker. There is total silence, and the barrel simply tracks back and forth, slow and menacing, letting WE the audience know that Staros is indeed correct.2. Contrasts - many examples of course in TRL, but my favourite has to be the baby bird, a struggling new life in the mud as we hear the thunder of war all around. Brilliant. (oh and FYI if you have ever actually SEEN a baby bird being born you will realise this baby bird is NOT dying, as some commenters have stated)3. POV shots as the US troops storm the Japanese encampment. No more needs to be said.4. Difficult scene to watch - the American GI talking with a wounded Japanese soldier, being so casually vicious and evil, but speaking in such a slow, gentle way, before leaning over and pulling gold teeth from a dead man's mouth. Chilling.5. A soldier crawling through long grass and the long grass touching his face reminds him of his wife's caress. Inspired brilliance, IMO.The film is not perfect. It's lengthy and convoluted, and has too many viewpoints. A more narrow field of focus would have helped the film, as it is, it's a little detached in that you don't feel as much for these young men as you should in this situation.Although the moment near the end, one of Sean Penn's final inner-monologues, I paraphrase, but one sentence ends with If I never meet you in this life, let me feel the lack... a moment that hit me in the heart and made me swallow, big time.Many have complained about the lack of dialogue.

Hellraiser's themes include sadomasochism, in an intriguing concept of the slasher figure in the story, which is a Gothic- looking antique puzzle box that summons ruthless demons to victimize the person in possession of it by subjecting them to a world of debilitating eternal pain. It also involves a femme fatale on the level of a chiller that does not involve fantasy, played brilliantly in an extremely acute performance by beautiful Clare Higgins. There is the layer of plot surrounding her that inhabits late-thirties, early-forties married and adulterous life with her almost frustratingly naive and unsuspecting husband, which is invaded by the devilish embodied soul of her ex-lover, brutalized by the demons of the puzzle box. Finally, at the core of the story is the pivotal character, as her fill of screen time patiently awaits to the point where she is revealed to be so, and she is the teenage stepdaughter, played by Ashley Laurence, one of the sexiest actresses I have ever seen. Everything from her voluptuous body to her scream-bloody-murder portrayal of the stepdaughter makes me wonder why her career never went any higher than this.So yes, the movie is more urbane than the vast majority of other horror films in that decade. It's even set in England. It's interesting that no one has an English accent in England, according to this movie, but nevertheless the locale serves the film with a dark atmosphere of sophistication and antiquity, which suits a story that surrounds an age-old puzzle box. This feel of the movie that I speak of is interrupted, quite inexplicably by beer-drinking, dirty-T-shirt-wearing American furniture movers, which I didn't know they had in England.Hellraiser is quite an enormous entertainment despite its 1980s-style inconsistencies that I suppose it just couldn't help but have. It's especially enjoyable during autumn, mainly during Halloween time.

I remember when this movie came out but never saw it until it was on TCM the other night.I couldn't get over how incredibly cheesy this movie is. Watching it, I couldn't believe it was made in the 1970's. It's obvious the writers & producers must have sat & watched numerous 1950's & 60's sci-fi movies in order to get the idea for this one. The set & acting all reminded me of an old movie in which all the spacecraft have cavernous rooms with highly polished floors and robots who move with jerky movements.How is it cheesy? Let me count the ways.First, the two robots VINCENT & Bob. Robots afraid? And then shaking in fear? This worked in the comedy The Ice Pirates, but that was a comedy. Black Hole is supposedly a serious movie. When I first saw VINCENT I realized I was watching a cheesy movie. The robot's eyes could have been so much better than just painted on. The robot reminds me of Cartman from South Park. And don't even get me started on Bob, the robot with the Texas accent. Also, how can a human have a psychic bond with a robot? I could have bought it if they said she had some kind of electronic implant or something. Incredibly advanced humanoid robots which move with stiff, jerky movements, can shoot balls of light with no problem but can't hit stationary people.The characters being able to breathe in outer space. Near the end, when the ship is breaking apart, yes, they climb onto the outside of it. Earlier they experienced rapid decompression in the garden chamber, but later when a meteor takes out the rail car tube, they don't experience the same problem. They also have the ability to breathe in space at this point. The meteor shower. Meteors as glowing fiery round balls? In the real universe meteors are cold chunks of rock floating through space. The scene where the one meteor tears through the skin of the ship and then rolls down the long chamber may have been cool from a special effect point of view, but is simply laughable. Notice how the meteor is just the right size to fit in the chamber? Near the end when they all go through the black hole appears to be a ripoff of 2001. The rocket even flies toward the same shining eclipsed star that you saw a few times in 2001.The deranged scientist dies on the ship when the giant flat screen TV falls on him, yet near the end he's alive again to be merged with Maximillian the robot? And what's with the Hell-looking area he ends up in? Is this supposed to make him the devil or something? And yet the good people fly down an arched hallway.This movie could have been so much better, yet wasn't made to be. There's just no comparison with that other 1979 sci-fi flick Alien. Black Hole shouldn't be seen by anyone over the age of 10, yet those under 10 are going to be bored with much of the movie and will not understand the ending.

However one of the positives of the summer was that the BBC launched a season of British films from across many decades.

In brief, reexamine you, everybody and everything around you, to make the decision  What way do you want to walk into ? It's excellent idea to turn away accidentally from your ordinary familiar road to stop a little, get in touch with new people and new experiences, and win a powerful knowledge. A knowledge which would learn you a lot about the world and yourself in it; like having the power to revolt against falseness, opportunism, corruption and manipulation by law; as for (Ben Affleck), and suffering from addiction of nervousness, anarchism and anything makes us lost love; as for (Samuel L. Jackson).Actually the movie was about to be perfect. I must mention the scene in which (Affleck) is trying to make up a fire in the company to get the opportunity to be alone in it. Just WAW ! This short yet dexterous sequence just condenses the unique quality of the whole movie. It was well written, filmed, edited.. etc. I loved the metaphor of it; as (Affleck) himself was the real fire by his anger.

He claims to have discovered the body and have been running for help but the police think otherwise, Tisdall's missing coat and belt helping to convince them that he strangled Clay himself. It is the day of Tisdall's trial where luck and a bit of judgement help him slip away into the crowd and make a break for it. Tisdall turns to Erica Burgoyne for help and she reluctantly gives him a lift despite being the Chief Constable. Quickly he wins her over and, against her better judgement she helps him as he tries to recover his missing coat and prove his innocence.This film opens with a wonder scene that is just one of the things that makes me love Hitchcock so much. As we look at the murder weapon (the belt) being pushed around by the sea, it forms a near perfect question mark, symbolising perfectly the mystery to be revealed behind this simple object. From here we are given a story that is similar to The 39 Steps in regards the innocent man turning to a female for help in fleeing the law. Unlike that film though, I didn't think that this mystery gripped me as much as I would have liked and it wasn't till the final third where I felt that we were getting into it.It doesn't matter too much though because for the first sections it does have a solid pace and charm despite the lack of urgency that comes with these. It is perhaps a bit too slight for modern audiences but for me it was a delight to see Tisdall's wonderfully English escape (almost apologetically slipping into the viewing gallery of the court) and the way he almost carelessly flees across the country while flirting with Erica. It is enjoyable but I did miss the lack of mystery and was glad when we got into it near the end. Not only did it get more exciting but it also produced a brilliant reveal shot that deserves to be considered as one of Hitchcock's classic shot as we slowly go from a wide shot of a ballroom right into the eyes of the killer on the other side; it is a brilliant shot and made all the better by having the cheeky Drummer Man being sung at the same time.De Marney struggles to inject urgency into his character in the same way as the material prefers the charming fun of the piece. He does fit the bill though &#150; not as charming as Cary Grant (for example) perhaps but he is nicely English without being uptight or stiff. Pilbeam is a stunning woman. Her performance isn't brilliant but again it does just what the film requires and she works well with De Marney. Radford shows up in a solid supporting cast that includes turns from Marmont, Rigby, Clare and others.Overall, a typically strong Hitchcock movie that as a total package doesn't stand up to his best films but it is enjoyable nonetheless and does have at least two scenes that should be mentioned when listing classic Hitchcock moments.

It is perhaps a bit too slight for modern audiences but for me it was a delight to see Tisdall's wonderfully English escape (almost apologetically slipping into the viewing gallery of the court) and the way he almost carelessly flees across the country while flirting with Erica. It is enjoyable but I did miss the lack of mystery and was glad when we got into it near the end. Not only did it get more exciting but it also produced a brilliant reveal shot that deserves to be considered as one of Hitchcock's classic shot as we slowly go from a wide shot of a ballroom right into the eyes of the killer on the other side; it is a brilliant shot and made all the better by having the cheeky Drummer Man being sung at the same time.De Marney struggles to inject urgency into his character in the same way as the material prefers the charming fun of the piece. He does fit the bill though &#150; not as charming as Cary Grant (for example) perhaps but he is nicely English without being uptight or stiff. Pilbeam is a stunning woman. Her performance isn't brilliant but again it does just what the film requires and she works well with De Marney. Radford shows up in a solid supporting cast that includes turns from Marmont, Rigby, Clare and others.Overall, a typically strong Hitchcock movie that as a total package doesn't stand up to his best films but it is enjoyable nonetheless and does have at least two scenes that should be mentioned when listing classic Hitchcock moments.

He claims to have discovered the body and have been running for help but the police think otherwise, Tisdall's missing coat and belt helping to convince them that he strangled Clay himself. It is the day of Tisdall's trial where luck and a bit of judgement help him slip away into the crowd and make a break for it. Tisdall turns to Erica Burgoyne for help and she reluctantly gives him a lift despite being the Chief Constable. Quickly he wins her over and, against her better judgement she helps him as he tries to recover his missing coat and prove his innocence.This film opens with a wonder scene that is just one of the things that makes me love Hitchcock so much. As we look at the murder weapon (the belt) being pushed around by the sea, it forms a near perfect question mark, symbolising perfectly the mystery to be revealed behind this simple object.
