Going into the movie, I wasn't sure if this would be a good movie or a bad movie or simply just a little disappointing. I had no clue what to expect. I can say, as the first scene ended, I had a huge smile on my face and was soaked into the movie.American History X is the tale of two brothers, Derek and Danny Vinyard. Derek Vinyard is the leader of a street gang who attempt to bring equality amongst the black and white people as well as dominating over them. Sent to jail, his younger brother Danny becomes much like him and so, Derek must try to stop his brother from following his trails. Despite that being the plot of the movie, this story is far more deeper in every way. I cared so much about Derek Vinyard as well as his brother Danny. The way the director made Derek both a criminal trying to simply achieve justice amongst the two races as well as such a caring brother and son to the family was what made him such a great character. You could tell that he simply didn't want his brother to become the person he did. The director did a fantastic job giving such a rich history to these two characters.The acting in the movie by Edward Norton is probably his best performance, yes I enjoy this performance more than Fight Club. He was absolutely fantastic stealing scene after scene he was in, which is pretty much the whole movie. Edward Furlong, John Connor from Terminator 2, does an absolute fine job playing his younger brother. I do not care what people say, Furlong is a good actor.The cinematography in the movie is far superior to most movies that came around during that time. The idea of black and white for past events was clever and easily helps you understand the movie and the two are easily distinguished. The music in the movie is very good, but of course, in this type of movie, the soundtrack isn't important. For a drama to succeed, the characters and story have to be interesting, and this film easily accomplishes that.During the movie, I kept guessing what would be the next thing to happen but every time I was surprised at the way the director took this movie. The film is just under two hours, but seriously, this movie felt a good half hour shorter. This happens when you love a movie.***SPOILERS*** The way American History X ended with Danny being shot in the school bathroom was shocking. It was simply that sad due to the performance that Furlong gave and the character's developed story. The way it ended with Danny narrating how the two races weren't supposed to ever fight but to be friends to each other was perhaps one of the finest endings to a movie ever. Seeing Derek mourn for the loss of his brother was shocking.****ENDING SPOILERS*** Overall, to sum it up, American History X is definitely a must see movie for movie fans however isn't recommended to those under the age of 13 due to the racism in this movie. That being said, those who haven't seen this movie, please do so now as you will be pleasantly surprised and how good this movie exactly is. If you don't see it, its your own personal loss...

The film is filled with creepy atmospherics, insane gore and is probably one of the most unique zombie films of the past, but different doesn't always lead to a good film. I just couldn't take it seriously, whether it was intentional or not, the script was a mess and laughable and the scares weren't effective enough as they could have been. The soundtrack was also a hit and miss, with some of it being completely out of place. The horror cult classics that came out during the same year like The Evil Dead etcetera were miles better, The Beyond just doest stack up. Definitely one of the most disappointing Italian\/horror cult classics out there.The characters were pretty illogical, doing most things people should not do in horror movies. For example, not shooting a zombie in the head, what a waste of bullets you fool! The other is hooking a clearly dead person to a heartbeat monitor, really! The acting was mostly just horrid to me, with overreaction to not enough reaction to what is happening around them. Catriona MacColl, who plays Liza Merril, a young woman who inherits an old hotel in Louisiana, is definitely easy on the eyes and carries the film quite well, she makes it bearable. The other standout was Cinzia Moreale (as Sarah Keller) who plays a blind woman pretty effectively, who comes out of nowhere into Liza's life to warns her about the sinister hotel. Good effort from those two, but the hackneyed script consumed them and everyone else.The late Italian\/horror director Lucio Fulci definitely made strange, one of a kind horror films. The type of films you don't see being made anymore, but The Beyond's plot had major development problems that were a huge distraction from everything else. Lucio goes wild here though, with a hypnotic, nightmarish atmosphere, intense close up shots of ghoulish imagery that will stay with you.

To me his best and creepiest film is The House By The Cemetery.Overall, not the horror extraordinaire people make it out to be, nor is it complete trash.

John ends up leading man kind to victory and so two Terminators, killing machines, have been sent back in time to eliminate him as a boy and change the future so that the machines win the war and wipe out man kind.From the synopsis to the movie, everyone just straight up assumes that this movie is an action movie with some cool moments. Are they right? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Terminator 2 is a movie that teaches you a great deal about humanity, such as why they shouldn't be eliminated for a greater good. It really is a heart warming film with so many redeeming moments which make T2 a far better movie than Terminator 1, which itself is a straight TEN out of TEN from me.Why do I love this movie so much? Well the acting in the movie is actually very good. Arnold Schwarzenegger actually does a great job in the movie playing the Terminator. Patrick Stewart does a great job playing the T-1000 and Edward Furlong, despite all complaints, to me, delivers a great performance. This is a performance that make me relate to John and not the guy who played him in the third movie. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was fantastic in this movie and her character really grew so much from the last movie.Terminator 2 is the king of action movies to me, delivering some absolute breath taking action scenes and some classical comic relief. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack to it making the tone of the movie all the more deeper.Terminator 2, along with the Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers, Return of the King, Aliens, Godfather Part II and the Dark Knight is deserving a title for the greatest sequel of all time. Seriously, everything that made the first film great is put into this film just with so much more depth making the film easily exceed people's expectations.This film also has some of the most mind-blowing Special effects that actually feel like they were made in 2010. The special effects certainly hold up and it is pretty evident that Cameron had a far bigger budget for this movie than he did with the original.However, the highlight of the film isn't the action, its not everything about humanity but its actually the relationship between John and the Terminator! Seriously, this is one of the greatest bonds in movie history. John, a jerk at the start is able to learn the qualities that make people human and he is able to teach this to a thing that is far less understanding, a killing machine. The way their relationship works is absolutely brilliant and is the scene stealer.Terminator 2 is a whole lot better than the original in every way; a bigger, budget, better acting, more fleshed out characters, better special effects and a whole greater story. This movie easily holds up as my second favorite movie of all time, behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy.For any who have not seen Terminator 2, which is hard to believe, MUST do so right now as it is pretty much the king of all action movies and one of the greatest sequels of all time to a fantastic duology- that's right. The last two don't exist. This film is an absolute must see and in fact, its pretty much impossible to tell what you'll be missing out on if you don't see this film---Its Cameron's masterpiece!

The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone.The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fiancée to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained.Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong.Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that shocking end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them.

She and the other orphans are forced to toil endlessly under their drunk headmistress. One day, Annie escapes from the orphanage in a laundry basket and meets Sandy, a dog. She and Sandy are caught by the police and returned to the orphanage, where Ms. Hannigan locks them in a closet.Then, Ms. Farrell shows up on the orphanage doorsteps. She is the billionaire Oliver Warbucks's personal secretary, and they are looking for an orphan to take care of for a week, as a publicity stunt. She sees Annie and is immediately smitten and manages to wrestle her from Ms. Hannigan's control. She brings her to Warbucks's mansion, where the staff falls in love with her. When Warbucks arrives, he isn't too pleased, but he lets her stay. Then when Annie and Sandy stop an assassination attempt on Warbucks, he begins to slowly give in to her charm.If what I've written above seems to be gushing with cuteness, imagine it with singing. Yep, this film is very, very cute. But it can get very, very annoying. There is a scene where Annie and Franklin Roosevelt sing to each other. I'm not kidding, that actually happens. To be fair, it could have worked, but only with a director who actually cared about the film. Huston did not. A cute children's musical was the exact opposite of the kind of film's Huston enjoyed to make.Despite the lively musical numbers, only one song is catchy enough to be memorable, Tommorow. The rest are rather forgettable, for example there is a song called You're Not Fully Dressed Without a Smile. Yep, I'm not kidding. As a musical, the film seems slightly half baked. The dance numbers are well choreographed, but that's about it.As Daddy Warbucks, Albert Finney is pretty good and bald. It's really disconcerting. His head looks like an egg shell. As for his performance, it is a caricature, as most of the performances are. He is good, but it isn't his fault, the character is written like that. Carol Burnett goes way over the top, in a performance that is probably the best in the film. She even has a few funny moments, but a lot of the time her lonely Ms. Hannigan comes off as really creepy, or as a pathetic alcoholic.Ann Reinking is okay as Ms. Farrell, but her character is rather one note. She does have a good voice though. Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as a pair of bumbling con men are good, but not great as they too are rather one note. Finally, Aileen Quinn as Annie is very spunky, and lovable, but she overdoes it sometimes, especially when saying grown up dialog.The screenplay isn't that bad, but it does feel rather wooden. It could have been done much better, as most of the musical could have been. When you have a story this well-worn, it helps to spice it up a little, maybe with interesting direction or a different approach. As it is, the cinematographer shoots it in a rather boring, uninteresting way. It feels very stagy, it comes off as rather boring. To be fair, it can be quite enjoyable at times, but at other times it can be too much, or too little.The film seems to rely on Annie's charm and cuteness in order to make you root for her. To be fair, she is cute, but it can be overbearing at times. The scenes in the orphanage are not bad, but some of the other orphan's can be really annoying. There is one actress who kept saying oh my goodness in such an annoying way, it made me burst out laughing each time. The film also goes on for way too long, but it could have been worse I guess.Huston's direction is not that good, you can tell it was a money job. His camera seems uninterested, and it drifts through the scenes as if it didn't really want to be there. I have often accused Huston of being laid back, but here he could have been sleeping and it wouldn't make the film worse. To be fair, Huston did have emphysema and would die within five years, but he still could have done a better job.Overall, the film isn't that bad. It can be enjoyable at times, but it could have been much better. If you are looking for a childish musical, this will do.

Do you like films in which the editing is completely random? Do you enjoy being completely confused? Do you like not really knowing the answers to anything and understanding little? Do you like films that are a pain in the neck to follow? Are cops and robbers stories your idea of entertainment? If your answer to all these questions is no, then I would NOT recommend looking at Bryan Singer's 1995 drama The Usual Suspects. Why? Because all those qualities I've mentioned before are present in this film. We begin The Usual Suspects with a very eventful night in which many criminals are killed and a boat gets blown up. The next day, two FBI agents (Giancarlo Esposito, Chazz Palminteri) come to the obvious conclusion that something serious went down that night. When they discover a survivor (Kevin Spacey) of the incident, they interrogate him for more information regarding the events that took place that night. They also ask him about the events leading up to this incident and the other people (Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio del Toro) that were involved. From this plot synopsis alone, you wouldn't think it'd be as confusing a movie as I'm making it out to be, but yet somehow it just is. The editing style is similar to Pulp Fiction in that the story is told in non-chronological order. So that contributes to the confusion a bit. It doesn't help either that half of the film is set in the office of a police department where the dialogue is uninteresting and foreign to understand. For that matter, the story that's being told is boring. Maybe it's not just the editing and direction that makes it all so confusing. The fact that I don't care enough about what's happening on screen adds to my confusion even more. So maybe it's an unfortunate combination of boredom and complete disinterest in the subject matter The Usual Suspects tackles that explains why I can remember so little. There are a few decent things about The Usual Suspects, chief among them Kevin Spacey's performance. By simply looking at his eyes throughout the film, it looks like his character is sad all the time. I'm not saying he's on the brink of crying, I'm saying he looks deeply depressed. By the time I got to the film's famous plot twist, I further admired what Spacey did with his performance here. There's also a handful of creatively executed scenes including one where Spacey, Byrne, Baldwin, Pollak, and del Toro surround a police car to steal the cop's money and badge that's ingenious from start to finish. Another example is when the same five guys are in the middle of a business deal gone wrong. Baldwin is holding a gun in each hand and ends up killing two people at the same time. This scene is really cool in its execution that I couldn't help but admire it. Aside from that, I didn't find much in The Usual Suspects that satisfied me. Like I've said earlier, the plot is impenetrable and more confusing than it needed to be. Even when I did understand what was happening, I didn't find it that interesting. Ultimately with all this said and done, The Usual Suspects ends up being a film that's too smart for its own good.

Like I've said earlier, the plot is impenetrable and more confusing than it needed to be. Even when I did understand what was happening, I didn't find it that interesting. Ultimately with all this said and done, The Usual Suspects ends up being a film that's too smart for its own good.

There is a scene with an antiques shop that seems to have no purpose, except that he eventually buys a gigantic propeller there. Why? Who knows.

The main character is on a radio while he's driving talking to some female dispatcher about how he's almost there or he should buy this shop. Who the heck is he talking to and why? We never find out. He ducks into a music show while he's actually searching for someone. Everyone at the music show is just standing there not moving. Except there is one couple dancing. Huh?

That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan.

But now I've seen the movie four times, and it is still growing on me. Every time I see it I begin to cry (which I seldom do). This is one of the very few movies that has stuck with me. I have it with me, in the back of my head, whenever I try to work out love, when I'm thinking about life, etc. It's one of the very few movies that has had this effect on me (to name some of the others The Iron Giant, Hannah and her Sisters, Fanny and Alexander, We all loved each other so much, My night at Maud's...). I know I am not the only one who feels this way about this movie. Some of my closest friends absolutely adore it, like me, and have seen it ten times or more. Others, however, think that is merely a nice romantic comedy, that's pacing along sometimes too slow. Why do people react so differently? I'll try to explain what I think is so amazing about it.The love story First thing, of course, is the love story. It's based on the very old story about people who can 't have each other because of difficult circumstances (think Romeo and Juliet). Here it is about social class - a normal bloke from London and a Hollywood film star. But it is also about much more. What made me see this movie in the first place was that it was mentioned in a book about introversion that I was reading (myself being a kind of sociable introvert that has experienced difficulties in relationships because girls didn't give me enough space). Both Anna (Julia Roberts) and William (Hugh Grant) are introverts. Both have a hard time just expressing their feelings or immediately doing what they feel like. But still, from the first moment there is a spark between them that they can't deny. I guess that people who love this movie identify with either Anna, William or both. It's a major part of the movie Seeing their faces, their expressions, their conversation... if you identify with them and intensely hope them to find love, you get drawn in. If not, you will find it boring. For me, I have found that I identify with both Anna and William. Anna, of course, is every man's dream The star and beauty that shows up from nowhere and becomes a part of your life. So far, as a guy, I'm all with William. But in terms of how they interact... I know that I'm more like Anna. She is afraid of getting hurt, she's afraid of giving away her heart, she has a temper. She is difficult. William, on the other hand, is the good guy. He knows that he loves her all from the start, and he never shies away from saying it. Some lines are especially poignant. Once, when she comes to his house in a state of confusion, he just says This is the place. This line always gives me the shivers. So simple. So moving. And it says so much No matter how difficult circumstances are, his place is the right place for her. I know that I, unfortunately being a bit Anna-like when it comes to being afraid of letting go and giving away my heart, long to meet a girl who will be like William Who will just love me, in spite of my quirks and fears, and just be there, and not give up on me. The humor This movie is not just about love, it is also very funny. Spike, the outspoken and vulgar roomie of William, provides constant comic relief. The humor is very British - dry, self- depreciating, semi-intellectual, at times surreal (but nice). The dialogue is sparkling all through the movie. love it. But I suspect that this is also a part of the film that some people will love, and others not so much.Place, friendship and belonging Ultimately, however, i believe that the reason I and so many others see this movie time and time again is because it is about more than romantic love. It is about friendship, and ultimately about belonging. About finding a place in the world that is YOUR place, and then staying there. William's friends are always around, supporting him (and making fun of each other). The love between William's best friend Max and his wheel-chair bound wife Bella is very moving. And not to forget The whole movie is called Notting Hill (an area in London). It 's not called William and Anna, or something like that. Simply Notting Hill. The area. The opening scene is about this area William goes around explains that this is where he lives, and will continue to spend his hours and years, and why he loves it so much. This is where William and his friends are grounded. It is their life, their area, their place in the world. And, the whole movie is about Anna coming to this place, and seeing the beauty in it, compared to the superficial world of Hollywood. Notting Hill\/Williams's circle vs. Holllywood 1-0. Summing it up, I guess this is why I keep coming back to this movie. If I feel lost, not sure about my place in the world, or wondering if I will ever find a girl to love who will love me back and that we'll be able to make it work - then I see this movie. It reminds me that life is ultimately about belonging somewhere, about having friends and family, and to dare to love. Not bad for a romantic comedy, eh? (and, of course - the acting of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is superb. The filming is beautiful. The only annoying and dated thing is the music. But even that can't ruin a perfect movie)Highly recommended.

See it big. It has so many different kinds of scenes, such terrific color and photography, and is dripping with so much history come alive it is a thrill and a joy. It's just a really really well made movie.The acting is superb. You might not think about this since it's such an old film and it might automatically be old-fashioned. But it is not, not with the two leads above all. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are justifiably revered for what they did here. Leigh in particular works her butt off making scene after scene come alive, with horror and frivolousness and charm and passion. The story is great by itself (based on the book which was the best selling novel two years in a row). It's not about the Civil War and its aftermath, even though that's prominent (and vividly, memorably). It's about a woman who is so self-absorbed in her infatuation for another man she misses out on true love. Some of the side characters are amazing.So yes, a great movie--but one that bothered me all the way through for its handling of African Americans. I may have noticed this years ago but I don't remember being so disturbed by the constant stereotyping. The slaves are naturally uneducated, so I try to overlook that as simple truth. And the black actors who play the three or four main parts are astonishing, all of them. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar that year for best supporting actress.The problem comes more from what all the white people say, or don't say, and what they don't do, over and over. There is no sense of shame, or apology, or perspective on their position as land owners and slave owners. Not before and not after the war. All of them, except Gable most of the time (he's a worldly and modern Southerner), mourn the loss of a great civilization, one built on slavery. They are so unabashed about this, and so many people say it, from Scarlett herself to the man she is infatuated with (the admirable Ashleigh) to all kinds of older and younger folks. Even the blacks are shown not in rebellion or joy at their release, but as slaves eager to fight for the South.The more I think about it the more it's disgusting. Now the answer to my complaint is probably that this is from the point of view of the South and so it's true to their perspective. And I think that might brush over some of the attitudes some of the time. But where are the slaves dying to be free? Where is a single voice of dissent among all the huge cast? Where are the Northerners with dignity and higher morality? (On this last point, when the Northerners appear after the burning of Atlanta, they too are shown only from a bitter Southern point of view--all of them, black and white, are opportunists and arrogant, selfish, un-civilized sorts.)I teach a beginning history of cinema class and so see a lot of movies from the whole century of the art. And it's painfully weird that the two lionized, epic, breakthrough films about the Civil War are both from the Southern point of view. I'm talking Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind. And both are insidiously unfair to Blacks, one more subtly than the other but true.I'll end more cheerfully. Knowing the movie has this quality doesn't prevent you from enjoying it for a million other reasons. I laughed (it's very funny) and I cried (it's very moving). And I was endlessly impressed.

They are so unabashed about this, and so many people say it, from Scarlett herself to the man she is infatuated with (the admirable Ashleigh) to all kinds of older and younger folks. Even the blacks are shown not in rebellion or joy at their release, but as slaves eager to fight for the South.The more I think about it the more it's disgusting. Now the answer to my complaint is probably that this is from the point of view of the South and so it's true to their perspective. And I think that might brush over some of the attitudes some of the time. But where are the slaves dying to be free? Where is a single voice of dissent among all the huge cast? Where are the Northerners with dignity and higher morality? (On this last point, when the Northerners appear after the burning of Atlanta, they too are shown only from a bitter Southern point of view--all of them, black and white, are opportunists and arrogant, selfish, un-civilized sorts.)I teach a beginning history of cinema class and so see a lot of movies from the whole century of the art. And it's painfully weird that the two lionized, epic, breakthrough films about the Civil War are both from the Southern point of view. I'm talking Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind. And both are insidiously unfair to Blacks, one more subtly than the other but true.I'll end more cheerfully. Knowing the movie has this quality doesn't prevent you from enjoying it for a million other reasons. I laughed (it's very funny) and I cried (it's very moving). And I was endlessly impressed. Taken in perspective it's still a fabulous fabulous film.

Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

I've watched this film 3 times and love it. The acting was outstanding. Gabriel Macht was seriously obnoxious as a smirking, leather bound, boyfriend of Sebatian's older sister. Clark Greg was deadpan hilarious even though he wasn't trying to be. Greg was so committed to his role as a transsexual but never gave his role a stereotypical performance, but stayed true to his character's process of transitioning from man to woman. Grenier played an inquisitive, adventurous teenager with subtlety and sincerity. The film was indeed an adventure for all involved. It moved from one adventure to another without dragging, and even though the performance of the actors created a comedic feel to the film, the film explored very serious issues. The ending surprised and affected me for a very long time afterward. This film was very underrated, but is a delightful little sleeper that all involved should be very proud of.

I get that Nancy was overbearing but there are more ways to depict than the obvious. Being loud and American won't cut it! Total waste of time.
