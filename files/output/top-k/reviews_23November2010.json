[{"date":"23 November 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Badly dated teen party flick that might have played better in the 1980s. Ethan Embry goes to a high school graduation party in a private home where he encounters Jennifer Hewitt, whom he has loved since childhood. He spends most of the movie trying to find a way to approach her. She, on the other hand, has just broken up with the class jock and is besieged at the party by an army of guys looking to hook up. Why she stays as long as she does is a mystery, but it makes for a convenient finale when Embry finally catches up with her. Dullsville. Blandsville. A more interesting storyline has supernerd Seth Green getting stuck in a bathroom with chubby classmate Lauren Ambrose. They have never been particularly fond of one another. So they argue and fight, then they make out, then -- well, you will have to see the movie for the rest. But frankly, I wouldn't bother.

Yet, this sadly isn't enough for me to make a good movie. I personally found the movie very trashy. It's full of bad acting, has a bad story, that is badly told as well, bad conversations and seriously trashy action scenes. Conan is so much more superior compared to this one. I personally can't understand how people can enjoy this flick. Good, non-pathetic fantasy movies are absolutely rare. I so wished that there'd be more out there. I hoped so much, that Beastmaster would be another one of this rare kind.If you like unintentional humor, or if you are able to ignore trashiness and stupidities, this movie might be for you.
