To review this movie well, you can't do that. You have to use conversation talk. This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have seen it tons of times, but I don't remember those times because I was little. Which is the age that most people watch it at because it has the most impact then. I'm sure I would look at it now as a teenager in more critical terms, like a reviewer. But i would still love it. That is not saying that this movie is only good for little kids. Any age would love it. The singing is excellent, probably the best singing I've ever heard.        People are critical of Dick Van Dyke's accent in this movie. They say it takes away from the goodness of the omvie. Being an American, I'm sure it is only normal to say that I see no way that this keeps from the fun of this movie. In fact, it sounded so funny and cool when i watched it that I used to want to laugh, and I used to really like Bert for it. It seemed like he was trying to get to the kids watching it and get them to have fun, which i did. Now, for the English, I can't say what they think. After all, I don't have their accent, so I have no reason to be offended by it. I just think it's a fun twist to the movie.     I agree that the chimney sweep dance was spectacular. It was great how they made the effect of the closest chimney seeps visible and detailed, and the farther ones kind of added a 3-D effect, with depth to the movements. I always thought it as also cool how they all slide down the chimney into the Bank's living room.      The one thing I don't understand is not about the quality of the movie. No,that is unquestinoably magnificent. My misunderstanding is about how this movie missed the top 250 list. I mean, everyone loved it. Everyone owns it, if they don't they tape it. Everyone loves it. So how could it not make the to 250. You have other far-less revered moies on the list like The Shining and Shakespeare in Love. Ok, I admit I know people who said the second was great, and I like the first, but neither are as talked about or as respected and enjoyed as this movie. I don't know, maybe in 20 years these movies will have more respect than Mary Poppins, but for now much more age ranges and just a higher percentage love Mary Poppins. People talk about how they've gotten it for their kids, and they've seen it many times. But it isn't on the top 250 list. I don't understand. OH, and for those of you who are saying well then why don't you vote, mart guy, I just did. I gave it a 10. Maybe that will have some effect. For now, I hope some of those lovers will vote and put this on the list.      The bottom line is this movie is great. It has all the elemenst of an excellent movie, and I'm sure glad they did bother to give this four stars. It deserves each of the those stars, and anything less would be unacceptable. See this movie if you haven;t. If you have, continue to enjoy it. I highly recommend it.     ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 1999","score":"","review":"  My last review was too professional.

I have read many mixed reviews on this film and allow me to set the record straight.  Three types should see this film horror fans, action fans, and Arnie fans.  End of Days successfully combines the horror and action genre for one hell of a thrill ride. Arnold plays an ex-NYPD cop now private security agent (along with partner Kevin Pollack providing good comic relief) who comes to the aid of a young woman marked for consummation by Satan (thus ending mankind as we know it).  Two schools of thought exist to foil Satan (Gabriel Byrne), one group (knights of the sacred heart I believe they call themselves) wants to kill Satan's unwilling bride-to-be while the other relies on the more traditional aspect of faith in God (both stemming from the very same Vatican!) In a radical departure from his traditional action roles, Arnie plays flawed hero Jericho Cane, a drunkard down on his luck and without faith (lost both his wife and daughter).  It is definitely an interesting character study as Cane must not only grapple with personal issues but the greatest manifestation of evil the human mind can acknowledge.  Byrne, on the other hand,  plays the devil with charisma and intelligence.  Although many may be disappointed with his initial entrance, one cannot deny his screen presence.   Many critics have complained the film lacks originality.  End of Days indeed does borrow visuals and concepts from the Omen\/Exorcist I and III as well as from numerous Schwarzenegger flicks ranging from Terminator to Predator.  The brilliant opening sequence also reminded me of THE MATRIX.  However the combination of religious horror with the bravado of a Schwarzeneggar persona is ultimately the films greatest triumph.    Peter Hyams (THE RELIC, TIMECOP, THE STAR CHAMBER) provides enough eye candy for any genre fan (e.g. the most wicked inbred since DELIVERANCE, stigmata, crucifixions, Arnie double fisted, the most firepower since Terminator II).  Finally, the film does successfully manipulate emotions to the point where I could honestly say I care if Evil wins over Good.  If this isn't a fun time at the movies maybe its the end of days for you.   ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 1999","score":"","review":"  Thank God Arnold's three year film hiatus is over.

It is this knowledge of the film that has perhaps partially ruined the experience of this film for me and many others.

Yet the film holds together brilliantly despite, or maybe even because of, the hype that has surrounded it's entrance to the UK.\tWhat the film does best is to build up the tension, almost silently, and allow one thing to go wrong after the other before dropping the crew (and us) in a living hell, within reach of all of us. It is hard to define the point at which they realise that they really are going to die, because it all builds up on different layers. The genius is that we are seeing this arrogant bunch do everything wrong, yet we know that we would do exactly the same thing in their position. We are annoyed with them, but we don't want them to die, even though we know they will. \tBecause we never see exactly what it is which is stalking them, we are left to imagine something far worse than CGI or animatronics could conjure up. The sound effects paint everything for us. The gore is minimal, but devastating. The design of the film (the stick figures, the house, the hand prints) is extremely effective. But what the film gives us more than anything is indescribable fear which oozes out of the film at every moment. The pace never lets up, and we are left every bit as exposed to the terror on the screen as the characters are, thanks to the ultra realism provided by the vérité style of the film. Thank God Hollywood didn't pick up on this, for it would have no doubt tainted the film with effects, music, gore and A-List actors. There is nothing intellectual or &#145;clever' about the film, but that is not the point, because this reduces the audience to a primal state, turning us into the closest we have ever become to cavemen.\tI don't think that it was a fluke that this film was a success, and I fail to see how anyone could be less than terrified by it.

I believe it would have worked every bit as well as the gore did, for as I walked out of the foyer, the dialogue that was ringing around my head to that final, truly disturbing image was not Heather's now infamous monologue in the tent but rather the early description of the witch by a local.

While it can be said that this movie has no plot to speak of and no central point to it, my response is so what? Not every movie is made to teach you how to live your life. Some of us can watch a movie simply for the pure enjoyment of listening to characters interact. Swingers does a better job of achieving this than the majority of movies ever made. Anybody can make Godzilla or Independence Day, but it takes a truly special movie to become a cult hit with nothing more at it's disposal than no-name actors (at the time) and catchy dialogue. This movie was the springboard for virtually every actor in it, with each going on to more well known parts.Ok, enough preaching, pure and simple this movie is great. Vince Vaughn's character is one of the most likable characters you'll see in a movie. Even if you have nothing in common with someone like him, you can't help but like him. He's hilarious, smooth, and a loyal friend, and he has some of the most quotable lines in the movie. Everyone else on this site has quoted it time and again, so no need for me to, but let's just say it's funny stuff. John Favreau's character, Mikey, makes you laugh while at the same time wanting to slap him for being so stupid. There's so many funny scenes in this movie, I can't even begin to describe them.

I am a big fan of the genre (Phillip Marlowe, Sam Spade . . . you get the idea).  Jake Gittes is a really great character and I couldn't imagine anyone else BUT Jack Nicholson playing him.  In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the whole cast as their characters (including Polanski).  CHINATOWN can hold its own along with such classics as THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL MY LOVELY (or MURDER MY SWEET) and THE MALTESE FALCON.      I remember reading that writer Towne and director Polanski fought over the ending.  I'd have to say that Polanski, though still reeling from the murder of wife Sharon Tate, had the right idea.  I could not imagine this film having a happy ending.  It certainly wouldn't have been as memorable.  I was surprised that John Huston wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as evil incarnate. Noah Cross is truly one of the cinema's greatest villains.

That is something that does not come naturally in the world of film. Movies glamorize almost everything they face matters with; whether it's violence, drugs, sex, or other behaviors. Movies persuade, advertise, and sell incorrect messages to hungry and excepting pedestrians. Not only is Bringing Out The Dead an anti-violence, drugs and glamour film, it also manages to deliver its message through one of the most talented actors in Hollywood clearly and understandably. This is one of the year's most unsettling and uncompromising productions, and also one of the year's best.Bringing Out the Dead offers no story in its existence. But there is no actual need for a plot here, due to a strong, precise narrative through-line and focused point of view seen through its central character. He is Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage), who narrates the film with a sense of depravity. He and his buddies, Marcus (Ving Rhames), Tom (Tom Sizemore), and Larry (John Goodman), work the evening shift at New York's Hell's Kitchen as Ambulance Drivers for an emergency hospital. They live a life full of stress, sweat, and desperation. Frank often comes to work pleading for his boss to fire him. The opening scene, which properly induces the desperate and gritty lives of the main characters, features Frank and Larry, being called to the home of Mary Burke, whose unhealthy father is having a heart attack. They stabilize him, rush the man to their emergency care facility, and go on with their lives.Now, where many lesser movies would have developed a romantic subplot with the Mary character and Frank, Bringing Out the Dead is too focused and skillful to do that. There is affection between the two. But Frank is in such a position in his life that he just isn't prone to fall for a woman. Nor does he give in to any of the many hookers standing on the street blocks tempting him to keep them in business. He is on the verge of an nervous break down, and the film never pretends otherwise.While for the most part, this movie didn't give into any major distractions or side-subjects, it did have several flawed and unexplained subplots. The story featuring Frank constantly being haunted by the ghost of a young girl he lost some time ago isn't really explained enough. Nor does an unusually bizarre scene later on payoff featuring Frank saving lost souls in pain beneath the streets of New York. And there seems to be an extremely dangerous drug featured in the movie, which strangely appears at the overdoes scenes where Frank is called to--this isn't detailed enough to pay off either. I do realize the purpose of us not knowing about this medical issue; we don't have the knowledge because Frank doesn't. But I still think there may have been a way to inform the audience on the context of this material, without making the hero look stupid. Also, the film is over narrated by Frank, who sometimes describes his interesting past experiences through words, not flashbacks or visions, which would have been much more intriguing.Scorsese makes no sense of the chaotic, unorganized, unsettling medical experiences patients go through in the emergency room where Frank doctors in. The style he uses to depict the film in is flawless in this justification the camera angles are mind-warping and fast paced, the atmosphere of the movie is gritty, with blood and vulgarism abound. The characters pace frantically as they travel across one end of the building to the next, not sure to where or whom they are going. The characters also are injected with a deep sense of lifeless scrounge, as they stare and gaze into each other's eyes, only to discover there is nothing in each other. In some aspects, this film is like Saving Private Ryan a tantalizing hell.And Nicolas Cage delivers yet another fascinating performance here. His character is empathized with the entire way through, even if narration is used instead of illusion. He manages to depict his character through the torment and emotional damnation required. He pursues profoundness in scenes where his character realizes happiness in itself. I fell like I saved someone, mutters Frank to himself. Good job, Frank.

This movie has pace! It moves along from the opening scene at great speed and it's never anything less than thrilling. There are stories within stories throughout the movie. Several funny moments. And many violent scenes. And that's my problem with this film. It seems to glorify (or at least casualise) violence. A kid's face is blown off by mistake - and our heroes only worry that his splattered brains spoils their hair.

Well, it isn't. SHAWSHANK was more about a man's search for  hope.  The director, Frank Darabont, new film THE GREEN MILE, isn't about a prison, but about a miracle that happens in a prison.  This is a outstanding film that shows what a miracle that could, or we wish that could happen, and how would mankind treat it. The story is based on the Stephen King novel, where it takes place on E block of a prison in Louisiana.  The E block is the death row, also known as the green mile.  On the mile, the chief of the security is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a sympathetic guard who cares about the health of most of his prisoners.  Paul has fellow kind and friendly guards at the mile which include, Brutus Brutal Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), and Harry Terwilleger (Jeffrey DeMunn).  There is one rotten apple in the bunch of guards, and his name is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison).  Percy doesn't care about anybody but himself.  Percy is cruel to the inmates, and loves to taunt them. One day a new convict arrives to the green mile, a seven foot and 300 pound black man named John Coffey (Michael Duncan Clark).  Coffey (sounds like the drink, spelled different)was convicted of killing two young girls.  But when Paul talks and meets Coffey, he believes that Coffey didn't kill the two young girls.  But that is only a part of the story.  There's a secret in Coffey that is a blessing or a miracle.  Whatever you call it, it's highly unusual for someone to have, and it does good towards humanity. THE GREEN MILE has classic written all over it.  This is a truly fantastic film!  Despite it's 3 hour plus running time, it's the fastest paced 3 hour film since TITANIC.  The story and character's grab your intrest, that time doesn't matter to you.  You're more concerned about the people.  That element alone is a sign of success. Frank Darabont tells a strongly dramatic film that isn't about a prison, but takes place in one.  It's a very emotional film, yet you would walk out of the film not only falling in love with it, but somewhat happy.  Darabont does a excellent job of detailing the character's and their feelings and  traits.  And like SHAWSHANK, Darabont does a magnificent job on adapting the work of Stephen King.  If I was Stephen King, I would have only Frank Darabont direct the film adaptations of my stories from now on. But the acting is also worthy of picking up golden statues.  Tom Hanks is different and great as the very kind and caring prison guard.  So are his fellow guards (Morse, Pepper, and DeMunn).  James Cromwell is also excellent as the prison warden who isn't the stereotyped warden.  And Michael Jeter is quite good as the mousy prisoner Eduard Delaeriox, who's best friend is a mouse.  But two faces or actors stand out in this film.  First is Doug Hutchison, who is very cruel and creepy as the evil guard.  His character of Percy, is the type of villian that you would love to see him get punished.  And the other actor who stands out is Michael Duncan Clark.  Clark is huge, yet he's very emotional and gentle as Coffey that the audience does feel a certain kind of kinship towards him.  You care about Coffey, that you also would believe Paul that Coffey can't be a murderer. I was extremely pleased with this classic. This has Oscar for Best Picture (winning, not nomminated) all over it. It is indeed over 3 hours, yet you'll feel a lot different after watching this movie.  It's a excellent tale about miracles, that happen in the most unlikely places.  And if they do happen, don't abuse them, bless them.  THE GREEN MILE, is paved with gold!  DO NOT MISS IT!!!!!! ***** (out of five) ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 1999","score":"","review":"  People would think that this film from the same director as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, that this is another prison film.
