My main complaint was trying to understand Jar Jar Binks, but on the DVD I can use English subtitles and thus understand all the strange things he says with his Caribbean accent. It makes the movie more enjoyable and I strongly recommend doing that.As usual, there is a ton of astounding visuals in here, all kinds of strange characters and excellent effects.

He has acted in much since then, although I saw him in a nice movie called Madison, with Jim Caviezel.People who are really into this Star Wars saga, and take it seriously, were, as mentioned generally let down with this movie.

If you watch Jingle All the Way expecting a heart-warming family film for the holidays, you're bound to be more disappointed than... um... say, someone who read this sentence expecting a somewhat funny punchline. I have to be honest about this movie's flaws, you being my number one customer and all1) This movie isn't funny. The only funny thing about this eggnog spill is that sometime back in 1996, George Lucas sat down in his Xanadu out at Lucas Ranch, popped this gem into his VCR, saw Jake Lloyd on screen and thought to himself This is it. I've found the kid who could do justice to the role of Darth Vader. Come to think of it, not even that's very funny. 2) This movie isn't heart-warming. In fact, it's more of an exercise tool for bulimia victims. They won't have to use their fingers or anything.3) What's with the rampant anti-dwarfism in this movie? Vertically challenged members of society are repeatedly tossed around as carelessly as babies with weed-smoking relatives. However, despite all of these flaws (and the 9,997 other ones that I wasn't allowed to list) Jingle is a mind-blowing experience for those with the right expectations. Like I said, if you expect a heart-warming and hilarious Christmas film, prepare to be disappointed. BUT &#150; if you expect a film in which Schwarzenegger does some totally awesome Arnold stuff the way only he can, like- trying to play a caring father but coming off as more of a closeted paedophile - fighting a huge, bare-chested Santa - punching a reindeer in the snout&#150; then, my friend, you will walk away from the movie a better person, with a big, earnest smile on your face and a steady stream of drool running down your chin. Personally, I watched with the right expectations, and loved the flick, even if it did kinda make me feel like my soul had just been besmirched with bucket-loads of hot grease from hell at times. But overall, a very satisfying experience for fans of the garbage Arnold has been churning out every now and then between his good stuff.

It's enough to win just best picture for a lot of movies. This movie portrays every film element to the highest degree, from the beautiful panoramic shots of the mountains outside of the mental institution to the story of ultimate redemption McMurphy and Chief find at the end.The movie is seen through the eyes of Randle McMurphy (Nicholson). He is sent to the mental institution because he would rather be considered insane and live in luxury other than being a jailbird in prison. Once he gets into the actual living area where the insane are, he looks up at this tall, native looking man they call Chief. McMurphy's initial reaction to Chief was his little Indian dance he did to mock him, but once Chief didn't react McMurphy asked him if he played football and says to chief, God damn, boy, you're as big as a mountain. Little by little, you could see their friendship start to unfold out throughout the movie.In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the title villain would definitely belong to Nurse Ratched. She gave threats to the patients, she was even friends with one of the patient's (Billy) mom. She also tries to toy with McMurphy's mind by trying to get him to conform with the customs of mental facility. It doesn't work out for her as planned. Including a classic scene where Nurse Ratched's threats cause little Billy to commit suicide. In rage, McMurphy has seen enough and actually chokes her out. This causes McMurphy to go through a lobotomy and become a vegetable at his stay at the clinic.I know many people probably disagree with this but, I think Chief killing McMurphy at the end was beautiful as much as it was heartbreaking. It symbolized that McMurphy, still had a chance to redeem himself and become a hero, even if it were death. It also gave Chief clearance to finally escape the premises and fly from the cuckoo's nest, and how he did it at the end was classic. That's what makes this movie one of the greatest of all time, not only because of the sensational acting and the sociological significance, but because of the message and symbolism of the story.The directing by Milos Foreman was phenomenal, not only with the memorable acting by Jack Nicholson, but with the camera shots he used in certain scenes. For example, the scene before McMurphy was about to get electro-shock therapy they show a very close up angle of him to show the intensity and crowdedness he had to go through while getting the shock treatment. Nicholson also makes it pretty believable that he is actually getting shocked, by making gurgling noises and such.They actually go back to the lying down closed angle shot at the end of the movie when Nicholson passes away. I thought it was very brave of the director to keep that long shot of McMurphy's dead self, because by making it last as though it were a still shot, to me it seemed more and more believable that McMurphy was actually dead. I don't know how Nicholson just lied there stiff as a board. I know he may have won his Oscar because of his heroic and charismatic character, but how he dealt with himself in those two scenes is what tickles my fancy.The ideology of this film is, in my opinion, what makes it one of the greatest of all time. The story brings up the question of who's actually the insane; McMurphy and his patients, or Nurse Ratched and the staff? Clinically, McMurphy was not insane. Even the doctors and professors stated that, but since he didn't follow the norms and the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched, he had to stay at the sanitarium longer. I also loved the allusion of Chief, by acting deaf and dumb. He played the omniscient or god-like role of hearing and seeing everything, yet not saying anything himself. It almost seems as he was the narrating the story until he befriended McMurphy.I don't know if I could think of a more evil villain in a movie other than Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). The evil looks she gave to her patients when they were doing something wrong was as cold-hearted as one could get. Also her audacity to tell Billy's mother about his sexual deviance is as sinister as you can get. She knew that it would hurt Billy deeply, which was a major reason he was insane is because of his relationship with his mother. He eventually killed himself, angering McMurphy.I never thought I would cheer out loud when a grown man was choking out a little woman, but I did here. This scene did a fantastic job of not making it taboo, but making you want her dead even more. This did change Nurse Ratched however, it made her a little nicer to the patients at the end and made her realize that if she abuses her power as a nurse, it can come back to haunt her.The meaning of this story is wonderful and helped Jack Nicholson set the bar for acting. The symbolism of Chief's and McMurphy's redemption serves as a corner stone for many many movies today. Whether it be the costumes of the patients, the crazy acting, or even the beautiful classic shot at the end of the movie where Chief runs out to freedom; This movie will never be forgotten. And it serves as a good lesson for everyone out there who feels left out can all come together and get freedom. I advise anybody who says they love movies to watch this film, because it will not only change your views, it will change your life and you can't say that about a lot of movies.

Stir of Echoes tells the story of Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) and his family. After being hypnotized Tom begins to see visions\flashbacks he cannot understand, what sends him of a journey to find out their meanings. Now as in The Sixth Sense, this movie has a great script that really keeps you interested throughout the movie. The greatest fault of this movie, in my opinion is the acting.

There are so many examples of thrillers from recent years that get into a groove of good guy, bad guy, love interest and rely on their special effects and stunts to pull it home. In Insomnia, these things are toyed with a little and what with a few other well made and thought through conventions, it makes Insomnia rather enjoyable.After you get the customary set up which reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs what with the police agent acting as a fish out of water (Academy to the Frontline in The Silence's case &#150; Los Angeles to freezing, backwater town in this case) brought in to track a murderer whilst having the plot involve a rookie female of some sort. What's clever here is that we know as much as the police do from very early on but as secrets and situations arise, the path we go down with Will Dormer (Pacino) is as decisive as it is enthralling. Insomnia is a really well shot film &#150; its use of the Alaskan setting through long, external shots and the way it portrays inside settings as so 'in-between' light and dark are really good. The fact the town he's in is almost always engulfed by light at the time of his visit acts as a fabulous device.Where Insomnia breaks away from the standard thriller is when it toys with the prospect of role reversal. After Dormer gets a call from Walter Finch (Williams) who's assumed to be a murder suspect since it was him running from a set up and it was him who has 'one up' on Dormer for events you'll discover, the film moves into a period of about thirty minutes revolving around Finch proving his 'innocence' that the death was an accident and Dormer becoming more and more besieged by guilt and the blackmail Finch has on him. It's almost as if Finch is now the OK guy and Dormer is the one who has done bad and this is emphasised through the way he sees the world he's starting to see everything in a distorted manner, he's having to tidy up his mistake by covering his tracks; something a murderer would have to do as well as come up with alibis. He's also failing to sleep at night and at one point is mocked by Finch for 'breaking his record'. This is Dormer entering the killer's mindset and it's done really well, having an interesting spin on things.I suppose the reason Insomnia's such a well made and effective thriller is that its director is Christopher Nolan who pays attention to fine detail. The way the editing becomes a little erratic and you could say 'slack' but I think it's for a reason &#150; heads are in different positions as reverse shots are displayed during conversations (like on the ferry) and it becomes quite abrupt, emphasising the lack of sleep Dormer's had. Like I said, the film does play around with who's 'good', who's evil and who's being pinned as evil when really maybe they're not and Hilary Swank's character of Ellie Burr is perhaps a little more than a supporting character when you think about it. Despite all the manipulation, the 'order' is eventually restored so that felt a little disappointing as I felt the film set itself up nicely for a twist of some sort.Make no mistake, Insomnia is well made and has made me curious as to what the original is like. I can just imagine Stellan Skarsgård running around an icy Scandinavian country dealing with the things that happens in this narrative. For maximum effect, watch the film late at night when you've got that feeling that you just know you'll be tired in about an hour and half but you start the film anyway.

Do you have to keep flashing to the gladiator movie again and again? I get it! Did every character have to act at the extreme end of their personality all the time?

I said out loud as they lined up on the 3 yard line, down by four points in their first playoff game, if they lose this game, perhaps the plot can be redeemed. But of course they don't.

Or did he actually quit before the end of their run? Meanwhile the b**chy owner is having her only human moment of the movie, making me wonder if the writers had heard of character development, or if those parts got left on the cutting room floor to shoehorn the movie into 2 1\/2 hours.And the guy's eyeball getting knocked out? Whose idea was that? I'm guessing the SFX guy always wanted to do that scene and talked Oliver Stone into it. Completely unnecessary.The acting was good, though I couldn't tell if Pacino was skillfully playing a tired old coach or if he is just a tired old actor.

Complete non sequitur, he wasn't in the middle of a war analogy or trying to win over the doubters on the team. The line was just crammed in. Sign of a lack of writing creativity. Likewise, various characters had to trot out the any given Sunday line over and over, making the title un-subtle to the point of ridiculousness. Oh, and the team names that the intern at the production company came up with were distracting. The Knights, with a big cross on their jersey? The Crusaders? Oh, wait, more in-your-face metaphors, got it.Bottom line, probably not the worst sports movie ever but I would never recommend anyone see it. 180 wasted minutes, minus the few on-the-field scenes that were exciting, but you might as well just watch a real football game.

I really like The Goodbye Girl, for instance. In the case of MBD, he was in top form, as funny as Mel Brooks. It's been a few years since the last time I saw this gem, so my memory is a little hazy, but here goes. A millionaire named Lionel Twain, (Truman Capote in his only film), has invited the world's five greatest detectives and their guests to dinner at a creepy looking mansion with the address 22 Twain. The detectives are 1. Inspector Sydney Wang, (Peter Sellers), the Charlie Chan character, who arrives with his adopted number THREE son, Willie (Richard Narita). 2. Dick and Dora Charleston, (David Niven and Maggie Smith), are polished, sophisticated society types modeled on Nick and Nora Charles from the Thin Man series of films. Their excellent breeding gets them out of a few scrapes during the course of the weekend. 3. Milo Perrier (James Coco) is a take on Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, and arrives at the house with his chauffeur, Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell in his first feature film role). 4. Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) represents the hard-boiled, American-style detective, a pastiche based on The Maltese Falcon's Sam Spade and Richard Diamond, Private Detective. He is ably assisted by Tess Skeffington,(Eileen Brennan), his tough but loyal secretary and mistress. 5. Jessica Marbles, (Elsa Lanchester) a hearty, tweed-clad Englishwoman, with a frail, seemingly gaga companion, her ancient nurse Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood, over 90 years old at the time), for whom she is now caring. Rounding out the ensemble are a blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Alec Guinness), and a deaf maid called Yetta (Nancy Walker). As the guests are sitting around the dining room table waiting for the host, Twain comes in. Twain announces that, as a test of their sleuthing prowess, they are expected to solve a murder which will take place in the house at midnight that very night, with a reward of $1 million to the winner. He then leaves, and everyone waits for dinner, where some very funny things happen. First of all, the blind butler comes in with a soup tureen and starts serving the soup. Only there's one small problem. There's no soup in the tureen! He comes around to Milo Perrier, and the first of many hilarious conversations takes place Milo Perrier One moment. Where is the soup? Butler In your dish. Milo Perrier There is nothing in my dish but my dish. Butler (sipping from empty ladle) I see what you mean, sir. I'll have a word with the cook. The butler then goes into the kitchen, where he complains to the maid, Ten people for dinner, and I'm serving them hot nothing! You can't get good help today. Meanwhile, the guests are getting hungrier by the minute, and speculating on who the murderer and victim might be. At one point, Jessica Marbles says, Murder by starvation. Maybe THAT'S his game. Every now and then, Inspector Wang comes out with proverbs like, Conversation like television set on honeymoon&#133;not necessary. Finally, someone asks a question, to which Sam Diamond replies, Why don't you ask the moose on the wall. He's been watching us since we came in. Realizing he's been found out, Lionel Twain comes back in, and Milo Perrier says, Monsieur Twain, we have been here nearly four hours and there has not been a hint of a hot dinner or a cold corpse. I must therefore bid you adieu. And Inspector Wang has a few words with Lionel Twain Sidney Wang What meaning of this, Mr. Twain? Lionel Twain I will tell you, Mr. Wang, if you can tell me why a man who possesses one of the most brilliant minds of this century can't say his prepositions or articles. The, Mr. Wang. What is the meaning of this? Sidney Wang That what I said. What meaning of this? Just about this time, the clock strikes midnight, the lights in the room start flashing in multiple colors, and the next thing anyone knows, Lionel Twain is lying on the floor with a large knife in his back. This prompts another funny conversation Dora Charleston Is he dead? Sam Diamond With a thing like that in his back, in the long run, he's better off. I won't go on any further with specifics, except to say that the rest of the movie is just as funny. I'll also repeat something someone else said in their post, Don't even try to figure out the ending. You'll only give yourself a massive migraine. But don't forget, this IS a mystery\/detective spoof. You're not SUPPOSED to figure out the ending. But, don't let that stop you from watching this movie, or you'll miss out on one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. Let me end this with one more conversation from the movie Willie Wang I don't get it pop, was there a murder or wasn't there? Sydney Wang Yes, kill good weekend! Drive please.

I really like The Goodbye Girl, for instance. In the case of MBD, he was in top form, as funny as Mel Brooks. It's been a few years since the last time I saw this gem, so my memory is a little hazy, but here goes. A millionaire named Lionel Twain, (Truman Capote in his only film), has invited the world's five greatest detectives and their guests to dinner at a creepy looking mansion with the address 22 Twain. The detectives are 1. Inspector Sydney Wang, (Peter Sellers), the Charlie Chan character, who arrives with his adopted number THREE son, Willie (Richard Narita). 2. Dick and Dora Charleston, (David Niven and Maggie Smith), are polished, sophisticated society types modeled on Nick and Nora Charles from the Thin Man series of films. Their excellent breeding gets them out of a few scrapes during the course of the weekend. 3. Milo Perrier (James Coco) is a take on Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, and arrives at the house with his chauffeur, Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell in his first feature film role). 4. Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) represents the hard-boiled, American-style detective, a pastiche based on The Maltese Falcon's Sam Spade and Richard Diamond, Private Detective. He is ably assisted by Tess Skeffington,(Eileen Brennan), his tough but loyal secretary and mistress. 5. Jessica Marbles, (Elsa Lanchester) a hearty, tweed-clad Englishwoman, with a frail, seemingly gaga companion, her ancient nurse Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood, over 90 years old at the time), for whom she is now caring.

When they fail to impress some cool chicks (a cat, a bunny, one appears to be a dog...) who prefer the jive-talkin negro crow nearby, Fritz ditches the guys and persuades the girls to accompany him to a party, with the promise of finding truth and enlightenment, but all Fritz wants to do is bang the pretty little things, and who could blame him? They go to this green guy's house (I can never figure out what he is - at first he looks like a lizard, but he's got a fluffy tail and a snout...so i have no idea...the fact that he's green doesn't help) but he explains that they are in the middle of a session (a pot-smoking term meaning a round of smoking sort of) so Fritz must use the bathroom for his truth seeking with the girls. Well, kudos to Fritz he gets the girls naked and giggly in about 3 seconds and proceeds to have his wicked way, before he's rudely interrupted by the other guys in the apartment who want in on this truth and elightenment as well! My fave line in this bit is the blue dude You ever make it with a aardvark? We're endangered y'know... The second act sees Fritz encounter Duke, a Harlem crow, in a bar, who quite rightly tells Fritz understanding the racial crisis from the black perspective is impossible for a cat like him, because he is NOT black (or in this case, he is NOT a crow).Anyway, in a particularly bizarre sequence Fritz trips out after having about 8 joints stuffed into his mouth at once, then has sex with a big crow chick, during which he suddenly exclaims that everything is clear to him now and he must tell people about the revolution. O...kay. His ravings on top of a parked car start a riot (not a difficult thing to do apparently if you lived in Harlem in the late 60's, according to some sources) during which his friend Duke is killed, and he is forced to go into hiding coz the fuzz are now looking for him. Duke's death scene is hypnotic and one of the more effective bits in the movie, with the pool-balls bouncing to the sound of a beating heart...really inspired little bit of animation, I thought.Fritz is found by his girlfriend Winston, who persuades him to go with her out into the desert and head for Frisco. Fritz digs the idea and they hit the road.No sooner have they run out of gas, Fritz ditches Winston to head off into the desert on his own, hooking up with my favourite character - the heroin-addled, psychotic, harley-riding blue bunny revolutionary, who ends almost every sentence with a deadpan ha ha and his horse-girlfriend, who takes a liking to Fritz. These are crazy fundamentalist hippies who want to blow stuff up fighting the establishment etc, and they quickly rope Fritz into a scheme to blow up a power station.

It is also a reminder that although we have come far in things like IT technology and medicine, etc, our morals and values have, if anything, gone BACKWARDS since 1972.

Avery Phillips (Barry Sullivan) was truly good in his alcoholic role - didn't you know the end of the movie would involve a car-accident when he picked up Eva's keys from his desk? I really didn't understand why the niece committed suicide - it was plain to me that Eva had hitched-up with every male in The South. John Ireland (Judson Prentiss) was good in his role, as were Betsy Palmer and all the rest.The star of the show, of course, is the wardrobe Ms. Crawford wears. I recall the TV-appeal they had her to do for poor people all around the world, some time ago. Everyone in the world could have, at that time, been fed if they just hocked the necklace she was wearing. True Crawford ! Poor people, but keep you hands off my necklace !Yeah, the drag-queens really got some fodder for their acts, especially the fabulous Charles Pearce, who did an act about a bitch-fight between Bette Davis and Crawford, just by turning his wig around......but by using his own material. For those of you who didn't have the privilege of seeing Pearce perform, you missed some great talent....almost as famous as the ladies he mimicked.You weren't aware that the lighting for this movie were designed to highlight Crawford's eyes - thick brows, or not ?I think this film was a story of Crawford's real life - her own daughter couldn't sit through it. I loved Queen Bee, because it made me laugh at such meanness, although I've known a lot of those people, too. You gotta admit one thing NO ONE does queen of mean like Crawford did. Today's actresses don't have it in them to be mean AND glamorous - younger people may not realize that movies, in those days, ALWAYS had lines in them to say how beautiful the leading lady was.I'm not a hard-core fan of hers, but I truly enjoyed Crawford in Queen Bee. Bravo to all! ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"4 September 2007","score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" The second to last Beach Party movie. In this one Frankie Avalon is separated from Annette Funicello by being in the Naval Reserve. While on an island he gets a witch doctor (Buster Keaton!) to see if Annette is being faithful to him. Keaton sends a pelican (???) to spy on Annette. Meanwhile handsome, attractive Ricky (Dwayne Hickman) is hitting on her. Then there's Mickey Rooney looking for the boy next door and girl next door for an ad campaign.Even for a beach party movie this is pretty desperate. Funicello looks way too old to be hanging out at the beach (and her pregnancy is clearly visible); the dialogue is more inane than usual; the songs are (to be nice) terrible; the jokes are stubbornly unfunny; Hickman is as bland as they come (even worse than Chris O'Donnell); Harvey Lembeck returns as the incredibly unfunny Eric von Zipper; the comical motorcycle race at the end is incredibly stupid; and it's kind of sad seeing Keaton and Rooney reduced to this. Still, this is kind of fun in a silly sort of way. It's not even remotely good but I kept watching. The Claymation opening is fun and I did laugh out loud at the Bewitched joke at the end. Also this is perfect for young kids. So it's not good but it's harmless. It's certainly better than the next (and last) beach party movie Ghost in the Invisible Bikini!

I also once read the Peter Pan book by J.M. Barrie (adapted from his play) at school during my elementary years, but don't seem to have any memory of it, even though I had permanent memories of this movie adaptation by then. Eventually, I went off Disney for a long time, but lately, I have been watching Disney films after not seeing them for many years. I finally got around to watching Peter Pan again last night, discovering that it was still good.Wendy, John, and Michael are three siblings in the Darling family who live in a nursery in London, England. One night, after they've gone to bed, they are visited by Peter Pan, who has come with his little fairy friend, Tinkerbell, searching for his shadow! After the three have been awakened, Peter teaches them how to fly, and they fly with him to Neverland! However, much danger awaits them once they arrive, which will make their stay in this magical land difficult! One problem they have to face is the evil Captain Hook and his crew! Hook's hand was cut off by Peter Pan, and he wants his vengeance! Now that Peter has brought the Darling siblings to Neverland with him, the angry pirate captain is a threat to them as well!Now, one thing some may criticise this movie for is the portrayal of the Indians in Neverland. This part of the film is racist, probably more so than any other Disney film I've ever seen, and it did make me feel a little uncomfortable. However, that certainly didn't ruin the entire film for me. Overall, Peter Pan is a fun romp, filled with excitement, nicely colourful animation (maybe better than in previous Disney efforts), and humour. A lot of the humour comes from scenes with Captain Hook and Mr. Smee, two very funny villains! So, no matter what age group you're in, if you're into early Disney animated features, and can get over the racism that I've mentioned, I highly recommend this Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie's story.

As far as the performances of the ENTIRE cast go, I'm not sure there're enough superlatives in the English language to do them justice. Peter Sellers playing three entirely different roles, (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove), and making it look effortless takes center stage, of course, but the supporting cast is just as strong. George C. Scott (General Buck Turgidson) shows that he's one of the most versatile actors who ever hit Hollywood and almost steals the show in the process. Sterling Hayden (Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper) plays the scariest psycho ever put on film with impeccable deadpan timing. Keenan Wynn (Col. Bat Guano) is also superb, as is Slim Pickens (Maj. T.J. King Kong). Let's not forget Peter Bull, (Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadesky), who put just the right amount of wacky paranoia into his part. Even the bit players, Tracy Reed (Miss Scott, Gen. Turgidson's sexy, seductive secretary and mistress and the sole female), James Earl Jones (Bombadier Lieut. Lothar Zogg) in his first movie, and Shane Rimmer (Co-Pilot Capt. Ace Owens) add to the unique flavor of this masterpiece. So, for $1,800,000.00 plus Stanley Kubrick, the world got Some of the funniest lines of dialog ever put in a movie, including words like prevert and phrases like Precious bodily fluids, Now you listen to me, Colonel Bat Guano, if that is your real name!, If you try any preversions in there, I'll blow your head off., Gee, I wish we had one of them Doomsday Machines, Stainsey., Well, I've been to one world fair, a picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones.,  Of course it isn't only physical. I deeply respect you as a human being. Someday I'm gonna make you Mrs. Buck Turgidson. Listen, you go back to sleep. Bucky'll be back there just as soon as he can. All right? Listen, sug', don't forget to say your prayers. and the immortal Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!. All of this and more? Priceless! Also images like Maj. Kong going over the contents of the survival kit and ending it by saying, Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff!, Gen. Turgidson describing a B-52 flying at treetop level, with great body language, the Soviet Ambassador attempting to photograph the War Room with a spy camera, Col. Bat Guano shooting the Coca Cola vending machine and getting Coke sprayed in his face, and Dr Strangelove's alien hand alternately trying to strangle him and shooting up in a Nazi salute. All this and more? Again, priceless! And last but not least, Maj. Kong riding the H-bomb down like a bronco, waving his cowboy hat and shouting, Aaaaaa hoooo! Waaaaa hooooo!. One more time, absolutely PRICELESS!! If you haven't seen this movie, or don't have it in your collection, go out and buy it RIGHT NOW! If you do own it, watch it again TONIGHT!
