[{"date":"30 April 2008","score":"","review":" Oh god no! why!? Planet of the apes is such a classic ground breaking film. It's a true masterpiece because it said more about ourselves & society then any other movie, so when you try and remake it your really asking for trouble. The expectations would be so high that such a film would be doomed for failure, which is kinda what happened.I don't care what anyone says, it's always a bad idea to remake a classic like Planet of the apes, hell look what happened to Psycho! it's just better off not to be remade. Heres why this movie ultimately failed For one thing this really doesn't fit directors Tim Burton's resume. Tim Burton has done masterpieces like Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, etc. So how does a Sci-Fi Action movie fit his bill? I give him credit for having the balls to try but come on! The Lead character (Mark Whalberg) was stupid, Shallow, Arrogant, and bone headed. Whalberg could never fill in the shoes of the late great Charlton Heston. Heston was Larger than Life, Whalberg is kinda annoying in this film. Besides him most of the acting is shallow & over the top. Seriously the dialogue is ridiculous, were the screen writers monkeys or something. The best performances by far were Tim Roth & Michael Clarke Duncan, they were the only bright spots in the film. I thought the Make up was fantastic and worthy of Oscar consideration but that's it for the positive's of this film.I've heard from many people who like this movie and say don't compare it with the original. Of course were gonna compare it to the freaking original! They both have the same titles and similar story what do you guys expect!? My problem is that there are many references to the original, but this film lacks any soul or message that the original had. The original made a serious political statement on society and where were going in the future. This remake is basically a way to cash in. It lacks any of the magic of the original, It doesn't take itself seriously, there are way too many moments of comic relief, The ending made no F*****g sense, and it's just totally forgettable.Planet of the apes probably should have never been remade. Perhaps with a different director, and definitely different writers, a Remake could have been meaningful. Unfortunately this film is a major disappointment, and is totally forgettable. 10 years from now we will still be talking about the original, and the remake will be largely forgotten.
