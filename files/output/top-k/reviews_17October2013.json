So the greatest super hero, Captain Amazing, decides to manipulate a few things to keep his sponsorship, and releases Cassanova Frankinstein. Unfortunately Cassanova gets the better of him and kills him so it is up to a hopeless trio the Blue Rajah, The Shovel, and Mr Furious, to get him back. Unfortunately they are hopeless so they recruit some more, landing up with the Invisible Man, the Spleen, and the Bowler's daughter. Then the Sphinx, a mysterious figure, turns up to train them.This movie, which is actually based on a comic series of the same name, is a farce of super hero movies.

Now that Captain Amazing is dead, a new lot of super heroes are needed, and unfortunately all they have are these guys. The Blue Rajah lives with his mother and Mr Furious is trying too hard to be something that he is not. In the end, when Mr Furious comes to terms with who he really is, a guy named Roy, then he becomes Mr Furious.This is a pretty cool movie, and I do recommend it, but it is not one that stands out so much that one would want to see it again and again. I guess there is a little criticism here, but in the end any comment that it would want to make, simply falls down into a pool of laughs and weirdness. It may be weird, but it is not the weird that makes me interested in the movie.

I enjoyed this movie but I really do not consider it to be a good movie. Even then, it does have a few interesting points, but unfortunately these points are not drawn out more, but even then, they are sacrificed for a more important idea.Never Been Kissed is about a young lady that had a hell of a time at High School, and she is given a job to return to high school and learn about what high school kids are up to these days. As such we have a jump between the time when she was in high school previously and he current time at high school. The title of the movie describes her desire to find the perfect man. Of course we quickly work out who this man is, but unfortunately she is masquerading as a student so her options are limited.One of the ideas is the mask, and this is paralleled with Shakespeare's play As You Like It. The English teacher describes how when one is disguised as somebody else then they can do things that they would not normally do. This sinks into the woman, but it is never drawn out. She really does not act as she would in real life because there are more issues that she must face.Her goal is to get into the in crowd and she spends a lot of time trying to do this. Unfortunately it reeks of effort, and this is never drawn out. She tries hard to get people to accept her, but she always ends up failing, and in the end never is accepted for who she is because she is trying to be something that she is not. She does get into the in crowd but not through her own actions but through the help of her brother, who has always been in the in crowd.Finally this movie compares what it was like then to what it is like now. They show a lot of differences, including the searches at the entrance, and the fact that she was not a part of the in crowd and now she is, but the conclusion that the movie comes to is that all of these changes are superficial. Everything is really the same - the same quirky teachers, the same studley, and the same brains.I felt that this movie had some interesting ideas, but it fell down when trying to pick up on these ideas. There were a number of different ones which meant that other ideas had to fall behind when a more important, but less relevant one, came about. I guess it could have been better if it focused either on the mask, or the attempt to try and work one's way into the in crowd. The first would have had her behaving in a way that was not herself, and then realising it later when her true friends are hurt, or she tries so hard and fails, and then realises that her effort is going to waste so she resigns to being herself and succeeds.

I guess the reason that he did not direct it was because it was an animated feature and he wanted to use a director that was far more skilled at animation than he was. In any case, this film still has a very Burton look to it with the twisted and dark scenery and the tragic characters. Even so, this movie is actually directed at children, and seems to be designed to introduce them to the world of the tragedy.The movie is about Jack Skelington, the Lord of Halloween Town. After a rather successful Halloween, he is depressed because he has lost all direction in life. All his life seems to be is haunting and scaring people at one time of the year, and even though the entire population of Halloween town looks up to him, he really does not want to do it anymore. In fact, he wants a career change.He thus goes on a walk out of Halloween town and finds a small grove of trees with doors in it. He enters the door shaped like a Christmas tree and finds himself in Christmas town. Upon seeing the wonders of this town, he decides that he wants to take over Christmas, so he has Santa kidnapped, and sets all of Halloween town to work to create his own Christmas. The problem is that Halloween town is not experienced and what they end up creating is a twisted and disturbing version of Christmas. This is the tragedy of this movie, Skelington seriously wishes to do something new, but ends up destroying the joy that the holiday was supposed to thing.I guess there is little in the way of themes in this movie with the exception of stick at what you are good at. But the movie is tragic in this sense because Jack Skelington has ended up doing what he has done because he has become bored and wishes to escape, but cannot. Even though the ending is happy, and Skelington gets the girl, there is still the underlying pain that Skelington is really back where he started, as when he tried to take over Christmas, he failed badly.This is a brilliant movie the visuals and the music are superb. In fact, the music is by Danny Elfman, one of Burton's companions that seems to do the music for all of his films. It is a shame though that much of the population do not see the beauty behind Burton's films.

What could Bond do to keep up and cash in on this new space boom, Moonraker of course! People find this very silly, but its a fun Bond movie, but does it hold up? Hmm...The story again involves a megalomaniac trying to destroy the Earth to create a master race, only this time the filmmakers trade Under the Sea to the empty vacuum of space. Bond must stop Drax, who is a little more interesting and intimidating than Stromberg, who uses his Moonraker space shuttles as transports for his Aryan race to space. I've said space too much in the space provided for me to write about a movie with space in it. (If you can read that fast, you're good) Roger Moore is again in top form as Bond, finally settling his performance that he would use until he became 50 years old in A View to a Kill. Lois Chiles is a tad bit wooden and monotone as Dr. Holly Goodhead (hehe lawlz) Drax is very memorable because of actor Michael Lonsdale's commanding screen presence.The story is interesting because everything before the launch of Moonraker I find to be boring.When we get to space, however, its amazing to see all the special effects devised by Derek Meddings. Everything looks amazing and surprisingly great for model work, and when its combined with John Barry's excellent score for these scenes make them unbelievably awesome.Now with those things said, there are some silly things, like Jaws' girlfriend, yes that happens. The gondola on land in Venice, the nerve gas, the ninjas (never explained) and even the sky fight is moronic.But like I said before this film is very fun to watch. There are silly moments of course, but it doesn't make this the campy silly film that most people would think it is. So, I recommend this movie to watch, but only if you want an escape to the stars.Next comes one of the absolute worst in the series, For Your Eyes Only.

All of the characters show a dependency upon technology and paperwork. They also believe that technology leads to a perfect and smoothly operated government. Mistakes? We don't make mistakes, a government worker states . The dependency and belief that technology could not contain flaws leads to a fatal mistake; the death of a Mr. Buttle mistaken for Mr. Tuttle. Sam Lowry, a low-level government worker is assigned to solve the case. He meets the woman of his dreams, Jill, who is accused of terrorism for reporting the government's flaw. Sam realizes he needs to transfer to information retrieval to get close to Jill. He asks his vain and plastic surgery obsessed mother for help and he succeeds in getting the job. With the job he is able to find Jill and the two grow to like each other. However, he abuses his newfound career by retrieving Jill's information and adjusting her files to make it appear that she is actually dead to protect her from arrest. The government makes the discovery of Sam's treason and he is hunted down by armed workers. Sam is taken unconsciously to a government building where he is then restrained to a chair in a room where he is to be tortured. He then learns that in a resistance to arrest Jill has unfortunately been killed. A masked friend of his is set to torture him. Just before torture commences Tuttle and his allies shoot down the torturer and rescue Sam. They escape and many odd and chilling scenes are shown. In the end it is realized that the entire escape was a dream of Sam's as he hallucinates. He is shown again back in the chair restrained, appearing delusional humming the movies theme song Brazil and the film ends.The ending is sad and leaves you longing for the happy ending seen in the alternate version of the film. On the other hand I found the ending to be my favorite part of this film and to me this tragic ending was more impacting for me. He attempts at being a hero and does not succeed but he is still seen as brave and a dreamer. He loses the woman of his dreams and is to be confined for the rest of his life. Like any great film should the ending leaves you wondering.

One of the may catchphrases from the original film is I love being a turtle!&#x85; I don't think it is true in this one! This is such a dire film. Easily the worst film in the trilogy.April O'Neil gets transported back in time when she buys Splinter an ancient relic. The turtles have to go back and save April, but when they get there, they arrive in the middle of a huge war. They hang around and help the village that they are staying in defeat an evil samurai leader from taking over.The first thing I thought when this film started was what disease have the turtles caught?. The costumes looked so much worse than in the second one, which is really bad considering the second one looked far worse than the original. They seemed to have spots all over their heads. I don't think they had them in the others, and even if they did they were not as dark as they were here. The story was that good. I always thought the turtles were much better in the city hiding in the sewer, so when they went back in time and they were all out in the open it just didn't feel right. The other thing I was missing from this film was the Shredder. He was always such a great villain and he was missed in this. Thankfully Casey was back. He was missed from the second one, but again his character was very much a small part. He didn't do a lot. I was hoping he would have been in it much more.The casting again was very average. The actors in the costumes were Mark Caso, Matt Hill, Jim Raposa and David Fraser. April was again played by Paige Turco. She was slightly better in this one, but her new hair style really didn't suit her. Elias Koteas returned as Casey Jones. He did a good job with what he had to do, but like I said before he should have been in it more as Casey. He also played another character in the film, but it just wasn't the same so he was missed as Casey.There are some great comedy moments in this film, which is the best part of the movie. Some of the script were actually quite funny and made me laugh a little bit. I also liked the small references to other movies. The Terminator and Wayne's World being 2 of them.The fighting was actually quite good during some of the scenes. Even the turtles were moving with some speed and made the fighting look smooth. There were some bad fighting scenes, but there were also some good ones.All in all this film was a big disappointment. Yes I mentioned some things I liked about it, but the bad outweigh the good by a long shot. It is a very poor sequel and I believe this should have never been made.I will give this 4 out of 10.You were expecting maybe the Addams Family?For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"17 October 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES IIIOh boy oh boy oh boy.

He was missed from the second one, but again his character was very much a small part. He didn't do a lot. I was hoping he would have been in it much more.The casting again was very average. The actors in the costumes were Mark Caso, Matt Hill, Jim Raposa and David Fraser. April was again played by Paige Turco. She was slightly better in this one, but her new hair style really didn't suit her. Elias Koteas returned as Casey Jones. He did a good job with what he had to do, but like I said before he should have been in it more as Casey. He also played another character in the film, but it just wasn't the same so he was missed as Casey.There are some great comedy moments in this film, which is the best part of the movie. Some of the script were actually quite funny and made me laugh a little bit. I also liked the small references to other movies. The Terminator and Wayne's World being 2 of them.The fighting was actually quite good during some of the scenes. Even the turtles were moving with some speed and made the fighting look smooth. There were some bad fighting scenes, but there were also some good ones.All in all this film was a big disappointment. Yes I mentioned some things I liked about it, but the bad outweigh the good by a long shot.

One of the may catchphrases from the original film is I love being a turtle!&#x85; I don't think it is true in this one! This is such a dire film. Easily the worst film in the trilogy.April O'Neil gets transported back in time when she buys Splinter an ancient relic. The turtles have to go back and save April, but when they get there, they arrive in the middle of a huge war. They hang around and help the village that they are staying in defeat an evil samurai leader from taking over.The first thing I thought when this film started was what disease have the turtles caught?. The costumes looked so much worse than in the second one, which is really bad considering the second one looked far worse than the original. They seemed to have spots all over their heads. I don't think they had them in the others, and even if they did they were not as dark as they were here. The story was that good.

I do not agree with this criticism wholly. The man with the Golden Gun is certainly not the best of the franchise, but it is certainly not the bottom of the barrel. So what's the story about this film, let's see what's what.The story entails a notorious assassin named Scaramanga (played by Christopher Lee) who tries to steal a most very important MacGuffin, I mean a device that will seize control of the already depleting energy crisis. Scaramanga sends MI6 a gold bullet with Bond's 007 number engraved, meaning he will kill him should he try to interfere. But of course Bond does and must defeat Scaramanga and save the SUN! Yeah the story is a bit on the weak side, but there are some good moments, especially with Christopher Lee and his girlfriend Andrea played by the gorgeousness known as Maud Adams. Both are very well scripted characters and played very well. In fact, Scaramanga was initially written by Tom Mankiewicz as Bond intellectual equal, which kind of shows, but the producers and director toned it down to a very bad degree. And we have one of the best car stunts of the series (but it's almost ruined by a slide whistle, watch it muted!!!!!!) The rest is bland. Roger Moore isn't very interesting this time around, and he seems to be trying to impersonate Sean Connery, bad idea Roger. Sheriff Pepper is back, ugh, why???? He's so awful in this movie it's not even funny. Then there's Mary Goodnight. God god she is so bad I wanted to shoot her with a golden gun myself. She's ditzy, annoying, and not useful at all. I won't talk about Herve Villechaiz much, but i found him acceptable. The action is mostly blind filler, and the final climax for me is too slow.Actually the one line that made the movie memorable was at the end when M speaks to Bond on the phone. M asks, Where's Goodnight? Bond replies, She's just coming sir. That's really funny.Overall, I'm not so sure about this adventure, sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't.So this isn't the best film, but it's not the worst either, for me it falls into the small category (in my opinion) of okay to watch. Well, onto the more famous of the series, The Spy who Loved Me.

I'm honestly not sure why this became a hit for Seagal. It's certainly not bad, but there is really nothing all that special about it. It has plenty of lame comedy, thanks to the unfunny Tom Arnold, and some admittedly funny lines by Steven Seagal. It doesn't embarrass itself in the action department. It has a great opening, and Seagal does do some of his trademark bone crunching, and seems to be relatively in shape, unfortunately&#x85; Seagal's laziness was starting to commence as well. There are some laughable kickboxing moves, which do not seem to be coming from Seagal. The story itself is familiar. Seagal's Orrin Boyd character is a little bit like Serpico. Orrin is a lone wolf, and wants to uncover cop corruption. Sound familiar? Seagal does seem at least somewhat invested into this project. He does have some funny lines, as I stated earlier in the review. I wouldn't call his performance great, but at least signs of his old charisma are here. There is a pivotal moment, involving a death of someone he is close too, and he seems only slightly concerned. I also didn't buy the forced attraction between Seagal & Jill Hennessy. It was always subtle, but it came across as quite awkward. DMX seems very uninterested in his role, and doesn't react to much of anything. He does have a twist which I didn't see coming, but he looked bored. Isaiah Washington does well as Seagal's partner. Anthony Anderson is terribly unfunny in his role. There is a scene between him and Tom Arnold at the end credits, which is supposed to be hilarious, because they are improvising on the fly. It came across as stupid, and unbearable. Michael Jai White has an OK fight scene with Steven Seagal in the finale. It was quite disappointing in all honesty. Tom Arnold's popularity has always befuddled me, and I felt his character was a waste of time. Bruce McGill & Bill Duke add decent support, whilst Eva Mendes is sexy, but that's about it.

The original Man Who Knew Too Much was made in 1934 during Hitchcock's British period; the remake dates from 1956 when the director apparently needed to make one more film to fulfill a contractual obligation to Paramount Pictures. The plot differs somewhat from that of the 1934 film; in particular it omits the final shootout which drew upon Hitchcock's own youthful memories of the Sidney Street siege. Although the film was produced by a big Hollywood studio and the married couple at the centre of the action (British in the original) here become American, none of the action actually takes place in the USA. The opening scenes were shot in Marrakesh (replacing Switzerland in the 1934 film) and the bulk of the film preserves the original's London setting. Ben McKenna, a doctor from Indiana, his wife Jo and their son Hank are on holiday in Morocco (at this time still a French colony) when they witness the murder of an acquaintance named Louis Bernard, who turns out to be a French secret agent. After being stabbed in the back, Bernard dies in Ben's arms, but not before has had time to whisper to Ben that a foreign Prime Minister will be assassinated in London very soon. Before he can inform the police Ben receives a mysterious phone call telling him that his son has been kidnapped. The kidnappers' price for the boy's safe release is the McKennas' silence about Bernard's last words until after the assassination has taken place. This sets up a similar scenario to that in the earlier film; the parents of the kidnapped child (a boy here, a girl in the original) have to rely upon their own resources, both to secure the release of their child and to prevent the assassination, without notifying the authorities. As in the 1934 film we never learn the nationality of the threatened politician (a wholly fictitious country, to judge from the national flag we see) or what the assassins hope to gain by his death. As in the original the assassination attempt is scheduled to take place during a concert at the Albert Hall (in keeping with Hitchcock's fondness for setting key scenes in or on landmark buildings or structures), and the work being played is again Arthur Benjamin's Storm Clouds Cantata, specially composed for the 1934 film. In an article about Hitchcock's Blondes the critic Camille Paglia pointed out that, even in his lighter productions, the great man preferred actresses like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint who were best known for their serious work; he did not generally make use of what Paglia called comedy blondes like Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. The Man Who Knew Too Much, however, is an exception. Although Doris Day's looks certainly qualified her as a Hitchcock blonde she was chiefly known for her work in comedies and musicals. It was, however, Hitchcock himself who insisted on using her here, against the wishes of the producers. He may have been attracted by her voice; Jo is supposed to be a professional singer, and the song Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be), written for the film, plays an important part in the film's denouement. (It was to become Day's most famous hit). In an interview with François Truffaut, Hitchcock said of the two versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional. If he meant by that that the 1956 film was the superior one, I am afraid that I cannot agree. The 1934 version is not Hitchcock's greatest film of his British period when compared with something like The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes, but it has strengths which its successor lacks. Certainly, Day and James Stewart as Ben are more charismatic than Leslie Banks and Edna Best who played the equivalent roles in 1934. The later film, however, lacks a villain who can compare with Peter Lorre's Abbott, by far the most memorable villain of the director's early period. It is also rather lacking in humour, apart perhaps from the brief scene in the taxidermist's shop. Most importantly, however, is the question of pace and timing. At 72 minutes the original is one of Hitchcock's shortest films, and its concision and brevity are well suited to the thriller genre. The 1956 version is nearly twice as long, even though it omits the shootout scene, and as a result lacks some of the urgency and pace which characterised its predecessor. The Albert Hall scene, for example, is far too drawn out- perhaps Benjamin insisted on his composition being head in full, or nearly so- and much of the tension is thereby dissipated. Sometimes a talented amateur can beat the professional at his own game. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 October 2013","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A number of Alfred Hitchcock's films have been remade- The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Psycho- but The Man Who Knew Too Much is the only example of Hitchcock remaking one of his own films.

Certainly, Day and James Stewart as Ben are more charismatic than Leslie Banks and Edna Best who played the equivalent roles in 1934. The later film, however, lacks a villain who can compare with Peter Lorre's Abbott, by far the most memorable villain of the director's early period. It is also rather lacking in humour, apart perhaps from the brief scene in the taxidermist's shop. Most importantly, however, is the question of pace and timing. At 72 minutes the original is one of Hitchcock's shortest films, and its concision and brevity are well suited to the thriller genre. The 1956 version is nearly twice as long, even though it omits the shootout scene, and as a result lacks some of the urgency and pace which characterised its predecessor.

The original Man Who Knew Too Much was made in 1934 during Hitchcock's British period; the remake dates from 1956 when the director apparently needed to make one more film to fulfill a contractual obligation to Paramount Pictures. The plot differs somewhat from that of the 1934 film; in particular it omits the final shootout which drew upon Hitchcock's own youthful memories of the Sidney Street siege. Although the film was produced by a big Hollywood studio and the married couple at the centre of the action (British in the original) here become American, none of the action actually takes place in the USA. The opening scenes were shot in Marrakesh (replacing Switzerland in the 1934 film) and the bulk of the film preserves the original's London setting. Ben McKenna, a doctor from Indiana, his wife Jo and their son Hank are on holiday in Morocco (at this time still a French colony) when they witness the murder of an acquaintance named Louis Bernard, who turns out to be a French secret agent. After being stabbed in the back, Bernard dies in Ben's arms, but not before has had time to whisper to Ben that a foreign Prime Minister will be assassinated in London very soon. Before he can inform the police Ben receives a mysterious phone call telling him that his son has been kidnapped. The kidnappers' price for the boy's safe release is the McKennas' silence about Bernard's last words until after the assassination has taken place. This sets up a similar scenario to that in the earlier film; the parents of the kidnapped child (a boy here, a girl in the original) have to rely upon their own resources, both to secure the release of their child and to prevent the assassination, without notifying the authorities. As in the 1934 film we never learn the nationality of the threatened politician (a wholly fictitious country, to judge from the national flag we see) or what the assassins hope to gain by his death. As in the original the assassination attempt is scheduled to take place during a concert at the Albert Hall (in keeping with Hitchcock's fondness for setting key scenes in or on landmark buildings or structures), and the work being played is again Arthur Benjamin's Storm Clouds Cantata, specially composed for the 1934 film. In an article about Hitchcock's Blondes the critic Camille Paglia pointed out that, even in his lighter productions, the great man preferred actresses like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint who were best known for their serious work; he did not generally make use of what Paglia called comedy blondes like Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. The Man Who Knew Too Much, however, is an exception. Although Doris Day's looks certainly qualified her as a Hitchcock blonde she was chiefly known for her work in comedies and musicals. It was, however, Hitchcock himself who insisted on using her here, against the wishes of the producers. He may have been attracted by her voice; Jo is supposed to be a professional singer, and the song Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be), written for the film, plays an important part in the film's denouement. (It was to become Day's most famous hit). In an interview with François Truffaut, Hitchcock said of the two versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional. If he meant by that that the 1956 film was the superior one, I am afraid that I cannot agree.

For those too young to remember it, it revolved around the doings of four young people (of college student age) who collectively called themselves Mystery Inc and roamed across America in a flower-power camper van, solving mysteries along the way. The four were Freddie (handsome upper-class WASP boy), Daphne (pretty upper-class WASP girl), Velma (plain, nerdish, bespectacled intellectual) and Shaggy (spaced-out hippie). They were always accompanied by the title character, Shaggy's large and cowardly dog. (Scooby is officially a Great Dane, but I doubt if he meets the official Kennel Club standard for this particular breed). The main reason why I disliked the seventies cartoon was that I considered it childish. Yes, I know I was only a child myself at the time, but children can be pretty unforgiving of books, films and television programmes they regard as having been aimed at children of a lower age group (or lower IQ group) than themselves. My main problem was that every episode was essentially the same. The mystery would always involve a supposed ghost, monster, or other supernatural creature terrorising the local population. Mystery Inc would begin to investigate and after a plot consisting of much screaming and running away from the creature (and possibly also of Daphne being captured and having to be rescued) the gang would invariably realise that the supposed ghost (or monster, or other supernatural creature) was in reality a flesh-and- blood human being who had assumed this elaborate disguise as part of some dishonest scheme. The episode would end with the villain being unmasked and arrested, normally exclaiming ... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!, or some minor variation thereon. Old television cartoons are generally best left to die-hard nostalgia freaks, but Hollywood frequently ignores this piece of received wisdom (as, for example, with the movie versions of The Flintstones and Josie and the Pussycats), and someone evidently thought that Scooby- Doo was a prime candidate for a live-action film series. In the opening scene Mystery Inc are seen ridding a toy factory (owned, rather improbably, by Pamela Anderson) of a ghost which, of course, turns out to be a man dressed up as a ghost. After an argument the group split up, but are reunited when all receive invitations to a theme park named Spooky Island, where the owner, Emile Mondavarious, believes that his guests are falling victim to a mysterious curse and asks the gang to investigate. Which leads to a plot consisting of much screaming and running away from various monsters (and also of Fred and Velma being captured and having to be rescued). Well, actually it gets a lot more complicated than that, but if you want to explore these complications and discover the eventual solution to the mystery you will have to watch the film itself. I just hope it makes more sense to you than it did to me. The original plan was for a knowing, self-mocking postmodernist take on the original, packed with adult humour, and a lesbian affair between Daphne and Velma, but the producers eventually decided on something more family-friendly. Some traces of the original plan survive; Shaggy's pretty blonde girlfriend is named Mary Jane, apparently a drug reference (deriving from the mistaken belief that the word marijuana is a shortened form of Maria Juana). Freddie's nickname for Shaggy, the Shagster, might seem to be another piece of adult humour, but is more probably due to the scriptwriter's ignorance of British slang. (The word shagster does not exist in the dictionary, even in Britain, but over here would be taken to imply someone with a high sex drive). We cannot, of course, be sure how Scooby-Doo might have turned out had the producers stuck to their original intentions, but the result could not possibly have been worse than the film we actually have. The plot is witless, standards of acting are uniformly low and the CGI used to create the monsters and Scooby-Doo himself is ludicrously unconvincing. Even the look of the film, with its hard, bright primary colours, is unattractive. Although the film is supposed to be a comedy, there is very little humour worthy of the name, and attempts to generate laughter, including a farting joke and a urinating joke, generally fall flat. (You have to be Mel Brooks to make cinematic farting funny). Most of the time we are laughing at the film, not with it. Presumably a CGI Scooby-Doo was needed because no real dog would lower himself to appear in this trash, but human actors were obviously not so fussy, and none of them emerges with any credit. Rowan Atkinson on top form can be one of Britain's funniest comedians, so God only knows what he is doing here. Linda Cardellini struggles hard to look plain and dowdy as Velma when she is quite obviously neither of those things. The worst actor on display is probably Freddie Prinze, Jr. (acting alongside his real-life wife Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne) who makes Freddie into an obnoxious jerk. The cartoon character was always blond, so Prinze has to be forced into a blond wig as unconvincing as anything else in the film. I said that I found the original cartoon series childish, but compared to this film it looks like the last word in adult sophistication. I am not sure what demographic the film is actually aimed at (apart from those who think that your mom eats cat poop! counts as sparklingly witty repartee). Certainly not adults. Certainly not most children. Toddlers? Infants? Babes in arms? Is there an unexploited gap in the unborn foetus market? 1\/10 (Only the fourth occasion on which I have given the minimum mark).

Shawshank is more than a prison movie however it is a life affirming tale of hope, loss and friendship.The Shawshank Redemption will continue to live on and be a part of best of lists, a future it deserves. Upon reflection and re-watch I can say one thing for certain and use a word that did not exist when Shawshank first entered our world. Shawshank redemption is the best bro-mance tale we will ever see, a tale that we will never forget and a movie that will never grow tired or old.5 Rita Hayworth posters out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 October 2013","score":"","review":" There are few movies ever made that require no justification as to why some (or in this case almost everyone) considers it a classic, Shawshank Redemption is one of those films.Shawshank lives onto this day in such high esteem that it feels almost pitiless to do a normal review of the film for by now almost everyone out there has seen or knows of the movie that inspired us to Get busy living, or get busy dying a movie that after watching it makes you feel like you could achieve anything or escape any prison either physically or metaphorically.Upon re-watching the movie for the umpteenth time it occurred to me that there are so many reasons as to why Shawshank is the film it is, a film that has so many elements that are truly classic. Here are some of the points in the film that to me make this movie endlessly rewarding and virtually as flawless as a movie could ever aim to be.- Shawshank Prison is there anything more foreboding than the flying camera zooming over the prison grounds as a bus of fresh fish arrives? Shawshank acts as a character in itself both endlessly scary yet sadly home to many convicted men.- Morgan Freeman as Red introducing the world to the now overused but never better voice over work of Freeman, Shawshank offered Freeman the role of his career as wise and deep thinking Red, a character everyone feels an affection towards.- Thomas Newman's score crafting a score that ranges from the haunting to the uplifting, Newman's score for Shawshank is a work of a true musically genius and has cues that to this day are used in all manners of film and other advertising. Try not to feel emotion as the music kicks in as Brook's leaves prison.- The Script turning Stephen Kings short story into an epic 2 hour plus feature film may have to some seemed like a pipe dream but what Darabont did with the script is nothing short of a magnificent work by a wordsmith that will never top what he did here. Classic examples include Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has or The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing s**t they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell&#x85; and those bars slam home&#x85; that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye.
