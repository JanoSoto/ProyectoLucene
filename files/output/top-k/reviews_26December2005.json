My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me. Do not approach this movie looking for some objective presentation of historic fact. Do not go into this film expecting to see a tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. Do not see Amadeus in order to understand the workings of musical genius. Inasmuch as all of these are incomprehensible - probably as much to those who lived them as they are today - Amadeus fails to achieve any of these laudable goals. What is does achieve - and quite well - is the blending of elements of Mozart's personality, aspects of his historical context, and an ingenious plot which is spelled out in a very clever narrative style. The truth you get out of Amadeus - as with most good historical fiction films and novels, is the truth of the feeling of a particular time and place.Amadeus immerses its audience in Europe's 18th century, but has just enough anachronism in its script to prevent losing its audience there. Mozart is a young prodigy who struggles with his own ego, over-sensitivity, arrogance, and self-destructiveness against a world which does not really know what to make of him. Salieri (Abraham) is his most ardent fan and admirer, but harbors a deep personal and professional jealousy, as well as an overwhelming self-centered guilt, and an even deeper conviction that his own perceived inadequacies reflect on his relationship to his creator. The third character, much better developed in the director's cut than in previous versions, is Mozart's wife Constanzia (Berridge) - seemingly the only fully rational and practical person among the principal roles. The film narrates the twists and turns of fate - the intrigues and folklore - which, even today tend to crowd out the facts of this part of Mozart's life. Hulce, playing Mozart in what is easily his greatest performance to date, utters a couple of highly anachronistic and off-color remarks in the course of the film. ISince I do not hold historical FICTION to some arbitrary standard of authenticity, I can say that my reaction to these was probably exactly as they were intended (1) Either Mozart was so creatively explosive that he occasionally happened upon 20th century phraseology through sheer coincidence and\/or (2) We are supposed to find these phrases a little shocking and they are used as plot devices to give the film a sense of surreality. Either way, the films works very well as a work of art and a good story, and what some describe as problems of authenticity are, to my mind, nothing more than artistic license. Most movies are not meant to be encyclopedic recitations of 'what really happened'. Keep that in mind before you commit to watching this. The only danger with regard to this film is that it is SO compellingly portrayed that some people are likely to walk away from it believing that this REALLY is what happened. F. Murray Abraham, who almost always does well, exceeds himself in this film, and well deserved his Oscar. Hulce is remarkable and the supporting cast are easily up to the task. The directing is subtle enough to be somewhat refreshingly unnoticeable, and the script and editing are excellent (at least in the director's cut). Very little can be said about the use of period music and costume which has not been said in the numerous awards and the high praise received from critics. This is a great film. Highly recommended for adults of any age.

Terminator 2 may not be the origin of said illness, or even the first film to fall victim of it, but it is commonly accepted as the first recorded case of it. The syndrome renders any sequel as more of a remake of the first than an actual sequel, but the quality is a variable, it can go either way(or nowhere at all). Usually, everything in the film is kicked up a notch, higher production value, more action and more entertainment... sometimes signifying a higher budget. These films are often a desperate attempt by the film-makers to re-create the success of the first without breaking new ground or showing any originality or creativity. For whatever curiosity value it may hold; Charlies Angels Full Throttle is another victim. As a victim of this illness, the film contains scene after scene(in fact, it's put together by them, it consists entirely of them) that are mild re-writes of scenes from the first. The plot is basically the same, and at best, fairly interesting. The minor lift the film has received in content, the fact that everything is just slightly 'more' than it was in the first makes for a few entertaining scenes scattered throughout the film(good thing, because without them, the film is barely worth watching at all). Apart from the entire original cast(well, the foundation, at least; the McCallister clan is back) returning for this sequel, we are also joined by the comedic talents of Rob Schneider, Tim Curry and Dana Ivey(I know, I know, but think of how she was in the Addams Family films, seriously), which pays off big time. The pacing is fine. The acting is mostly goofy and overplayed, which I suppose is the idea. The humor works, on occasion. There is one thing I just have to say; I don't much mind the silly humor of most of the film, but at the end... when it turns to slap-stick, Looney Tunes-like humor... that was just too much. It was bad in the first, this time, it's worse. I could barely watch. I found myself turning away again and again, taking longer and longer to look back at the screen. The content disgusted me. This is coming from a man who, in the last week, has seen Dawn of the Dead, Saw and Hellraiser Hellseeker... during which, I never turned away, or, for that matter, regretted that I hadn't. The tone is just too much in this film, during those last scenes. I don't know what disturbs me more; the fact that I, myself, as a child, enjoyed these scenes. The fact that as I write this, there are children enjoying them. Or the fact that there are grown people... not only enjoying watching them, but thinking that it's OK, that it's OK to put that in (children's) films, to tell children that it's OK. That it's responsible. That children may, or even(*shudder*) should think that. It disturbs me. Quite a lot, in fact. That aside, the film does a nice job, through cinematography and dialog, to show the world as seen by a young child... of course, that only makes aforementioned fact even worse. I only recommend this film for people studying films, so they can analyze and debate it, get into the frame of mind behind this film, understand it. Anyone else watching it should take great care to understand that it is, in fact, fiction, and has very, very little to do with reality. I wouldn't consider this proper viewing for kids, unless these are very mature and understand that it's not real. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 December 2005","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" This is another of those sequels that... suffer(?)... from a not entirely uncommon illness, known as The T2 Syndrome.

And one of the survivors Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is asked to be a guide for the rich and happily married couple the Kirby's (William H. Macy, and Tea Leoni). They are adventurer's and want to fly over Isla Sorna to see dinosaurs. But after the plane crash the people Alan Grant travels with seems to not be the ones they said they are, and with dinosaurs smarter then primates, all hell breaks loose. JP3 is not the worst movie ever, but it's not a good movie. I have never understood the people that say they like this better the Lost World. And i hope i never will either. For me this movie feels like a Pizza without the cheese. JP3 only last 92 minutes. If they should do it right it would have lasted at least 120 minutes, and with a MUCH better story. There shouldn't be any Kirby's in the movie. Or a little Kirby that hides in a tank and saves Dr.Grant with smoke grenades, as he runs through the smoke in his jungle-ish clothes to save his hero Dr. Grant.It all looks so stupid and childish.

On paper it sounds like it could be a boring, arduous task to sit and watch this film a 3-hour long story of a few bandits chasing the same treasure. But there's so much more to it than just that. TGBU is the final part of Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy' and if you've seen the previous two films, TGBU seems a lot more polished. Similar elements seen and heard in the first two films are used in TGBU, but to greater effect, producing a truly unforgettable experience. I remember watching this film many times when I was about 8 or 9 years old and loving it back then, and I hadn't really seen it since then, until I was 23. Seeing this film again was such a joyful experience for several reasons the soundtrack - often the part of a film that's overlooked, not so here (Ennio Morricone - bravo. Multo bravo); the fantastically-executed telling of the story (gets better on repeated viewing); the ending - still can bring a tear to my eyes (rare for me) just because of the tense drama produced here; the dialogue; the cinematography - still very unique, even though some directors have tried to use similar techniques, none have really produced a film of similar overall quality.The only downside here is the sexual politics of the film, and of all the 'Dollars' films it has to be said there aren't many women in this film at all. On t'other hand though, for the purposes of the story, it wouldn't've made much sense to put more women in just for the sake of having more women in the film. The ideas behind the story cater for a mainly male cast the time it was set in, the shenanigans of the main characters. Watch TGBU and you'll understand what I mean, I hope.Go on.

I first heard of the film through the documentary 'A Decade Under the Influence and was interested right away via a clip from the 'rabbits in the trunk' scene. When I sought it out and watched it, I was even more impressed (not just the scene, which is a riot from when our leads are picked up by the wild-man, but the film in general). Here is a work over-looked in the much maligned career of Michael Cimino, though also for actors Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. You know things will be going in unexpected turns right from the first sequence- a keeper- in which we're introduced to Eastwood as a Priest, first preaching the sermon, and then on the run right away from a gun-wielding 'old friend'. But what keeps the film alive through a slightly unusual story is that the connection between the two actors is strong, and often in the 'genre' films Eastwood's been in the attention to what goes on can be sometimes made well or broken by his co-star.It's not just the two main actor's personalities put to really good use, but really Cimino's attitude towards the characters in the story. Much more like a European-style film than something of the usual Eastwood-Hollywood game, it's more in tune with showing who these characters are, in the small towns and wide open Idaho spaces they go about in (shot very spaciously and brilliantly). I loved how the basic premise- Eastwood leading Bridges, and two others (one George Kennedy in a well-fit villain-type tole) to rob an Armory in a small Montana town after a botched attempt- keeps getting put aside for more of the 'little' things that they come across. For example, how Cimino shows the men getting odd jobs as cover for staking out the area; another filmmaker might just make this a montage, something goofy, but the goofiness here is more replaced by a genuine, though off-kilter, sensibility giving the actors more to work with. Or early on in the scenes establishing Thunderbolt and Lightfoot- somehow it's weird to see how these people would meet, but they're together, and a strange fit.The film isn't great, however the aspirations of what would come in Cimino's later films (for better or likely for worse) are seen here in good light. The dialog is pleasing, if a little 'off' when compared to the performances and cinematography (Lightfoot's dialog especially, not due to Bridges lively performance, is filled with sayings that run their course quick). But what is achieved is a mix of cool, 70's action-movie pathos, with elements more intelligent than would come across elsewhere. Other Eastwood films from the time were just as entertaining, yet sometimes lacking in the originality that comes in many of the scenes in this film. And the climax is a whopper, with one of the most successfully bittersweet endings in 70's cinema. This would be a movie I would be curious to see again, even if years from now, like on a late-night TV showing. In widescreen it is, of course, superior.

I loved how the basic premise- Eastwood leading Bridges, and two others (one George Kennedy in a well-fit villain-type tole) to rob an Armory in a small Montana town after a botched attempt- keeps getting put aside for more of the 'little' things that they come across. For example, how Cimino shows the men getting odd jobs as cover for staking out the area; another filmmaker might just make this a montage, something goofy, but the goofiness here is more replaced by a genuine, though off-kilter, sensibility giving the actors more to work with. Or early on in the scenes establishing Thunderbolt and Lightfoot- somehow it's weird to see how these people would meet, but they're together, and a strange fit.The film isn't great, however the aspirations of what would come in Cimino's later films (for better or likely for worse) are seen here in good light. The dialog is pleasing, if a little 'off' when compared to the performances and cinematography (Lightfoot's dialog especially, not due to Bridges lively performance, is filled with sayings that run their course quick). But what is achieved is a mix of cool, 70's action-movie pathos, with elements more intelligent than would come across elsewhere. Other Eastwood films from the time were just as entertaining, yet sometimes lacking in the originality that comes in many of the scenes in this film. And the climax is a whopper, with one of the most successfully bittersweet endings in 70's cinema. This would be a movie I would be curious to see again, even if years from now, like on a late-night TV showing. In widescreen it is, of course, superior.

I first heard of the film through the documentary 'A Decade Under the Influence and was interested right away via a clip from the 'rabbits in the trunk' scene. When I sought it out and watched it, I was even more impressed (not just the scene, which is a riot from when our leads are picked up by the wild-man, but the film in general). Here is a work over-looked in the much maligned career of Michael Cimino, though also for actors Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. You know things will be going in unexpected turns right from the first sequence- a keeper- in which we're introduced to Eastwood as a Priest, first preaching the sermon, and then on the run right away from a gun-wielding 'old friend'. But what keeps the film alive through a slightly unusual story is that the connection between the two actors is strong, and often in the 'genre' films Eastwood's been in the attention to what goes on can be sometimes made well or broken by his co-star.It's not just the two main actor's personalities put to really good use, but really Cimino's attitude towards the characters in the story.

Years of waiting, and anticipating a very good thriller led to a let-down. Pacino is great, as he nearly always is, but Barkin and Goodman are merely adequate. The suspense is just not there, many scenes are full of trite dialog and just plain silly plot contrivances. Why doesn't Pacino's cop check the new love's fingerprints she left behind? Surely that would have saved a lot of stupid behavior on his part, and he could have pursued his love interest with an honest and open relationship. It doesn't ring true, but then the movie would have no reason to exist had he done that. The Pacino and Goodman characters are just not good detectives. A lot of things real detectives would have done are just left out. Once again, we have to rely upon the great acting of Pacino to carry a film. Worth seeing for just that reason alone.

Harvey is absolutely brilliant, a lovely storyline with a few touching twists, great acting, and just a brilliant atmosphere all around. The one thing that I've always been most afraid of is losing my mind, but by the time I'd seen the first hour of Harvey it completely changed the way I thought about it, and I started considering the possibilities of actually freeing my mind (I'd just watched a documentary on the Fox Network before hand which really made me want to free my mind from the horrible, horrible world we live in!). It made me realise why I look forward to going to sleep and dreaming, and why I dabble in hallucinogenics. Because if you have a brilliant experience that makes you happy, whether its real or not, it's an experience worth having that can be really hugely positive! That aside, I just can't really sum up how... just how nice Harvey is. Elroy, the main character, is the most likable character I've ever seen, and all the tossers and horrible blokes he meets along his way are converted into good blokes just by the pure personality, likability, good spirit and faith in everything that this man presents. Truly brilliant.

Still the movie goes a bit too far at times and becomes utterly ridicules, even for Tim Burton standards.I'm a big fan of Tim Burton's style so this movie certainly is not a disappointment to me. The movie has this typical and unique crazy look that distinct Tim Burton movies from others. There also are some typical, crazy like Tim Burton characters in this movie, such as the main villains (Penguin, Max Shreck) and especially the bizarre red triangle circus gang. The end result of all those odd and unique things combined, works surprising well and entertaining as a movie, that is watchable for all, so you don't really have to be a Tim Burton fan to fully enjoy this movie.The story is very simple and because of that it also gets quite ridicules at times, especially toward the ending with the Penguin when the movie loses most of its credibility. The whole duality between the Bruce Wayne and Batman character is highly underdeveloped in this movie and the character of Bruce Wayne is totally uninteresting in this movie, as is Alfred, who both had some good scene's together in Batman.The new characters in this movie are a welcome addition to the Batman movie franchise. Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito are both wonderful as the new 'villains', whose characters are really deepened out good enough and are quite humane. But there, also at the same time, lies another small problem I had with this movie. The villains weren't stereotypical villainous enough. Christopher Walken just plays a 'normal' businessman and Penguin is more tragic than he is villainous. Oh, well guess I was just expecting another villainous Joker like character(s) in this movie. Also a welcome addition is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is surprising good and believable in her role and she plays a memorable impressive character and not just only memorable because of the way she looks.The action is good and there are some good fight sequences. There also are some good new cool Batmobile tricks in this movie. I really want a Batmobile for Christmas now!The musical score from Danny Elfman is wonderfully present again in this movie which certainly adds to the mood and atmosphere of the movie in a positive way. The good action-editing is from specialist Chris Lebenzon.All to together its a wonderful and good looking action movie, that is very entertaining to watch, time after time without ever loosing any of its power or entertainment value. This is mainly thanks to the new characters that are in this movie and the lively directing from Tim Burton.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"26 December 2005","score":"","review":" Batman Returns is very entertaining as a movie and is professionally made with some big talents both in front and behind the cameras.
