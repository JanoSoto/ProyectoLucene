Kevin Bacon plays a writer just out of college trying to support his newly wedded wife, while at the same time working for some sort of ad agency, and trying to write his first book.  Throughout the movie, it's him narrarating his life from the start of his wedding until the end of the movie...His wife, however, decides that she's ready for a baby.  He on the other hand, does not really get as excited about the idea as she does. The entire movie is set up from his point of view, and he sees the world through his eyes, and a lot of 'what ifs' start to boggle his mind.  His confusion and dry humor make it a great classic, and a great watch for anyone.

The Shining, in my opinion, is quite the opposite - the best adaptation of a King book I've seen and the only one that has aged well, retaining its ability to put one at unease. There are several reasons for this, but two really stand out. One is Nicholson's performance, which may now seem as a standard Jack act but was really the beginning of the seething, satanic anger of characters that he would later play. It is flawless. There is comic detachment in scenes that he really goes insane, but in that comedy lies horror. It is almost as if the character knows it's quietly (and sometimes quite loudly) going insane and finds the fact amusing. Why not go out with a bang? Jack's Jake seems to be thinking, I am loving this demonic liberation. And that's what makes it so unsettling - the ease and joy with which he allows the madness to take over. The other factor is Kubrick's direction, the reason King hated the movie. It is detached, restrained, and not emotional enough (King would complain). Now, while I haven't seen King's version of the Shining (the miniseries), I have read the book which I consider to be one of King's very best. It can be easily argued that Jake's plunge into insanity mirrors King's own personal demons (alcoholism was suggested) and the book depicts it brilliantly. I think Kubrick's film does the same, in a different manner. Since film lacks access to the character's thoughts (unless of course you want to make a movie with continuous narration), this is communicated through atmosphere, which in this case, is dehumanized, desolate and terrifyingly lonely.  Thus, while King may not like it, it is the best he has gotten so far from any director - The Shining is indeed a classic modern horror, an achievement rarely repeated.

It is one of the best movies I've ever watched and definitely my favorite movie that has come out within the last five years.  It's wonderful!  I think that it is not only realistic (in the emotional anxiety the lead character suffers from), but also because it really shows how people can hide their true feelings and keep a smile on their faces, even when they're really feeling like crap on the inside.  Everyone in this movie did such a terrific job.  The only person I felt was not suitable for her role was Jena Malone.  She was great in Stepmom, but not right for this character she tried to portray. However, the lead, Jake Gyllanhaal, really shined.  I have only seen him in two other roles, the first of the two others was, Moonlight Mile, and The Good Girl, in which he also plays a little mentally disturbed. And being an avid Drew Barrymore fan, I felt that this was the best role she had ever been in, as small as it may have been. I was also surprised to learn that she was one of the executive producers to the film.All in all it was a great watch, and I can't wait to watch it with more people to see what their reactions will be.  And in case you don't already know it, a fun piece of trivia is that Jake's sister in the movie, is his real sister in real life too.  Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze were the other two small characters in the film and I thought they were really good.  I'm not a big fan of Swayze's but I thought this was the best role I'd ever seen him in as well. I also thought that the woman who played the annoying teacher, Ms. Farmer, was really good.  She made you hate her so much and she was really good in her role.  She really became her character.Weird, bizzare, and confusing might describe this movie for some, but for me it was beautiful, interesting, funny and really well written and directed.

Look Who's Talking Now is just plain pathetic on the level that it's more for the kids vs. the adults, I think because they found that Look Who's Talking had a children's love as well as an adult's, because it was just all together a great comedy. With Look Who's Talking Now, we have a more family friendly movie with puppies that surprise, surprise talk. Not to mention that the silly plot line that they put in where it seems like the dogs more revolve around the characters instead of the characters we have grown to love.A young cross bred puppy is up for sale and we can hear him talking, he sees Mikey passing by him and begs him to take him home. Mikey however has to hurry past in tow of his mother, and two harsh looking individuals buy the puppy. The puppy manages to escape them and starts his life as a stray. James is a private air pilot working for Samantha, who we see has a crush on him and is always trying to extend the trips to spend more time with him. Mikey tells Santa that he wants a dog for Christmas, James feels the time has come to give Mikey the present he has always wished for and tells his boss Samantha about this. In the meantime, Mollie is a top accountant at her firm but because her salary is so high, she is suddenly fired in order for the firm to save money. Unable to acquire a decent job, Molly gets a job as one of the Elves for the mall Santa for the holiday season. During a visit, Mikey discovers to his horror that that Santa Claus is a fake and becomes upset with disbelief. One day though the dog gets caught by the animal rescue force and taken to a kennel, where several other dogs are kept - presumably also found on the streets. The dog is about to be put to sleep on the same day that James brings Mikey to the kennel to select a dog, overjoyed Mikey bumps into the dog he saw as a pup, and takes an instant liking to him and decides to take him home. When James, Mikey and Rocks the dog get home, they see that Samantha is at their house and has brought over her dog Daphne who is highly trained and she wants James to have it as a present from her. Molly discovers that James had gone and gotten a dog for Mikey without discussing it with them and after a brief argument, they can't take Rocks back to the kennel or he will be put to sleep, and James does not want to offend Samantha by refusing Daphne. And now realize they are stuck with two dogs. And of course these dogs talk as well to narrate the story that Mikey cannot narrate any more.Is Looking Who's Talking Now the worst movie ever? No, not really, it's certainly not terrible, but it's just pointless. It was just a different way of making money off of the franchise. I think that this is a silly movie, but it did have a couple of random laughs here and there, but for the most part it's just silly with the whole story between James and his new boss, Samantha who has a crush on him, more like an obsessive crush where she just throws herself at him, maybe she saw those Welcome Back, Kotter episodes one too many times and was in love with Vinnie Barbarino. But anyways, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to too many people, more for the really young kids who just wanna see really cute puppies, that's about it. This movie doesn't have much to offer except for&#x85; puppy love! Oh, you know I had to make a lame joke.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2004","score":"20 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":" OK, yes, I do think we are all a little sick of the Look Who's Talking sequels, even though I did enjoy Look Who's Talking Too, it was just taking a really great concept and not putting the effort into it.

And now realize they are stuck with two dogs. And of course these dogs talk as well to narrate the story that Mikey cannot narrate any more.Is Looking Who's Talking Now the worst movie ever? No, not really, it's certainly not terrible, but it's just pointless. It was just a different way of making money off of the franchise. I think that this is a silly movie, but it did have a couple of random laughs here and there, but for the most part it's just silly with the whole story between James and his new boss, Samantha who has a crush on him, more like an obsessive crush where she just throws herself at him, maybe she saw those Welcome Back, Kotter episodes one too many times and was in love with Vinnie Barbarino. But anyways, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to too many people, more for the really young kids who just wanna see really cute puppies, that's about it.

Look Who's Talking Now is just plain pathetic on the level that it's more for the kids vs. the adults, I think because they found that Look Who's Talking had a children's love as well as an adult's, because it was just all together a great comedy. With Look Who's Talking Now, we have a more family friendly movie with puppies that surprise, surprise talk. Not to mention that the silly plot line that they put in where it seems like the dogs more revolve around the characters instead of the characters we have grown to love.A young cross bred puppy is up for sale and we can hear him talking, he sees Mikey passing by him and begs him to take him home. Mikey however has to hurry past in tow of his mother, and two harsh looking individuals buy the puppy. The puppy manages to escape them and starts his life as a stray. James is a private air pilot working for Samantha, who we see has a crush on him and is always trying to extend the trips to spend more time with him. Mikey tells Santa that he wants a dog for Christmas, James feels the time has come to give Mikey the present he has always wished for and tells his boss Samantha about this. In the meantime, Mollie is a top accountant at her firm but because her salary is so high, she is suddenly fired in order for the firm to save money. Unable to acquire a decent job, Molly gets a job as one of the Elves for the mall Santa for the holiday season. During a visit, Mikey discovers to his horror that that Santa Claus is a fake and becomes upset with disbelief.

An old man Paddy (Leo McKern) takes care of them teaching them how to survive in the wilds.  He dies soon after and they are left by themselves.  Years later they grow into Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins.  They discover each other, have sex, a kid etc etc etc. Silly movie.  When it came out in 1980 it was trashed by critics worldwide.  They called it kiddie porn (due to the frequent nude shots of Atkins and Shields' double) and lashed out at the stars and director Randal Kleiser.  However, the public LOVED this and it was a huge box office smash.  My guess is people just went in to see handsome, buff Atkins and Shields' double nude (there's a LOT of frontal nudity here), and maybe the cinematography.  There's nothing else here!The story is virtually nonexistent and, to be nice, Shields and Atkins can't ACT!  Atkins is actually worse than Shields--hard to believe but true.  Also their constant whining and bickering got annoying.  Also they look suspiciously healthy and in GREAT shape after being abandoned for so long.  It gets really silly when they discover sex leading to some hilarious soft-core sequences.  However, nothing is really shown.  My favorite scene has got to be when Shields has the baby.  She goes into a dark forest, screams a few times...and they carry out a clean, dry, healthy baby.  SHEEESH!!!!  They also make bringing up a baby look like loads of fun.  This movie was risky at the time for dealing with sex between teenagers (Shields was 15, Atkins was 19) but it's so far from reality nobody took this too seriously.The cinematography (a deserved Oscar nominee) by Nestor Almendros is just gorgeous.  THAT'S what kept me watching--some of the shots take your breath away.  Also there's a pretty good (if monotomous ) score by Basil Poledouris.  But director Kleiser's only concern seems to be to show as much nudity as he possibly can get in an R rated film.  This got by with it because most of the nudity is very casual and the two of them DO have great bodies!So, if you're not offended by that and you want to see some truly beautiful scenery, tune in. Just ignore the acting and hilarious leaps of reality.  In the right frame of mind, you could probably find this all a laugh a minute.  I'd love to know what Atkins and Shields think of this now.

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w\/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable&#133;we can relate to her.  As Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover\/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen.  There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much&#133;just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.'  He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.

As the personalities clash we see that Denzel Washington is an evil dude without a redeeming quality.  The movie is an interesting adventure through the bad parts of LA.The personality clash is incredible to say the least as we see the idealistic Ethan Hawke definitely at conflict with the crooked Denzel Washington.  The movie has some very good moments and two very good performances from the leads and nice appearances from many character actors, like Macy Gray, Tom Berenger and a number of others you really don't expect.  But the movie does not really say anything, there is no real socially conscious message it is just an action movie.  Therefore in a decent role, but definitely not in an Oscar-worthy performance Denzel Washington did not deserve an Oscar for this part.  He plays a crooked cop the best that he can in a movie that is really not meant to have any great roles.In fact Denzel Washington plays a stereotype of what many people in the media portray African-Americans today.  With so many other straight action movies and far better performances this year (including a non-nominated performance by Billy Bob Thornton in Monster's Ball)  I don't think Washington deserved his Oscar.The movie does get intense as we see a very driven and disgusting man get the best of Ethan Hawke and everyone else in the movie.  Watching Washington's psychological game is quite incredible, and definitely one of the highlights of the movie.  The finale is very good, but a little on the predictable and unbelievable side.

As the personalities clash we see that Denzel Washington is an evil dude without a redeeming quality.  The movie is an interesting adventure through the bad parts of LA.The personality clash is incredible to say the least as we see the idealistic Ethan Hawke definitely at conflict with the crooked Denzel Washington.  The movie has some very good moments and two very good performances from the leads and nice appearances from many character actors, like Macy Gray, Tom Berenger and a number of others you really don't expect.  But the movie does not really say anything, there is no real socially conscious message it is just an action movie.  Therefore in a decent role, but definitely not in an Oscar-worthy performance Denzel Washington did not deserve an Oscar for this part.  He plays a crooked cop the best that he can in a movie that is really not meant to have any great roles.In fact Denzel Washington plays a stereotype of what many people in the media portray African-Americans today.  With so many other straight action movies and far better performances this year (including a non-nominated performance by Billy Bob Thornton in Monster's Ball)  I don't think Washington deserved his Oscar.The movie does get intense as we see a very driven and disgusting man get the best of Ethan Hawke and everyone else in the movie.

Never heard of it before, but it seemed interesting.Point is, I loved it to the point of even recording it and recommending it to my friends.  I was in the rave scene during the mid 90's, when the likes of Scooter, Faithless, Robert Miles, Mark 'Oh and many others were at their peak.I truly enjoyed this movie and felt I was there the whole night. This movie is definitely not meant for anyone, much less for those who still don't understand what indie films are about. This was certainly not Arakki or Aranofsky, but I have to commend director Greg Harrison for this piece of work.This movie starts with the sound of a modem connecting to the internet... sooooo 1998! It was funny.  Then you see all these fast stories about weirdos and their lives.The plot was definitely secondary in this movie. I could not care less about Leyla, or Colin, or whoever... But I guess that wasn't exactly the point.Although the party was somewhat different from what I used to go to, its structure was basically the same Clandestine party, where you need maps and bribe a few guys to know exactly where you're going; the different levels of music throughout the night, from slow-beat clubhouse to orgasmic trance; the amount of drugs, the doped people, the escape from it all.There were pointless scenes, like those gay guys trying to get to the party (there was already a gay moment between Colin and that masseuse guy.. poor Harmony!). I recognized Rachel True, the gorgeous girl from The Craft, I had no idea she was on this.I agree with the one who commented that John Digweed would never play in a party like this.. Actually I laughed when he made his cameo... So what was next? Tiesto? Johan Gielen? Paul Oakenfold?This movie was also a reflect of how these parties were about 5-10 years ago. Yes, the electronic scene has become much more commercial, specially in Holland and Belgium.  I guess that it's not so special to me anymore, now that virtually everyone has discovered it.And yes, once the party got busted, there's no way they would have gotten away with starting it again!When the party is over, the movie is over, leaving the viewer with the SAME FEELING most ravers had when leaving...

So I checked out the first page of comments about this movie and I was embarrassed to see such biased and unintelligent comments. Thus, I had to write my ownDWMC is solely a comedy. If you're looking for anything else, you will be disappointed by this film. I would classify it as guy humour, but the voting breakdown here would disagree with me, so I'll try to be more specific. This is not a romantic comedy. While the main characters, Jesse and Chester, obviously care about their girlfriends, they have no epiphanies about love and will only serve as bad examples for boyfriends worldwide.DWMC has also been described as a silly comedy. I would agree with that assessment. To me, Jesse and Chester are Larry and Curly without Moe. The movie also seems like it was written around a bunch of funny skits, which were then tied together with a plot of some kind. What does this mean? Well, it translates to no comedic downtime. Everything you see is either a joke or a setup for a joke (which will be revealed very quickly). Granted, the plot gets a little far-fetched in order to deal with the wide range of skits, but if you approach this film prepared to enjoy a silly comedy, the plot will not bother you.I won't bother to give a complete run-down on the plot, as I said, it's not too important. One thing I will mention is that in essence this is a movie about two best friends bonding through crazy adventures. This is probably the aspect of the film that appeals to me the most and transforms it from a funny film to a great movie I can watch over and over again. By writing this review, I just want to give a true account of this film so that those who would also like this film will not be scared away by reading the reviews. Here it is, plain and simpleIf you like Mr. Bean, the Three Stooges, or Monty Python, chances are you will love this movie. If you yearn for the old days of Saturday Night Live, you will enjoy this movie. If you would still like the Simpsons if they removed the social commentary, you would like this move. If your favourite movie is Life as a House, then don't waste your time with DWMC, you'll probably hate it. Either way, if you are going to watch this movie, be prepared for something silly and be sure to rent the movie and not settle for the TV version.

I love this movie so much! I will never get tired of watching it.  My favorite genre is most definitely horror to begin with, and so for me this movie was perfect, because it's not the cheesy, Prom Night (which is ironically mentioned in this movie), that never scares you and all it's focused on is big breasts and naked girls in the locker room.  It's better than that...it actually has a plot and a story to it (contrary to what Scary Movie may say about it.).  Neve Campbell, in my opinion is one of the worst actresses to ever hit the movie screen, and they could have done a lot better casting for her role.  Matthew Lillard is gorgeous and I want him, although all the other girls seem to have a thing for Skeet Ulrich, who was very good in the movie, but not really the cutest guy who could have played, Billy.  Rose McGowen was extremely funny and although I don't care for her in real life she did a fantastic job in this film and should receive more credit for it. Courtney Cox is also probably one of my favorite characters in this.  She's so funny and she's not even supossed to be.  The anamosity between her and her cameraman is laugh out loud hysterical most times and the friction between her and Neve, and the sexual tension between her and David Arquette is hilarious in itself as well.The inside stuff is the best part too.  There are so many things that I still pick up when I'm watching it.  For instance, one of the last scenes of the movie, Jamie Kennedy is sitting on a couch watching Holloween with Jamie Lee Curtis, and while the killer is standing behind him, he's saying aloud to himself, Look behind you, Jamie, behind you!  It's pretty funny stuff.Great lines and humor while the first time you see it, if you're not used to these Teen Screams, may be scary, but after the first time it's just like watching a comedy. Not a You've Got Mail, thank God, but definitely lighter than some horror movies. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and can't wait to see it again!That is the end of my review.
