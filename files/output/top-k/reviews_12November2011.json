Whilst the film was not a success at the time it has become a cult classic and after 28 years a sequel was released.Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is a skilled software engineer and arcade owner who attempts to hack into ENCOM's computers to retrieve evidence that the company executive Ed Dillinger (David Warner) had stolen his computer games codes. Dillinger himself runs a programme called Master Control (voiced by Warner) and uses it to commit corporate espionage and he Dillinger discontinues the TRON programme that could act as a third party watch on other programs. But Master Control has gone rogue and starts to hack into the Pentagon and Kremlin.Flynn and his friends Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan) break into ENCOM so Flynn could straight into the system, but Master Control uses a experimental laser to teleport the man into the digital world. In this new world Flynn not only has to survive in the computer but also has to stop Master Control.TRON was made at a time when computer games and home computing was starting to grown and the film makers wanted to tap into that. It was also a time of growing paranoia about the grown computers, Wargames was only released a year later. Ideas in TRON seem to be an influence or at a coincidence in other films, TV shows and comics, such as The Terminator, The Matrix, Digimon being ones on the top of my head. The design for Master Control was also very similar to VIKI in I, Robot, who also have similar plans.The big selling point of the film is the visuals. The scenes in the real world are shot much like other sci-fi of them. There are some dark scenes in offices, the arcade and the cityscape, but there are also bright, well light scenes in the sterile environment in the labs. But it is the computer world scenes we are most interested in and it is basically what would it be like in a 1980s arcade game. It was both dark and black, with bright colours all around. The director Steven Lisberger certainly used what was new technology to its fullest and he made a fast paced film with grand set pieces. The beginning of the film also reminded of some fantasy, Master Control being like an evil ruler or wizard, rounding people up, torturing people and even threatens his own people.The film also reminded me of a childish idea I used to have that all computing is interlinked, including computer games and many basic things that are electronic. But obviously I outgrown that idea and this was a film where ideas of computing and the internet were at a very early stage.Bridges plays cocky man who is incredibly skilled but can also rub people the wrong way. He had good interplay with Boxleitner, both having a love triangle and being antagonistic towards each other despite being one the same side. Warner too gives Dillinger some depth because he is shocked that Master Control has developed his own consciousness and blackmails him, fearing what machine could do with high politics. Also Boxleitner and Warner also made sure they were playing different characters from one the in the real world to the ones in the character.I have to say some of the plot elements are a bit predictable and it was simply a quest film, but they has been much worst and stupid ideas been put to film.Overall, TRON is enjoyable I think an overall IMDb rating of 7.2\/7.3 would be fair.

Being a big fan of John McNaughton's film, I approached the 1996 sequel with some excitement, and natural trepidation. It looked bad for a number of reasons.... for starters, Rooker wasn't reprising his role as Henry. And needless to say, McNaughton wasn't to be at the helm. But nevertheless, I watched it, and I was quite surprised. It's a long shot off the first film, but nevertheless, it is enjoyable and although Neil Giutoli had been given an impossible task of matching Rooker's performance, he still managed to shadow his performance well and was quite good. The sequel takes off where the original ended, with Henry at large and on the run. He is homeless, but is still randomly killing people. It's not until he finds a job working at a portable toilet company that he finds some stable work and money, and he moves in with Kai - a co-worker - and his family. These people are thrash, and Henry fits in just perfectly with them. Kai's wife's niece also lives in the house, a very shy and geeky artist with suicidal tendencies. She takes a liking to Henry that later turns into dangerous obsession. Meanwhile, Henry is approached by Kai to do a little extra 'work' with him. This involves them burning down sleazy properties for insurance scams, and Kai turns out to be some sort of pyromaniac... and needless to say, Henry starts killing while out on these late shifts, and it isn't long before he has Kai doing the same thing. OK, even from reading that I know many people would be turning their noses up and calling it a blatant insult\/rip-off of the original. That it nearly is, but I was willing to look beyond that and just enjoy the film as it's own. This was never going to brilliant... as the original is notorious for just being a film about three characters sitting around a scummy apartment drinking, and two of them just happen to pop out every night and kill someone. It was so simple, yet extremely effective and almost authentic looking. The plot here has a bit more flesh added onto it, and there's a lot more going on. But it doesn't make it anymore scary or shocking, it just improves it as a whole in terms of being its own film. Giutoli is far from intimidating... he stands at no more than 56 and he lacks all the power and intensity of Rooker in the original. The violence is plentiful as there are a few beatings, a decapitation and numerous stabbings as well as a neck break (The one thing that makes me squirm!). The story leaves a lot to be desired, as it seems to just repeat the trend of the original where Henry bumps into scumbags like himself and is able to manipulate them to kill and brutalise people. This disturbing trait is evident here - as is the idea of just going out and murdering someone because you've had a bad day which was possibly one of the biggest things that made the original film make such a huge impact. Henry kills just as apathetically here, and as usual, makes sure that everything goes his way. So is it a good sequel? Yes; because it could have been a whole lot worse. Director Chuck Parello manages to remain faithful to the original in maintaining the taut and tense atmosphere, however, that been said, it's still a long pitch off the original - as it lacks the power and intensity, and part of that is just down to the absence of Rooker.

I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.Citizen Kane is about a man named Charles Foster Kane who is a US newspaper magnate. I will not delve into the plot because that is not the purpose of the movie. Rather it is a character study on Kane and it is also a tragedy for we see how Kane's life not only slowly disintegrates to its inevitable conclusion, but also we see how his life ended up as it is.There has been a lot of discussion over the precise meaning of Rosebud, the word that he mutters on his deathbed. At the end of the movie we discover that Rosebud is the name of his sleigh, and we see this as it is thrown into the fire. A journalist spends the entire movie trying to find out the meaning of Rosebud, but he fails to do so, walking out of Kane's manor, Xanadu, behind a huge amount of possessions packed away in boxes. We learn that the answer to the Rosebud question is an insignificant item amongst all of these meaningless possessions.What does Rosebud mean? It may be the name of the sleigh, but what does it really mean. I guess to answer that question we must look at what Kane had, and what he did not have. At the beginning of the movie we are told all about Kane, or what the media knew of it, but as we follow the journalist we slowly come to learn more about the more intimate and personal period's of Kane's life. We are allowed into Kane's personal space and into his mind to try and understand how he thinks, and by doing that we are given clues as to why he mentioned Rosebud.Charles Foster Kane was incredibly rich, having almost everything that he could want. Xanadu, his palace in which he died, was a tribute to his wealth. The palace was not finished, but that only says something minor about his character which I will not address. What I wish to draw out of that is that Xanadu represents his wealth and his ability to claim whatever possession that he wants. I use the word possession because there are three things in the movie that his money cannot buy the presidency, love, and his childhood. The presidency is a minor thing, and love becomes more important after his first divorce. It is important because he uses his money to make his second wife famous, but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him. He dies in bed a lonely man.I believe that the major thing that Charles Foster Kane could not buy was his childhood, and we see evidence of this throughout the film, and tied together at the end where we see his sleigh, Rosebud, burning in the fire. His actions and his attitudes all show signs of a little boy trapped in the body of a man, trapped since the days he was sent off to boarding school.The first instance is when Kane's mother decides to send Charles Foster Kane away. His father is against this, but his mother is adamant that Kane has a good education. When Kane learns of this his first reaction is to lash out at Thatcher, his trustee, with his sleigh. For the rest of his life he hated Thatcher with a passion. He refused to listen to him, and made his job incredibly difficult. Even though he was sent to the best schools, he reacted violently against them and was never able to last long. In the end he purchases a Newspaper because it seems like a good idea.He hated Thatcher because Thatcher was the man that stole Kane's childhood. When Kane came of age he was able to dissolve the trust, and as such remove Thatcher from his life. He reaction to the schools is his hatred of having his childhood stolen from him, and the newspaper was him trying to reclaim the childhood that he had lost. In the end he is too old to live out a childhood, but tries to anyway.The final thing that I wish to discuss is the reaction by Randolf Hurst against this film. It is a reaction that I really do not understand because I do not see Kane as an unflattering character. My friend described Kane as being a real and a repulsive character. I did not find him that repulsive, rather rash and unthinking. He actions which lost him the presidency was not due to any immorality, but rather due to lies fostered by his opponents. The divorce of his first wife is never explored, and it is doubtful that it was because of this because she knew the truth. Maybe it is because she did not really love him, but because she loved the fact that one day he might be president.

At the beginning of the movie we are told all about Kane, or what the media knew of it, but as we follow the journalist we slowly come to learn more about the more intimate and personal period's of Kane's life. We are allowed into Kane's personal space and into his mind to try and understand how he thinks, and by doing that we are given clues as to why he mentioned Rosebud.Charles Foster Kane was incredibly rich, having almost everything that he could want. Xanadu, his palace in which he died, was a tribute to his wealth. The palace was not finished, but that only says something minor about his character which I will not address. What I wish to draw out of that is that Xanadu represents his wealth and his ability to claim whatever possession that he wants. I use the word possession because there are three things in the movie that his money cannot buy the presidency, love, and his childhood. The presidency is a minor thing, and love becomes more important after his first divorce. It is important because he uses his money to make his second wife famous, but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him. He dies in bed a lonely man.I believe that the major thing that Charles Foster Kane could not buy was his childhood, and we see evidence of this throughout the film, and tied together at the end where we see his sleigh, Rosebud, burning in the fire. His actions and his attitudes all show signs of a little boy trapped in the body of a man, trapped since the days he was sent off to boarding school.The first instance is when Kane's mother decides to send Charles Foster Kane away. His father is against this, but his mother is adamant that Kane has a good education. When Kane learns of this his first reaction is to lash out at Thatcher, his trustee, with his sleigh. For the rest of his life he hated Thatcher with a passion. He refused to listen to him, and made his job incredibly difficult. Even though he was sent to the best schools, he reacted violently against them and was never able to last long. In the end he purchases a Newspaper because it seems like a good idea.He hated Thatcher because Thatcher was the man that stole Kane's childhood. When Kane came of age he was able to dissolve the trust, and as such remove Thatcher from his life. He reaction to the schools is his hatred of having his childhood stolen from him, and the newspaper was him trying to reclaim the childhood that he had lost. In the end he is too old to live out a childhood, but tries to anyway.The final thing that I wish to discuss is the reaction by Randolf Hurst against this film. It is a reaction that I really do not understand because I do not see Kane as an unflattering character. My friend described Kane as being a real and a repulsive character. I did not find him that repulsive, rather rash and unthinking. He actions which lost him the presidency was not due to any immorality, but rather due to lies fostered by his opponents. The divorce of his first wife is never explored, and it is doubtful that it was because of this because she knew the truth. Maybe it is because she did not really love him, but because she loved the fact that one day he might be president.

I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.Citizen Kane is about a man named Charles Foster Kane who is a US newspaper magnate. I will not delve into the plot because that is not the purpose of the movie. Rather it is a character study on Kane and it is also a tragedy for we see how Kane's life not only slowly disintegrates to its inevitable conclusion, but also we see how his life ended up as it is.There has been a lot of discussion over the precise meaning of Rosebud, the word that he mutters on his deathbed. At the end of the movie we discover that Rosebud is the name of his sleigh, and we see this as it is thrown into the fire. A journalist spends the entire movie trying to find out the meaning of Rosebud, but he fails to do so, walking out of Kane's manor, Xanadu, behind a huge amount of possessions packed away in boxes. We learn that the answer to the Rosebud question is an insignificant item amongst all of these meaningless possessions.What does Rosebud mean? It may be the name of the sleigh, but what does it really mean. I guess to answer that question we must look at what Kane had, and what he did not have.

I have heard that he is a well known director with a unique style, but as I have not seen any of his films, I cannot comment on it; but if they are anything like Casino then so far I am impressed. I heard of Martin Scorsesee not from watching movies but from a Alternate band named King Missile (known for a song which they wrote about as certain part of the male anatomy that a person was able to remove, and then ended up losing, and finding it again and having to fork out $20 to buy it back - weird group). I will not go into the details of what their song was about and what they wanted to do to Martin Scorsesee even though they said that he made the best films.Casino is a movie about people and about how that begin with everything and end with nothing. The movie is based around Sam (Robert DeNiro) who is made the director of a Casino by the mafia. His childhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) comes to Las Vegas to apply his business - thuggery - to the town almost untouched by thugs. It is set in a time when the gangs ruled Las Vegas and gambling was a game of skill, and enticing people out of their money was done by the way one arranges their poker machines. The conclusion shows us that those days are passed as now the corporations own Las Vegas and the casinos only exist if their theme is worth it.As I said earlier the movie is about people, and to explore the movie we must explore the people and the relationships that they have with each other. There are three main characters and they are Sam, Nicky, and Ginger. Sam and Nicky do not change where as Ginger does. This is important because the Ginger and Nicky claim that Sam has changed, but this is differential to the nobility of his character. One might ask how can Sam be noble when there is no honour among thieves? Well, in this time there is honour and this honour his held at the point of the gun. There is a way that the mafia does things and if people don't do what the mafia tells you then you will find yourself buried in a hole in the middle of a corn field. Yet the problem with this honour is that it works on the assumption that might means right, meaning that once somebodies power exceeds your own then either you comply or suffer the consequences.Sam's character is the central character. He is clean, an spends the whole movie clean. He is a man that does not take risks, he only takes certainties. As is said at the beginning of the movie, he is a man that when he makes a bet, the entire bookmaking industry changes. As such he is the perfect man for a casino because he knows how to make money. Now he has a record in illegal gambling so it is difficult to get him into a casino, but as long as you treat the authorities in Las Vegas okay, then they won't happen you - the minute you step over the line and upset somebody, then they can put the pressure upon you.As I said before, Sam does not take chances. He is a man that runs everything his way. He is obsessed that everything runs smoothly. He does not pay people to think because their thoughts are not his thoughts and they don't know how to work the people and the floor. The example is the poker machines. He puts the big jackpot machines in plain view rather than hiding them. Hiding them keeps people away and as such they don't run the risk of hitting the big jackpot, but having them in plain view brings more people to them so that they waste more money trying to win the big jackpot. Of course his obsessiveness with things running his way is very much a flaw, as he wants to always know where his wife is, and this leads to distrust and finally to the breakdown in their marriage. It was not all his fault as he tried to marry a woman who was not meant to be married and it ended up destroying him and her. The blueberry muffin affair is another instance where is compulsiveness goes overboard.Casino is about power and the question of who really rules. In one way we see that the mafia rules Vegas from the east, while on the other hand, the authorities are so corrupt that they let them, yet if you upset the authorities then they can and will tighten their fist. Or is it the king of the thugs - Nicky - who rules. It seems like he does, but in the end he only finds himself in a pit in a cornfield.

I would also say that this is an almost perfect example of the genre but let me put some more emphasis on the word almost.Honestly, you could you not like this movie? It's cheerful, colorful and very charming. It's set in great colorful environments, features a sort of simple, no-worries type of story (untill its final 30 minutes) and some great and very memorable songs. It's a movie that can really lift your mood while watching it.To me this actually seems like a movie that can best be seen on the large silver screen. The nature environments, the sets, the colors, the camera-work, it all deserves to be seen on a large screen and it will make the movie no doubt look even better than it already does on an average sized television. There are still plenty of screening every year, so if you get the opportunity I really would recommend you to see this movie on the silver screen.Yes, it's a long sit, since the movie is almost 3 hours long but the movie is definitely worth it. It still is a bit odd to me though, that no matter how long the movie is, its ending still feels very rushed. Seriously, the whole WW II aspects got hardly mentioned at all in the first 2 hours of the movie and then boom! Suddenly there is a war going on. There is no real good build-up to it in its story, which in my opinion seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. The final 30 minutes feel really crammed in and rushed. Besides, in my opinion the movie never really reaches a fully satisfying conclusion. It still leaves a lot of questions open and has some loose ends in it, as if they were perhaps expecting to make a sequel to this movie some day.But this is not the only problem I had with the second half of the movie. I was really liking the movie for its cheerful atmosphere and uplifting story and characters but I did not at all see it's love story coming up. To me there was absolutely nothing at all that indicated that Maria and Captain Von Trapp were falling for each other and that these two persons were meant to be together. I was actually quite happy about it that for a change this looked to be a musical in which the two main characters wouldn't fall in love with each other. It pretty much came out of nowhere for me and it just didn't seemed to be something that this movie and its story needed.No complaints about the acting obviously. It still is Julie Andrews' most iconic and memorable role and Christopher Plummer also did a pretty good job. You probably wouldn't had recognized him, since he's still so very young and different looking in this movie. Can't also really complain about the child cast, though I should say that's its just a bit odd that none of the children really look alike. The one has blond hair and blue eyes, while the other dark hair with brown eyes. None of them really look they could be brothers or sisters in real life. But of course I understand that it would had been quite hard to find 7, singing, dancing and acting children, that also all look alike as well.With this movie Robert Wise once more showed his amazing versatility and talent as a director. Seriously, is there any genre this guy hasn't worked in? He of course had some practice already, with his other much acclaimed musical West Side Story. But even when looking at just these two movies you'll notice how much different they actually are in its style and approach. Again, also this really shows how incredibly versatility and talented as a director Robert Wise was.All in all this remains a nearly perfect musical movie, that despite all my criticism of it, really remains a great and truly enjoyable watch.8\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2011","score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Most people are afraid to admit it but The Sound of Music remains one of the best and most classic musical movies ever made.

It still is a bit odd to me though, that no matter how long the movie is, its ending still feels very rushed. Seriously, the whole WW II aspects got hardly mentioned at all in the first 2 hours of the movie and then boom! Suddenly there is a war going on. There is no real good build-up to it in its story, which in my opinion seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. The final 30 minutes feel really crammed in and rushed. Besides, in my opinion the movie never really reaches a fully satisfying conclusion. It still leaves a lot of questions open and has some loose ends in it, as if they were perhaps expecting to make a sequel to this movie some day.But this is not the only problem I had with the second half of the movie. I was really liking the movie for its cheerful atmosphere and uplifting story and characters but I did not at all see it's love story coming up. To me there was absolutely nothing at all that indicated that Maria and Captain Von Trapp were falling for each other and that these two persons were meant to be together. I was actually quite happy about it that for a change this looked to be a musical in which the two main characters wouldn't fall in love with each other. It pretty much came out of nowhere for me and it just didn't seemed to be something that this movie and its story needed.No complaints about the acting obviously. It still is Julie Andrews' most iconic and memorable role and Christopher Plummer also did a pretty good job. You probably wouldn't had recognized him, since he's still so very young and different looking in this movie. Can't also really complain about the child cast, though I should say that's its just a bit odd that none of the children really look alike. The one has blond hair and blue eyes, while the other dark hair with brown eyes. None of them really look they could be brothers or sisters in real life. But of course I understand that it would had been quite hard to find 7, singing, dancing and acting children, that also all look alike as well.With this movie Robert Wise once more showed his amazing versatility and talent as a director. Seriously, is there any genre this guy hasn't worked in? He of course had some practice already, with his other much acclaimed musical West Side Story. But even when looking at just these two movies you'll notice how much different they actually are in its style and approach. Again, also this really shows how incredibly versatility and talented as a director Robert Wise was.All in all this remains a nearly perfect musical movie, that despite all my criticism of it, really remains a great and truly enjoyable watch.8\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Family"},{"date":"12 November 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 212First of all I saw the silent version on TCM.

It is important to realize what the world was like when this was made. The Great War had ended only 12 years ago, and WWII had not occurred, and in 1930 it wasn't even really on anyone's horizon. 1929 was the start of the Great Depression, and when this film was made. It was also the time when silent films transitioned into talkies. This film was a big gamble- tough topic, big budget, large cast, and it all paid off.'All Quiet' is a visual representation of Grade 10 History. Everything I learned about WWI is present in this film propaganda at home, peer pressure, poor, unexpected conditions, trenches, mud, loss but this was new to the people of 1930. So while a viewer now won't be so shocked, they would've been 80 years ago. But 'All Quiet' nails the visual aspect of life in the War.We follow a group of German schoolboys, as they sign up and find out about the horror of war. Through the first half, they are a collective, but eventually the film focuses on Paul. Lew Ayres crafted a character that affected his life. We see a boy become a man, and then the shell of a man.I found some sections to be a tad over-dramatic, like the hospital scene with the boots. It just went on and on, and it didn't help there was lots of dialogue and few cards of words.But 'All Quiet' is best, and most heart-wrenching when everyone stops talking and we see battle. The first real fight we see, after days of shelling, is one of the most nauseating fights ever. And for its time, easily the most violent. The massive scale, the incredibly accurate battlefield, the sheer number of men- it's unbelievable. Seeing the machine gunner mowing down people in a single camera shot, seeing a man disappear with only his hands attached to wire- it's downright upsetting and one of the most epic battles ever. No amount of talk can emphasize a message like dramatic reenactments of trench warfare. And then, when the allies jump into the trenches, the guns go away, the bayonets go away- and the shovels come out. I hate to make this comparison, but Saving Private Ryan wouldn't be possible without this film to pave the way.Some may be turned off by its age, but 'All Quiet' is one of the earliest essential films, and maybe the earliest essential war film. It absolutely deserves its accolades. The message, always relevant, and the ending, always shattering, create an amazing tragic drama that is a very important viewing. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 212First of all I saw the silent version on TCM.

Rozenthal does a fine job as the director.If the film has any flaws, it's that Jamie Lee Curtis's hair is noticeable as a wig, and Carpenter's music, with some assistance from Alan Howarth, is more 80's and not as simplistically disturbing as the original 1978 score. But otherwise, I enjoyed Halloween II thoroughly. With it, and the 8 films that followed, the Michael Myers mythology stays alive, and is plenty scary. This sequel carves deep, like a knife penetrating a smiling pumpkin. ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"12 November 2011","score":"","review":" Ya wanna come inside? - Rocky. No, I gotta go. - Adrian. I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom. - Rocky.Rocky does many things right, but one of the biggest things it does exceptionally well is the dialog it packs in. The wit and humor is subtle but necessary in telling this particular story, and it only helps when a little ray of sunlight is shed on a premise so serious.What can be said about the 1976 film Rocky that hasn't already been said countless times before? That's the greatest challenge in reviewing classics, personally. When I reviewed National Lampoon's Animal House, I found myself often pausing for a long period of time or getting up and walking around contemplating what else to say. Was that it? Only five paragraphs? Surely a film so monumental deserves more than just five paragraphs.But I digress. It's difficult to review a film that has been seen by everyone, and for you yourself to try and write something unique and fresh about a film so cherished without sounding pretentious is quite a difficult task. Rocky tells the emotional and inspiring parable of an underdog fighter nicknamed The Italian Stallion (Stallone) who is thirty and broke, living in the slums getting his face and body beat to hell for barely any money. He forms a relationship with a nerdy pet-shop employee named Adrian (Shire), and is given the opportunity of a lifetime to fight against champion fighter Apollo Creed (Weathers).Motivated by Adrian, and trained by her brother Paulie (Young), Rocky continues to become more confident in his abilities but at times faces a dark sense of realism that he might not be able to take on the champion. Rocky's training sequence is occupied by the instantly recognizable and famed theme song of the film that only adds to the emotion in the film.The character Rocky is effortlessly likable and as charismatic as any movie hero should be. What makes him so likable is his persistency and his devotion to becoming more than an underdog, but a true winner in the ring and in life. He's thirty, down and out in Philly, and knows he can do better. Adrian and Paulie prove it to him.Consider the impact of the scene where Rocky climbs up The Philadelphia Museum of Art staircase to the Rocky theme song. When he finally gets to the top he runs around in circles while repeatedly throwing his arms up in satisfaction. Combined with the music, a fantastic feature to the film, it only assists a great scene and proves that even simple training sequences can be brought to full effect. The scene has spawned numerous other people imitating the event, and a Stallone statue was even placed at the top of the staircase years after.When we get to the actual fight we are fully immersed in the story. It doesn't seem like a film anymore, but the fight itself might as well be a real-life Pay-Per-View event on Television. We've spent so much time with the character Rocky, and so little time away from him it's not that we can't help but love him, but truly want to see him triumph over Creed. Actor and writer Sylvester Stallone went around parading the script of Rocky to numerous studios and was turned down multiple times. Mainly because no one really knew how it would turnout. When you think about it, Rocky was one of the first, if not the first, dramatic boxing film released. Expectations were uncertain, but it soon became one of the most successful films in history grossing over $225 million against a $1 million budget. Stallone went on to make five sequels, and has been remembered for his role as the lovable boxer for years. Decades later it still holds up. And Rocky is still one of the most loved and respected underdogs ever filmed. Starring Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Directed by John G. Alvidsen.

I don't particularly like either and I'd hate to become one too.The Third Man has a fantastic premise. Plenty of great twists and turns with fine performances from Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, but in my opinion, I don't think that this noir story stands out or is all that great anyway.Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not too keen on several plot holes and inconsistencies. First off, we don't know who the real Third Man is. Harry Lime? Or someone else? Maybe that's supposed to be the beauty of it and I'm not getting it, but I don't like it at all. Second, the shop owner was killed all of a sudden when he was about to give out information. Harry Lime? Or again, someone else?

Then she finds out the atrocities he's committed, and further cements her decision that she is better off living with someone like Holly instead of Lime. In fact, who can't help but dislike Lime for the things he had done? But in the end, she ends up hating everyone around her for setting him up for his death.

It belongs to Father Malone's grandfather, and tells how he and the other five founding members of the town caused a ship called Elizabeth Dane to crash, and then plundered it. They planned to open a leper colony, but all of the crew on board were killed. And now a strange fog has begins to creep upon the town, carrying with it a ghostly ship. Three fishermen are killed by sword-wielding spirits, and it soon becomes clear that the crew of the Elizabeth Dane are back to claim six lives for themselves.As mentioned by Marc in his review of John Carpenter's most recent film, The Ward (2010), Carpenter's career is a very mixed bag. Made during his early heyday, The Fog was produced on a low-budget, and contains the same kind of style and atmosphere that we saw in the excellent Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and Halloween (1978). It's not his best film by any means, but The Fog has become an almost classic in the horror genre. To my surprise, (as other reviews I had read told me otherwise) The Fog is very good, and although isn't ground-breaking like Halloween, or as damn cool as Escape from New York (1981), or even as inspired as The Thing (1982), but it is certainly eerie, and has that 1980's feel to it that the likes of Carpenter and David Cronenberg made their own.The premise of it is certainly silly. It's the time of thing you would read in an old collection of horror stories, and see in a 1950's B- movie. But this is essentially a B-movie, but made straight-faced by Carpenter with his golden touch that rules out any possibility that the film might come across as silly. This is pure popcorn horror, made by an old master. Especially memorable is the scene where we first glimpse the ship's crew, huddled in a church with the fog swirling around them. Their leader slowly draws his sword; his red eyes glowing, while Carpenter's self-penned atmospheric synth-score plays over. Again, silly-sounding. But it's not, it's actually beautiful and extremely cool. A very pleasant surprise, and another reminder of just how good Carpenter was before his decline.

It begins with a professor and his team working out a method of extracting hydrogen from water to use this as fuel. Every time the experiment is run the reaction becomes unstable, until Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) finds the correct frequency. After the experiment has succeeded, we see the professor and Shannon (Morgan Freeman) arguing. Later the entire facility is destroyed and eight city blocks are annihilated in what seems to be a nuclear explosion. Eddie and Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) are framed for espionage and decide to run from the police.The movie then falls into one and a half hours of running away from police. One could term this as action, but ends up to be quite dry. What resurrects the dead movie is the mystery of who Shannon is. At first he seems to be a scientist, and then we learn that he is the head of a scientific group called the Moore Foundation and that he has some powerful contacts in the government. He has a huge house, limousine and access to top secret bases. At first it seems that the FBI are the bad guys but we learn that greater powers are leading them around.The main theme here what should be done with cheap electricity.

Why is this relevant? Because it is this ability to create something so magnificent out of something so modest that marks a truly great piece of art; this ability to find support in the foundation of an idea, rather than from the celebrities and production associated with a big budget release, that heralds a truly genuine film. Pi hits all the right notes.From the very beginning, as the overexposed black and white image thrusts us into a surreal, nightmarish world, and Clint Mansell's dark, electronic soundtrack starts to activate our adrenaline, it becomes obvious that we are in for a unique experience. It also becomes obvious that this is not a film for everyone. The low-budget cinematography constructs a tangible sort of insanity&#x97;we are right there, alongside tragic protagonist Max, trying to navigate through the hullabaloo of a foreign-seeming world, and this can become tiring. But if an audience is willing to commit itself to a film that may, at times, be uncomfortable and confusing, it bears lofty rewards in the end.The premise itself isn't very complex math mastermind, Max Cohen, attempts to uncover the nature of ultimate reality through number patterns. This is a subject that has been discussed time and time again by philosophers, and the film presents few (if any) ideas to add to the discourse&#x97;but then again, it's not trying to. What it does do admirably is translate this abstract subject into a resonating visual landscape; it associates a concrete feeling to a vague concept.This is, in a lot of ways, similar to what _Eraserhead_ achieved a little over two decades earlier. Aronofsky admits to having been influenced by David Lynch, and this debut film is his clearest homage to vintage Lynchian style from the nihilistic undertones to the industrial surroundings to the grotesque, surrealist images&#x97;numerous parallels can be drawn. But while _Eraserhead_'s protagonist passively trudges through the rubble, _Pi_'s leading man desperately tries to explain it, and it is with this desperation that the film builds intensity in a way _Eraserhead_ never quite does, nor attempts.However, despite its many successes, the film does suffer from a few downfalls worth mentioning, most of these a result of the low production cost. For one thing, the acting in many scenes, while not cringeworthy, can definitely become a distraction; this is partly due to the dialogue which doesn't lend itself well to the actors' interaction. Furthermore, there are instances when the camera becomes so shaky that it might take considerable effort to fully grasp what's happened (those instances are rare). But these are minor shortcomings that are easily overshadowed by the film's strengths.Overall, _Pi_ is a very fitting film to mark the beginning of an exceptional directorial career.
