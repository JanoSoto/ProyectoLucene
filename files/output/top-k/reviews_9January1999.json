[{"date":"9 January 1999","score":"","review":"  Cate Blanchett rocked in the role of Elizabeth.  She had one of the most convincing and powerful presences I have ever seen on screen.  The film was pretty dark, which took a bit away from the overall experience.  I liked the scenes with her and Joseph Fiennes, of the magnificent Shakespeare In Love.  His eyes are so intense, he's a perfect match for her.  This is one of the best films of the year.
