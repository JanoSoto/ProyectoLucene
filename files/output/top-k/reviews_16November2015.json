[{"date":"16 November 2015","score":"","review":" Obviously this film was not advertised during its release. I didn't have much of an interest based on such a pedestrian film title. Little did I know it was going to be as compelling as it is. I have seen this film several times and even though I feel like I connected with it then, I feel somewhat connected to it differently now. I am drawn to the youthfulness of the young Vincent Kartheiser, who plays Bobbie. James Woods is magnetic as Mel. It's an absorbing tale. He and Melanie Griffith play an older criminal couple who take Kartheiser and his girlfriend underneath their wings. I like it a lot but I would not flat-out recommend it to a wide array of people. Before going in, you must know it is directed by Larry Clark. He has quite a reputation, at least for his films. If anything he has done catches your eye, I'd say give this one a go. One of the best scenes in this film comes near the end when Mel rages at Bobbie after a situation goes bad. Mel freaks out in the backseat of their car as he says to Bobbie, You really f****d it up good this time didn't you, Bobbie? and from there he goes into one of the best rants in movie history. Absolutely stunning this is. ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2015","score":"","review":" Obviously this film was not advertised during its release.

However, there is something bellow the surface, much smarter than your average sci-fi action flick. It is a wonderfully cynical and clever satirical masterpiece.In a style comparable to that of Robocop, it uses fake news and propaganda clips to, essentially, explain to the audience certain plot points. But, it also increases the satirical element. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of satire BESIDES these news and propaganda sequences, but those specific scenes ARE the most noticeable satirical scenes. There's also a lot of satire in the training sequences. The satirical situations are really exaggerated, but still pretty clever in execution.Other than the satire, the film is genuinely fun and entertaining, although it is clear that the more satirical elements definitely increased the film's rating for me. While the special effects aren't the greatest (or anywhere near the greatest-at all), the film is still very well made. The sets may seem a little cheesy, but I, personally, really liked their look, so they weren't much of a problem in my opinion.The film also includes some surprisingly brutal sequences that highlight the horrors of war, which I genuinely didn't expect from this movie, especially since, most of the time, the film doesn't take itself seriously at all.While it isn't as openly satirical as Verhoeven's masterwork Robocop, it still has tons of great, witty satire. Plus, it is a really entertaining action movie, so even if you aren't into satire, you still might really enjoy Starship Troopers!Highly recommended.
