[{"date":"25 March 2008","score":"","review":" Remakes come in all shapes and sizes. What's the reason for making remakes of the classic movies that fitted well? Some remakes get to show a different side of view like Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear in 1991 where rather than showing a happy family in peril (like in the original 1962 classic), Scorsese shows a dysfunctional family filled with anger and a disease where it made audience applaud for De Niro's character.Tim Burton is known for making movies in a goth emblem from Beetlejuice, Batman Returns (the best of his work), Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and much more. Now he directs this 1960's classic about how a man from space gets stuck in an island filled with talking and vicious primates. Mark Whalberg is Capt. Leo Davidson who doesn't do much except try to wow women with his boyish good looks where one of his lab chimps goes inside a space rocket and leaves the space station where he goes into another planet. Leo tries to find his pet until he realizes that once he arrives everything is upside down with humans in cages and use for enslavement while primates (Gorillas, monkeys, orangutans, etc.) rule the planet. The leader is General Thade (Tim Roth, who stands out) who wants to abolish all humans from the face of the earth. His henchmen involves the volatile Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), Limbo (Paul Giamatti) the fool, and sweet Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) who crushes on Captain Leo.If you seen the original movie about how the humans and some of the chimps fight off the bad primates, there's a twist in the ending. There's no enthrallment, no cheers, it felt as if certain scenes from the trailer worked rather than the film itself while breathing in relief after I walked out of the theater.
