A predecessor of A Time to Kill if you like, however the movie turned out to be much more than a court-drama. The movie is truly about and told from the point of view of the children, growing up in the depression-era of the '30's in a small racial divided Alabama town.The story is told beautifully and takes it time to tell the story in a good suitable slow pace. The emotions of the movie are truly gripping and all have a very real, realistic feeling. The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a child makes it even more effective. All the scene's with the children feel very realistic and should bring back some childhood memories. The way their playing outside with each other should is especially recognizable.The movie has several subplots. The scene's with Atticus Finch and his defense of the black man who is accused of raping a white woman is one of them but the movie never looses its focus on Atticus his two children Jem and Scout who truly are the main characters of the movie. The children have to deal with the loss of their mother, their fears and prejudices. The way these things are handled make To Kill a Mockingbird a powerful and important movie.Gregory Peck is mostly excellent as the ordinary but yet highly admirable Atticus Finch, who besides his own personal problems and that as a lawyer also fights to hide the ugly things of the world for his children. Also really excellent were the child actors. Especially Mary Badham as Scout deeply impressed me. It's no wonder that the then 9\/10 year old received an Oscar nomination. Peck received a nomination and unlike Bedham he also got the take the statue home with him. Other Oscar wins for this movie were Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.Also of course worth mentioning is the very good musical score by Elmer Bernstein. This one is among his best work of his lifetime.Is there nothing wrong with this movie? Unfortunately yes, even though I still consider this a classic and one of the most memorable and impressive movies it is not a perfect one. It's obvious that this movie is based on a book and some typical book elements are present throughout the movie that don't really work out the way they're supposed to, such as the entire 'Boo' Radley (played by Robert Duvall, in his very first movie role!) story at the end of the movie. Also the whole 'Boo' Radley thing feels a bit old fashioned and perhaps a bit too over-the-top.A movie that you should experience at least once in your lifetime.9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I always thought that To Kill a Mockingbird was nothing more than a court-drama.

Especially the main character Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is disappointing. She isn't really strong enough as a character to carry this entire movie. Real main character of the movie to me was Samuel L.

He plays a sort of loser role like you wouldn't expect from him in a movie like this.

This movie is one of the greatest court room movies i have seen. Not only because the court room sequence here stays in reasonable length but it also makes a little fun of the whole process. There's great humor in the movie though the subject is very serious indeed. Very often the court room cases are so serious and dull but here Wilder makes it very enjoyable and fun and at the same time very exciting. Maybe the original book is more serious, i don't know 'cause i haven't read it but Wilder's view works great here. And the main reason is the great characters! Charles Laughton's role as a lawyer Sir Wilfrid Robarts is just fantastic. It's great when he is in the court room very serious and he is very passionate about his work but still you can see from his face that he is maybe very tired for the whole thing. And it's great in the end of the movie where he has been humiliated by Leonard Vole and viewers are just thinking that now he has had enough for the whole court room thing. But no, he is going to defend Christine Vole in her case. And there are many great moments and characters on the court room and the whole feeling is somehow very mild. Lawyers are telling jokes though it's a murder trial and the whole thing is shown also like a very much a competition between the defense and the prosecution. After all, does it matter if he is innocent or not? The most important thing is that Sir Wilfrid Robarts hate to lose. There's all the time this great hypocritical attitude present in the movie. Of course these motives have been deal with other this kind of movies also but Wilder does it here better than anyone.There are lots of great moments in this movie just like it was in Sunset Boulevard.

This also happens to be the first time Greg has met Pams parents, hence the title-'Meet the Parents'. Pam's father isn't the most laid back of people in fact he's rather scary and they couldn't have chosen anyone better to play Jack Byrnes than Robert DeNiro. This is a different role for DeNiro from his other films but you can still see his character hold some of his old roles. Poor Greg is taken on a roller-coaster with only himself to blame. You can't help but feel sorry for him as he seems like an outcast especially when they all go and party at Kevin's mansion (Wilson) who's Pam's ex fiancée-I mean can you actually imagine that happening to you, it's so cruel. Ben Stiller is great in this film and I love his acting. He's great at playing the vulnerable, clumsy guy who only wants to keep everyone happy. I mean this guy was never given a chance even from birth when his parents named him Gaylord'Greg' Focker. This film made him one of my favourite comedy actors. He doesn't need to pull faces, and go OTT like the Jim Carreys of the acting world. Instead you feel as though Stiller is a lot like Gaylord 'Greg' Focker in real life which makes him even more likable.

Everything that makes up this movie is incredible; the style of it, the acting, the scenery, everything is wonderful. I haven't read the original book that the movie is based on, but after seeing how god the movie is (courtesy of Rob Reiner), I should most definitely read it.The casting is perfect. Cary Elwes plays Westly, a poor farm boy who is in love with Princess Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and follows her every command with As you Wish. When Buttercup is captured by three men and then eventually forced to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), It's up to Westly to rescue her. All of this is being told to A grandson (Fred Savage) by his grandpa (Peter Falk).The scenery is beautiful. From the pirate ship out at sea facing the shrieking eels, to the deadly Fire Swamp, the visuals and scenery will leave you in awe. Don't forget about the Cliffs of Insanity, where and epic fencing battle takes place.I remember watching this as a child and loving it very much. As I watch it again when I'm older, I love it just as much and I also realize how good of a movie it is altogether.

The photography is simply amazing and reflects the paradox of the situation enormous dosis of violence in a paradisiac island where every site is beautiful (I love the scenes where the soldiers are walking and they encounter the natives from the islands acting if nothing was happening, as if there were no war). The acting is brilliant (specially Nick Nolte, as always) and the direction is so personal (I think no director actually has a style similar to Malick one) that makes the film unique.

Now meet Hedwig, the rock-em-shock-em punk band leader into which Hans transforms himself when his American husband abandons him in the midwest. Embittered when the Berlin wall falls and furious when a later teenage-lover steals her music and becomes an arena-filling rock star, Hedwig now dogs the teenager's steps by staging a tour with her own band and following him from town to town.John Cameron Mitchell, who co-wrote and starred in the New York show and who appears in the film as both director and star, mutes the more savage tones of the stage original in favor of pathos and a broader sense of the character's humanity; consequently, the film isn't really as far-out or edgy as it might seem and it lacks the sharp bite you might expect. The film also seems a bit unfocused, a bit unstructured, and at times I felt a bit frustrated by what it leads you to expect but never actually delivers. Even so, Mitchell and company (especially Miriam Shor), give some extremely interesting and often drop-dead funny performances, and the music performed by the band as it tours is first rate throughout.Sadly, some viewers will reject the film without seeing it on the basis of subject matter alone--which would be a mistake. Often funny, often touching, and certainly thought-provoking, HEDWIG packs a solid punch by appealing to the untapped creativity in all of us and leads us to question our own internal sense of unity. The characters and ideas it presents linger in mind afterward, and while Hedwig and her angry inch aren't quite as knock-out as you could wish they're still fascinating.The DVD release contains lots of extras, most notably a documentary (almost as long as the movie itself) that describes the creation of both stage show and film.

The military is called in to stop the menace, but are ineffective; luckily the small town of Arborville has some plucky, rebellious teenagers around to save the day.Seeing as how this movie was made with modern technology, the special effects in 'The Blob' are much more advanced than they were in the original flick, and this leads to some fairly startling gross-out sequences. The creature is much faster and deadlier than the original monster, although it does look fake at times. The titular beast is fairly nasty too, and has a habit of eating characters you'd expect to survive a movie like this, which helps keep things a bit unpredictable; the film-makers show some guts, as not even kids are spared the wrath of the Blob. The Blob may have even eaten a dog or two, but I can't be certain about that.In between the numerous special effects sequences, the story manages to stay fairly interesting, albeit a bit predictable, especially if you've seen a lot of horror films.

Still, people won't be watching 'The Blob' for the gripping story, but rather for the scenes where the Blob goes to town, and the movie doesn't disappoint here.

This can, of course, be a good or a bad thing depending on the quality of the movie and your opinion of it. In many ways, making a movie that leaves the viewer completely detached and uninvolved is almost an achievement in itself and if that was writer\/director Francis Veber's objective then I'm happy to say that Three Fugitives is a unparallelled success. Being a horrible misfit of crime thriller, action comedy and emotional tearjerker, Three Fugitives spends its entire duration going absolutely nowhere.Nick Nolte plays hardened career criminal Lucas who is released from jail after a five-year stretch for his fourteenth armed robbery. On his first day back in society, Lucas is caught up in a bank robbery of someone else's design, namely bumbling nerd Ned (Martin Short). When the police, led by Lucas's nemesis Dugan (James Earl Jones), turn up, they naturally assume that Lucas is responsible and the pair of them escape in the ensuing confusion. Slowly, the two build up a unique partnership that is focused on Ned's traumatised daughter, Meg (Sarah Rowland Doroff).A movie such as this hinges on the relationship between the two leads and personally, I felt that Nolte and Short were not a good combination. Nolte is too restrained for Short's wild physical humour and aside from a few smirks here and there, the comedy felt forced and not particularly funny. Doroff is good but she has nothing to do besides look cute and in my opinion, Jennifer Love Hewitt does that better than anyone else. The whole film feels stuck, endlessly chasing the initial premise around and around until you hardly remember what the point of the film was. It sags badly after the first 45 minutes or so and it never regains its opening promise. It is also badly edited - even someone like me (who rarely spots continuity errors and such) spotted a whole host of mistakes and plot holes that really should have been dealt with before being released.Three Fugitives starts out promising but all too quickly runs out of steam and then surrenders. It never gets out of second gear and the whole thing never engages or stimulates the viewer. It is a celluloid sedative, stretching out every minute of its duration. It isn't the worst movie ever made but a lot of viewers will not enjoy a film that never makes up its mind what it wants to be and spends 90-odd minutes being nothing. A handful of people may get something from this but this is a quiet little movie, barely noticeable on the CVs of Short or Nolte (who looks remarkably young in this!) and not worth the effort. Sorry but this is one movie that I will not be pursuing in future, unless I wanted to go to sleep.

In other words, if you're wanting to watch this for the same reasons you wanted to watch the original Evil Dead, you may be disappointed. This is the sort of evolution that Raimi has taken the series with the first was a film from a filmmaker 21 years old, with an over-load of visual energy, pumping out one of the most visceral and inventive of all horror films. The sequel went half and half- at times it took the sincerity and true horror of the first film, but it also had a lot to laugh about too, as it didn't take itself seriously for most of it. With Army of Darkness, it's tongue-in-cheek incarnate. Take a scene where Ash has just resurrected the deadites (through some fault of his own, mumbling the last word of his forgotten phrase to stop the curse from the book of the dead) to rise. He suddenly gets pulled down to the ground, and the skeletons from the graves have their way with him, in short, having a fight in the tradition of a Three Stooges skit (blocking eye-pokes and all).

And the film may or may not work for some depending on the stamina and prowess of Campbell, who for me is one of the funniest people working in low-budget films today (he comes up occasionally in big-budget films too), but may be a little too 'ham' for some viewers.

Multiple viewings are highly recommended, however not necessary. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"28 July 2005","score":"","review":" An excellent film concerning war as a phenomenon in it's own right. What is so good about this film is that it makes no statement about war, it just presents it to you. Here we have Kubrick completely ignoring generic and traditional dramatic structure, as he sticks his neck out yet again to present one of the most uncompromising dramatic forms ever shot. It is brilliant.We follow Joker (Matthew Modine) throughout the course of the movie, starting at boot camp and moving into Vietnam itself. We are not given any inside information in the film - we know and understand less than the characters themselves. All we know is, through the claustrophobia of the training barracks, that there is a war out there somewhere and that these soldiers will fight against something. Even the narration (provided by Modine) is empty and robotic, unlike the journal-esqu readings of Platoon.We see their meaningless and detached involvements, and can not help but feel shut-out from even the most basic elements of the entire Vietnam conflict. All actions are amplified as we are so close in (yet paradoxically, so removed) to the platoon\/squad that the big picture and any perspective is completely distorted and even lost.

It's so sappy, it makes you laugh! But then it has an actual plot, which is exciting and unpredictable! This is one movie that I could watch time and time again and never become bored with it! I can nearly quote every line of the movie, and I still enjoy each viewing just as much as the last! I can't say there are any great values presented - although there's nothing questionable, really - but it's just a fun movie to sit down and laugh at. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good laugh at some REALLY funny stuff - not just the ordinary, cookie cutter jokes that most other movies provide. I also loved the storyline - it was cute and touching, and while the outcome was obvious from the beginning (as all fairy tales are), the path on which the characters would take to produce such an outcome was very interesting. It is a great movie! I strongly recommend it!
