[{"date":"20 January 2010","score":"","review":" I know nothing about director Kinka Usher, I know nothing about the Mystery Men comics and I know nothing about how close to their hearts the true fans held this band of lovable losers. What I do know is that Mystery Men is one of my favourite comedies of all time with a script that constantly throws up many absolute gems of dialogue.Anyway, the plot sees the Mystery Men doing what they do best . . . . being pretty lame superheroes who simply seem to screw things up until Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear in his great smarmy mode here) comes along and saves the day. But when Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush, who is wonderfully OTT) manages to trap Captain Amazing it's up to the Mystery Men to save the day. Mr Furious (Ben Stiller doing his best impotent rage schtick) thinks they should just go for it while the others feel they would benefit from the guidance of the mysterious Sphinx. Can the underdogs save the day? What this film has in abundance is style, wit and a genuinely magnificent ensemble cast including Stiller, Kinnear, Rush, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Claire Forlani, Kel Mitchell, Paul Reubens, Lena Olin, Eddie Izzard, Tom Waits and more.The look of the whole thing is like a cross between Gotham City and . . . . . some other, warped Gotham City. The characters and their particular talents are all depicted well and the camera twirls around and provides some crazy POV shots (a la Frankenstein's finger) in a way that just makes it feel as if it's joining in with all the fun instead of just shooting the action.Each cast member is pretty much perfect. If you don't like Stiller's angry young man work then you're not going to be won over here but, personally, I think he does it brilliantly. Garofalo is at her wisecracking, jaded best. Azaria is wonderful, Reubens is disgustingly amusing but the revelation here is Macy, showing real warmth and a great sense of how to play the comedic element straight a la Tommy Lee Jones in Men In Black.The rating here for this movie is shockingly low and should be rectified immediately. A fantastic comedy that I can watch once a week and never tire of.See this if you like The Specials, Superhero Movie (although that's a much inferior debacle), Dodgeball.

Then, I waited its DVD for years, now I have it. Critics, some people and also as I know, the director, Paul Verhoeven say that the movie has a lot of political, social messages, it is a satire. However, I am not interested in messages, I am an apolitical watcher and honestly, I cannot detect generally (I don't want it anyway), but I don't object to such sub-texts, it might be true. Fascism, militarism, anti-militarism, media, army criticism, it seems that everything is here. Starship Troopers is fun, fun and fun. Years years ago, I read it, a critic says where is entertainment, tell me? Arms and legs are disintegrated. He is right, but of course not this side of the matter is fun. The first half of the movie is interesting, but it is like the introduction, you see nothing yet. The design of the bugs and clash scenes are great (and unique) thanks to Paul Verhoeven. May be you don't emphasize the soldiers, but you care about them, you worry about them one each and you feel like you are there. When one of them is killed, you bother, you cheer, when one of them is saved. And as for adrenalin, excitement, you fasten on the screen while hundreds of bullets are spent, because it is extremely hard to get through. One bug is destroyed, but then starting all over again. I am sure that we won't see such movies in the future. Probably, this is because of Verhoeven's talent. The best bug designs so far are in this movie. In the second half, almost non stop action, except for action freaks, it might be excessive for some people, it is that great. I love it. My favorite scene is the sequence that they come to the station, this sequence deserves to be put in the cinema anthology. Each time, I am astonished when thousands of bugs appear and attack. As a note, the sound editing is brilliant in this part. Verhoeven may be criticizes militarism, but it does not mean that he does not care about action, just the opposite. By the way, there are two weapons in front of the station that look like tank gun, the most heavy armament of the soldiers. May be, this will make some people angry, but I liked these weapons. I am not interested in guns at all, I have not any kind of weapon and it won't, I just love gunfight scenes. I believe that even if he criticizes somethings above all, he cares about action, entertainment. When the soldiers hold their guns to the bugs, he zooms! He made this movie as it should be. In terms of style and content both including the atmosphere, the second half recalls computer games. I don't play computer usually and I haven't played its computer game yet, but I took a look at the game, so not so important, but this is a plus. The dead bodies are pretty hard-to-look-at, but it seems that set designers made great effort. There are many kind of bugs, the design of the bugs are well designed as I said, so interesting. Starship Troopers is not the best science fiction movie ever made, but the best action \/ science fiction after The Terminator 2. Lastly, I did not like Cameron's Aliens, it was a big disappointment after Alien. However, people love Aliens which is also according to them one of the best action movies, but the rating of Starship Troopers is one of the most bothersome ratings in IMDb history! It was pretty slow paced (may be after such movies, it seems) and the most important there was no gunfight, no battle between the team and the aliens. And aliens were passive?

Only from this brief summary, you can see how powerful this life story is, and even though I haven't read the novel of the same name in which the movie is based on, it seems like the writers took full advantage of Reinaldo's story, going from his poor childhood in the Cuban countryside to his exile in the United States.The main role here goes to Spanish-born actor Javier Bardem. The only movie with him that I've watched is No Country for Old Men, and though he is outstanding in that picture, he does a much better job here. His acting is absolutely perfect. In every scene he is (almost the whole movie), he steals your attention. He is Reinaldo Arenas in this picture, no question about it. He deserved every award he got. And he does that with a supporting cast that has names like Sean Penn (in a very tiny appearance), Johnny Deep (playing two roles), Brazilian-born director Hector Babenco (also a small role), Diego Luna and other unknown actors.Julian Schnabel also does a very nice job directing. Even though a few of the shots reminded me a lot of Schnabel's latter The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, with very similar underwater sequences, shots of people in open cars, and open shots of the town and the woods, I appreciate his style. One shot in particular that is worth mentioning is the one in the beginning of the movie that comes out of the hole Reinaldo is playing and becomes an open shot of the small town. Beautiful work of directing. Another aspect that is worth mentioning is the photography. Both directors of photography do an excellent job, and the movie looks almost like a painting most of the time.From all this I have mentioned, this movie would get a 9 rating. But a few things bothered me. First, the movie is quite boring and slow most of the time, because of the lousy editing by Michael Berenbaum. You could easily cut off 20 minutes of the film. And also there are too many childhood memories throughout the movie completely unnecessary. But what bothered me the most is the language issue. This movie suffers from the same problem as Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata. Both of them have great acting and directing, and all the character's speak in English, but they should be talking Spanish! If this is Cuba, you expect a Spanish-talking picture, but instead you get a few random lines in the correct language. I know this is made to attract north-American audiences, but they should be faithful to the story. Thankfully, Julian Schnabel doesn't make the same mistake in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. There, they speak French in France!Overral, this is a great film with outstanding acting and directing, but the language issue and the lousy editing keeps this movie alway from having a better rating.

And also there are too many childhood memories throughout the movie completely unnecessary. But what bothered me the most is the language issue. This movie suffers from the same problem as Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata. Both of them have great acting and directing, and all the character's speak in English, but they should be talking Spanish! If this is Cuba, you expect a Spanish-talking picture, but instead you get a few random lines in the correct language. I know this is made to attract north-American audiences, but they should be faithful to the story. Thankfully, Julian Schnabel doesn't make the same mistake in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. There, they speak French in France!Overral, this is a great film with outstanding acting and directing, but the language issue and the lousy editing keeps this movie alway from having a better rating. A must-see for Javier Bardem and Johnny Deep fans (the only time you can see him as a transsexual).7,5 out of 10, that in this case goes back to a 7.

Whilst acting as another example of Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar's knack of being able to incorporate, at least to a very basic degree on this occasion, texts within texts; such a sequence goes rather a long way in capturing how he does most of what it is he looks at in his films. That is to say, the sequence is thrust onto us in an unspectacular manner by way of two different compositions evoking a somewhat televisual sense, before a gradual reveal of one item; followed by another; followed by the fleshing out of who these people really are in a manner that feels cinematic. It's this establishment of an idea, subject matter or basis for a bog-standard and quite dramatic scene being revisited and toyed with to deliver something anew; much in the way Almodóvar revisits ordinary, but rather troubled, inhabitants of his native Spain and provides new tales mixed with both new and familiar flaws these people possess.The Flower of my Secret is more of a wavy tale than I'd have liked it to be, too often getting bogged down with scenes and sequences that detract from what is primarily a film about a woman battling with her identity in the form of an alter-ego as she undergoes changes in her life. In a film all about the relationship a woman has with her employers, herself and her husband, the scenes that carry the least dramatic weight are the one's in which the same woman must balance her role as a daughter and sister. But these incidences only occur sparsely and much like the lead heroine of the title whom totters around the general area in an unbalanced and somewhat confused manner, there is that consistent feeling the film itself will similarly do the same as it shoots about from one interaction to another. But The Flower of My Secret pulls together, if only just, but a more concentrated and more narrow view on these people and their problems would've sufficed even more.The film covers Leo Macías (Paredes), a middle aged female writer whom works within fiction under an alias of Amanda Gris, someone many would like to find out the true identity of through her success. As an individual going through a troubled time, furthered by issues of a marital nature, the want to filter the true feelings, emotions and experiences through into her writing becomes more prominent &#x96; something the publishers don't want, because the winning formula of writing these upbeat and romantic novels has already brought untold success to both Leo and the company. Leo is established in her very first scene to be a person who has difficulty removing the boots that she wears, while half her journey in the piece is the real inability to additionally rid herself of this alter-ego she has burdened herself with by way of writing cheery, uplifting tales and generally giving everyone what it is they crave. Aware the boots come with a problem that renders them difficult to get off, but doing so anyway because of her husband Paco (Arias) who is based in Belgium with the United Nations, this idea of going through a grinder for the sake of others seems to catch up with Leo early on; something that will carry on into her role as a writer as the film progresses.Almodóvar's film is full of quirks, establishing things such as the boundary between reality and fiction that exists by way of the first scene before branching out and presenting happy-go-lucky novel fiction that the author wants to give an edge - but the film isn't a rounded experience. Another quirk, which arrives in the form of a subplot of sorts, is the nature of Leo's brief interaction with her husband Paco; a man charged with serving, protecting, nurturing and caring for those in far off places following an assigning to then war-torn Bosnia, but he does not much possess the said characteristics when thinking of his own wife and marriage, while Leo is stuck in nurturing a side of her in Amanda that she wants to rid herself of. In what is a seemingly self-aware jab at his own work, given how limited the presence of sexually active characters and the study of items of a sexual nature are in general, The Flower of my Secret is decidedly 'un-raunchy'. Indeed, when Leo and Paco initially meet in the doorway of the apartment; their embrace is somewhat censored by a conveniently placed reflective object of sorts while later on, the suggestion of anything steamy between the two is greeted with proverbial bombshells. Later on, a bathroom mirror will act as the means for the camera to whip pan toward as they reflect on where they are with each other and he reveals that certain plans have changed.Almodóvar is a clever film-maker, able to build relationships between characters and play out some pretty dramatic set-pieces in the process. Unfortunately, The Flower of my Secret is only marginally interesting; with flashes of intrigue and border-line brilliance combining with above examples of intricate film-making. Here, I think to cram in a flailing marriage; with a career path in the balance; with another man falling in love with Leo; with her partially blind mother desperately wanting to return to the rural place she knows best, known only as 'the village', is biting off more than the film can comprehensively chew. Almodóvar is too good-a film-maker to make material of this nature unwatchable, but the flitting around he does as his lead tumbles in and out from one location to another gets a tad tiresome more often than not; as lots of different threads are all drawn together to form the basis for an arc of a woman whose life threatens to capitulate.

I look up to Sly Stallone in a lot of ways, and this movie was always one of my favorites. Well after not viewing it for quite a few years, did it still hold up?. I was very happy to find out that I still found much to enjoy about Lock Up. For starters it's one of the most realistic prison films I've seen, period. The Prison is incredibly depressing looking. It helps that it was filmed in an actual prison, to add to the realism factor. John Flynn|The Director| did a great job of letting the viewer feel The tension between Leone and The Warden, throughout the film. Lockup did get a little silly near the end, I thought it was a little bit over the top to be honest. Even a Warden who had that much hatred for an inmate, I highly doubt he would go to the lengths that he did, to keep Leone in prison, it just felt highly unrealistic, thought it did make for some good action sequences. Lockup also does a smart job with the characters. We are able to care for Leone and the friends he has, because we can sympathize with them all, even Dallas.I also enjoyed how quickly Lockup gave us a quick jolt. When we see Leone 1st being transfered and haled off into another prison, it really set the tone and the mood for the movie. Donald Sutherland's 1st appearance, especially his speech was quite chilling. Sylvester Stallone is not the world's greatest actor, but he's always had a pure heart, and loads of determination to get him where he is today. His charisma is undeniable, and as far as his performance here is concerned, he did just fine.Performances. Sly Stallone is the central character, so he has to carry a lot of the weight. He is up to the task. We care about Leone, he's a good all around human being, brimming with likability and positivity. This movie, and his performance were both panned by critics, but I thought he did terrific. Donald Sutherland is chilling as The Warden. He's sick, he's perverted, and he'll do anything to exact revenge, and that's what made a lot of the movie. John Amos plays the strict, yet Captain with heart very well. Sonny Landham has a great physical presence, and made for a terrific psycho. Tom Sizemore has never been a favorite of mine, but he is pretty good as Dallas. He's a bit of a weasel, but one with a heart, therefore I could relate to him. Frank McRae plays it low key, unlike Last Action hero, and the film was better for it. Darlanne Fluegel is very pretty, and does well as the love interest of Leone's. Larry Romano is a likable individual as First Base, he did well with what he had to do. Jordan Lund plays one of the fattest, despicable characters I've seen in some time, I hated him.Bottom line. Lockup is not the perfect movie, but it's definitely a very entertaining one, and one of the better prison films out there. Ignore the bad reviews, and the arrogant critics, Lockup is a good movie.

Richard Brooks did a much better job adapting the script of In Cold Blood and Elmer Gantry. I think that's mainly because those are based on novels, and this one is based on a play.The story is about a WWII veteran (Humphrey Bogart) that goes to the island of Key Largo in Florida to talk with the wife (Lauren Bacall) and father (Lionel Barrymore) of his old-friend from the war. That's when a gangster (Edward G. Robinson) takes control of the place and turns everyone into his hostages. At first, I didn't really get what was that gangster doing in that place, but it's latter explained that he's waiting for a hurricane and needs protection. But why that tiny island? I still don't get this, but alright. This flaw is compensated by one of the best climax I've ever seen in a movie. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but it's great.About the acting, Bogart did much better jobs in other pictures. This is the final movie with him and Lauren Bacall together, but I prefer their first collaboration in To Have and Have Not. Edward G. Robinson also gives a great performance, but again, he was better in other movies like Little Ceaser. In my opinion, the members of the cast that gives the best performances are Lionel Barrymore and Oscar- winning interpretation by Claire Trevor. They are both excellent.John Huston, as always, does a nice direction, but I prefer much better his masterpiece of the same year The Treasure of Sierra Madre.

The Villa is also home to the romanticist poet Lord Byron and his assistant Dr. Polidori who himself would go on to write Vampyre among his works.With any Ken Russell movie you need to expect some very bizarre scenes and Gothic is probably his strangest and most incoherent yet. I'm a big fan of Lair of the White Worm which stays on point throughout the film so I know Russell is capable of doing so but this is just a mess of a film with odd scenes mixed with inane dialogue. It was difficult to determine why the guests were acting so strange. Were they under the influence of hallucinatory drugs? Was the ghost real? Did they summon their fears into existence like gods? Who the hell knows as every scene is one of the cast running and screaming like a goof from room to room like every episode of Scooby Doo. And what the hell was up with the Villa anyway? Mechanical women and an oddball collection of helpers? Was Byron Willy Wonka for crying out loud? Speaking of Byron, Gabriel Byrne really channeled his inner Caligula as he subjects his guests with various tawdry games all the while trying to screw anything with a heartbeat. I would be surprised if one the snakes made it out of the Villa without get groped by this bisexual Dracula look alike. Some of the effects were interesting like the incubus that appears on top of Mary, Claire's breasts with eyes, and the Ken Russell signature scene of an entity trying to assault a woman with an enhanced member. One of the first performances by the late Natasha Richardson who does a fairly good job as the only semi-sane person in the Villa. Gothic's frenetic pace, cumbersome dialogue, and constant homoeroticism eventually wore me down. This film did inspire me to stop huffing chemicals.

While I understood the basic idea of the movie 3 friends go into the woods to make a documentary about a legend of the Blair Witch and subsequently they seem to be stalked and attacked with no clear answers as to why or how, their footage being found a long time later; I wasn't sure why it became as popular as it did.One night I had fallen asleep with my TV on and when I woke, I saw Book of Shadows was on. I almost changed the channel when I realized that it was the sequel to Blair Witch Project, but (like a superficial girl) I saw Jeffrey Donovan on the screen and stayed a moment, ending up watching the entire movie.The movie was about a tour guide (former mental institution patient Jeffrey) who takes a group of tourists (Gothic Kim, Wiccian Erica, and a couple researching the Blair witch Tristin and Stephen) into the woods where the footage from the original movie was made. One night they camp out in the woods, drink, talk, have fun. All the while, they videotape their night. Suddenly they all wake up and have no memory of what had happened that night. Tristin and Stephen's research notes is found ripped to shreds all over the campsite, the tapes hidden away. They find the tapes and eventually go to Jeffrey's home. Looking through the tapes, they see nothing, but eventually they run the tapes backwards and they find that they had a wild party. Still unable to put the pieces together completely, they find out that tourists that they had a run-in with were murdered, and it was them who committed the crimes. Erica is found dead, and they realize that Tristin is to blame for the murders (I don't believe it is confirmed, but it is implied that she is possessed by the Blair Witch), and they confront her and as she ties a rope around her neck, she mocks them, especially Stephen, who loses his cool and pushes her off of the stairs. The three remaining are arrested, the cops have video tapes that shows them killing others. The tape shown to Stephen shows Tristins death completely different than how it occurred, showing the 3 ganging up on her, and kill her by tying the rope around her neck and pushing her off. They are baffled and assumed to be arrested.It is shot completely different from the first a fiction movie rather than a faux-documentary, and the storyline being more clear. There were many twists and turns, interesting characters, a solid storyline and great editing.I definitely recommend this movie to others. It's not perfect, but it is a solid film.

Half the time I felt dizzy, very confused and slightly sea-sick. While I understood the basic idea of the movie 3 friends go into the woods to make a documentary about a legend of the Blair Witch and subsequently they seem to be stalked and attacked with no clear answers as to why or how, their footage being found a long time later; I wasn't sure why it became as popular as it did.One night I had fallen asleep with my TV on and when I woke, I saw Book of Shadows was on. I almost changed the channel when I realized that it was the sequel to Blair Witch Project, but (like a superficial girl) I saw Jeffrey Donovan on the screen and stayed a moment, ending up watching the entire movie.The movie was about a tour guide (former mental institution patient Jeffrey) who takes a group of tourists (Gothic Kim, Wiccian Erica, and a couple researching the Blair witch Tristin and Stephen) into the woods where the footage from the original movie was made. One night they camp out in the woods, drink, talk, have fun. All the while, they videotape their night. Suddenly they all wake up and have no memory of what had happened that night. Tristin and Stephen's research notes is found ripped to shreds all over the campsite, the tapes hidden away. They find the tapes and eventually go to Jeffrey's home. Looking through the tapes, they see nothing, but eventually they run the tapes backwards and they find that they had a wild party. Still unable to put the pieces together completely, they find out that tourists that they had a run-in with were murdered, and it was them who committed the crimes. Erica is found dead, and they realize that Tristin is to blame for the murders (I don't believe it is confirmed, but it is implied that she is possessed by the Blair Witch), and they confront her and as she ties a rope around her neck, she mocks them, especially Stephen, who loses his cool and pushes her off of the stairs.

HG is a real charmer. Even playing the caddish Wickham part in this Jane Austen sort of take-off, Grant manages to make Wickham likable in spite of being equally caddish! I used to read the original B.Jones column in the Independent. It was fairly entertaining although eventually I got tired of her endless problems and moans and stopped reading it - it went way past its sell-by date, I felt. The movie isn't nearly as good as the column, mainly because Zellwegger is so badly miscast althuogh the actress clearly does do her very best. I just can't imagine Bridget Jones like Zellweger, nor does she as scriped and acted have the slightest connection that I can see to sparky, clever Elizabeth Bennet.The original idea of having Mr Darcy and Wickham in the story was always amusing. If you can be tolerant of a very weak Mr Darcy and a completely non-Elizabeth, you may well love this movie. 6 stars mostly for Hugh Grant. Without him, it would have been only stars. The movie might have worked better for me if Zellwegger had been Elizabeth Bennet's silly younger sister Lydia and ended up enforcedly with a resentful Wickham!

From an early age, I was familiar with two of its songs, The Bare Necessities and I Wan'na Be Like You. I first heard those on an album of songs from animated Disney movies, and then saw where they came from. I also saw the live action 1994 film of the same name on the big screen. I've watched a bunch of full-length Disney cartoons again in recent years, some produced by Walt Disney himself and some made after his death. It took me a while to get around to The Jungle Book, but I finally rented it a few days ago, and as usual with these movies, I still found this one entertaining after all these years.In the jungles of India, a panther named Bagheera finds a human baby boy (or man cub) in a boat wreck, far from the nearest human village. He takes the boy to a pack of wolves for the parents to raise him with their newborn cubs. The boy's name is Mowgli, and he lives in the jungle for the next ten years. The wolves then learn that Shere Khan, a human-hating tiger, is back in the jungle, and Mowgli will have to be returned to the man village to be safe! Bagheera volunteers to take him back, but Mowgli is reluctant, as he wants to stay in the jungle. On the way, they encounter creatures that make the journey more challenging, and after the two of them separate due to the human boy's resistance, Mowgli meets a bear named Baloo. This laid back bear teaches him about living a care-free lifestyle, and he now wants to live with him, but Shere Khan is still a major threat, especially after he learns that there's a human in the jungle! Like many other Disney movies, one thing that helps this film's entertainment level is the animation, most notably the backgrounds here. You obviously can't expect the computer generated backgrounds we see today, but the backgrounds here are still beautiful with the faded colours, especially the green. The story isn't the most interesting one I've ever seen, at least not early in the film, and for a while, I kind of wondered if it was enough to carry the film. Fortunately, I think it gets better along the way, and is often suspenseful, without being too scary. There are also a number of memorable characters, including the lovable Baloo (I might have been introduced to him as a little kid with TaleSpin), Kaa the Snake, King Louie the Ape, Shere Khan, and the vultures based on the Beatles. A lot of the characters provide comic relief. The voice acting is mostly good, with the exception of Bruce Reitherman as Mowgli. The songs are not the best to ever be featured in an animated Disney film, but they are acceptable.This was the last animated feature, of many, that Walt Disney produced in his career, and it came into theatres nearly a year after his death. It was apparently a box office success, which it deserved to be. It showed that Disney's movie franchise was still going strong thirty years after the release of the flick that started it, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I'm not familiar with the source material (a collection of stories by Rudyard Kipling), which is usually the case with me and these Disney adaptations, but judging this version of The Jungle Book just as a film, I think it's good family entertainment, and obviously many would agree with me. There may be more for kids in the film than there is for adults, but many adults could enjoy it as well (that can be said about any good Disney movie), adults who still like animated family adventures.

He managed to grip and hold the audience as they shook in their seats much like how the birds managed to grip and hold Jessica Tandy and she shook herself to deter the birds.This epic film literally made me look out the window daring never to step outside my balcony to see if any birds were around hovering in packs ready to steer themselves into my homes.It is quite enthralling and truly spectacular to be able to capture suspense in the manner Alfred Hitchcock did in this film and actually shake the vary foundations one feels in their house, one should feel safe and secure, but after viewing this movie one will not hesitate to lock twice.Many credits should be given to anyone who participated in the making of this masterpiece and one will certainly love the beautiful Technicolor of the 1960's.The acting was magnificent and many applauds to all actors and actresses. I found the acting of Rod Taylor truly magnificent as he played the role of a man looking for love but powerfully dominated mentally by his mother while all the time having to deal with a bird infestation problem. Of course one cannot doubt the beauty of Jessica Tandy and her acting in Birds, particularly the final scene where she enters the very much realistic trance after her final attack by the birds! Overall wonderful film, and very surprised, provides a bit of many worlds which includes romance, thriller, and suspense.Thank you Hitch!

Two children playing apparently safely are left on their own by their parents who are mixed up in their own world. What follows is a striking shot in which Donald Sutherland's John sprints out of the house and we see a high angled shot looking down into the expressionless eyes of his daughter, floating in the water. This scene is staggering, made powerful through the sudden shock of aimless playing and a father trying his best to save her.Whilst the film begins with the grizzly opening the book opens with the married couple sat in the restaurant discussing the people around them.Changing tactic from calm to shocking allows us to be engrossed into proceedings and sets the upcoming drama. I confess to not loving this change, particularly after witnessing the too quick cut from Laura's view of John clutching their daughter. Nevertheless the rest of the film picks up the dramatic implication of the tragedy as the cut switches into the restaurant where the sisters are introduced.The beauty of a book is imagination and to adapt such a provocative story such as this makes our assumptions different. When reading the novel I found the psychic to be a bit more reserved, a little less forward. The scripting and seizures Hilary Mason goes through as Helen are a tad awkward, bit of a contradictory to the calm nature of the psychic in the novel.For a short story at around 50 pages its amazing to squeeze a two hour film out of. There are notes of improvisation where events happen on screen rather than in the book, such as the vivacious love scene, the wandering around the streets at night and the collapsing sequence in the church. All brilliant, if lacking a bit of author magic. There are many little things that add up to such a consistent feeling, such as the red themes and calm feel of Venice despite the hidden crime details.What was a slight disappointment was the lack of focus on the murder spree happening in Venice, a touch more detail and the ending would have felt more personal. The sound is terribly loud and warbled Nevertheless this is a shocking provocative adaptation that will entertain and delight many, especially for the neutral who will be in for many surprises.
