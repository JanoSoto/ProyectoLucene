I realized the focus was not going to be on David Berkowitz, but I was lead to believe that this film was going to be a portrait of New York City in that fateful year of 1977. Instead, things like Reggie Jackson with the Yankees, Studio 54, the big blackout and subsequent looting spree were just minor elements in the overall picture, given a little more than perfunctory treatment, but not much. Even the heat wave that summer wasn't depicted very vividly.Instead, the focus was on one Italian-American community and a group of friends living there, particularly one married couple (John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino). While he has trouble trying to stay faithful to her, the others are falling victim to the city's paranoia and they come to suspect one of their own (Adrien Brody) as being Son of Sam, mainly because he's adapted the new punk-rock look and is affecting a British accent.Some scenes disappointed me in particular. The killings were graphic but rushed through as if Lee was anxious to get them out of the way, and were handled with no originality at all. The sex scenes were very unerotic, but it's likely they were intended that way. Still, they weren't very enjoyable to watch. Berkowitz's on-screen appearances depicted him as little more than a cartoon character, dressed in his underwear and banging his head against the floor as his nemesis, the neighbor's dog, keeps barking. The biggest mistake, I think, was the scene in which that dog that has so bedeviled Berkowitz comes in his apartment and speaks to him. When he started talking like a latter-day Mr. Ed, the theatre audience let loose with the biggest laugh that they gave during the whole picture, and I don't think that was the director's intention.Still, it was a 2 hour and 22 minute film, and Spike Lee can't be all bad. There were some worthwhile moments here and there. A couple of the best scenes were the music-video treatment of the Who's Baba O'Riley and the end credits (that's no joke--they were done in a tabloid newspaper format to New York, New York).The  acting was all done well but in Lee's films, like Stanley Kubrick's, the direction is the star. He may have hit a bump on the road with this film, but I have no doubt he'll be back on track. Truth is, since I left the theatre, I've tended to recall more of the good than the bad.

Christopher Reeve was also a perfect choice for Superman.This movie perfectly tells all of the story of the Superman from start to finish.  The Krypton scenes are terrific.  Marlon Brando plays Jor-El, the respected scientist and father of Superman, very well.  When Superman arrives on Earth we see a very lonely teenager, who feels (for good reason) that he does not fit.  Superman (or Clark Kent, his alias) journeys to the North Pole and creates the Fortress of Solitude.  There he talks to the image of his father, and emerges twelve years later as the Man of Steel.Unfortunately many Superman fans have never seen the unedited version of this film, which runs about 3 hours, and five minutes.  This version with 40 minutes of extra footage was shown on TV in the early 80's.  It shows more of the scenes from Krypton, along with several others.  Many of the cuts that were made to this film, I agree with, although there are a few that I believe should have been left in.  At the begining, there are several cut scenes from Krypton with Jor-El.  At one point the council sends a guard to stop Jor-El from sending his son off Krypton.  This is very interesting, and should have been left in, but when Krypton explodes there are several shots that I agree with being cut.  The extended version shows many of the Kryptonians dying in the explosions, which becomes a little long and drawn out.Also two scenes that are a little too long and drawn out in the extended version are when the Smallville kids are driving, and when the cops are following Otis.  A scene that I really believe should have been left in, is when Lex Luthor tests Superman.  He shots, burns, and freezes him, unsuccessfully.  My favorite scene from the extended version comes at the very end.  Luthor, while playing the piano, tries to kill Ms. Teschmacher. He tries to feed her to the babies, who are introduced earlier in the extended version.  Although this is a very good scene, it contradicts Superman II, when Ms. Teschmacher saves Lex from prison.

Starring Tom Ewell and Marilyn Monroe, and based on George Axelrod's play, the film takes a humorous look at the problems of a typical middle-aged married man. Tom Ewell, and unassuming leading man with a flair and talent for comedy, is perfectly cast in this movie. Ewell plays the part of Richard Sherman, an average middled-aged man of the 50's...office worker, city inhabitant, with a loving wife and one son. He is left alone in the city for the entire summer while his family vacations in Maine. All is well until Mr. Sherman meets the beautiful blonde who rents the apartment above his for the summer. They soon get to know each other and become friends over champagne, potato chips, and a Rachmaninoff record. Their friendship causes Mr. Sherman to worry that his wife will find out about his relationship with the blonde bombshell. With his overactive imagination, Mr. Sherman dreams up numerous situations concerning this young woman, as well as his wife. Although his imagination causes Mr. Sherman much worry, it provides many of the film's most memorable and enjoyable scenes. Of course, the film is famous for the scene of Monroe standing over the subway grate, which has always been a classic movie scene. Monroe, although unnamed in the film, gives one of her best screen performances, which is just elegant, as she says throughout the movie. She displays a talent for comedy as well as beauty, which should not be overlooked. Ewell's portrayal of Richard Sherman is delightful, hilarious, and perfect. His facial expressions and comedic timing contribute to the film's enjoyability. Along with these stars, the supporting cast is excellent as well. It includes such character actors as Robert Strauss (Mr. Kruhulik, the janitor), and Donald MacBride (Mr. Brady, Richard Sherman's boss). The Seven Year Itch is one of the ultimate 50's pop culture films. And since it was filmed in Cinemascope, it would be perfect to see on the big screen. Any fan of Monroe, Wilder, old movies, or 50's culture would enjoy this movie; I strongly recommend it.

The narrative exists becuase there is no script and these types of experiments usually don't turn out so well.  The story focuses on the lives of 2 groups of characters a killer, his partner and some blond haired girl, and a mute, his father, and a girl on the rebound who plays the mute's love interest. The killer played by Leon Lai, was poorly cast as he has neither the physique nor intensity to make his character believable. The mute, played by Takeshi Kaneshiro, acts a lot like Charlie Chaplin but his tormenting of people in the night (which the movie is entirely set) hardly makes him a likeable character.  All the characters are miserable and is miserable for those who have to watch them.  One may wonder if there are people actually do live like this and I certainly hope not.  To think that Chinese culture that once produced profound thought, classics, and poetry now produces the degrading angel (Duolou loosely means degrading. How fitting the title is!) is a travesty.  There are several particular scenes where Michelle Reis masturbates for a good duration of time which serves no high purpose. How any director can make a human being act indecently in front of a camera is a mystery.

Both parties seem to have been in this project to save themselves from typecasting (it's a cinch Reeves was all through the early '80s - see The Bostonians and Monsignor).  Only 2.5 scenes work at all in this poorly directed and hammy exercise in the mechanics of tear-jerking.The scene that is pulled off halfway is the first, marred only by a pretentiousness that points to something spooky going on.  The first thing that clued me into the fact that the film was going to be more painful than I guessed was very small, but noticeable, and mistakes like it happened constantly throughout the entire movie.  A camera pans through an apartment we know belongs to Reeves, simply from having seen movies before. Something that Szwarc doesn't get at all is that 95% of those in the audience are smart enough to figure anything out because all their lives they have ingested moving images and know their language subliminally.  But this early pan, which I believe happens right after the opening credits, pauses on a group of objects so that the dumbest rock in the seats can recognize them from the prologue, and say - oh, this must be Reeve's place.Those type of directing decisions are made all along, and come in varying degrees.  I'm shocked that Szwarc directed Bruce the Tempermental Mechanical Shark at all, because in this very simple production, he can't even seem to stage a simple two-shot without doing something obtrusive or allowing something stagey to seep into the lense.  This goes from the large to the small - in one scene, Seymour recognizes Reeves from about 100 yards below and behind where he is sitting.  I thought this unlikely, but was then treated to a shot from her point of view (considerably removed from her position forward via the camera set-up), and there was NO WAY Reeves' own mother would have recognized him in that shot.  All you see is a shoulder and part of his head - and that all obscured by woodwork and bushes.  A smaller gripe comes from the strange and even lazy-seeming inclusion of a shot between Plummer and Reeves on a gazebo in which a moth suddenly flies up from under the camera and cuts a wacky line between the actors before flying away.  Why was that take even printed, and how did it make it into the final cut?  Szwarc was not reaching for verisimilitude, that's for sure - everything in this movie is so stagey and polished like a tv movie that I can't see how the moth was allowed to upstage the actors.Enough.  The sad part about this is the utterly foul performance by Mr. Reeve, NO DOUBT pushed in all the wrong directions by the director.  Many of the really bad moments are straight from the direction.  In the beginning, we see Reeves in his office, obviously frustrated about something.  Then he sits at a desk and proceeds to do every little thing a high school thespian would do he picks up the phone, holds it, then hangs up.  He sighs, leans back, purses lips, then suddenly rips a page out of his typewriter and gets up.  Ugh.The worst moments of all - the ones that made me cover me face with a couch pillow because I was embarrassed for him - come when Reeves is called upon to do anything out of the ordinary, like act nervous, talk to himself, mince around being a wiseguy, or do anything other than stand still expressionless.  And for trying to shed the Superman image, there is a leaden moment in this movie where he does the Clark Kent schtick without any disguises.  That made me cringe almost as bad as the moment where he does an impersonation of an uppercrust snob to entertain Seymour. Double-ugh.I know I've really gone after this movie with a hammer, but before I say something good about it, one more thing...  The character Reeve plays is very unlikely to begin with.  An educated, successful playwright who seems to forget everything about theater when he goes back in time.  Also, I find it incredible that what appears to be an incredible delusional psychosis crushing this man makes for anything like a fun time at the movies.  I thought it was funny\/sad the way this man suddenly goes mad, wandering around like a zombie and even goes off by himself on a 'trip.'  Then the silly clothes and all the talking to himself and all the ridiculous things he says with a straight face.  I found no motivation for his sudden departure for the island where his 'adventure' takes place (and watch the shot where he stops at the 'Y' in the road and decides to go left - as good an example of bad acting as anything in Corman).  The film is trying to drop him into an obsession, like Dreyfuss and the mashed potatos in Close Encounters, but you never grasp a reason why, other than he needs to go from point A to point B in order to service the plot.  Szwarc believed endless shots of a camera-conscious Reeve staring at pictures would do the job - hardly!  All you can think of is that if you knew someone who was acting like that, you'd want them on medication, pronto.Aside from all that, the film has two good moments.  The best scene comes along near the end, where the two leads are eating on the floor of their room.  This is the only scene in this 104 minute movie that plays like anything out of a more accomplished film.  There is a well staged and edited series of shots near the end of the scene that have seemed to appear out of a film that is not so obnoxiously innocuous.  The other good moment resides in the last three shots, which have been done before and since (Titanic), but still work magic that shouldn't have appeared in something this drecky.In the end, this movie accomplishes something incredible, in that it makes Love Story seem on the level of Potemkin.

Bits that you wouldn't notice the first time round. Will Shakespeare is played wonderfully by Joseph Fiennes, so well I wonder why I haven't stumbled on him before. Gwynneth Paltrow makes a wonderful Juliet-type character - innocent and sweet and young and well, drop-dead gorgeous. Judi Dench is very overpaid for her minute or so that she plays as the queen, and play it well she does. I absoloutley adore Ben Affleck's performance as the big-headed Ned Alleyn - he has some wonderful lines Will Thank you sir, thou art a gentleman. Ned And you sir, are a s**t-house. I can only assume that the casting director is a fan of the fast show because three of 'em are there, one as the prologue, and two as taxi-boat drivers, and very good they are indeed. Stuff I loved Will's little ritual of spinning round before he sat down to write; Will's wonderful ink-stained knuckles; the taxi-boat driver bit I'm a bit of a playwright meself; the wonderful joke about John Webster; when that guy says well that'll have 'em rolling in the aisles and many many more besides.

The thing that scares the most is not the sight of something horrible or frightening but merely the thought. People who prefer books to films often say that books require much more imagination.

The only indication of a shark is the fact that nothing else could throw around a person like that but a great white.The weakest scenes, in my opinion, are near the end when the shark actively attacks the boat and we see far too much of what is a pretty average model.

A comet (not sure if it was Haleys) wipes out everybody who's standing on the streets to get a peek.  Unless you spent the night inside a steel structure, you're a gonner.  Two sisters manage to do that and try to adjust to being nearly the only survivors to whats happened.  Director Eberhardt has a terrificly photographed scene the morning after; the streets are empty, all is quiet, machines are the only things still operating, and the sky is covered in a red haze.  Along the way the sisters encounter a surviving truck driver, some unscrupulous scientists who want their blood, and psychotic zombies who are slowly dying.  Film has a great mood and a cool soundtrack and a scene teenage girls will savor a mall where everything is FREE!  Stewart and Maroney are cuties and the ending shot has a good gag, so if you want mindless fun, check this out.

A comet (not sure if it was Haleys) wipes out everybody who's standing on the streets to get a peek.  Unless you spent the night inside a steel structure, you're a gonner.  Two sisters manage to do that and try to adjust to being nearly the only survivors to whats happened.

Only this one achieved worldwide recognition. Director Luis Puenzo was a former 30-seconds advertising maker, and it shows pretty well; he masters at timing, lighting and use of music score, but the plot is hopelessly poor and kitsch. He knew the time was right for such a movie and he did it -actually winning the Oscar seems to have been a too oversized prize. I do accept the film was useful to let foreigners know what have happened here, but this alone does not make a great movie -not even a good one.
