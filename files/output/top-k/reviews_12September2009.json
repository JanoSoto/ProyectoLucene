There are no real moralizing overarching themes they exist on the merit of wit and wordplay. Now in that, they are wonderfully successful and entertaining. So why adapt them into a film- namely a Disney film, known for it's life lessons and happy endings? Well that is the question that everyone would like answered.While glimpses of the original wit shine through during the entire movie, there is a disconnect in the obliged Disney storyfication. Now I never begrudge Disney for tailoring their sources to their trademark pattern- they do it so well. However this time it does feel a misstep choosing a source so unsuitable to their goal. Here the words are a tumbling, bumbling servant, not the framed focus and the morals leave a heavy taste in an otherwise whimsical palette.That being said, Alice is not without its values. The serial stories were mostly entertaining, especially the walrus and the carpenter. Even more than that, the characters are vividly memorably and interesting, though when you really sit down to think about it, not a one is extremely likable or even pleasant.

It was entertaining to say the least. Being that I was eight at the time, and that the movie wasn't in theaters and was in fact on T.V. about 8 years later. When watching, there were and still are a considerable amount of flaws from the video game to the movie. Being that I was and still am a huge Mario fan gives me proper rights to question What were they thinking? The first thing that bothers me is the intro. It's extremely abrupt, there is nothing interesting about it, and it just jumps down your throat like a teacher that won't give you a second crack at a quiz (if that makes any sense). Next is the setting for where most of the movie takes place, the mushroom kingdom. In the games, they all have a mystical, sort of magical premise that you would like to see in any sort of adventure game. However, in the movie they have no regard for such a thing. The mushroom kingdom to the directors was a disgusting run down city ruled by an evil tyrant named Koopa, which brings me to my next point. Yes the main antagonist is Koopa (whether you want to call him KING Koopa or Bowser is up to you to a certain point) But considering that in the games he was called Bowser leaves you with the same question that I asked close to the beginning of this review. Next is the Mario brothers' last names that they lamely mention in the scene where Mario and Luigi get arrested and prosecuted. Mario says that their last names are Mario, and to an extent I can see how that makes for a small laugh, but there's really no excuse for that. If you go to Youtube and look up an inside edition story on Nintendo that dates back to the late 80s, you'll find within that story an interview with an intern at Nintendo of America explaining that the Mario brothers' last names are in fact NOT Mario he says that some things just have no answers and in my perspective I think that the directors should have taken a lesson from that. Anyway, the overall premise to the movie in itself is kind of unique, it blends family humor, with action, and gritty world themes. However, that was a turn-off to most critiques and fans alike. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but I have the absolute most respect to people who did. There are so many other problems with this film that stray from the Mario plot, and in the movie itself. Most of you will probably know that Bob Hoskins called it a F-ing nightmare, and if you didn't know this already then you heard it hear. The game's creator and also one of the most important gaming figures on the planet (Shigeru Miyamoto) said himself that he wished the movie was never made. But in a lot of ways I see past that, this movie is almost so bad it's funny, and in a lot of ways holds a good deal of nostalgia for me. So if you're looking for a good quality movie worthy of Oscar material, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a flick to laugh AT instead of with, and to embrace the impurity that lies within this movie and that so many Mario fans alike share, then look no further.

To me, Tommy was always more about religion and acceptance than crass commercialism and familial dysfunction.But hey, what do I know? In spite of what, to me, is a blinding message error, Tommy is superbly, sharply entertaining, and the message it gives is still one that needs to be heard. That ancient cliché that money is the root of all evil comes to a boiling, tense, child-abusing head in this whacked-out opera, beautifully designed and staged and intriguingly acted.The songs are done just brilliantly (for the most part)-- very few problems there. But the song Champagne (written for the film, not featured in the original album) morphs into a disgusting mud-wrestling fantasy involving soap suds, chocolate, and baked beans. Gross, right? Those three or four minutes could be dropped out, no problem.The musical cameos are great. I've never before been able to stand performances by Tina Turner or even Eric Clapton, and Elton John-- well, it's pretty much this and The Lion King, ya know?

Also, most shockingly of all, Jack Nicholson shows off his vocal chops-- and actually does a pretty good job! There is, however, a rather awkward moment in Sensation where Roger Daltrey attempts to throatily sustain a note that is much too high for him-- wasn't there another take they could use? Most of the characters in the film do some really evil things, and the challenge for the audience is reserving judgment to look at the bigger picture, which we see quite clearly in the climactic We're Not Gonna Take It. Along the way you'll find some typical 70s dementia, some typical Ken Russell oddness, and some typical Robert Stigwood musical exaltation. On the last note there, it's better than Stigwood's Grease and infinitely better than his Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. If you're a fan of the original album, this film may drive you crazy. At least for a while. But for anyone, it takes some getting used to. But once you're used to it, it's a masterpiece-- with a couple minor faults.

I can't really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation thrusts her to the top of their lists. As a little girl, I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper- it was my absolute favorite costume.Honestly, I don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it still rings true.As for the characters, if nothing else, Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is evil to the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way. Her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her- she doesn't need staffs of lightening to strike fear into your heart. The animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiotic Gus. I would have cheered had he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was no pushover- making some justly catty remarks at times. However, she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic. Sure, she was nice and fed animals, but what was keeping her at that place? We never know. Even if she only became a maid in another house, at least she'd be getting paid and have a shot at respect. It seems the only reason things work out in the end for Cindy is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap.

Some big standards originated here- A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes, So This is Love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo...Cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights.

With that as a start, let me continue.The roles of Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp were well-cast and portrayed. The actors bore reasonable physical resemblance to the real men. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was superb; I thought his portrayal was more accurate than that of Val Kilmer in Tombstone, his personality and his appearance.... although with friends, Doc Holliday was a pretty affable gentleman.The story was a nice story, although there were significant problems with some of the historical accuracy. First, Morgan and Virgil were NOT shot on the same night... actually 3 months apart. Things like that bother me when seeing a supposedly historically accurate film. But what I considered the weakest part of this movie (and Tombstone as well) was the very incomplete and weak buildup to the gunfight. There was so much more that happened, so much that affected the relationship between the good guys and the bad, so much missing that both films almost made the fight look like a spur of the moment battle... which is far from factual. What many people don't realize is that Bat Masterson spent time in Tombstone during this era, although not directly involved in the action; also, Luke Short was a major ally of Wyatt's throughout this time.I very much liked that Wyatt's young life was shown... his time as town constable, his marriage to Urilla Sutherland, her death and his resulting devastation, his pony stealing in Arkansas... all things that most folks never realized.I would very much liked to have seen more of Wyatt's revenge ride and subsequent deaths and scattering of the Clanton gang. Also, the absence of any sequence involving the robbery of the Benson stage and the killing of Bud Philpot and Peter Roehrig is regrettable, as this was a major factor leading to the battle. Also, as a result of the stage robbery, we should have seen a sequence regarding Wyatt's agreement with Ike about turning in the robbers. Finally, how Behan backed out on his deal with Wyatt regarding the sheriff's office... a major factor in the animosity between the two men.Yes... there are many other missing historical incidents that would have made the film more accurate and real.Anyone who has an interest in this era should see the film.

Spielberg's battle scenes are really something &#x96; ten years later I still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the Normandy beach &#x96; the audience is put right in it. Other than that I remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined French village and the final scene 40 years later. I had to be reminded that it was Tom Hanks who led the rescue team (I do recall Vin Diesel in it too), so the acting didn't leave much impression. The actors were overpowered by all the action.Perhaps comparing this blockbuster with Tarantino is not fair, Both films entertain in there own way &#x96; Spielberg, who gives us splendid visuals, is utterly conventional and offends very few viewers and Tarantino does things his own way and doesn't care who he offends (though he does not make light of atrocity). Has the second world war movie run its course? Even if the answer is yes we have not seen the end of war movies in general. As long as there are wars there will be movies about them. Ryan at least tells a coherent story, and survival stories are usually both pretty gripping and mildly uplifting. Tarantino, on the other hand is inclined toward nihilism, but he does have fun getting there. Spielberg is more hard work, but Ryan has to be one of his better films.

Either peole were NOT interested, or the very first viewers told all their friends to avoid at all costs. While it's not a terrible film, in the end Cutthroat Island amounts to little more that a string of clichés, which attempts to take us back to the days of Errol Flynn, but instead becomes a rip-off.Scene one introduces us to Morgan Adams, a cunning young lady and a tough pirate. Shortly after the opening credits end, her father dies, but before he does, he makes Morgan captain of his ship, and gives her a piece of a map. It is a map to Cutthroat Island, where a massive treasure is supposedly buried. The map piece she has however is in Latin, and no one aboard speaks or reads it. They sail to Port Royal in hopes of finding a slave who speaks it. They find and purchase one, Dr. William Shaw, arrested for thievery. The next step is to find the other two pieces of the map, and one of them is in the hands of Morgan's evil uncle, 'Dog' who also wants the treasure. It now becomes a race for the gold and glitter. Meanwhile, the Royal navy has set out to catch Morgan.Cutthroat Island offers everything you might expect. There is sword play, gun play, jailbreaks, storms at sea, ship battles, and booty. All of this however is presented in a mediocre way. Most of the action scenes are unconvincing, badly choreographed, and too much is in slow-mo, especially during the climax.Next there is the problem of acting and characterization. What Geena Davis does is not acting, it is play acting. Her character amounts to little more than a girl who can wield a sword, and command a crew. Matthew Modine as Shaw is equally two-dimensional, although he is occasionally quirky. Frank Langella as a villain does nothing but growl and sneer. He doesn't even look like a pirate. His haircut for instance is too short, and would not be possible without a modern electric razor.On the positive side, at least it's watchable. Seeing as the film is mostly one action scene after another, you keep watching just to see what happens next, but it never gets better. I doubt it will be long before Cutthroat Island fades into oblivion, considering it is the biggest financial loss to this day. While it is not the worst movie, oblivion is probably where it belongs.

The hallucinations become increasingly bizarre as Jacob struggles to overcome the painful memories of his son (played by Macaulay Culkin) who was killed while he was in the war.Lyne uses seemingly ordinary images to evoke the fear and sickness that Jacob suffers with, from vapid shower curtains and naked spines, to the grotesque slab of meat inside a refrigerator&#x97;all induce a sense of estrangement and insanity. Later he uses more horror-styled elements coiled reptilian tails, saber-tooth's, convulsing heads built on paint bucket shakers, etc.The nonlinear style cuts back and forth between Jacob's present life in NY and his former life in Viet Cong. At times, flashes of a later life (i.e. an afterlife) appear on screen that seem to foreshadow his inevitable fate. Jacob begins to see literal demons infiltrate his perceptual awareness, haunting and tearing at his soul, causing him to sink lower and lower into the depths of madness as he struggles to let go of his memories and embrace death. But are these demons real, or are they simply figments of his hallucinatory imagination? Along the way, he shares multiple conversations with his guardian angel chiropractor, Louis (Danny Aiello), who imparts very peculiar, almost preachy wisdom to Jacob to help him calm his hellish nightmares. Quoting from Meister Eckhart (the master of Negative Theology), he says Eckhart saw Hell too; he said 'the only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you,' he said. 'They're freeing your soul.

But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.' Most of the time, the viewer is unaware of where the story is headed.

The film, as Fellini describes, is self-indulgent. It was not made for public fanfare or critic accolades, but was more of an iconoclastic push-in-the-face to media in general. The autobiographical story follows the crowded life of film director, Guido, who, in the midst of making a larger-than-life science fiction film, suffers from an existential crisis.We travel through many surreal corridors, many of which are either incoherent or elusive, but all of which represent the psychology of Guido's memories\/dreams as he painstakingly struggles to complete his film. In this aspect, the journey of a filmmaker actually making a film, despite its highly stylized qualities, is very realistic. The non-linearity and seemingly capricious juxtapositions of both Guido's film within Fellini's film mirror each other. In fact, Fellini uses Guido and his story as an extension of his own two struggling filmmakers who seek to complete their masterpieces.Although extremely challenging to the the viewer's patience, in retrospect the film can be very rewarding.

The autobiographical story follows the crowded life of film director, Guido, who, in the midst of making a larger-than-life science fiction film, suffers from an existential crisis.We travel through many surreal corridors, many of which are either incoherent or elusive, but all of which represent the psychology of Guido's memories\/dreams as he painstakingly struggles to complete his film. In this aspect, the journey of a filmmaker actually making a film, despite its highly stylized qualities, is very realistic. The non-linearity and seemingly capricious juxtapositions of both Guido's film within Fellini's film mirror each other. In fact, Fellini uses Guido and his story as an extension of his own two struggling filmmakers who seek to complete their masterpieces.Although extremely challenging to the the viewer's patience, in retrospect the film can be very rewarding.

Specifically, Italian cinema became watershed. Those challenging and sober themes of post-war Neo-realism, though pervasive, began to travel down more expressionistic avenues. Besides peeking around doorjambs and tackling real social issues, a new style emerged, mirroring mental events that displayed subjective memories, imaginary scenes, fantasies and dreams.

Either loved or hated, Badlands was Malick's first full-length, directorial debut that really broke the mold of first-time films of first-time directors very informed by its time, completely understated, well-paced, intelligent, and above all, extremely quiet and contemplative. This atypical style would continue to pervade Malick's later pieces, which, given his 40 years in the business now, has amounted to only six total. That said, Malick has clearly been one of the more thoughtful directors around.Badlands was released at the tail end of the Vietnam war and depicts certain guerrilla warfare tactics as personified through Malick's two main vehicles, Kit Carruthers & Holly Sargis&#x97;a sort of insurrection resurrection of Bonnie and Clyde. Together, the two go on a crime spree, escape from urbanization and set off to live life in the wilderness. The story is said to mirror the classical tale of Peter Pan, and, conspicuously so. Holly's Once upon a time&#x85; voice-over acts as the motherly Wendy figure throughout the film as she embarks upon a rebellious adventure in the lost wilderness with her equally lost and confused boyfriend, Kip.Outside of the occasional murderous outbursts, the beautiful scenery yet bleak atmosphere is really what this film is all about. It's not my favorite Malick piece, but it is a worthy springboard that gave rise to his much more quietly epic masterpieces. And soon to be, with much anticipation, his newly Tree of Life is set to release in 2010. Can't wait!

A series of events take place. He gets his wagons burned and mules killed; he gets into a fight; he's thrown into jail; he gets released and is employed by a competitor to the land-grabbing patriarch upon whose property he apparently trespassed at the outset. It was that initial transgression that got his wagons burned. Low and behold, without so much as a by-your-leave he's trespassing again - this time to reclaim some of his new employer's strayed cattle. There's an inconclusive gunfight. The land-grabbing patriarch's son is psychotic (shades of The Big Country). There's a romantic by-line. The romance is on, then it isn't. Or is it? Someone's flogging guns to the Indians. The wagon containing them is pushed off a cliff. Its not a big drop - a couple of hundred feet. The guns are in crates and most would probably have survived despite a small powder-explosion. But nobody goes to check.Stewart's character had a mission to avenge the death of his brother, killed by Apaches in an ambush. He succeeds and goes back to Laramie. That's about it.As I say; apart from the revenge bit, everything else just wobbles along to no particular conclusion at all. Is the girl going to follow her new love interest back to Laramie? Does she know that he's killed her former lover? Who knows? The location work in America's big, wide, wild west is absolutely splendid. It's definitely the star of the show.
