In addition, I avoided by this means Widmark's Southern drawl, said by those better qualified to judge than myself to be hilariously bogus. When I have seen him in films with English dialogue including Westerns, he has always sounded very urban to me, probably hailing from some part of New York and I have never noticed that he has attempted to change his accent before. So this was probably an isolated attempt that didn't work out. He is, nonetheless, an excellent actor, and we must recall that even our late great Sir John Gielgud made a terrible hash of this too, on the very rare occasions he was induced to speak with a different accent from his plum-in-the mouth, silver tones.If you are looking for a Western of the inferior spaghetti type (I do not include Sergio Leone in that description), with non-stop violence and a corpse a minute, be sure to give this one a miss! Although a war film, its mood for the greater part of the footage is great calm, but a calm fraught with tensions. It takes at least three quarters of an hour for the first death to occur (unless there was a fatality at the Alvarez hacienda in the first few seconds, which I happened to miss, and that is unlikely). And immediately after this fatality, a party of Blues capture a party of Greys, who with hardly a pause turn the tables on the former, but without causing any further losses to either side or even anybody getting wounded. The development of the plot is mainly without physical action, so that I must admit it does tend to drag at times. The main protagonists quietly and stealthily pitch their wits against each other that is why the incident of the severed finger(already mentioned on the general introduction page) comes as such a brutal shock. But the true nature of war, including the American Civil War, is like that much manoeuvring (Am. maneuvering) without very much happening for most of the time, interrupted by sporadic, sudden flare-ups.The main characters are well-drawn with many quirks and foibles and there is much humour in their interaction and the awkward situations they find themselves in. A good example of this is the frustration of Widmark, the one-eyed Confederate colonel, who with the reluctant help of the devious civilian,but pro tem acting colonel, Holden, tries to turn the dude grey-coated soldiers into competent cow-hands. Both Widmark and Holden take turns in being the butt of the various ironies, but the stiff-necked, self-opiniated and bumbling Union major played by O'Neill, is the object of such ironies for most of his on-screen time, including from his commanding officer.The photography is good, the scenery (supposed to be Virginian although the film was said to be shot in Louisiana) is very beautiful, and the costumery and indoor décor quite colourful and well-researched. The women,however, are rather insipid, especially when compared to those belles in a similar situation in the Wayne-Holden opus The Horse Soldiers, not to mention the vivacious Vivienne Leigh in Gone with the Wind, though that is an unfair comparison. Not a movie,then, for those Western fans who like fast action. But, if you are patient enough, there is a terrific finale with a battle, which (to avoid giving too much away), is very reminiscent of a scene from How the West was Won which also involved Richard Widmark and, now I come to think of it, also of a sequence in The Wild Bunch, starring Holden.Although I had already been around for some time when this film first came out, I had hitherto never seen it or even heard of it, despite the fact that I am quite fond of good Westerns, a fan of both the main actors, and have have often been impressed by O'Neill too. I can only imagine that this occurred because it proved a commercial flop, by reason of the faults above-mentioned, and was shelved. It had never been shown before on the channel where I saw it, and there is little that they do not repeat again and again and again.

In addition, I avoided by this means Widmark's Southern drawl, said by those better qualified to judge than myself to be hilariously bogus. When I have seen him in films with English dialogue including Westerns, he has always sounded very urban to me, probably hailing from some part of New York and I have never noticed that he has attempted to change his accent before. So this was probably an isolated attempt that didn't work out. He is, nonetheless, an excellent actor, and we must recall that even our late great Sir John Gielgud made a terrible hash of this too, on the very rare occasions he was induced to speak with a different accent from his plum-in-the mouth, silver tones.If you are looking for a Western of the inferior spaghetti type (I do not include Sergio Leone in that description), with non-stop violence and a corpse a minute, be sure to give this one a miss! Although a war film, its mood for the greater part of the footage is great calm, but a calm fraught with tensions. It takes at least three quarters of an hour for the first death to occur (unless there was a fatality at the Alvarez hacienda in the first few seconds, which I happened to miss, and that is unlikely). And immediately after this fatality, a party of Blues capture a party of Greys, who with hardly a pause turn the tables on the former, but without causing any further losses to either side or even anybody getting wounded. The development of the plot is mainly without physical action, so that I must admit it does tend to drag at times. The main protagonists quietly and stealthily pitch their wits against each other that is why the incident of the severed finger(already mentioned on the general introduction page) comes as such a brutal shock. But the true nature of war, including the American Civil War, is like that much manoeuvring (Am. maneuvering) without very much happening for most of the time, interrupted by sporadic, sudden flare-ups.The main characters are well-drawn with many quirks and foibles and there is much humour in their interaction and the awkward situations they find themselves in. A good example of this is the frustration of Widmark, the one-eyed Confederate colonel, who with the reluctant help of the devious civilian,but pro tem acting colonel, Holden, tries to turn the dude grey-coated soldiers into competent cow-hands. Both Widmark and Holden take turns in being the butt of the various ironies, but the stiff-necked, self-opiniated and bumbling Union major played by O'Neill, is the object of such ironies for most of his on-screen time, including from his commanding officer.The photography is good, the scenery (supposed to be Virginian although the film was said to be shot in Louisiana) is very beautiful, and the costumery and indoor décor quite colourful and well-researched. The women,however, are rather insipid, especially when compared to those belles in a similar situation in the Wayne-Holden opus The Horse Soldiers, not to mention the vivacious Vivienne Leigh in Gone with the Wind, though that is an unfair comparison.

Actually they're pretty good for 1950, when the film was shot. And the story kind of sweeps you up as it moves along, rather as if you'd been standing in front of some porn shop on 42nd Street when the tsunami roared through Times Square.But, fellas and girls, you have to suspend your disbelief big time to not laugh at this one. A group of scientists who insist on calling each other doctor discover that there is a star with a planet in orbit around it, and both are headed towards Earth. The closeness of the planet will cause major disasters before the star smashes into Earth and obliterates it in its entirety. Earth's population is in a hopeless position, with no place to hide. There is no escarpment. But there is a small chance that a couple of dozen humans along with animals and cultigens may escape in a space ship and land on the new star's planet where, they hope and pray, the conditions will be livable.So who's going to get to go? We'll skip the scientific stuff because, although it may all be wildly conjectural, I don't know enough to comment on it. Well, I guess I can say, speaking as a semi-scientist, that if I were to stock a space ship as if it were Noah's Ark, and if every ounce counted, I would take very young goats instead of fully grown goats -- and eggs rather than chickens. The egg always comes before the chicken.The protagonist, the everyday kind of guy the audience is supposed to identify with, is Richard Derr, a blond man who acts in the same way that a pointer indicates the location of a game bird -- Psst. Right there. He looks too much like Danny Kaye for most of us to identify with him since, after all, the majority of male viewers, like me, more closely resemble Cary Grant.But, be that as it may, casting may have made some errors here and there but Barbara Rush isn't one of them. Wow. She looked so gorgeous in a very American way, and continued to do so for years afterward, up to and including Hombre. Why she and Derr, who describes himself accurately as no more than an aerial taxi driver, fall for each other and foul up the affair between Rush and an honest doctor, I don't know. I believe that when there are only eleven days left before the total destruction of the planet, she is still fussing over which guy she should marry, the honest doc or the lowbrow rogue she loves. Eleven days left and she's worried about being happy for the rest of her life.It could be argued that if the term stereotypical applied to anything at all, the characters in this film would qualify -- the earnest scientist\/father, the devoted humane daughter, the self-sacrificing doctor, the adventuresome but modest pilot, the arrogant selfish millionaire, the two innocent young lovers, the humble but honest goats, the constantly bickering chickens, the cows in their unashamedly stupid rusticity, the dildo-shaped space ship eager to get going.And the story plays false with its own values. The murderous and cowardly millionaire who funds the project (played by Hoyt, who did a fine job in MGM's Julius Caesar) isn't allowed to choose anyone to accompany him on the dicey space trip. Every passenger is chosen by lot, except those who are necessary to the trip's successful completion. And we're all for excluding this snarling rich guy. But the rules are violated in order to include Barbara Rush, though her only job has been passing out sandwiches to the work crew. Why? Because her scientist\/father is the chief organizer and he loves her. And Richard Derr is bootlegged aboard too. Why? Because SHE loves HIM. Absolutely nothing is made of this chink in the lottery. It's presented with the blessings of the producers.Well, the script can't be swallowed anyway. The night he finds out that the Earth will be destroyed, Richard Derr and Barbara Rush go to a night club. He gets tipsy and begins lighting cigarettes with ten-dollar bills while she gazes at him admiringly, and the scene ends with them chuckling together over the fact that money means nothing anymore. If someone informed you, right now, that the planet would be destroyed in a few weeks and everyone on Earth was doomed, is that what you would be doing tonight? Still, this thing is so simple minded and the effects so spectacular for their day that it's worth watching.

What Valerie Martin did with the book was to take the story, and instead of exploring the conflict in Harry Jekyll, exploring the psyche of the broken servant girl, and gives an interesting view into life as it was for the underclass in the Victorian London.Mary Reilly is the soft spoken and demure chambermaid who works in the house of the rather eccentric Dr. Harry Jekyll. He is a gentle man and shows an interest in Mary's story in a way that she is not used to from her masters. At the same time she is fascinated by the uncivilized and crazed fervor of the master's assistant, Edward Hyde.The scenery and imagery is eerie and elusive, and at the same time visceral and physical and it is constantly covered in the smog of the industrial age. There is no attempt to pretty up the destitution and the physical and moral corruption of London in the Victorian age, a contrast to many other period pieces as they show the Victorian age as something elegant and romantic. This is dirt and gold side by side. Examples are the trip down butcher alley with Edward Hyde and the sight of the autopsy slab through the swinging doors. This also counts as some of the most unpleasant scenes to watch, but there is also a few hints of gore in this. The prostitute's bedroom is nauseating.Julia Roberts is good in this role, dodgy accent aside, I think it is so annoying to hear people continue to rant about it. Yeah the accent is crap, but is easy to disassociate from if you try. I think that Roberts give a very good performance, her eyes are haunted, and her body language speaks of a cowed spirit. There is tuned down from the Hollywood glamour, and it really suits her.John Malkovich is absolutely spectacular, the lack of attempt on an English accent I barely thought of. He is gentle and soft spoken as Jekyll, yet all the time with a glitter of madness in his eyes, it's wonderful. Yet he is perfect as Mr. Hyde, the madness, the brutality, his coarseness, a man completely enslaved by his urges. John Malkovich smoothly glides through both roles Other memorable performances is Glenn Close as the greedy brothel owner, and Michael Gambon as Mary's monstrous father, he's a man of one's nightmares.I thought Mary Reilly such a fascinating film because it is so phycological, a person with a little knowledge of Freud and Jung will be to see that parallels in the story to their theories. Exactly why I don't consider it a problem that Jekyll and Hyde are not difficult to separate in their looks. They are supposed to be two sides of the same person, while they also have a little bit of the opposite in them. The idea of Jekyll and Hyde being the two projectors for Mary's desire is ingenious, the gentle and the ferocious, the safety drive and the sex drive.

This film is not for those people who wants a gorish horror movie with everything served. This film is for people who does not mind a slow pace, but likes to savor the characters and the mood of this.

Its story of young Salvatore Toto who discovers the magic of the movies through his friendship with projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) has potential, but too often falls prey to false sentimentality, muddled storytelling, and unbelievable characters. It got to the point where I thought that the remote Sicilian village wasn't even a real location, but rather a soundstage set (the piazza seems too big and tidy).I watched the 122-minute version, not the 170-minute director's cut, but I still felt that Cinema Paradiso was too long, padded with innumerable local color scenes. The townspeople&#151;who are all stock comic characters, including a village idiot&#151;sit in the movie theater and react quirkily to the film they're watching. Presumably, this is meant to show how important the cinema is for them, bringing glamour and romance into their difficult lives. But since you never get a sense of what these people are individually like outside the movie theater, the contrast between real life and reel life isn't deeply felt.Toto is not a very sympathetic character in any of his three incarnations. At first, he is an annoyingly impish, prank-pulling little boy; then a lovesick and wildly impractical teenager; then a successful middle-aged film director who seems to have no inner life whatsoever. (Evidently, the middle-aged Toto is more developed in the director's cut, but I don't know if I have the patience to sit through that one!) The movie's attempt at heart-tugging romance falls flat because Toto's love interest Elena is so poorly characterized--all actress Agnese Nano has to do is stand there and look pretty. Noiret is good, though, moving beyond the cliché of the crusty but lovable mentor to reveal Alfredo's deep bitterness and determination that Toto not make the same mistakes he did. The famous ending montage of all the screen kisses that a conservative priest had censored is a lovely celebration of old Hollywood, but nothing that you can't find in the Academy Awards tribute montages every year. It also requires a major suspension of disbelief&#151; weren't all these prints lost when the movie theater burned down? The best scene in Cinema Paradiso, coming closest to conveying just what's so special about the movies, is when Alfredo turns his movie projector to face the window and screens a film on the outside of a building.

Its story of young Salvatore Toto who discovers the magic of the movies through his friendship with projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) has potential, but too often falls prey to false sentimentality, muddled storytelling, and unbelievable characters. It got to the point where I thought that the remote Sicilian village wasn't even a real location, but rather a soundstage set (the piazza seems too big and tidy).I watched the 122-minute version, not the 170-minute director's cut, but I still felt that Cinema Paradiso was too long, padded with innumerable local color scenes. The townspeople&#151;who are all stock comic characters, including a village idiot&#151;sit in the movie theater and react quirkily to the film they're watching. Presumably, this is meant to show how important the cinema is for them, bringing glamour and romance into their difficult lives. But since you never get a sense of what these people are individually like outside the movie theater, the contrast between real life and reel life isn't deeply felt.Toto is not a very sympathetic character in any of his three incarnations. At first, he is an annoyingly impish, prank-pulling little boy; then a lovesick and wildly impractical teenager; then a successful middle-aged film director who seems to have no inner life whatsoever. (Evidently, the middle-aged Toto is more developed in the director's cut, but I don't know if I have the patience to sit through that one!) The movie's attempt at heart-tugging romance falls flat because Toto's love interest Elena is so poorly characterized--all actress Agnese Nano has to do is stand there and look pretty. Noiret is good, though, moving beyond the cliché of the crusty but lovable mentor to reveal Alfredo's deep bitterness and determination that Toto not make the same mistakes he did. The famous ending montage of all the screen kisses that a conservative priest had censored is a lovely celebration of old Hollywood, but nothing that you can't find in the Academy Awards tribute montages every year. It also requires a major suspension of disbelief&#151; weren't all these prints lost when the movie theater burned down? The best scene in Cinema Paradiso, coming closest to conveying just what's so special about the movies, is when Alfredo turns his movie projector to face the window and screens a film on the outside of a building. The beam of silver light shoots through the empty black air; for an instant, all is magical, illuminated, even incendiary.

Anna Leonowens (1831-1915) was indeed a real person who did indeed teach in the royal court of Siam. She did not allow fact to get in the way of a good story; while her memoirs were extremely popular, they were also fictionalized. They became further so in 1944, when novelist Margaret Langdon retold the story in the novel ANNA AND THE KING; a play and film, the latter with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, soon followed and proved popular as well. According to theatre lore, actress Gertrude Lawrence, one of the great talents of her era, encountered the material and recommended it to Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein with the thought that she herself might play Anna in a musical version.Opening on Broadway in 1951 with Lawrence in the lead, it proved a tremendous success. Sadly, Lawrence did not live to recreate the role for the screen; she died of cancer during the New York run. After much indecision and not a little argument, the role fell to Deborah Kerr--a memorable actress--but one whose singing voice was hardly up to the role. In consequence the songs were voiced by the ubiquitous Marnie Nixon, a performer who specialized in this work throughout the 1950s and 1960s.As a film, THE KING AND I belongs to a period during which Hollywood tended to approach musicals from a theatrical rather than a cinematic point of view there is no pretense that we are any where but on a sound stage and the camera itself seldom moves, creating an effect that is very much like that a performance given on a proscenium stage. It is a style which has not aged well--but THE KING AND I is the exception that proves the rule with outrageously colorful sets, brilliant costuming, memorable music, and remarkable performances it remains as enchanting as it was when it first debuted in 1956.It is also distinctly of its era in terms of casting. Voice aside, Deborah Kerr was a natural choice for the role of Anna; she too was a cultured Englishwoman. But although minor roles were generally played by people of Asian origin, none of the leads and few of the major supporting roles were. Yul Brennar was of Russian origin; Rita Moreno was Puerto Rican (and, like Kerr, her singing voice would be dubbed); Martin Benson (Kralahome) was English; Carlos Rivera (Lun Thai) was Mexican-American; and so on. Such would be quite unthinkable today, but there is no getting around the fact that all these performers give performances which are not only credible, but often extraordinary--with Brennar and Moreno cases in point.Regardless of who, what, why, and how, the end result is enchanting from start to finish, the sort of musical that is stamped as a special event from start to finish. Everything glitters; the music is among the best created by Rogers and Hammerstein; the larger-than-life performances are spot-on. The story itself is both endearing and touching--and, as is often the case with Rogers and Hammerstein, makes an oblique statement against racial prejudice. While it may not be good history (the story so annoys the Thailand government that it is banned from that nation in all its many incarnations), it is delightful entertainment... and, in my opinion at least, the best of the Rogers and Hammerstein musicals both on the stage and on the screen.GFT, Amazon Reviewer ","genre":null},{"date":"10 June 2007","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" THE KING AND I has a remarkably convoluted history.

He wrote an up-to-date, ORIGINAL thriller misplaying a talent far greater than all that stuff in Star Wars, etc. (I saw a docu on TCM the about the making of those action-films the same night I saw this movie.......brilliant for their time, showing the difficulty it took to get them made and released.) However Body Heat has A STORY, told perfectly with a genius we all can relate-to and understand, with a superb cast.....all of them becoming major stars. As it unfolded, I experienced deja' vu, but wasn't really sure.The heat between Turner and William Hurt (Ned) was palpable; with lines like maybe you need a tune-up (Hurt) and she saw oral work on about 7-or-8 inches (as told to the DA by the young daughter); Hurt's manly-sexy body; Turner's gorgeous, sensuous body; the subtle-but steamingly realistic sex-scenes; Lady, do you want to f--k and she's trying to f--k me to death (both by Hurt). Those lines may be a trifle racy to some folk, but that's the way we speak. The revelation that Tuner and Hurt met the entire crew naked is a shocker. Have you ever known of such daring in ANY other film? Ted Danson (Lowenstein) was clever and totally convincing in his role, even with his soft-shoe. Oscar Grace (J.A.Peterson) was the savvy detective with affection for the man he knew was guilty; somehow, I missed the planning of the murder, I thought Ned jealously wanted Mattie for himself. Mickey Rourke was very believable as the arsonist.....the sets and costumes, cinematography and moodiness, the great acting by everyone in this film certainly makes it one to see over and over.I finally realized I HAD seen Body Heat before when Mattie walked toward the boat-house, and intuitively knew she never got there, as Ned did in jail. We suppose Ned went to prison, but we knew Mattie got her wish to be rich, but didn't find happiness even though she got her hubby's money (Richard Krenner) and had another stud on an exotic beach.As ribarproductions asserts, this movie deserves a sequel, but who would play the roles as well? I don't know of any other actress who can project total sexiness, just by speaking her lines, as Turner did.

World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland.The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film.The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia.The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced.

Thus works the perfect reward-and-punishment, cause-and-effect, code of the universe. We live out in our present life what we wrote out in our last. But the great moral thriller also orders us to rage against karma and its despotic dictates. It teaches us to subvert it. To change it. It tells us we also write out our next lives as we live out our present. ~ The Alchemy of Desire &#151; Tarun J. TejpalI first saw this film in 1998 with my 6-year old son. And even though he asked a lot of questions, I could see he loved it. I believe he understood it. That's what happens when a work of art is perfectly conceived and executed. The theme, plot and message are so transparent even a relative babe can appreciate them.Last night, now 14 and a freshman in HS, he was looking through our video collection. I was fascinated watching him make his choice. At first, he toyed with films like WILD, WILD WEST and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC. Then he chanced to lay a hand on GATTACA, which he had not seen for eleven years, and to my mind, had forgotten.I want to see GATTACA again, he said. I realized his choice would open whole new levels of appreciation. Seeing it again, we were not disappointed. After, my son said, They don't make films like this any more; there'd have to a long chase and a shootout.Sad, because 1997 was only 10-years ago. It seems like we could have held onto decent stories for a little while longer. In fact, it seems like we could have continued to demand them. 1997 was also the year LA CONFIDENTIAL came out, another under-appreciated film with a great story line. There haven't been many recently. ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"}]
