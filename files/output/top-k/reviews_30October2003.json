Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew Ace. Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this Goodfells Part 2. Is it Goodfellas Part 2, in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. Casino is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says It's more like Disney Land now. Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace! Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my Rober DeNiro A history of his films that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has hired her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!, you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1\/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song Gimme Shelter by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. Casino is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to Goodfellas, let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250.

The feeling that I always get upon each viewing is why the big deal?.  I think that feeling might be because after over thirty years, the revelationary film making that seemed so fresh and new in 1971 is now hackneyed.  The whole look has been done to death and WAS done to death by copy-cat films of the 70's.  For example, Death Wish in 1974 may have had an entirely different plot from The French Connection but it's look is a ripoff of TFC.  The gritty look must've seemed like something so new and invigorating back in the early '70s just like the neo-realism of Italian films of the late 40's looked so fresh back then.  So with the look of the film not seeming new, the films plot and other elements stand out.  OK..the plot is fine and pretty interesting and the characters are certainly well played.  BUT, I agree with another poster here how could anyone pull apart a huge car (a Continental now less!) put it all back together and have no one notice?  And yes, again I agree how could the Frog 1 character get away from the Island?  And more why would such a big drug deal go down with so many people around (what? Did they invite the guys whole family?) and in such a public place?  How about a simple motel room or something where it mostly happens?  And the car chase did this really happen?  If it did, don't you think Doyle should have been reprimanded?  He drove incredibly reckless, nearly ran over a mother and her child and wrecked a guys car.  Also, there's scene of a car wreck that inexplicably dwells on the people hurt and\/or killed in it.  Why does the camera show us this?  I kept thinking it has something to do with the plot but it was all gratuitous.  It was probably added to make everything more realistic.  It may sound like quibbles and I'm sure most people seeing The French Connection in '71 didn't mind all the plot wholes but they stood out to me.  And yes, I DID appreciate the little details like Doyle standing freezing outside the restaurant while Frog 1 and one of his cronies are eating a luscious meal.  I don't mean to imply that the film isn't well made or not taut and suspenseful, it's just that in hind sight, it doesn't hold up too well.  And don't get me wrong...it's certainly NOT boring and Hackman and Schneider are fantastic as is Ray.  Overrated yes...Great-No.  Watchable and entertaining..certainly.  And one more thing.  I LOVE New York and this movie makes NY look like an urban HELL whole.  While certainly a lot of the city probably wasn't pretty (and still isn't) and in '71 a lot of it was falling apart, I think there was a conscience effort by the film makers to make the city look as bad as possible.

Ridley Scott, with the help of breathtaking, brilliant Alien design from H.R. Giger, takes the viewer to the very end of the nightmare tunnel, the darkest recesses of the worst nightmare imaginable. This movie is made on a shoestring budget and the old fashioned way, with imagination and talent. The end result is the absolute epitome of horror that gets better with age. The Nostromo is a mining ship, a huge towing vessel, created with sets that were dark, claustrophobic and unforgiving. Most of these sets were made out of old airplane parts and the result was a spectacular achievement in horror, with flickering lights, gently swaying and clanking chains and dripping water, providing a sinister environment for a most unwelcome guest.The crew and cast are a blue-collar lot of unknowns, but the chemistry and acting is superb, disturbing and believable, enhancing the absolutely real horror that awaits each one of them. There are no superheros here, as they were in no way prepared for what awaited them. They are scared, and rightfully so, and no one projects this better than Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, the very embodiment of a hysterical, sobbing woman scared out of her wits...and for very good reason. This is simply the scariest movie ever made, so enough niceness and on with the review!On a scale of 1.0-10.0 (worst-best)MOVIE 10.0\/10.0 Simply the best horror film ever made, an outstanding classic that keeps on scaring.Alien is truly awesome from beginning to end. The hands on effort and imagination of Scott Ridley is stunning, even in this day and age of special effects and CGI. The designs of Giger are wildly original, horrifically breathtaking and unforgettable. The editing by Terry Rawlings was crisp and parsimonious, making for a perfect storm of a horror flick. No one who has seen Alien will ever forget the dinner scene, one of the most dramatic even to be presented to an unwary viewer. Even the actors were unaware of what was coming down, maximizing the effect of the event. Memorable!SOUNDTRACK 10.0\/10.0 All I can say is Wow!Jerry Goldsmith hits home run after home run with the score for this movie. Never has the terror been enhanced more than by this wonderful score and timely cues. A magnificent effort.BADASSCICITY &#129;?(that's INFINITY!)\/10.0 It can never get any badder than the Alien.It is almost always dangerous to project an absolute about anything, but as far as I am concerned, everyone else can just flush their so-called monsters or baddasses down the sewer. Green Goblin in Spiderman, yeah, right! I'm sorry, there just can't be anything in reality or the human imagination that can top this creature that we barely get to see during most of this horror classic. The metaphorically rich design of this snarling, biting, chomping, eviscerating and head-banging nightmare from the bowels of hell can never be duplicated or topped. If you disagree with me, then you are wrong. If you think the Predator had a bad attitude, you will not believe the unchartable hostility that the Alien carries around as second nature. The Predator, as tough as he was is about the equivalent of the Pillsbury doughboy when compared to this &#129;gbad boy&#129;h. Ash said it best, &#129;g It's structural perfection is only matched by its hostility...Perfect organism...unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.&#129;h Chilling.SET DESIGN\/ARTWORK 20.0\/10.0 No computer graphics in Alien, they did it with imagination and talent.Every time I revisit this movie, I must take pause to reflect on the enormous raw talent and creativity that made it possible. The ships are organic, almost alive as was terrifyingly demonstrated by the creepy, cavernous spaceship that surrounded an even creepier Space Jockey. I cannot say enough about the use of lighting and sound which complimented Goldsmith's wonderful musical score. Ridley Scott is a genius and his creativity with using ordinary objects and hands on attention to detail make this film what it is. The design of the Alien monster is a feat that will probably never be duplicated.CORPSE COUNT 10.0\/10.0 We will really never know, will we? While this is not as important in a horror movie as it is in a Carnage\/Action movie, I think that special mention should be made of the creativity of the Alien kills. We never know how many he or his gene line have killed previously. It's what it does best. Violent does not begin to describe his methodology....Heart-stopping.SAPPINESS .01\/10.0 No love here at all Kudos to Ridley Scott for axing a scene that would have alluded some sort of thing between Dallas and Ripley. Alien does not distract the viewer or detract from the fear by any sort of mushiness. By the end of the movie Ripley has demonstrated that she has some &#129;gballs&#129;h even though we see that she is all female when we are treated to just one glimpse of her barely pantied mons in what was the only scene in the movie that could be considered marginally erotic. This movie takes care of business, and its business is to turn your underwear brown.~SPOILERS CORNER~ Major Spoilers below here, so if you haven't seen the movie, be warned!WoW! I don't know where to begin.... From the terrifying sets to the even more terrifying Alien, with a very sinister elongated head replete with rows of smashing teeth, the viewer is uneasy and usually scared shirtless, time and time again. The movie literally oozes with organic evil as the makers of Alien put on a clinic of how to scare you properly! Ridley Scott shows you just enough to make your imagination and terror run wild as the viewer only get glimpses of the terror of all terrors.There are 3 scenes in this movie that really stand out. First, of course is the Last Supper chest-bursting scene. Much has been said and written about this, you must see it to believe it, one of the most dramatic scenes ever attempted on the screen. It was brilliant! The second scene was when Brett went to retrieve the cat, Jones. You just knew, you just knew that when Brett went through those double doors that something terrible was about to happen. The sets literally emanate haunting malevolence as the inconsistent lighting, the swaying, clanking chains, the dripping water and the dirty, grimy mining machinery, poised to come alive at any moment! Here is where first Jones and then the doomed Brett get a first look at the monster and brother what a monster he is! I still get chill bumps as Jone is a non-human witness to an unparalleled ruthless brutality with those chains still swaying and clanking, HELL YES!The third memorable scene employs what a great horror movie always employs and that is the unexpected and ingenious plot twist. Ash is revealed as a Company planted robot, charged with bringing the Alien back to earth in an ultra violent and equally terrifying reality check at Mother's console. That oozing milk-mouth, and the reverberating and super chilling voice of the freshly decapitated Ash, did nothing to encourage what was left of the Nostromo crew. He coldly let them have it between the eyes as to what they were REALLY up against. Unforgettable.

Y Tu Mama Tambien (translated as And Your Mother Too) is the story of two young men in present-day Mexico (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) who have just graduated from high school and are looking for a hot summer without their girlfriends (Ana Lopez Mercado Ortega and Maria Aura Boullosa) who are traveling abroad in Europe during their time away from their studies. Luna and Bernal think the summer will be great, but soon they realize that may not end up being the case. The duo attend a wedding and meet sexy 30-something Spaniard Maribel Verdu (in an appropriately erotic and steamy performance). Soon the awkward teens who always seem to be drinking, smoking and doping are flirting with her and wanting her to come to the beach with them (a fictional place called Heaven's Mouth). She explains she is married (ironically to Luna's stuck-up cousin, played by the scene-stealing Juan Carlos Remolina Suarez) and the duo leave her alone. Very soon after the wedding Verdu learns the results of some medical tests and it is made apparent that something extremely serious is ailing the beauty. Trying to come to terms with her illness, she learns that Suarez has had multiple affairs and she sinks into a deep depression. Her fright and sadness turn around when she remembers the offer from the youngsters and she contacts them immediately. The duo believes that this is the best thing that could have ever happened. In spite of the fact that Heaven's Mouth does not exist, they do not let that small inconvenience stop them from having an opportunity to be with a hot older woman. In the U.S. cinema this would all point the way to a silly teenage road trip film with over-sexed boys on the prowl, but Y Tu Mama Tambien is not like that at all. It is a trip that will forever alter the trio's lives, making them question their wants, their needs, their friendships, their relationships, their sexualities, their places in a complicated world and their futures. As all this goes on they find a Mexico that none have ever seen before, a place where drug dealers and cops have waged war for so long in some areas of the land that there is really no hope or happiness for those unlucky enough to be innocent bystanders. Poverty and uncertainty also plague many that the group pass along the way on a seemingly endless trip into something unknown. Y Tu Mama Tambien may actually be the finest production to come out of Mexico. The Mexican cinema has always been mired for one reason or another because of various factors, but they took a huge step forward here. The three leads are revelations, with Verdu possibly becoming an international superstar (hopefully this will help her career the way Malena helped Monica Bellucci) by the film's emotion-packed finale. The Cuaron brothers (Alfonso, who also directed, and Carlos) developed a monumental screenplay (which brought them Oscar nominations) that has its peaks and valleys and actually plays like lives intertwining and touching (much like real-life situations). The script is one of the most brilliant I have ever encountered. Emmanuel Lubezki should also be given kudos for cinematography that almost acts as a fourth lead (the camera work just adds so much to this picture). Censorship has never been a big deal in Mexico with their cinema, but the government stepped in this time. This is a very rough film to sit through. There are excessive sexual scenes that push the envelope on most everything previously seen in the mainstream cinema. The movie was cut down to only about 75 minutes in one version (there should be about 105) and the Cuaron brothers decided against that when the opportunity arose to go international. The movie received no rating in the U.S. (it would have been an NC-17 easily) and due to that fact it became more of an art-house flick, a movie that very few saw and one that most in the typical viewing public had never heard about. In Mexico, Y Tu Mama Tambien became an overnight sensation. It immediately became the country's largest money-maker ever and quite possibly the nation's most talked about production. Strangely the Academy failed to award this movie with a Best Foreign Language Film nomination (Talk to Her also failed that nomination). During a year where the Academy dropped the ball consistently (think Gangs of New York), the snubs to Y Tu Mama Tambien may have been its largest mistake of all. Even though young people under 17 are sometimes advised to steer clear of a movie like this, it is truly apparent that those in that age group are the real ones trying to be reached. Y Tu Mama Tambien teaches you to not always live in the present, but to plan for your future and to let where you are dictate where you are going. Near total excellence. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

This was a real shocker when I first saw it several years ago. There had been violence before, but never so inexplicable. And gore before, but never gore quite so galore before. And that odd, quirky dialog -- alternately clumsy and adroit. It was obviously done on a small budget but did everything it was supposed to do and more.A second viewing, along with some knowledge of Tarrentino's later work, deprives us of the shock but gives us a better perspective on the movie. A couple of things stand out.One is that Tarrentino is like Howard Hawks in depriving his characters of any background. (That's about all he and Hawks have in common.) There have rarely been such rootless people wandering around on the screen. In this instance, there is a father\/son pair, but nobody else has any family, few real friendships except those developed in the course of the narrative. There is no ethnic solidarity. Nobody has a home or a dog. Nobody has a job. Nobody has a girlfriend. These characters are like the ones Shakespeare warned us about, coming out of air, thin air.Another thing is the catholic derivativeness of the story and the scenes. Tarrentino may have made an art movie here but he's gobbled up bits and pieces of every kind of film imaginable, from superior stuff to schlock. The claustrophobic feeling of being cooped up in a warehouse with people you don't know and can't trust, he claims, was borrowed from Carpenter's junk version of The Thing. The moment when everyone is pointing guns at everyone else, waiting for someone to fire first, seems to be from the climactic scene of The Wild Bunch. The exclusive use of pop rock in the score has been done by Scorcese and others. But it's hard to be sure that these are borrowings because, to the extent they are, such borrowings have never seen in such multitudes and so nicely fitted together.The big shootout, of the sort we saw in such detail in Heat, is mostly off screen here, which saves money and doesn't cost the narrative much since it deals mainly with character and motivation and blood. The violence and the blood that follows can be a problem. The focus isn't on suffering, just pain and fear. People bleed enough to fill a bath tub. And that scene in which the bound cop is mutilated by Michael Madsen is a bit too-well set up and executed -- for me, anyway. And this is despite the fact that we don't know the cop, or any of the other characters really. These scenes are just shivers looking for spines to run up. Grown sadists and kids who don't know anxiety may enjoy it more. Interesting anecdote. In an interview, Tarrentino describes how poor Lawrence Tierney was giving his big speech assigning the names of colors to the robbers -- Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, and so on. (Borrowed from The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.) Tierney kept forgetting his lines or blowing them and asking to start again from the top. The other actors were required to sit off screen without moving or changing expression. It took two hours for a satisfactory take.

It was obviously done on a small budget but did everything it was supposed to do and more.A second viewing, along with some knowledge of Tarrentino's later work, deprives us of the shock but gives us a better perspective on the movie. A couple of things stand out.One is that Tarrentino is like Howard Hawks in depriving his characters of any background. (That's about all he and Hawks have in common.) There have rarely been such rootless people wandering around on the screen. In this instance, there is a father\/son pair, but nobody else has any family, few real friendships except those developed in the course of the narrative. There is no ethnic solidarity. Nobody has a home or a dog. Nobody has a job. Nobody has a girlfriend. These characters are like the ones Shakespeare warned us about, coming out of air, thin air.Another thing is the catholic derivativeness of the story and the scenes. Tarrentino may have made an art movie here but he's gobbled up bits and pieces of every kind of film imaginable, from superior stuff to schlock. The claustrophobic feeling of being cooped up in a warehouse with people you don't know and can't trust, he claims, was borrowed from Carpenter's junk version of The Thing. The moment when everyone is pointing guns at everyone else, waiting for someone to fire first, seems to be from the climactic scene of The Wild Bunch. The exclusive use of pop rock in the score has been done by Scorcese and others. But it's hard to be sure that these are borrowings because, to the extent they are, such borrowings have never seen in such multitudes and so nicely fitted together.The big shootout, of the sort we saw in such detail in Heat, is mostly off screen here, which saves money and doesn't cost the narrative much since it deals mainly with character and motivation and blood. The violence and the blood that follows can be a problem. The focus isn't on suffering, just pain and fear. People bleed enough to fill a bath tub. And that scene in which the bound cop is mutilated by Michael Madsen is a bit too-well set up and executed -- for me, anyway. And this is despite the fact that we don't know the cop, or any of the other characters really. These scenes are just shivers looking for spines to run up. Grown sadists and kids who don't know anxiety may enjoy it more. Interesting anecdote. In an interview, Tarrentino describes how poor Lawrence Tierney was giving his big speech assigning the names of colors to the robbers -- Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, and so on. (Borrowed from The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.) Tierney kept forgetting his lines or blowing them and asking to start again from the top. The other actors were required to sit off screen without moving or changing expression. It took two hours for a satisfactory take. All of the other performers who had been sitting like stone idols all that time went suddenly into spasms of twitching, yawning, scratching, and moaning with relief.

A better writer and a better director could have turned this into a real classic.  The elements are all there - they were simply poorly executed.  Instead of the uninspiring ending, it would have been interesting to see more of a duel between the two protagonists, in which their rage and anger and their desire to do good all come into play.

No, The Blair Witch Project is all about insinuations and the unknown. I'll admit that the film is pretty darn creepy, if ineffectively scary.

To expose something ever so briefly so that you think, What was that? and try to play back your videotape again to pause the image. But the film doesn't ever really approach the Blair Witch. Furthermore, it never really explains anything by the end of the film. And I understand that this is the appeal of the film for most people. BUT...I'm not asking to show the Blair Witch chasing them around. All I would have liked to see was at least an ever-so-brief glimpse of some unintelligible being.

This movie sent chills up my spine and made the hairs on my neck stand up at certain points. This is my kind of horror movie--I'm not into the slasher flicks, primarily because I do not find them very scary at all. I'd rather have the images of the attacker lurking in the dark left up to me, not jumping forward at the screen. Am I contradicting myself? I say I do not want to see the Blair Witch, but yet moments later I say I do. No, what I want to see is some effervescent being illuminated in the dark ever so briefly; it would be the ultimate spine-tingler. Remember in Signs how M.

I would have liked something like that--just something very quick and very, very spooky. Not even as detailed as the alien--some far away being standing in the middle of the woods, who suddenly disappears with a shriek.

I'd rather have the images of the attacker lurking in the dark left up to me, not jumping forward at the screen. Am I contradicting myself? I say I do not want to see the Blair Witch, but yet moments later I say I do. No, what I want to see is some effervescent being illuminated in the dark ever so briefly; it would be the ultimate spine-tingler. Remember in Signs how M. Night Shyamalan showed the alien walking across the driveway at a birthday party? Remember how you weren't expecting it, how sudden it was? How quick? I would have liked something like that--just something very quick and very, very spooky. Not even as detailed as the alien--some far away being standing in the middle of the woods, who suddenly disappears with a shriek. (So that you never really see it at all, you just see the light and think, What was that?)The craving of seeing the attacker is part of the fun. In this case, my craving was never fully satisfied.4\/5.

Fear is scarier than scariness itself--scary is just scary. Fear is fear. And fear induces all else that follows. Fear gets you on the edge of your seat; fear makes the hairs on your neck stand up. The scare comes afterwards.The movie is false, but knowing that ruins the surprise of it all. Three amateur filmmakers--two guys and a girl (where's the pizza place?)--go into a Maryland wood, in hopes of uncovering the secret of the infamous Blair Witch, a legendary witch who is rumored to live in the woods. First they interview town folk and get their sworn testimonies. An old, apparently crazy woman insists that the Blair Witch appeared next to her in a lake once and was covered with beastly hair. (That sent chills up my spine.)Then they embark into the woods, equipped with video cameras and recording everything. But soon they get lost--the map is pointless. They just keep going in circles. They walk around the woods for days, every night hearing strange sounds outside their tents and finding mysterious wooden ornaments hanging in a graveyard.The Blair Witch project is smart enough to know this, but that is about all I can credit the film for. It's that type of fear-inducing, thought-provoking horror movie not made since the likes of The Exorcist and The Omen, but when I was done watching it I realized that it hadn't really scared me at all. It had me thinking, yes, and it had me interested throughout, but it didn't scare me. After all the fear had settled there was no scare left. I viewed the film with all the lights in the room turned off, and yet it still didn't scare me. In fact, I found it to be rather ridiculous at times.But it is an admirable horror film, one that uses ancient techniques as opposed to chainsaw-wielding villains with ski masks chasing groups of very, very stupid, mentally under-developed big-breasted teenage bimbos around a house for hours in the dark, jumping out at the camera whenever we've gone too long without a jolt. No, The Blair Witch Project is all about insinuations and the unknown. I'll admit that the film is pretty darn creepy, if ineffectively scary. At one point, a group of three teenagers are asleep inside a tent, lost outdoors in a Maryland woods, when loud screams start coming from somewhere out there.They rush outside with the video cameras jolting about frantically. I was waiting any second for some ghostly pale figure to be seen far off in the woods. Which is part of my disappointment in the film. To unexpectedly catch a glimpse of something--the witch, the ghost of the murderer, anyone and\/or anything--would have been terrific. To expose something ever so briefly so that you think, What was that? and try to play back your videotape again to pause the image. But the film doesn't ever really approach the Blair Witch. Furthermore, it never really explains anything by the end of the film. And I understand that this is the appeal of the film for most people. BUT...I'm not asking to show the Blair Witch chasing them around. All I would have liked to see was at least an ever-so-brief glimpse of some unintelligible being. That would have been far spookier, because eventually you get to the point while watching the film when you realize it isn't going to show you anything, and you start to lose interest.
