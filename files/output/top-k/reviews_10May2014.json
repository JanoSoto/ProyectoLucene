With the exception of the character played by Wayans, I had very little or no sympathy for these people on such a startling downward spiral. They seemed doomed to lose from the start and it was no surprise at all that their lives were not turned around; that is, as I said, with the exception of the character played by Wayans, who it seemed had some very real redeeming qualities but was not strong enough to withstand the overwhelming power of the downward momentum of those in his sphere. But how low those characters did go. It just hurt too much for characters that I mostly didn't even like.

However I love talking about my favorite films, and so I am writing this review mostly just for my own enjoyment.First let me touch on the acting and the characters. The acting in The Godfather is some of the best acting ever put on the big screen, boasting the two names Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, both of which are acting legends. First let me touch on Al Pacino's performance. What makes Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone so incredible is the character's transformation from the beginning of the film to the end. At the start of the film, Michael tells his girlfriend Kate that he is not like his father. He does not kill or steal, which is true in the beginning. However, as the film progresses, he turns into a much different man than he is at the start of the film, and by the end becomes almost the exact opposite of what he was, eventually being the cause of one of the best endings to a film in the history of cinema. I don't need to tell you what that ending is. On the other hand, Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is also incredible for many of the same reasons. His character also changes from the start of the film to the end because in the end, he is the one to make peace with the other families. He, in the end, becomes what Michael was at the beginning of the film. Michael on the other hand becomes what his father was in the beginning, and both actors are able to portray this change so, so well. One of the best things about The Godfather is that you can watch it over and over again, and it really does get better with every viewing. My first watching of The Godfather, I immediately hailed it as one of my favorites, and every time I have watched it since I have actually liked it even more. Not many films have such a high replay value, and a replay value is always the sign of a great film. I could watch The Godfather once a week and it would never get old, and that is one of the best compliments I could give a film. However there is an experience for the first time viewer when you hear Michael say Yes I do denounce him, for the first time, and you experience the onslaught that follows that iconic line. Over all, as most would agree, The Godfather is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made. I cannot pick my top favorite film of all time, but this is definitely in my top 5, and probably in my top 3. If you have not seen The Godfather, do yourself a favor and see why it is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.The Godfather obviously gets a 10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 May 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" OK so if you have even the slightest knowledge of American film you know about the film The Godfather, and chances are that you don't need me to tell you how great it is.

I saw Major League, the original movie, once and to be honest, was rather disappointed that it wasn't as good as Back to the Minors, which I had seen several times at that point.Since other reviews have done a good job describing it, but may contain spoilers, I'll try to give the flavor in this one without the spoilers. BTTM is a great baseball movie for sitting back with some popcorn and having a laugh. It's a bit like The Sandlot except geared more towards adults in terms of story-line and humor. That's not to say kids can't watch it. There isn't a ton of swearing (one or two words) and nothing over the top sexually (unless you count a woman wearing a nice bathrobe.) I'm perfectly fine with letting my 9yr old baseball playing son see it, but some of the story might be a bit over his head.The movie has lots of unique\/memorable characters, a solid underdog story-line, and lots of humor sprinkled through-out. The humor is largely visual gags and some verbal word play. It's light on mean-spirited and crass humor. This was something that I found less than appealing about the original (from what I recall, it was over a decade ago at this point), it seemed to rely more on that sort of humor, which I'm not a huge fan of in those kinds of doses and would certainly not let my son watch at this age. Good movie for former baseball and fastpitch softball players who may be reminded of former coaches (both good and bad) and crazy teammates. Might even be a good family movie for parents with slightly older children, but you'd want to view it first to make certain it's a good fit for you.

I was serving in the Army in Germany then, and I didn't see it until years later &#x96; perhaps on TV. By then, its popularity and success had raised the views of the critics as well. European audiences took to the film much ahead of Americans. Today, I doubt there is a movie fan anywhere who doesn't think this is a first- rate movie and a great Western. That itself, should tell us of the fickleness of the field of professional critics.Movie buffs who haven't heard or read much about this movie and its making would enjoy a bonus feature that Paramount Pictures made in 2009. The Size of Legends The Soul of Myth bonus DVD came with the DVD of the movie that I bought. My summary heading above is from that DVD &#x96; it's the title of the third chapter of seven. The DVD is a compilation of interview vignettes with film industry people. It looks at the film and its making, at John Ford and his career, at John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, and at the Western genre. In one of the interviews, a film critic comments that it was too bad that Lee Marvin hadn't come along earlier in John Ford's career &#x96; how Ford could have used him in more films. Film maker Peter Bogdanovich says, The fact that the movie was dismissed in America as just another pot-boiling Western shows how shallow the thinking was in critical circles. When I first saw the film, sometime in early '62 in a screening room on Broadway in New York, there were like (sic) four people in the room. Nobody cared. Nobody came to the screening. Over the years, in the '70s, it picked up a great deal of critical support, especially in Europe and France (sic).This film is so different from what decades of Westerns had been like up until its time. So, did the critics just presume that Westerns, in general, were a thing of the past? We know they don't enjoy the place they once had, and that's understandable. When I was a kid, growing up in the mid-20th century, we young boys played 'Cowboys and Indians' all the time. I don't recall my boys doing the same, and none of my grandkids do today. My point is that the Western theme loomed large in American culture and folklore in my childhood days. We were still quite close to the time of the wild West &#x96; Dodge City, Tombstone, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and the OK Coral. But today, we are much further away from that time and its lore. So, while occasional Westerns are made still, they have to be of the substance and quality of the best of the Westerns in the past.This movie is about the very change in the face of the West. It's about the men and women who brought about the change. It's about the fights between open range cattle ranches and farmers and growing towns. And, it's about heroes &#x96; unsung heroes that helped bring about the change and who are all but forgotten today. It's about legends and the men behind those legends. It's an excellent movie, and one that should be in any serious film collector's library. I'll share here some of the poignant comments in the bonus DVD, The Size of Legends. Scott Eyman, John Ford biographer, says that the movie tells us that our vision of the West. is based on &#x85; agreed upon misconceptions and half truths. But that this film insists on the importance of memory &#x96; the past. And Americans don't particularly live in the past. We're interested in what comes next, and that's not Ford's point of view. The past is the foundation upon which the future is built. And, for Ford, there is no present without the past.Richard Schickel, film critic and historian, says, The John Wayne character is simply lost in history and will remain so&#x85;because the newspaper guy's not going to print the story. And that was his last hope for survival&#x85; I mean, this character who does the heroic and right thing is lost to history. And that's the sadness in the movie.Eyman says, Well, the myth starts with the title. Ransom Stoddard has built a career and a life because he's supposedly the man who shot Liberty Valence. But he knows he's a fraud. So, his entire life is kind of turning to ashes as he grows old. And Bogdanovich adds, It's exemplified by the line at the end when Vera Miles says, 'Look at it. It used to be a wilderness and now it's a garden. You must be so proud.' And he doesn't look proud at all.The melancholy of the closing scene of Stewart and Miles, as Ransom and Molly, says it all for me. They both knew that they would not be where they are today, but for Tom Doniphon (Wayne). They owe their marriage and their lives to him. Tom was the hero for the changes that came about. Yet no one would know his part. He would never be honored, and was already forgotten. Only they, and a few others, will never forget him. And when they are gone, so will be the memory of the real hero. That is, except for you and me and the many others who have seen this movie and can be grateful for all the Tom Doniphons for their unheralded heroics in settling the West. What a fantastic move!

And he doesn't look proud at all.The melancholy of the closing scene of Stewart and Miles, as Ransom and Molly, says it all for me. They both knew that they would not be where they are today, but for Tom Doniphon (Wayne). They owe their marriage and their lives to him. Tom was the hero for the changes that came about. Yet no one would know his part. He would never be honored, and was already forgotten. Only they, and a few others, will never forget him. And when they are gone, so will be the memory of the real hero. That is, except for you and me and the many others who have seen this movie and can be grateful for all the Tom Doniphons for their unheralded heroics in settling the West. What a fantastic move!

That was the one thing that bothered me, some of the CGI was great, but at the time CGI was no good for planes, ships or a huge rotating Gyroscope. It was good however for storms and galaxies and planets.But despite this minor flaw, the sets were very well done, including Jody's spaceship and the structures surrounding it. But what drives this film is not how it looks, there are strong and weak aspects to that. What really drives this story is Character, and the fact that we ourselves can relate to the dichotomies presented here.Basically all through this film, Dr. Arroway refuses to see the merits of Faith, she only relies on what can be proved with Facts in Hand. But Faith in God cannot be accessed that way.This rigid thinking initially allows her to make her big discovery, but when it comes to the row she created and taking part in her own discovery, it prevents her from being originally picked as the person to represent man as a whole. We have Nick Lowe on one side representing the Conservative POV, and Matthew McConaughey on the other, who should be representing the Conservative\/Religious POV but in fact Ms. Foster's character cannot see that he is actually her most valuable ally.This is how both Science and Religion should tread, they are in fact not at odds with each other, they complement each other. I think this was Carl Sagan's final statement with this book and film. Both require Faith to make work and if allowed to, Science and Religion can be used together to answer questions that neither alone can answer.I personally believe that if a machine like the one in the film were built, we would experience it differently from Within and Without.James Woods as the NSA chief almost reprises his great role as Citizen Cohn and Tom Skerritt reveals a Political Ass-Kisser and chump who is not above taking Arroway's discovery and using it for political gain, even while standing in her way earlier in the film. John Hurt in another chameleon role is SR Hadden, a mysterious recluse and main Arroway ally.And as much as Matt McConaughey bothers me, his character is pivotal to the film, as well as Gary Busey prodigy Jake as the psychotic religious fanatic which he so well represents. I believe all stereotypes are accounted for using appropriate actors.This film is worth sitting through, even though it moves slowly.

Not sure if that really means anything, but it's something I've been thinking about since watching the picture.Considering Clint Eastwood's character to be one of the Secret Service agents assigned to the Kennedy detail, I'm glad the film writers didn't take the approach of making Frank Horrigan a discombobulated mental case because of the assassination. Eastwood displayed just the right amount of angst over his connection to Dallas without obsessing about it. Casting John Malkovich against Horrigan as the disgruntled ex-CIA agent was a brilliant move, he exhibited a cold menace in the early going to keep Horrigan off balance. There was a great line he used to taunt Horrigan with when he said What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come? Without knowing anything about how the Secret Service actually operates, the film had some interesting points to make about protecting the president. There was also the upcoming election intrigue taking into account the president's standing in the polls and how the Chief of Staff (Fred Thompson) obsessed about closing that gap with personal appearances in light of a credible threat. Another interesting observation which can only be made in hindsight, is the phony name used by Leary early in the picture when he was calling himself James Carney. How could anyone know that in 2014, the presidential press secretary would be someone named Jay Carney. It calls to mind all those weird coincidences when considering the assassinations of John F.

The Japanese version of this film is certainly much better than what would be done with the American version, which turned into a complete disaster for the studio when released in 1985. However, this Japanese version actually stays closer in tone to the original film from 1954 and I think it's rather interesting that the filmmakers pretty much overlooked every other Godzilla movie except for that original. For the most part I think the film is a success, although there's certainly some flaws to be found including the 102-minute running time, which just has a few too many slow spots. This is especially true early on as we keep waiting for the big guy to appear. Once Godzilla does finally show up we're treated to a pretty good monster flick. Thankfully the Godzilla costume is a lot better than what we had previously seen up to this point with the mouth really benefiting from being more flexible. I also thought that costume design was good for the most part. The special effects on the other hand weren't any more impressive than they were in 1954. The entire stomping on buildings isn't exactly grand work but I think fans will enjoy the charm of them. Performacnes were decent for the most part but do we really come to these movies for acting? Again, I think the film would have benefited from being trimmed down some but there's still no question that the film is fun for fans of the series.Godzilla 1985 (1984) ** (out of 4)This is the American version of the 1984 Japanese film that had the beloved Godzilla returning to the big screen. It should go without saying but overall the Japanese version is the one to watch and it's easy to see why American critics ripped this thing to shreds and why so many people stayed away from the theater. For starters, this film runs just 87-minutes whereas the Japanese one ran 102-minutes. I really don't mind the shorter running time because I found the Japanese version to be too long but the added scenes with Raymond Burr really don't bring anything to the picture except for a connection to the original American version. You can check out various websites (including this one) for the alternate scenes here and there are a few funny changes including the bit with the Russian sub. The biggest problem with this film is obviously the extremely bad dubbing job, which just brings the film down several levels.

The biggest problem with this film is obviously the extremely bad dubbing job, which just brings the film down several levels. The seriousness of the Japanese film is pretty much lost through the dubbing.

Frank Baum. While the film is so dated, it's still watchable even today becoming part of American pop culture. The film is known for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters. The movie starts out amazing black and white, with Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), a young farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle, in Kansas in the early 1900s. She decide to run away, due to Dorothy's dog Toto, biting a neighbor. Before she can get far, a tornado comes up, carried her and her house to the Technicolor world of Oz. Dorothy find out that the only way to get home is to find the Wizard (Frank Morgan). With help from Gilda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and some new friends on the way, like Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin-Man (Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion (Bert Lehr), they make their way to the Wizard on the dangerous yellow brick road, where the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is looking for revenge for Dorothy accidentally killing her sister. All the actors were wonderful in their roles, playing multiply complex parts, bringing the comedy and music and dance alive. Still, it was bit over the top. All the actors also play the farmhands in the beginning, making you wonder if all this Oz was just a dream. That was the main different between the film and the book. There were other things that the film change, such in the case of Dorothy's age. Shirley Temple was originally wanted for the role, but since they couldn't get her. They got Judy Garland and had to change the age from 7 to 16. They even wanted the blonde curls that Temple is famous for. The wig was top heavy and kept getting mess up, so they took it out, and went with Garland's natural hair. It's creepy in a way, that Dorothy was literally based on Frank Baum's daughter that die in childbirth. Frank Baum was known for his medium spiritual belief, and you see it in the character of Professor Marvel (also Frank Morgan). It's believe that the Wizard character represent fault power leader. The Wizard can be allegory to what Baum thought was fault power leader at the time, such as President McKinley who introduce the Gold Standard, in which many historians believe was represented by the Yellow Brick Road. Oz is indeed an abbreviation that stands for gold, a hot political topic of the day where people were rallying for fixed gold and silver ratios. Some believe that, the Wizard in the film represent Franklin D. Roosevelt who was known to make illusions to sound strong and look powerful, when trying to present the New Deal to Americans at the time. Emerald City is allegory to Washington D.C that looks like money, but in the end, the film, it was dull white. If the novel, Emerald City look was based off the White City in the 1893's Chicago World Fair. Then 1939's Emerald City was the New Deal, Washington D.C. Then, all of Dorothy's friends could be presented as Coxey's Army, an group of unemployed workers made out of farmers (Scarecrow), laborers (Tin-Man) and free silver supporters (Cowardly Lion). It is said that the Lion represents 19th century politician William Jennings Bryan, who was viewed as someone having a load roar, but no power or bite. Honestly, in the book, the Bimetallism Ruby slipper were really silver. There were a lot of things that wasn't in the film that was in the novel such as the visit to China Country, Queen of the Field Mice, the battle with Giants Spiders & Kalidahs, and the attack of the armless Qualdings. Talking about missing limbs. Civil War vets with prosthetic limbs were inspiration for the Tin-Man. There is a tale that Tin Man was indeed a munchkin named Nick Chopper. The screenwriters wanted Tin Woodman to be a hardened criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. The torture of being encased in the suit had softened him and made him gentle and kind. Wow, that's really dark. Another dark urban legend claimed that, in the film, a Munchkin could be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree and swinging back and forth in the left background, but it was just a bird. There were a lot of weird rewrites, like a spoiled, selfish princess in Oz outlawing music and others. The role of the Wicked Witch of the West was also enlarged for the movie. While, the Witch of the West in the novel was less evil. I think this role fit the film, well. Mad props to Hamilton for continuing the role after getting badly burn during production. There are at least 44 major differences between the book and this movie. Nevertheless, the film was far more faithful to Baum's original book. Still, they almost cut the most famous song from the movie, 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' written by E.Y 'Yip Harburg. Glad, they kept it. The song The Jitterbug, was instead delete. The film footage for the song been lost, but you can find the 'Jitterbug' footage rehearsals on newer DVDs version. I still dig the other songs. Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead We're Off to See the Wizard and The Merry Old Land of Oz are some of my favorites. The movie always have great special effects, and top production value for the time. Still the story is lacking an overall moral and there were lot of not necessary extra scenes that could be cut out. Overall a great movie that will forever be known as one of the greatest movies of all time. I have to agree.

The deadly radiation is making it's way towards Australia and the citizens and any survivors from other countries who've made their way there must come to terms with their impending doom.The US submarine USS Sawfish commanded by Captain Dwight Towers(Gregory Peck)arrives in Australia where Towers and his crew await the end of the world. Towers befriends Australian Navy Lieutenant Peter Holmes(Anthony Perkins)who's young wife Mary(Donna Anderson)is struggling to accept that they and their new born daughter will soon lose their lives.Towers also meets Moira Davidson(Ava Gardner) a weary woman who uses alcohol as a way to cope with what humanity is facing. Towers and Moira fall in love and for a while bring some comfort to each other. Towers is a widower who's family were killed in the Nuclear war although he still holds onto a small hope that somehow they may have survived. Towers also meets Julian Osborne(Fred Astaire)a scientist who helped create the atom bomb and bitterly regrets that invention and the military who used these weapons.As they seek to come to terms with their situation a radio transmission is received from America which could indicate survivors there.

The films characters all have to face these questions and Mary and Peter Holmes in particular struggle to decide when faced with suicide or agonising radiation sickness. It's an horrific choice none of us should ever have to face. Being released so close to the Cold War this film no doubt struck a powerful chord with audiences who thought they might well be facing the worlds end soon themselves.Chilling,thought provoking and deeply moving with brilliant performances On The Beach is an unforgettable experience.

I also found the storyline intriguing so I rented the DVD. I'm glad I did. I give this movie 9\/10. Why? Because it's a very good movie. It's not a typical Hollywood blow-'em-up\/shoot-'em-up. It doesn't rely on CGI or even special effects to puff it up. What makes it a good movie then? It has an intriguing idea and a good script to go on. It has very good actors and good direction. But most of all it is a compelling story of a very strange man who may, or may not, be an alien.A man (Kevin Spacey) appears, seemingly out of nowhere, in Grand Central Station in New York City. A woman is robbed by two hoodlums and this man tries to help her off the floor. In the scuffle the police arrive. At first they think the man robbed the woman, but a witness steps forward to clear him. But he gives the police such strange answers to their questions that soon he finds himself in the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan where he's assigned to resident psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges). Dr. Powell determines the man's name is Prot (inexplicably pronounced to rhyme with note\u2015why not just spell it Prote?) and he claims to come from the planet K-Pax, which lies about 1,000 light-years away in the Constellation Lyra. Powell of course thinks Prot's delusional and prescribes medication for him but mysteriously it has no effect on him. Dr. Powell claims Prot is the most convincing delusional he's ever handled. But through several hypnotic sessions he sees emerge a more human side to Prot. Soon Prot is making a significant positive effect on the other patients. He tells them he's returning to K-Pax on July 27 (2001), a planet he's described to them as an idyllic and peaceful place, and tells each one he will take one of them back with him. Soon all the patients are vying with each other to compose an essay why he, or she, should accompany Prot to K-Pax.At a lawn party he's hosted, Dr. Powell talks about Prot to an astrophysicist friend and tells him of Prot's claim to come from a distant solar system. The man is intrigued. Dr. Powell asks him for some questions with which he can query Prot to test his claim. Prot comes through in flying colors. Based on his answers he's invited to be interviewed by a group of astrophysicists and astronomers. He blows them over with his intricate knowledge about the solar system and its two suns from which he claims to come. Does Prot really come from K-Pax? Or is he a savant who has the capability to rapidly master the intricate knowledge of a field that only specialists would know? At another lawn party Dr. Powell hosts, Prot attends. An incident with a water sprinkler system causes Prot to lose it. Dr. Powell sees in this Prot's human side showing through and become convinces Prot is from planet Earth like everyone else. Through a little sleuthing, he traces Prot to a small town in New Mexico where he identifies him as Robert Porter, a man who had worked in the local stockyard as the man who stunned cattle before they were slaughtered. Porter lived a quiet isolated life with his wife, Sarah, and daughter, Rebecca. One day a drifter stopped by and raped and then murdered Sarah and murdered Rebecca. Porter discovered the drifter and killed him in a fit of rage. Then according to the official record he died by drowning in the local river although his body was never found. The date all this happened was July 27 1996. Suddenly Dr. Powell sees the significance of Prot telling everyone he's returning to K-Pax on July 27 2001. Dr. Powell is now convinced something very serious is going to occur on the fifth anniversary of the deaths of Prot\/Porter's wife and children. The date comes. Prot\/Porter turns catatonic. One patient, a young woman who never spoke to anyone, is found missing. The movie ends with Dr. Powell pushing a catatonic Prot\/Porter in a wheel chair implying to him he knows what happened to the missing young woman. Prot\/Porter has a cockeyed grin on his face. Is he Porter? Or Prot's human shell (Robert Porter's body) after Prot's departed with the young woman to K-Pax? Well, who knows? Normally, I don't care for ambiguous endings but this one worked OK.It was interesting to see a young Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad) playing a cameo role as Dr. Powell's estranged son.NOTE The Constellation Lyra's major stars are about 1,000 light-years away. Dr. Powell remarks this is quite far away. But in terms of the Milky Way galaxy, whose diameter is 100,000 light-years, a 1,000 light-years away is not really far in galactic terms.

He blows them over with his intricate knowledge about the solar system and its two suns from which he claims to come. Does Prot really come from K-Pax? Or is he a savant who has the capability to rapidly master the intricate knowledge of a field that only specialists would know? At another lawn party Dr. Powell hosts, Prot attends. An incident with a water sprinkler system causes Prot to lose it. Dr. Powell sees in this Prot's human side showing through and become convinces Prot is from planet Earth like everyone else. Through a little sleuthing, he traces Prot to a small town in New Mexico where he identifies him as Robert Porter, a man who had worked in the local stockyard as the man who stunned cattle before they were slaughtered. Porter lived a quiet isolated life with his wife, Sarah, and daughter, Rebecca. One day a drifter stopped by and raped and then murdered Sarah and murdered Rebecca. Porter discovered the drifter and killed him in a fit of rage. Then according to the official record he died by drowning in the local river although his body was never found. The date all this happened was July 27 1996. Suddenly Dr. Powell sees the significance of Prot telling everyone he's returning to K-Pax on July 27 2001. Dr. Powell is now convinced something very serious is going to occur on the fifth anniversary of the deaths of Prot\/Porter's wife and children. The date comes. Prot\/Porter turns catatonic. One patient, a young woman who never spoke to anyone, is found missing. The movie ends with Dr. Powell pushing a catatonic Prot\/Porter in a wheel chair implying to him he knows what happened to the missing young woman. Prot\/Porter has a cockeyed grin on his face. Is he Porter? Or Prot's human shell (Robert Porter's body) after Prot's departed with the young woman to K-Pax? Well, who knows? Normally, I don't care for ambiguous endings but this one worked OK.It was interesting to see a young Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad) playing a cameo role as Dr. Powell's estranged son.NOTE The Constellation Lyra's major stars are about 1,000 light-years away. Dr. Powell remarks this is quite far away. But in terms of the Milky Way galaxy, whose diameter is 100,000 light-years, a 1,000 light-years away is not really far in galactic terms. Any star found within 1,000 light-years radius of our sun would be considered a member of our stellar neighborhood.9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"}]
