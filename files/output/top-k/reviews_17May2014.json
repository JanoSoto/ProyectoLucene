But instead of the melancholy of Amelie, Delicatessen instead focuses on very dark humour, being based around a cannibalistic butcher who lures in victims to his apartment block so he can kill them and sell them as meat to his cannibalistic tenants. He does this in a post apocalyptic world where food appears to be scarce and people have become more willing to show their barbaric nature in order to survive.And this is where the films focus lies. For it is less interested in the post apocalyptic world, but instead focuses on the characters and the various tenants who live in the building and their dark humour . A majority of the characters will have their own distinct personalities that make them quite memorable. There's one tenant who keeps quiet throughout the film, keeping an inventory of frogs and snails to represent the side of fine French cuisine in contrast to the more barbaric man eating side of the film. Then there's the girl who constantly keeps trying to commit suicide and failing in the most darkly comedic ways. It's with characters like these where the film does gain its personality and it's many awkward chuckles that are somewhere between comedy and tragedy.The film also succeeds at creating both likable protagonists and despicable antagonists. Louison (the lead protagonist) is an extremely charismatic young boy who is both very kind to all the tenants in the building and very skilled being a clown and displaying a nice introductory scene using bubbles to entertain th kids of the apartments. Then there's the lead girl, Julie, who is very brave working to stop Louison from being butchered. Similarly, Louison often protects her making their relationship extremely dependant on one another.Then the antagonist Clapet is also very memorable. The film makes it clear that he is a despicable man within the first five minutes on screen as he commits brutal murder, but feels no remorse about doing it, instead appearing to even enjoy it. At times he's slightly overplayed, but this assists in making sure he stands out as the most insane, amongst an already insane cast of characters.The style the film is shot is also very interesting as for the most part the entire story is confined to the apartment building. Through this it helps to create both a claustrophobic feeling and makes the characters feel even more detached from the rest of the world keeping the story very self contained. Also the cinematography uses a fairly dark tone, assisting the film to get a distinct look and help it stand apart from other apocalyptic futures.However, whilst everything that was in the film remained effective, throughout the film I couldn't help but feel there was lost potential. For example, whilst what I saw of the apocalyptic world was interesting, I didn't feel like we saw enough of it. Presumably what they were going for was to create some mystery as to the world, with there being a great deal of uncertainty as to when the film was even set with the likes of black and white TV's being used. But I feel the film would have been stronger if they had expanded on certain elements of the world like creating some bizarre shows on television or hints at why there is such a food shortage.It also feels like the film would have benefited from a longer run time. It took a lot of nice scenes to slow down and build up the relationship between the two leads showing them playing instruments together to create a more natural relationship. But this carries with it the problem that the plot ends up feeling more rushed with less time to make the different characters arcs complete. For example, tenants such as the Landlords mistress feel like good characters but don't get enough time for us to learn enough about them.Though the major missed opportunity that I see in the film is we don't really see any of the characters eating any of the human meat, despite the entire film centred around cannibalism.

But instead of the melancholy of Amelie, Delicatessen instead focuses on very dark humour, being based around a cannibalistic butcher who lures in victims to his apartment block so he can kill them and sell them as meat to his cannibalistic tenants. He does this in a post apocalyptic world where food appears to be scarce and people have become more willing to show their barbaric nature in order to survive.And this is where the films focus lies. For it is less interested in the post apocalyptic world, but instead focuses on the characters and the various tenants who live in the building and their dark humour . A majority of the characters will have their own distinct personalities that make them quite memorable. There's one tenant who keeps quiet throughout the film, keeping an inventory of frogs and snails to represent the side of fine French cuisine in contrast to the more barbaric man eating side of the film. Then there's the girl who constantly keeps trying to commit suicide and failing in the most darkly comedic ways. It's with characters like these where the film does gain its personality and it's many awkward chuckles that are somewhere between comedy and tragedy.The film also succeeds at creating both likable protagonists and despicable antagonists. Louison (the lead protagonist) is an extremely charismatic young boy who is both very kind to all the tenants in the building and very skilled being a clown and displaying a nice introductory scene using bubbles to entertain th kids of the apartments. Then there's the lead girl, Julie, who is very brave working to stop Louison from being butchered. Similarly, Louison often protects her making their relationship extremely dependant on one another.Then the antagonist Clapet is also very memorable. The film makes it clear that he is a despicable man within the first five minutes on screen as he commits brutal murder, but feels no remorse about doing it, instead appearing to even enjoy it. At times he's slightly overplayed, but this assists in making sure he stands out as the most insane, amongst an already insane cast of characters.The style the film is shot is also very interesting as for the most part the entire story is confined to the apartment building. Through this it helps to create both a claustrophobic feeling and makes the characters feel even more detached from the rest of the world keeping the story very self contained. Also the cinematography uses a fairly dark tone, assisting the film to get a distinct look and help it stand apart from other apocalyptic futures.However, whilst everything that was in the film remained effective, throughout the film I couldn't help but feel there was lost potential. For example, whilst what I saw of the apocalyptic world was interesting, I didn't feel like we saw enough of it. Presumably what they were going for was to create some mystery as to the world, with there being a great deal of uncertainty as to when the film was even set with the likes of black and white TV's being used. But I feel the film would have been stronger if they had expanded on certain elements of the world like creating some bizarre shows on television or hints at why there is such a food shortage.It also feels like the film would have benefited from a longer run time. It took a lot of nice scenes to slow down and build up the relationship between the two leads showing them playing instruments together to create a more natural relationship. But this carries with it the problem that the plot ends up feeling more rushed with less time to make the different characters arcs complete. For example, tenants such as the Landlords mistress feel like good characters but don't get enough time for us to learn enough about them.Though the major missed opportunity that I see in the film is we don't really see any of the characters eating any of the human meat, despite the entire film centred around cannibalism.

Basically four years have passed since the events in Washington, D.C., and Regan MacNeill (Linda Blair), now fourteen years old, is living with guardian Sharon Spencer (Kitty Winn) while her mother is away filming, but she continually visits a psychiatric institute for troubled children. She claims to have no memory of what happened during her exorcism, and she seems to be normal, but she has nightmares, and Dr. Gene Tuskin (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Louise Fletcher) who is monitoring her believes that her memories are repressed or buried within her mind. Dr. Tuskin has an invention to investigate this theory, a device that hypnotises two people and links their minds together, and slowly through doing this they find that the spirit of Pazuzu, the demon the possessed her, still lurks within her, and it is desperate to emerge once again and cause havoc. Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton) has been ordered by the cardinal to investigate the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), who was killed during Regan's exorcism, Lamont reluctantly agrees and witnesses the workings of the device, listening to the doctor and young girl as they subconsciously return to that night when Merrin returned to room alone with Regan. Lamont feels unworthy of the task he has been given, as he believes evil is a literal entity and that this entity is winning over the power of good, but he comes to believe in the demonic forces, travelling to Africa and learning about Pazuzu's ability to appear as a swarm of locusts, but specifically that the demon attacks those who can heal others, Regan is able to telepathically reach others, for example helping an autistic girl to speak. Lamont slowly becomes frantic and more obsessive over these theories, and he knows that the only way to truly defeat the spirit within Regan is to return to the house in Georgetown, where the exorcism took place, it is there that Pazuzu unleashes evil, forcing the house to slowly crumble around him and Regan. In the end it is Regan that defeats Pazuzu, performing a ritual that banishes the locusts, Sharon is killed after a car crash in the flames, and while Regan and Lamont walk away together having survived the collapse of the house, Dr. Tuskin watches on remains there while the police gather and have questions to ask. Also starring Paul Henreid as The Cardinal, James Earl Jones as Older Kokumo and Ned Beatty as Edwards. Blair is still relatively likable as the innocent girl put through turmoil once again, thankfully not as harshly as before, Burton as the priest investigating past events does I agree he does overplay his lines a little, it is interesting to see Fletcher being nice as opposed to quietly evil like Nurse Ratched, and Jones gets his moment as the one who has most of the answers to the mythology. The problem I have with this sequel is that surely there should be more over the top material, this instead for most of the films bores you to death with chit chat about why possession occurs, talk about religious mythology, the ways the demon appears, and flashes back in time, it is only near the end the explosive stuff happens, you might as well ignore this sequel entirely and just stick with the masterpiece original (don't bother with the prequel The Beginning either), a disappointing horror film.

It makes the mistake of depressing and repelling you not because you identify or feel sorry for the characters in their crappy situation, but because it's such an ugly, stagnant, miserable, boring movie. It uses shock tactics without giving you a single good reason why you're being shocked. It tries to fake you into negative emotions without the movie backing up its intentions. I didn't feel as if I was watching this movie so much as being infected by it.It's set in a desolate and run down city in which Henry Spencer (John Nance) lives an unhappy existence. He steps in a puddle. Oh no. Isn't life tough? Henry mopes off to have dinner with his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) and her parents (Joanne Bates, Allen Joseph), where it's revealed that she's pregnant. On the menu are little chickens, which waggle their legs and ooze black goo in what I'm sure is a very meaningful way. Then Mary's mum licks Henry's face. Blimey, this must all add up to something. Pretty soon the baby is born, and it turns out to be a slimy mutant that cries incessantly. Then Mary packs her bags and heads home, leaving Henry with only the baby, his next-door neighbour and the lady behind the radiator for company. I checked the counter on my DVD player, and this stuff took about a month to happen. Here's the dialogue in one scene 'Was there any mail?' 'No.' That scene lasts for three days.Breathing space is fine, a slow burn is fine, deliberate pacing is fine. That's all fine. But there needs to be reason for it other than torturing your audience. 'Eraserhead' doesn't use silence and a slow pace to any particular end, it's just agonisingly slow. Shots will start with a dreary silence drilling into your head before anything happens, then end the same way. The nothingness hangs so heavy in the air that my neck started aching, then I got irritated, then I got angry. I can sit through a bad movie if I have to, but please, not one that grinds on like this. There is no reason whatsoever for the pace to be this slow. Shot after shot establishes itself, then just sits there, unchanging, for an unreasonably long time. I really hated this film. It took five years to make, and twice as long to watch. Both experiences were an astonishing waste of time.The direction of the actors borders on embarrassing, and their one-note performances cross that border. Everyone talks. Very. Very. Slowly.

The 1962 movie with Rosalind Russell isn't perfect, but it is certainly worthy of the acclaim its gotten, even if detractors are rampant and determined to smear it on behalf of the individual lady who they prefer as the mother of both June Havoc and Gypsy Rose Lee.O.K., so Merman screamed so loud upon hearing Roz got the role that glass might have broken somewhere, and like others who lost their stage role to another actress on film, she may never have seen the movie. Still, as disappointing to purists (such as myself) who would have liked to have seen Merman do the part, Russell makes it her own, at least for the 2 1\/2 hours that the movie runs, and she got the Golden Globe for the role, like Merman had gotten for the movie version of Call Me Madam almost a decade before.Sing Out Louse! With those words, Rose Hovick makes her entrance, and this is the key that unlocks the door to the personality of this brassy woman who dominated her daughter's lives in her efforts to get them on stage and into the Orpheum Circuit. Russell never lets up on the brass, and you totally forget that you're watching the glamorous Auntie Mame as she eats the role up alive. Her Rose obviously loves her children, but she loves success and the spotlight probably just as much if not more. She isn't the belter of Merman's style, and it is very probable that most of her singing was dubbed. Listening to cast albums with Lisa Kirk (particularly Mack and Mabel) makes it even likelier that it was she who did the work, and in keeping with Roz's speaking voice, it is difficult to tell the difference.Replacing Jack Klugman from the original cast is the very similar Karl Malden, and his Herbie is a totally likable man whom you know both Louise and June would have loved to have seen as a stepfather. The softness of Russell's Rose comes out in her singing of Small World, and their playful relationship is also evident in You'll Never Get Away From Me. Seeing outtakes of the second act opener, Together Wherever We Go makes it obvious as to why it was cut, although the idea of seeing it re-shot with altered lyrics makes for a better idea.As for Natalie Wood, coming off her triumph in West Side Story (also dubbed) made her the obvious star to take on Louise\/Gypsy, and she goes from shy other sister to super-star stripper with building confidence. At times, Natalie (as she often did) would bray her lines, including her key line, I thought you did it for me, mama!, a factor in her receiving more Razzy awards than any other actress of her era. She is very good here, however, and when she takes on Let Me Entertain You! after going through the first half of the film pretending to be a cow, gives evidence of the confidence instilled into her by director Mervyn LeRoy who knew a little something about how to transfer stage shows into movies.But Malden and Wood are totally forgotten when Roz breaks into Rose's Turn, perhaps the greatest eleven o'clock number in musical history, and one where a breakdown is not always successfully perceived as happening. Roz briefly collapses inside, but this woman is too driven to allow her anguish to take over, and this is the shining star in her performance. I can't say who the greatest Mama Rose is, but in judging this movie, Roz does great justice to the part, and other than someone like Judy Garland, it is difficult to guess who could have eaten this role up as much as Roz did. Years later, when Bette Midler did the role for T.V., she brought her own light into the part, and gave new dimensions that other actresses might not have seen. The two Broadway Rose's whom I have seen (Bernadette and Patti) gave entirely different connotations of the role which shows how fascinating this part is for study and why so many actresses who reach a certain age are anxious to dip (Just Dip!) into it.The Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim songs are energetically performed, including the magnetic You've Got to Have a Gimmick where Louise is shown by three very different strippers how to cajole her audience into taking her into their hearts, even if the men are not quite looking at her heart. Each actress who plays Rose or Louise has their own gimmick, and that is what makes this show fascinating.

It's still hokey, fun in a dullish sort of way, firmly entrenched in the paranoid mindset of 50s creature features and very much a knowing example of a movie in which small town comes under attack by a goopy monster.Like the original it begins with an old man discovering a meteor in the woods, and before long the purple goo it contains has becomes an enormous gelatinous mass that threatens to engulf the whole town. The most striking difference between this and the original is in its attitude to authority whereas the teenagers in the '58 version were best pals with the cops, here anti-hero Kevin Dillon is far more distrustful of them. And rather than the titular blob being an unknown goop from outer space, it's a man-made biological weapon created by a double-crossing government agency. It's all far less wide-eyed than the original.Probably the most successful aspect is the blob attacks themselves, which look fantastic. In the pre-CGI era of the late 80s, it's all done with rubber and goo and prosthetic effects, and not surprisingly it all looks far better than it did 30 years earlier. Blobby effects do not a movie make, however, so scripters Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont spring numerous surprises on us by being completely heartless about their victims. The movie pulls a 'Psycho' on us early in the movie when Donovan Leitch, cheekily set up as the hero, is blobbed to death in a doctor's office. Then there's a sweetly hesitant romance building between the town's sheriff and the owner of the local diner, which comes to an abrupt halt when she sees his melted head blobbing past a phone booth just before the blob crushes the booth, swallowing her up. Characters I thought would stay the distance get blobbed and it's quite shocking at times, so the movie kept me on the edge of my seat that way in the absence of any real suspense elsewhere. Yep, it's not all good news the main sticking point here is the pacing, which stops and starts all over the place. After each blob attack it all goes quiet and Leitch and Shawnee Smith prowl about for a while until the next one, and it becomes disappointingly tedious.Top moments are probably one poor guy getting sucked head first down a plughole and Leitch screaming while inside the blob. There are some funny lines ('Kevin, don't eat with your face!') and a cracking bash of slasher films when some kids sneak in to a horror movie ('It's not hockey season!'). Overall, though, it's a very hit and miss affair, dull in places, exciting in others.

Basically in a world of anthropomorphic ducks, Howard T. Duck (voiced by Chip Zien, portrayed by Ed Gale, Tim Rose, Steve Sleap, Peter Baird, Mary Wells, Lisa Sturz and Jordan Prentice) is a twenty seven year old who lives on Duckworld, and one night while looking through Playduck Magazine his armchair starts quaking, and then all the sudden while sat in it he propels backwards, being pulled into outer space. He eventually lands on the planet Earth in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, and after being thrown out of a club he ends up in a trash can in an alley, he sees club singer Beverly Switzler (Back to the Future's Lea Thompson) being assaulted and confronts the thugs with his own brand of Chinese Martial Arts, or Quack Fu, she lets him stay the night at her place. The next day Beverly takes Howard to supposed scientist Phil Blumburtt (Razzie nominated Tim Robbins) in the hope of helping him return to his own planet, but Phil is only a lab assistant, so Howards shuns Beverly's help, accepting he may have to stay on Earth he tries to get a job, this also fails so he goes to make up with Beverly, she sings in the band Cherry Bomb, and he confronts their sleazy manager to release them from their contract. Beverly suggests Howard becomes Cherry Bomb's new manager, they are interrupted while flirting by Phil who has brought along his colleagues Dr. Walter Jenning (Beetlejuice's Jeffrey Jones) and Carter (Miles Chapin), Jenning explains that Howard came to Earth because scientists were experimenting with a dimensional-jumping device that happened to be aimed at Howard's universe, he was sucked to Earth by mistake.

This movie touches up on the fact how popular radio used to be during the golden years in the 1940's. During this time, the lives of people revolved around listening to radio and Allen does a great job in bringing this fact across. However, this is a story about family and kinship and how radio particularly affected this family.Woody Allen directed a rather charming film that is narrated by Joe and he talks about how radio influenced his childhood and he talks about his memories of his family and how radio associated with them. Not only that, but he also gives vivid descriptions on behind-the-scenes as well from the eyes of the radio personalities.This film has a strong cast led by regulars of older Woody Allen films. Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton makes some appearances here and do fairly well. Dianne Wiest had a great performance as Aunt Bea and Julie Kavner did well as Mother.Overall, this is a charming and witty film that will make you be overcome with nostalgic feelings. Even if you weren't born or alive in the 1940's, you can't but feel like you've been a part of this life someway or another. It's a great look on how radio played a part in everyone lives and how it's missed from today's society. I rate this film 8\/10.

The obvious question, then WHY? Why bother? What's the point of it all? I don't even like Brian De Palma's 'Carrie', an overrated adaptation of Stephen King's first novel, but jeez. This is just a cash grab that plods predictably through the plot of the first movie.In classic 'Teen Wolf Too' style, the movie introduces us to Rachel (Emily Bergl), a handy long-lost sister of Carrie's who has the same (apparently hereditary) mental abilities. She's an outsider, the high school elite torments her, she takes telekinetic revenge. That's pretty much it apart from an entirely unconvincing romance between Rachel and kind-hearted jock Jesse, played by Jason London with all the presence and charisma of a year-old pie. There's a void at the centre of the film where their relationship should be because the movie offers not a single scene to explain their attraction.One of the few things the movie has going for it is Bergl, whose smile lights up both her face and the screen, and who is able to infuse her underwritten character with an extra dimension, something none of the other actors manages. The trick played on her by the jocks is painful to watch because she's engendered some sympathy, and this cruelty (and their list of conquests) is the only time the movie breaks itself out of its apathetic shuffle. Even so, it's all been done before.Other than the entire plot, the other strand connecting this to the original is the reappearance of Amy Irving's Sue Snell, now, by some coincidence, a counsellor at the school. She sees the signs and tries to help Rachel, but there's very little reason for her to be there she barely connects with the plot aside from supplying the clunky scenes that explain Rachel's parentage, and she gets an entirely dignity-free end into the bargain. (I hooted at the scene where she takes Rachel to see the ruins of the high school &#x96; still there after 20 years!)Throw in a 'shock' ending and the obligatory genre in-jokes (damn you, 'Scream') and that's your lot. Run of the mill rather than outright bad, 'The Rage Carrie 2' is completely, utterly and totally re-frickin-dundant.

This is just a cash grab that plods predictably through the plot of the first movie.In classic 'Teen Wolf Too' style, the movie introduces us to Rachel (Emily Bergl), a handy long-lost sister of Carrie's who has the same (apparently hereditary) mental abilities. She's an outsider, the high school elite torments her, she takes telekinetic revenge. That's pretty much it apart from an entirely unconvincing romance between Rachel and kind-hearted jock Jesse, played by Jason London with all the presence and charisma of a year-old pie. There's a void at the centre of the film where their relationship should be because the movie offers not a single scene to explain their attraction.One of the few things the movie has going for it is Bergl, whose smile lights up both her face and the screen, and who is able to infuse her underwritten character with an extra dimension, something none of the other actors manages. The trick played on her by the jocks is painful to watch because she's engendered some sympathy, and this cruelty (and their list of conquests) is the only time the movie breaks itself out of its apathetic shuffle. Even so, it's all been done before.Other than the entire plot, the other strand connecting this to the original is the reappearance of Amy Irving's Sue Snell, now, by some coincidence, a counsellor at the school. She sees the signs and tries to help Rachel, but there's very little reason for her to be there she barely connects with the plot aside from supplying the clunky scenes that explain Rachel's parentage, and she gets an entirely dignity-free end into the bargain. (I hooted at the scene where she takes Rachel to see the ruins of the high school &#x96; still there after 20 years!)Throw in a 'shock' ending and the obligatory genre in-jokes (damn you, 'Scream') and that's your lot. Run of the mill rather than outright bad, 'The Rage Carrie 2' is completely, utterly and totally re-frickin-dundant. ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"}]
