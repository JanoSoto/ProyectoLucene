I have read a few of other viewer comments and am taken aback by people getting upset about the central idea behind the time travel communication (the aurora borealis lets Frank Sullivan's ham radio in 1969 communicate with his son John Sullivan (using the same ham radio in the same house) in 1999). People - it's a PLOT DEVICE - get over it! It's just there to get the story started and to add drama. When the writers put in a plot device like this, that's OK - you have to willingly suspend your disbelief. What counts next is, are the writers being internally consistent with the rules they have set up and the conditions in the movie? In Frequency, yes, they are. (Other movies aren't so good about this - don't get me started about Independence Day, where Jeff Goldblum is able to hack into the alien ship's computer system - apparently the aliens use Microsoft Windows too! Come on! They're aliens!)The rules of the plot are that there is the ham radio communication between eras; that it's October 11, 1969 on one end and October 11, 1999, on the other end, and that the two eras are running simultaneously (in a sense). That is, if Frank Sullivan (the father)spends 7-11 p.m. on Oct. 11 in 1969 talking with John Sullivan (his son), this happened for John at 7-11 p.m. on Oct 11, 1999. If something is changed in 1969 at 300 p.m. based on information sent from 1999, then the world of 1999 doesn't update till 300 p.m. of that same date in 1999. This is set up and reinforced by the good editing, constantly flashing back between one era and the next. So the writers set up these groundrules, use them as a basis, and then go into a very moving tale of father-son love, growing up, redemption, and second chances. I found the contact between the two men very believable. At first they're just chatting together on the radio; Frank says something about You think the Mets will win Game One of the Series tomorrow? John, of course, knows that the Mets lost Game One because it was 30 years ago for him, and makes some comment about that. (It was all over after Buford's homer in the second inning.) Then, of course, the ham radio loses contact. But the next night, Frank asks John, How'd you know about Buford's homer? And John says, It wasn't hard, buddy, it was 30 years ago. Then John gets more information (Frank's name, call letters, etc) and realizes who he is talking to. He desperately wants to warn his father about Frank's upcoming death in the warehouse fire which is going to happen tomorrow. But Frank doesn't want to listen, thinks John is crazy or a stalker or something - just can't believe it. John says If you had just gone the other way in the fire you would have gotten out - if you had just gone the other way! Then, of course, the ham radio stops working.Frank is pensive the next day, because everything so far has turned out as John has said it would (Al Weis hits a game-winning RBI in the 9th)and he is thinking, Is this guy for real? Might I be going to die today? When the climactic moment in the fire comes, Frank does go the other way, and saves his own life. John is sitting in a bar drinking with his friends in memory of his father, 30 years after his death. There is a very effective sequence where Frank is making his decision and escaping from the fire, and John is in the bar and getting new memories of a life where Frank lived on. I particularly like the intercutting where John drops his glass in the bar (in slo-mo), Frank has thrown his fireman's hat out of a window and that is falling (in slo-mo), and Frank and the person he saved from the fire are going down a warehouse chute (in slo-mo)away from the fire, into the river. The editors cut from shot to shot with very moving music from Michael Kamen, the composer, here. At the end of the scene, Frank is outside the warehouse watching it burn and realizing he is alive! and that this guy on the radio is for real; John is in the bar with his friends realizing that his father didn't die in a fire 30 years ago, but died from lung cancer 10 years ago, and John has memories from both of these timelines. That evening, Frank comes home, and talks to John. He realizes that hey, this is not a fake, it's really my son from the future (wow!)and they have a long talk together. This, to me, was the best part of the film. In the beginning of the movie, John Sullivan is a bitter, jaded, cigarette-smoking alcoholic cop who is breaking up with his girlfriend. As he talks w\/his father, you can see him smoothing out old bitternesses and fears. His father is there for him now and that makes all the difference. You see the two of them chatting about various topics, sort of guy talk that is a coverup for their deep joy in being able to communicate with each other. At the end of the scene, Frank is able to say, I love you, son, and John responds, I love you too, Dad. I've missed you so much! and Frank knows what he means\/meant to his son. Of course, up to this point is only half the movie, so they still have to continue the plot with the serial nurse killer stuff. That was well-written and a good thriller, but to me, not as moving as just the quiet conversation between the two men on the ham radio, the father and the son connecting. Advice to the viewer be sure to check on EVERYTHING in the background - photographs (who's in it right now? Is Dad missing? Is Mom missing? Is the dog missing?); newspaper headlines (Fireman Dies In Warehouse Fire is changed to Fireman Saves Runaway From Warehouse Fire); radio and TV commentary (note that the physics professor talking about the aurora borealis is on the Dick Cavett show in both 1969 and 1999!) and even the decor of the house in 1999. At first, when John's father died 30 years ago and his mother is living in an apartment somewhere, it's a rather gloomy cop dwelling. Then John changes the past & his father didn't die; John comes home from work, and notices that the lamps have changed, things look different. Next, it turns out that his mother has died in 1969, and again the house looks more bachelor-ish and less like a woman has done stuff to it. At the end, (SPOILER WARNING) in the future where both his parents lived, there is a major morph, and things look shipshape, tidy, and well-decorated. This is the kind of thing that you have to see the movie a few times to pick up on. It's also not always obvious due to camera angles, editing, etc. The ending is a major cop-out (no pun intended) in terms of being internally consistent to the rules that were set up. (SPOILER WARNING) In 1969, Frank has managed to expose Jack Shepard as the serial killer, so Jack comes to Frank's house to kill him and his family. In 1999, before Frank exposes Jack Shepard, John Sullivan meets Jack Shepard in a bar and tells Jack that he knows that Jack is the serial killer. So now Jack Shepard in 1999 is coming to the house to kill John. There is very effective and exciting intercutting between the two confrontations (Frank vs Jack, John vs Jack 30 years later) but if you think about it, it doesn't hold water. Frank shoots Jack in 1969, (shoots off Jack's right hand), and then you're supposed to believe that a one-handed ex-cop murderer fugitive from justice was able to hang around for 30 years to come and mess with John? If you listen to the director's commentary on the DVD, the director does make note of this and suggested a different, internally consistent ending be filmed. However, apparently test audiences reacted so positively to the current ending (SPOILER WARNING) (Frank is still alive in 1999, comes in and blows away Jack Shepard with his shotgun) that the other ending was never filmed. I have to admit that the ending as it is right now, is pretty satisfying emotionally, though. I'm a sucker for a happy ending and this movie does have one (SPOILER WARNING) It's a neighborhood softball game in Queens. Frank is still there, alive and well, having neither died of lung cancer or in a fire; Julia (Frank's wife) is also there, happy and healthy; John gets a game-winning RBI hit to knock in his father; John's wife (his girlfriend that he broke up with at the beginning of the movie in his alternate history) is there with their son; Frank has quit smoking, John either never started smoking or quit smoking, and nobody is an alcholic; life is good. I thought it was a tightly edited movie as well; John and Frank talk on the ham radio; Julia, John-as-a-6-year-old, and John's friend Gordo-as-a-6-year-old also talk on the ham, but the only one who knows that this is the future talking, is Frank. The writers could have had it that other people know, but they maintained the dramatic tension by having it be just Frank and John talking to each other. (Frank does tell his cop friend Satch, but Satch doesn't believe him and the radio is broken so Satch can't talk with the 1999 John). I'm the kind of person that asks hypothetical questions about movies, so now I'm wondering, If Frank comes in in 1999 and saves his son John, and the ham radio is still active, does Frank in 1999 talk to himself in 1969? Does he tell himself, Hey, we've gotta be here at this date and time to save John - write it down in your dayplanner? What would it be like, talking to your future self, anyway? Did Frank in 1969 ever tell Julia (his wife) about his conversations with their future son? As Frank lives through 1969-1999, does he ever talk to young John about talking with the 1999 John? Or does he just know that he can't talk about all this till it happens for John in 1999? (He does know some things that will happen to John - e.g., John blows his arm out, can't be a baseball player, goes to the police academy, becomes a cop.) At the end of the movie with all the changes that have been made in John's life, does he have three sets of memories? (one with Frank dying in 1969, one with Frank living and Julia dying in 1969, and one with both of his parents living through to the present day). Or does the current reality gradually supersede the old memories and the old memories fade away? Or do they remain? (hey, in my previous life, I was a single, alcoholic, bitter, jaded cop and now I have a family)?I guess that both Frank and John could look at it this way We each came close to death and cheated it by an amazing set of coincidences; let's make the most of the life we have left. In the end, that's good advice for all of us.  ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2004","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Very enjoyable entertainment.

Frank shoots Jack in 1969, (shoots off Jack's right hand), and then you're supposed to believe that a one-handed ex-cop murderer fugitive from justice was able to hang around for 30 years to come and mess with John? If you listen to the director's commentary on the DVD, the director does make note of this and suggested a different, internally consistent ending be filmed. However, apparently test audiences reacted so positively to the current ending (SPOILER WARNING) (Frank is still alive in 1999, comes in and blows away Jack Shepard with his shotgun) that the other ending was never filmed. I have to admit that the ending as it is right now, is pretty satisfying emotionally, though. I'm a sucker for a happy ending and this movie does have one (SPOILER WARNING) It's a neighborhood softball game in Queens. Frank is still there, alive and well, having neither died of lung cancer or in a fire; Julia (Frank's wife) is also there, happy and healthy; John gets a game-winning RBI hit to knock in his father; John's wife (his girlfriend that he broke up with at the beginning of the movie in his alternate history) is there with their son; Frank has quit smoking, John either never started smoking or quit smoking, and nobody is an alcholic; life is good. I thought it was a tightly edited movie as well; John and Frank talk on the ham radio; Julia, John-as-a-6-year-old, and John's friend Gordo-as-a-6-year-old also talk on the ham, but the only one who knows that this is the future talking, is Frank. The writers could have had it that other people know, but they maintained the dramatic tension by having it be just Frank and John talking to each other. (Frank does tell his cop friend Satch, but Satch doesn't believe him and the radio is broken so Satch can't talk with the 1999 John). I'm the kind of person that asks hypothetical questions about movies, so now I'm wondering, If Frank comes in in 1999 and saves his son John, and the ham radio is still active, does Frank in 1999 talk to himself in 1969? Does he tell himself, Hey, we've gotta be here at this date and time to save John - write it down in your dayplanner? What would it be like, talking to your future self, anyway? Did Frank in 1969 ever tell Julia (his wife) about his conversations with their future son? As Frank lives through 1969-1999, does he ever talk to young John about talking with the 1999 John? Or does he just know that he can't talk about all this till it happens for John in 1999? (He does know some things that will happen to John - e.g., John blows his arm out, can't be a baseball player, goes to the police academy, becomes a cop.) At the end of the movie with all the changes that have been made in John's life, does he have three sets of memories? (one with Frank dying in 1969, one with Frank living and Julia dying in 1969, and one with both of his parents living through to the present day). Or does the current reality gradually supersede the old memories and the old memories fade away? Or do they remain? (hey, in my previous life, I was a single, alcoholic, bitter, jaded cop and now I have a family)?I guess that both Frank and John could look at it this way We each came close to death and cheated it by an amazing set of coincidences; let's make the most of the life we have left. In the end, that's good advice for all of us.

I'm sure curiosity will lead a lot of people into watching this flick, but for Chrissakes, PLEASE don't spend any money on this. This has to be honestly, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I was so angry at the amount of time watching this movie wasted in my life, that I would've smashed the VHS against the wall, if it wasn't my friend's rental from Blockbuster. I am really surprised that this made it with check marks through the producer's hands, and ended up a movie. GOD FORBID IF THIS BECOMES A TREND. If this generation looks to this and smiles, I think we need some new role models really friggin quickly.

Having said all this, however, I think that LE JOURNAL D'UNE FEMME DA CHAMBRE aka DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID (1964) is the weakest of the final ten feature films Bunuel made during the most fruitful period of his career (between 1961 and 1977) &#150; if such a choice were to be made, that is.Don't get me wrong; I do think that LE JOURNAL is an excellent film and would probably be considered a bona-fide masterpiece if it were made by a lesser director. There is much to enjoy in the film Jeanne Moreau's superb central performance as the opportunistic Celestine stricken by an unexpected sense of moral duty prompting her to nail the killer of the child even if she has to marry him to do so; Michel Piccoli's hilarious turn as the eternally insatiable but perennially unsatisfied master of the household who, when his sexual advances towards Celestine are turned down by the latter, has to make do with the ugly-looking house-maid; the aged father-in-law who invites Celestine into his room to read for him, all the while indulging in his foot fetish; the sadistic manservant who thinks nothing of violating and murdering innocent little girls while nurturing dreams of sealing his independence with the purchase of a pub all his own and with Celestine as his partner; the eccentric neighbour who sabotages their garden at every turn and yet yearns for Celestine's companionship, etc. Bunuel offers a typically scathing satire of the bourgeoisie here and, as has already been stated by others in this thread, also shows that he is adept at utilizing the widescreen format despite this being his first and only stab at it, as well as imbuing seemingly trivial and innocent sequences with a subtly perverse touch of subversion. Even so, I do tend to generally agree with eminent film critic Leslie Halliwell's verdict on this particular film 'Interesting but not especially successful Bunuel version; the subject is certainly up his street but the novel (by Octave Mirbeau) seems to restrict him'.

I can't say I concur with Halliwell's review this time around dismissing as it did Renoir's film 'Hollywood notables were all at sea in this wholly artificial and unpersuasive adaptation of a minor classic'! Leonard Maltin, a well-known US film critic, didn't like it much either saying that it was an 'uneasy attempt at a Continental-style romantic comedy&#133;tries hard but never really sure of what it wants to be&#133;(the cast) do their best to liven things'! Based on these two capsule reviews I was hardly expecting it to be a patch on the Bunuel version but I nevertheless purchased the PAL VHS (issued by 4 Front but subsequently deleted) since it was quite cheap and, after all, medium Renoir (another of my favorites, by the way) is better than many other film-makers around!

Doing some more reading on this film after watching it a couple of times, I found out that there are those who think more highly of Renoir's DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID than I was previously led to believe. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, no less an authority than Andre' Bazin, in his famous unfinished critical study of Renoir's films, goes so far as to call it a masterpiece and the finest of all the films Renoir made in America between 1941 and 1947.

Burl Ives's Big Daddy is larger than life, insensitive, domineering, self-absorbed. Ives is on every moment. And every moment is true.Paul Newman's Brick, is as afraid of life as Big Daddy is in love with it. Yet, in his way, he's a chip off the old block - self-absorbed, insensitive.And domineering or, as Big Daddy and Maggie would have it, masterful, ready to take charge -if he could just get over himself.I confess, I don't care for Elizabeth Taylor as an actress, but she is so right for the part, that I can't think of anyone else to fill it. Anyway, who else has eyes that could compete with Newman's? Judith Anderson plays the typical Williams matron, living in her house of delusions. She's Big Daddy's tormented, desperately lonely, unloved partner, who towards the end wins Big Daddy with her nobility and devotion.The under-appreciated Jack Carter has the unenviable role of Brick's pliant, conformist brother, Gooper, decent at heart but worn out after years of jumping through Big Daddy's hoops and still winding up on the short end, with a house full of brats, bred at Big Daddy's presumed bidding and delivered by a scheming, ambitious weasel of a wife. Gooper the only character I have a little trouble with, because his climactic speech, as rendered by Carter, is so heartfelt, that we are aggrieved with him at the injustice of Big Daddy's favoritism for the no-account but aesthetically more pleasing Brick.Perhaps an even more unenviable role is that of Gooper's wife, played to perfection by Madeleine Sherwood. Anyone who has grown up in the South has known Sister Woman. I can assure those who haven't, that this character is not a stereotype or caricature.There are a few quibbles. One character, the family doctor, though played well by Larry Gates, has a dramatic function that's about as useful as the referee in a pro wrestling match, but not nearly as decorative. I guess he's included to provide plot information, but I think it could have been provided just as well without him. I was also put off by the contrived thunder claps at dramatic moments. Then, there were some continuity problems, such as different facial expression when shot angles were changed and Gooper's too many Shut ups to Sister Woman.If, as another reviewer has said, Tennessee Williams hated this film, then it couldn't have been because it was untrue to his work. If he disliked the changes and omissions, he should blame '50s prudishness, not the film, for dictating, say, the suppression of Brick's homosexuality. Williams wrote about lies and delusions, the good ones and bad ones. Well, that's what Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Streetcar Named Desire and Glass Menagerie were all about. Tennessee Williams's stories about the South and its culture of delusion are not just rebukes of Southern hypocrisy and bloodymindedness but paeans to the gentle and genteel refuge which delusion provides. As Maggie The Cat says, Truth, truth - everybody keeps hollerin' about the truth. Well, the truth is as dirty as lies.Finally, I think it was brilliant of Richard Brooks to insist on color, for Williams's stuff is talky, and with the drabness of a typical Williams set, this can be a bit oppressive. With color, and the wonderful animation Brooks instills in all the characters, his Cat contains not a dull moment. If Brooks has given us something at odds with what Williams intended, I think he has given us something just as fine.

Yet, in his way, he's a chip off the old block - self-absorbed, insensitive.And domineering or, as Big Daddy and Maggie would have it, masterful, ready to take charge -if he could just get over himself.I confess, I don't care for Elizabeth Taylor as an actress, but she is so right for the part, that I can't think of anyone else to fill it. Anyway, who else has eyes that could compete with Newman's? Judith Anderson plays the typical Williams matron, living in her house of delusions. She's Big Daddy's tormented, desperately lonely, unloved partner, who towards the end wins Big Daddy with her nobility and devotion.The under-appreciated Jack Carter has the unenviable role of Brick's pliant, conformist brother, Gooper, decent at heart but worn out after years of jumping through Big Daddy's hoops and still winding up on the short end, with a house full of brats, bred at Big Daddy's presumed bidding and delivered by a scheming, ambitious weasel of a wife. Gooper the only character I have a little trouble with, because his climactic speech, as rendered by Carter, is so heartfelt, that we are aggrieved with him at the injustice of Big Daddy's favoritism for the no-account but aesthetically more pleasing Brick.Perhaps an even more unenviable role is that of Gooper's wife, played to perfection by Madeleine Sherwood. Anyone who has grown up in the South has known Sister Woman. I can assure those who haven't, that this character is not a stereotype or caricature.There are a few quibbles. One character, the family doctor, though played well by Larry Gates, has a dramatic function that's about as useful as the referee in a pro wrestling match, but not nearly as decorative. I guess he's included to provide plot information, but I think it could have been provided just as well without him. I was also put off by the contrived thunder claps at dramatic moments. Then, there were some continuity problems, such as different facial expression when shot angles were changed and Gooper's too many Shut ups to Sister Woman.If, as another reviewer has said, Tennessee Williams hated this film, then it couldn't have been because it was untrue to his work. If he disliked the changes and omissions, he should blame '50s prudishness, not the film, for dictating, say, the suppression of Brick's homosexuality. Williams wrote about lies and delusions, the good ones and bad ones. Well, that's what Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Streetcar Named Desire and Glass Menagerie were all about. Tennessee Williams's stories about the South and its culture of delusion are not just rebukes of Southern hypocrisy and bloodymindedness but paeans to the gentle and genteel refuge which delusion provides. As Maggie The Cat says, Truth, truth - everybody keeps hollerin' about the truth. Well, the truth is as dirty as lies.Finally, I think it was brilliant of Richard Brooks to insist on color, for Williams's stuff is talky, and with the drabness of a typical Williams set, this can be a bit oppressive. With color, and the wonderful animation Brooks instills in all the characters, his Cat contains not a dull moment. If Brooks has given us something at odds with what Williams intended, I think he has given us something just as fine.
