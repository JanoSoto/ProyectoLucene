I knew it was rather well-rated on IMDb, so I was hoping it was average at the very least. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised either. Fight Club struck me as a interesting idea, but somehow I felt the script wasn't completely able to capture it. During the first two thirds of the film, I felt slightly intrigued, reasonably upset about the message that was being sent and yet, somehow, I was thinking. I really enjoy thought- provoking movies, and Fight Club is a fine specimen. This isn't a visual masterpiece nor an all-action movie picture, and the development is slow, sometimes too slow. But it keeps you tuned (at least it kept me) because everything feels so strange that you just want to try and understand it. I felt a little bit like I used to feel watching Alice in Wonderland while growing up. So, I forced myself to sit through it, simply because I wanted to understand what the point was. Some action scenes made the movie flow better, but they weren't at all that interesting nor that much of a visual experience. I felt like some of the fight scenes' violence was over- exploited, but that didn't bother me all that much as I'm a tolerant watcher. The fact is, when the major plot twist occurs, I was thrilled for a moment. I thought hey, that was clever. Didn't see that one coming. Now I get were all that slow, bordering boring plot development makes some sense. This might actually be a good movie. So, I hoped. And I was let down, because the one idea that formed in my head that seemed to me worthy of saving this film wasn't explored. You see, when I finished watching the movie, there was one big question just flashing in my mind Now what?. The ending is so brutally unsatisfying in the way that it makes the film all about people relating to it (which is important, of course) but completely forgets the plot, forcing you to enter in such a state of acknowledging that the film is meant to be a wake-up call about consumerism and rotting lifestyles and not a reflexion about it that you end up feeling unsatisfied. Although this isn't a fair comparison, what I love about Chris Nolan's films is that everything just seems to come together so perfectly in a plotwise masterpiece time after time after time, while presenting amazing thought-provoking premises; and David Fincher, in my opinion, failed to do exactly that, leaving an idea floating in the air but somehow failing to grab it, make it his and build a coherent, believable plot around (our about) it. All in all, Fight Club is a movie worth watching. It starts from an interesting premise and explores it, it has one significant, believable and interesting plot twist, the acting is brilliant and the directing is very reasonable. It captivates you because it's strange, and ends up making you wonder. However, it develops very slowly and it ends up forgetting it's own plot and will leave you with a bitter-sweet scent on your mouth because, even if you must recognize this is a good movie in most aspects, you end up thinking it could have been so much more if just the script was just a little bit more satisfying. 6\/10; Pros interesting premise; great technical aspects, directing, acting, some very enjoyable scenes and a great plot twist Cons Besides the plot twist, the plot is rather weak and the ending is unsatisfying and bordering on ridiculous.

They all have their weak spots but but this one brings new meaning to the word weak. A few examples 1. We know Harry can take on all kinds of bad guys with the six bullets in his Magnum, but, cmon, 2 thugs armed with machine guns? How does lying down at the bottom of a glass-walled exterior elevator protect you from machine gun bullets, by the way?2. Can someone really drive a vehicle in a high-speed chase thru SF and yet still be able to handle the controls of a remote-control toy car? Back in 1988 did they really have RC cars that could go 60 mph while loaded with an explosive device? What kind of battery powered that thing... plutonium? 3. Would the Mafia chief in the prison really fall for Harry's scam... to the point of hiring bodyguards for Harry? Really??4. Weakest partner ever for Harry... Kim has done some good work in film and TV but he has very little to do here beyond the one obligatory martial arts fight scene. His becoming yet another wounded partner is becoming old,especially where this time we haven't even had a chance to get to know the guy.5. Harry's bosses griping and complaining about Harry... again, becoming very old and tired. Especially when the actors have no personality to speak of. Bring back Leslie Nielson!6. Liam Neeson's character... pure stereotype. Very uninteresting. The villain is a total nullity. Really bad writing here. He's not scary, not interesting and not very believable. Compare him to Andrew Robinson in the first DH movie. Wow... talk about contrasts!7. The sub-theme about the media exploiting the pain of ordinary people to increase ratings and circulation... gee, I doubt this was ground-breaking even back in 1988. The fact that Clarkson is converted to Harry's point of view after getting machine-gunned... well, at least she catches on quick!8. The final confrontation where Harry harpoons the bad guy... did anyone else LAUGH when Harry comes out with the harpoon gun in his hands? It's a nice twist to have the villain holding Harry's Magnum but really?! Also anyone else notice the ethical problem here Harry kills a man he knows to be unarmed (out of bullets) and who is offering no resistance. He never did that in the first DH... that was the whole POINT of Do you feel lucky, Punk? Even when he shoots Robinson in the football stadium, his INTENT isn't to kill an unarmed man, it's to coerce information about the poor kidnapped girl out of him. Sure, it's extreme but it isn't an execution. IMO this presents a major degradation in Harry's character, perhaps betraying a failure in the writer's appreciation of Callahan's ethical mind-set. If they wanted the villain dead at the end, which makes some sense, why not just have him pull another knife out of his pocket and charge Harry?9. Filmed like a one-hour TV episode of a show like Cannon or Hawaii 5-0. Actually I've seen better episodes of ordinary TV dramas than this and I'm sure they cost a LOT less to write and to film.Ultimately, it isn't so much that one could reasonably expect Dirty Harry 5 to come close to the quality of the first DH. But one could expect a movie of this significance to be far superior to an ordinary TV drama. Right?Worth watching once, if for no other reason than to appreciate how great the first DH is.

And after a year or so, I had to come back and edit it after another thought.Overall I find it great! It's a fun watch and you shouldn't toss too many thoughts into it or it'll make everything go sour. This is the same for a lot of shows and movies. And that's the same for The Walking Dead, which I analyzed in details and found lots of parts that didn't make a whole lot of sense either. So details are not important.Originality\/Creativity It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Artwork I really don't know. When I was a kid, I found it gorgeous with those random swirlies. Looking at it now, it's a little weird but I don't dislike it. The artwork is very fantasy-like, which really works for this. Music I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really fit in. Of course there are also really good music\/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid.Parts that doesn't make a lot of sense I think there are a few around but I just want to point out like three. At the beginning Zeus says that Hercules got his strength. So Zeus should be pretty should too. But when the Titans fought with Zeus, he acted like he has no strength and only got thunderbolts. So he threw thunderbolts one at a time and did nothing to the mountain\/rock titan. As a result, Zeus lost his part of the fight. When Hercules came, he basically flew around in circles to annoy Hades and then release Zeus. And this time, by throwing two-three thunderbolts at the same time, it blasted the mountain\/rock titan's head off and scared them off. The tornado titan also did nothing during the whole fight other than helping Hercules kill the other titans. In conclusion, to make this whole scenario make any sense, Hercules' role in this whole battle is only for morale purposes and using the tornado titan to kill the rest is just extra to fulfill the part where he wins the battle. When Hercules lost his strength, apparently he still kept his God-like durability. He was flung half way across the city within a second and smacked into a concrete wall. I don't know about you, but I'll be pretty dead. But let's just say that he did retain his God-like durability. Then Meg's sacrifice was for nothing other than getting Hercules' strength back since Hercules wouldn't even felt that pillar dropping on him. And isn't the deal that Meg will be safe from any harm? So even self inflicted harm like stabbing her own leg would be just fine. For some reason, both Hades, Meg, and Hercules thought it had to be lethal. Third point, when Hercules saves Meg by jumping into the river of death, we can clearly see that the 'river' part is fairly far down from the ledge, where Hercules jumped off from. But for some reason, he was able to reach all the way to almost touch Meg, when he first arrived. Okay, let's just say that was an illusion created by the angles. But when he stuck his hands into the river, it virtually instantly 'dried up'. However, for some reason, he was able to maintain his body's health and fluid while swimming towards Meg. Somehow, he prolonged his death. Educational Purposes\/Authenticity to Source I basically threw a random low score that makes me feel right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The step-mother was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or trials, which is sort of what Hercules in this movie did to become the true hero. Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for Reviewers It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done with a kid's perspective in mind.

The quality of the image was great and the score was performed live. And I only had the obvious reference of it Willis H. O'Brien, who was responsible for the special effects in KING KONG (the original 1933 version certainly), worked here, doing the stop-motion material as well. I'm pretty sure I'll write *King Kong* a whole lot more in this commentary since this is similar to Kong in many ways. I was actually very surprised because of that fact; I, certainly, expected similarity to Kong but really nothing more than something technical oriented. Actually, I would say THE LOST WORLD is pretty much KING KONG. It doesn't have, however, a very iconic character (nor a sad ending); after all, it isn't titled after the name of a specific creature (here we have dinosaurs of all kinds). But don't let this confuse you dear reader since Lost World does features iconic scenes. In other words, the dinosaur here (the one that suffers a similar denouement to the one Kong had) doesn't climbs a famous London building, equivalent to New York's Empire State (yes, this film, or better said, the last part of it is set in London, England), but we do enjoy a really wonderful scene featuring the dinosaur at a London landmark. Needless to say, this was made eight years before Kong. THE LOST WORLD is one of those films that are worth watching not just because they were influential. I mean, this is so much FUN! Unlike many films of this kind, it never hesitates when it comes to show you its main attraction (the dinosaurs of course) &#x96; we get to watch lots of fights between them (great and fun material) and some heart as well (there's a crazy ape- man too). I'm willing to seek the DVD of it and hopefully I get to watch the full (or just longer) version. Meanwhile, this one-hour piece was a blast and a perfect Saturday night movie!

If you want an excellent, well polished well sparked remake, this is the one! Back two years ago, I watched Martin Scoursese's Cape Fear which I found was outstanding, but now that has changed since I saw this remake from 1998. This is one of the better remakes in many years of a total line up of them. However, since I haven't seen the original at all, I will not be comparing this film with Lindsay Lohan to the 1961 version. (Warning, some spoilers are in here, so if you have not seen this film, please don't read everything).The film sets on a warm sunny day, set 11 years later from these parents who were married, had twins and then separated, where one took one twin to live in England while the other was taken to live in California. 11 years from that setting, the two twins meet each other at summer camp and then find out about each other. This leads them to fact that they are alike and the two twins, Annie and Hal become eager and determined to reunite their parents together.This was a really fun film to watch, my expectations weren't high and I thought that it would've been a decent film. I was totally wrong as this film is well casted, has a memorable music score, has some beautiful looking scenes and the anticipation, twists and overall plot of the film are all shown in great forms and shapes. The story is told beautifully as it is done through the perspectives of the two twin girls (played by Lindsay Lohan) who are wanting their parents to be back together.First off, I have to mention the musical score; I thought it was hauntingly enchanting, peaceful and quiet and it really had a melody to it. It also suited the acting of Lindsay Lohan as Annie and Hal who I thought did a stunning job. They were, mischievous, cheerful, cute and awesome in one pack! She does a real great job as the two characters and she is definitely the light of the film with her different accents, playful pranks on the father's girlfriend and explorative minds.Many of the places of where the scenarios take place were a good choice for the film to. Hotels, pool areas, the country, camping sites, cabins, crowded streets, its all there and it was really great to see so many different places that the girls could explore.The cast and choice of actors\/actresses were wisely picked out and like I mentioned before, Lohan was the best and the star. Everyone I would give credit to too as they were excellent in their roles, showing seriousness and funniness.Lastly, I'd talked about some of the unpredictable plot twists in the film. When I thought the mother and father weren't going to get back together, I was thinking, its not going to be a happy ending! It was paced really well about how they were going to show the mother and father getting back together again. The ending (I wont talk about) I was stoked! Overall, The Parent Trap from 1998 is excellent piece of film from the very late 90's which has much potential. Loving the film as I do, I would say it is, hands down, the best film I have seen this year! It marks a 10!

First, I've lived in Kodiak, Alaska where Bart's relatives originate, and I've visited much of the Rocky Mountains and the mountain ranges of Alberta, Canada. The mountains in the film seemed strange and unidentifiable to me. Later, I discovered that the film was actually shot in the mountain ranges of Italy. The other, more natural surprise, was that a male bear had been coaxed into accepting the presence of a baby bear - something very strange in the real wilderness. Most bear cubs who get anywhere near daddy bear end up as lunch meat, unless momma comes to the rescue. distasteful as it may seem to us, it's just part of the real bear world. In fact, much of the natural behavior of living bears was altered or ignored in this film for the sake of the story. Yet, somehow you simply become immersed in this charming tale of childhood survival and learning. And, those of us who are familiar with the species of mushroom the little bear ate, were rolling in the aisles with laughter.For those who may consider the face off of the Bear and the Hunter near the end of the film as pure fantasy, this encounter is actually quite possible. Bears are very predictable in many respects, but their behavior under duress can often be startling and unexpected. Bears are built by nature as the perfect killing machine. But, they are also extremely intelligent and capable of incredible survival instincts. We were told in Alaska that a simple coke can with a stone inside makes a sound that bears are scared of. Bears also react to strange smells. People have been known to drop their shirts or coats while being chased by a bear. More times than not, the animal will pause to sniff the garment, and cease the attack because of the strange scent.

It goes without saying that this film has everything you could possibly want in a film and more. It has a flawless cast headed by Elisabeth Shue (Chris), Maia Brewton (Sara), Keith Coogan (Brad), and Vincent D'Onofrio (Dawson). Spoilers ahead Here is a little bit of how the film starts out. Chris who is babysitting Sara and Brad (His Friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) also stayed over), and they had to make a trip into Chicago to pick her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), who ran away from home, and they essentially go through hell trying to pick up Brenda and get back home.

But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance  that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself.Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot.Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do.The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below''  the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules.

This movie has amazing drama, exceptional acting, and bloody, exhilarating action. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Dog Day Afternoon) who plays the avaricious, antisocial Cuban immigrant Tony Montana (who has a scar on his face due to his unknown childhood trauma) who wishes to pursue the American Dream when arriving in Miami, Florida with his loyal best friend, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer, an underrated actor). He decides to follow the dark side to exceed his prospects. Tony does a hit job on a corrupt politician (exposition) for crime boss, Frank Lopez, who has a soft spot. Thus, Tony starts to escalate. As Tony explains to Manny first, you get the money, then the power, then the women, he becomes charmed with Frank's cocaine-addict oblivious wife, Elvira (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) and wants Frank gone, so he can take control of the cocaine empire. While Tony is working for Frank, he has an almost incestuous relationship (I dunno) with his sister, Gina Montana and is very protective of her because he doesn't want her to be corrupted. Later in the movie, Tony makes a deal with sadistic cocaine drug lord, Sosa, who tells Tony not to screw him, and argues with his Frank about the deal the he made. Frank explains to Tony that Sosa is a snake and not trust-worthy. Tony doesn't believe this and starts fooling around with Frank's wife. Frank's assassins attack Tony in a luxury club, but he escapes luckily and confronts Frank. Tony kills him for his betrayal and takes over the empire. Tony gets everything, but slowly goes insane when he keeps doing cocaine. His relationship with Elvira falls apart after marrying her. Also, he has problems with the FBI force. Manny secretly dates Tony's sister without telling him. Then, Tony makes another deal with Sosa that they would both solve each other's problems by doing favors for each other. During the climax, Tony has to whack a journalist that could enervate Sosa's business by putting him in jail, but Tony has a sense of morality when he doesn't want to kill the journalist's family when they are in the car with the journalist, so Tony decides not to.

This movie has amazing drama, exceptional acting, and bloody, exhilarating action. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Dog Day Afternoon) who plays the avaricious, antisocial Cuban immigrant Tony Montana (who has a scar on his face due to his unknown childhood trauma) who wishes to pursue the American Dream when arriving in Miami, Florida with his loyal best friend, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer, an underrated actor). He decides to follow the dark side to exceed his prospects. Tony does a hit job on a corrupt politician (exposition) for crime boss, Frank Lopez, who has a soft spot. Thus, Tony starts to escalate. As Tony explains to Manny first, you get the money, then the power, then the women, he becomes charmed with Frank's cocaine-addict oblivious wife, Elvira (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) and wants Frank gone, so he can take control of the cocaine empire. While Tony is working for Frank, he has an almost incestuous relationship (I dunno) with his sister, Gina Montana and is very protective of her because he doesn't want her to be corrupted. Later in the movie, Tony makes a deal with sadistic cocaine drug lord, Sosa, who tells Tony not to screw him, and argues with his Frank about the deal the he made. Frank explains to Tony that Sosa is a snake and not trust-worthy. Tony doesn't believe this and starts fooling around with Frank's wife. Frank's assassins attack Tony in a luxury club, but he escapes luckily and confronts Frank. Tony kills him for his betrayal and takes over the empire. Tony gets everything, but slowly goes insane when he keeps doing cocaine. His relationship with Elvira falls apart after marrying her. Also, he has problems with the FBI force.

To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of Manhattan, which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous Husbands and Wives as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life.Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of Rosemary's Baby when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. She had a heart condition, he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis.Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do. The greatest delight of Manhattan Murder Mystery relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, Husbands and Wives, a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, Manhattan Murder Mystery feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in Husbands and Wives where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is, although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality (a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the urge to invade Poland and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake.And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make Manhattan Murder Mystery such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

We can clearly see that everyone else has no happiness in them whatsoever.

For a Few Dollard More is an amazing film though perhaps not as influential as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Just for the record I happen to love all three films.

Of course things have been cut out for time but the most important elements are here(unlike later movies). The cast was excellent, I was thrilled by Argus Filch who was kinda scary(unlike later movies) and his cat, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore was also very book-like and nice to look and listen at. The movie has only one big flaw and that it's too close to the book. Columbus followed the book almost to the letter and didn't let his own imagination to spice the story up. The sets looked gorgeous. I am sad that some of the rooms in the end were cut. Hagrid had mentioned earlier that Snape had been one of the people who designed the protection of the stone yet his potion riddle was cut along with Quirrell's troll.
