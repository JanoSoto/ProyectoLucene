This is a great film because I think Max Fisher is a pretty solid character that everyone can relate to somehow. He is a 15 year-old who is smart, yet immature at the same time. He really displays many different tones and emotions in the film that really define the basis of the film. Bill Murray is wonderful as well in his own Bill Murray Way. Rushmore is full of brilliant and SMART COMEDY, not immature\/lowball humor (poop & sex jokes,etc) that you see in more mainstream comedies.Rushmore is truly a remarkable film. It's really involves emotions and relationships while adding a great side of comedy to them. I think that the people who said this film was boring aren't seeing it for what it really is. I imagine that those people attend theatres regularly looking for overdone special effects and overrated stars Rushmore has probably one of the best soundtracks ever. (The Who, Kinks, Cat Stevens, and The Faces just to name a few) I really suggest you check it out. Guess what!? It's not a cd full of sorry music you won't hear in the film!! Director, Wes Anderson uses The Who's A Quick One... to perfection in the scene where Max (Jason Schwartzman) and Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) go to war. Check out the Criterion Edition DVD if you love this film!!
