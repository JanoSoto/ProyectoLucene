Still, it has an absolutely first-rate cast giving decent performances, has some witty moments, and is filmed with glorious black and white cinematography, ever so-suitable for its subject matter. Moreover, it does actually develop its theme about the role of the armed forces brass in our government perfectly well enough to satisfy most any secondary school civics teacher in the land, and for that reason it can also be judged an honest treatment however fanciful it develops the details.

Sure it did quite well at the box office, but really did not compare to the first one. The reviews were lukewarm at best, quite incendiary at their worst. I believe it had multiple razzie nominations and I do believe Danny DeVito actually won for worst performance. However, over the years for reasons unknown to me it has gained a following, now it is often said to be the best of the original four films. At one point it had a 6.2 score on IMDb, but now sports a 7.0. What changed? I have no clue as to me it is not the disappointment it was then, but I still thought the first film was better. Burton went darker with this one, at the same time in areas he went lighter. This one is a sequel, yet other than a throw away line about Viki Vale and a few of the same actors this film almost feels like a totally different film in some regards. Still, it is my second favorite film of the original four films, though it is a set of sequels that change up the formula so often that you hardly can tell they are connected when you compare Batman and Robin to the first film.The story has a strange circus gang on the attack, things get a bit out of hand and Commissioner Gordon calls on Batman. Did not take him all that long to become over reliant on the Bat now did it? Well during the chaos a strange person dubbed the Penguin makes his way out of sewer, part of his plan that is not really a Penguin plan of the comics. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is having boss troubles to the point of being pushed out of windows and resurrected as Catwoman! The boss, Max Shreck, decides to use the Penguin for his own needs and makes a bold push to make this strange man into the mayor. Catwoman and the Penguin soon team up as the Bat keeps interfering with each and plan a caper to frame the Dark Knight.There is a lot going on in this film, and that is a bit of a problem. Penguin's and Catwoman's team up seems rushed, there are parts of the film that seem important that are never discussed again and the best villain is not even one of the two super villains, but rather Christopher Walken's Max Schreck character. Still, Burton has a way of making the very bulky bat suit not look like something that is going to restrict someone's movement to the point it is nonfunctional. The next two films it looks like the heroes can barely move! The suit on display in this film is also the best looking one of the original four ditching the molded muscles of the previous film and the strange tail on the bat insignia. The bat mobile still looks awesome, it doesn't for the next two movies and Catwoman's costume is hot...though I prefer the Lee Merriweather look in the 60's version as Michelle is too pale for my tastes.As for the villains, neither is really a lot like their comic book counterpart. However, Burton should not be restricted by a comic book nor any other director. Seriously, do people really want every comic book movie to start at issue 1? Granted, both get a very strange treatment as Catwoman gains her power from random cats, I would prefer she be just a cat burglar and Penguin's origin shown at the beginning would be great, if the villain was Killer Croc. He is also a bit to disgusting looking. I just do not see people rallying behind him as people are shallow and while they may not burn him at the stake, they are not going to fall in love with him as they do in this film. Michael Keaton is still good as Batman, I prefer Bale a bit over Keaton, but Keaton is miles ahead of the other two guys. I just think Bale did Bruce better while Keaton was actually better as Batman. With them it is close, not so much for Kilmer and Clooney.So I still do not see why people act as if this film is the best in the series including the Nolan films, however, I respect their opinion. One even gave me a list and while I did not agree it allowed me to understand a bit why they felt it was superior. To me, it was an okay film and a disappointing sequel. I just thought areas of it were to strange, some too lighthearted and it just did not continue the first film well enough (Billy Dee Williams...where are you?). It still had a lot of fun moments and it had a lot more Batman in it than the first film and probably the next two. Add a awesome action scene to the end and I would give it an 8, but the anticlimactic ending we got is one of the main reasons I did not like this film as much as the first and only give it a score of six. I still remember the disappointment I felt as a kid as the ending played out.

I for one found it a powerful and sometimes beautiful film. I will admit the first half is better than the second however. The second half does take a nosedive in plausibility particularly a really awkward moment where Erika takes out her sexual frustrations onto her own mother, while the first half is absolutely fascinating. The Piano Teacher is very well made, bleak and somewhat cold in colour palette but at the same time sumptuous. The cinematography is splendid, as is Michael Haneke's sure-handed direction. The music is outstanding, Schubert's music- Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Schoenberg and what sounded like Bach in the two pianos-playing sequence- is the most frequent and it is deliciously lyrical though the repetition of Im Dorfe- the one with the growling-sounding bass line- is likely to haunt your mind. I also have to say the piano playing is amazing, some of the best I have ever heard. The script has its very thoughtful moments in the piano teaching sequences and the letter scene actually is revealing about Erika's sexually frustrated and somewhat warped state of mind. The sex scenes though do have some lines that are likely to make you go um, okay, the worst offender being the penis-related one in the bathroom sex scene.The story is interesting in life as a piano teacher and how the pieces are interpreted and has some genuinely disturbing moments primarily Erika cutting herself, Erika's attack inflicted by Walter and the rape scene. The ending is interpretative and on the abrupt side but was a clever and fitting to end the film. The characters are not easy to empathise with, the main character especially is very cold while Walter is somewhat relateable until his terrifying change in character.

The script has its very thoughtful moments in the piano teaching sequences and the letter scene actually is revealing about Erika's sexually frustrated and somewhat warped state of mind. The sex scenes though do have some lines that are likely to make you go um, okay, the worst offender being the penis-related one in the bathroom sex scene.The story is interesting in life as a piano teacher and how the pieces are interpreted and has some genuinely disturbing moments primarily Erika cutting herself, Erika's attack inflicted by Walter and the rape scene. The ending is interpretative and on the abrupt side but was a clever and fitting to end the film. The characters are not easy to empathise with, the main character especially is very cold while Walter is somewhat relateable until his terrifying change in character. The performances are really great. Isabelle Huppert is incredible in a difficult(both in character and how she relates to the audience)role with eyes and delivery that tell a huge amount. Benoit Magimal is a charmer in the first half, and once Walter is repulsed by the letter his change in character does manage to terrify. Annie Giradot is perfect as the stuffy mother figure, and the rest of the cast give good performances if not quite up to the standard set by the three leads.Overall, powerful, beautiful and shocking, not perfect but very effective. 7.5\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"27 October 2012","score":"","review":" Belated Day 21 Of My 31 Days Of Horror 2.The Lost Boys is one of those movies that changed me after I saw it.

As such, Halloween II becomes a waste of time, but not a waste of the effort that went into producing it.Carpenter co-wrote the film with partner Debra Hill (as they had done on Halloween), but directorial duties were instead handed over to Rick Rosenthal. Rosenthal is no John Carpenter (obviously), but he does at least make the movie interesting and at times, a little scary. The main problem with Halloween II is that it is pretty much a rehash of the previous film, and is more in touch with the numerous imitators its predecessor had spawned over the three years since that dark, fateful night in 1978.Halloween II is a direct follow-up to Halloween, which depicted an escaped maniac stalking and killing the teenage babysitters of a small (fictional) Illinois town called Haddonfield on Halloween night. The sequel picks up with a brief recap of Halloween's final moments where Dr. Sam Loomis (the late Donald Pleasance) pumped six bullets into the chest of knife-wielding mass murderer Michael Myers. In the process, Loomis also saved the life of would-be victim Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).Laurie is rushed to the hospital to recover from a few minor injuries and the trauma of the night's events. Loomis, meanwhile, continues his obsessive hunt for Michael Myers before he has a chance to kill again. As fate would have it, Myers shows up at the hospital and begins killing the doctors and nurses on staff that night. And later on in the picture, we get a shocking revelation in that we learn just why Michael Myers is so intent on specifically targeting poor Laurie Strode.For a horror sequel, Halloween II is surprisingly well-made, and does have some pretty suspenseful moments - though none of this is on par with the utter perfection of Halloween. As I stated earlier, because Halloween II is so much in league with the slasher movie spawn of its predecessor, it feels more like those cheap imitations, and not a worthwhile sequel to a landmark horror picture. The characters are paper-thin, the violence is much more graphic and palpable (the first movie contained only a minimum of violence and gore), and the whole thing just stinks of rehash - although it does, in fact, continue the story of the first film, rather than just repeating the exact same scenario over again.One of the big bonuses of Halloween II is its synthesizer-based score, which was composed by Carpenter himself and frequent collaborator Alan Howarth (they had just worked on Carpenter's Escape from New York and were preparing for The Thing). The score for Halloween II contains many of the same motifs (including the signature 5\/4 time rhythm) but this score relies much heavier on electronics, rather than acoustics, as it was on the first picture. But like the first movie, the score fits neatly into any scene it's placed and succeeds in managing to create some pretty suspenseful scenes.Overall, Halloween II was never going to repeat the massive success of Halloween, which is unquestionably one of the best and greatest horror movies of all time.

From the very first thing we see on screen, with the title fading in, I was simply thrown into the film when I saw it. When Galadriel begins to narrate the prologue, I was just amazed at how Peter Jackson transformed all of JRR Tolkien's amazing work on screen. The prologue scene deserves to remain as one of the all time best intros to any film and perhaps the greatest introduction to a franchise ever made. We get to see a bit of the Last Alliance and a bit of Sauron. The prologue was spot on with the book.Then we go to the Shire, to the present day and things are just superb. The plot slows down but remains extremely exciting all the way through. The cast for the film was amazing and I could not think of anyone apart from Ian McKellen to play the role of Gandalf.Some complain the film slows down incredibly, but I've no issue with this. Seeing Christopher Lee as Saruman was just completely perfect. The duel between the two was just amazingly filmed. All the locations, such as Isengard, were exactly how I'd imagine them. The acting was amazing, the visual effects were too good for the eyes and the scenery was simply amazing. What I loved so much about FOTR was the Nazgul. They were so terrifying and so full of evil in these movies. The scene where Frodo is running from the Nazgul is amazing for many reasons. It was so thrilling and it also contained an amazing score.

Instead, they were relatively short, yet exciting keeping the audience engaged.The film ends beautifully and the friendship between Sam and Frodo is really well done in this film.Overall, definitely a must see film and definitely amongst the three best fantasy films of all time This, The Two Towers and the Return of the King.

I also loved how even though the prisoner was huge, he had a heart of gold, and he actually appeared cute and innocent to me during the whole movie. The only con of the movie was it took me a little bit to understand the murder of the little kids that was committed by the insane man in the movie. I also loved when the old Tom Hanks showed the old lady that he was telling the story to the mouse that was still alive.
