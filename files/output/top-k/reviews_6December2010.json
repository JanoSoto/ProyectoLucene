I first saw a trailer for it probably around the time of its release, or shortly after, and could tell right away that its title was obviously based on the title of the classic 19th century poem, The Night Before Christmas. However, I never watched any of the film until December 2007 (I think), but even then, I only saw a bit of it. I didn't actually watch the whole movie until last year, just a few days before Christmas, even though it appears it was originally released for Halloween in 1993. With that first viewing, I was disappointed, and certainly didn't understand the massive appeal, but with a second viewing nearly a year later, it did get better.All holidays have their own separate worlds, with entrance portals in trees! One of these worlds is Halloween Town, which is inhabited by different types of monsters who celebrate Halloween every year with a good fright. The leader of this celebration is a skeleton named Jack Skellington, but another October 31st has just gone by, and he is tired of the same routine year after year. His woes send him wandering out of town and into the forest, where he comes across the entrance to Christmas Town. He opens the door and is sucked in, but really likes what he sees on the other side. The other residents of Halloween Town have been wondering where Jack has gone, but he soon returns, much happier than he was when he left. He begins to share his knowledge of Christmas with the other monsters of the town, hoping to get them to help him celebrate this holiday for a change, but they can't seem to fully understand it.The intro of this movie shows us the place in the forest where each of the holiday entrances are located and features an opening narration by Edward Ivory. This narration is far from perfect, as Ivory tends to speak too fast. The intro is followed by the film's first musical number, This Is Halloween, which is a pretty good and intense song to start with. The stop-motion animation makes The Nightmare Before Christmas a visual treat, with well designed sets and figures. Christmas Town looks gorgeous as we watch Jack discover it, and I wish more scenes took place there. A number of characters stand out, including Jack Skellington, voiced well by both Chris Sarandon, who provides his speaking voice, and Danny Elfman, who provides his singing voice. Most of the voice acting I can't complain about, and that includes Edward Ivory as Santa, as he is definitely better in that role than he is as the opening narrator. The musical numbers can be a little weak, and mostly aren't really that memorable, but I guess they could be worse. The film does feature a decent amount of suspense, and there are some pretty humorous moments, such as the mischievous Lock, Shock, and Barrel accidentally bringing back the Easter Bunny to Halloween Town instead of Santa.Before I watched this movie last December, I thought there was a good chance it would be a ten out of ten in my book, just like it is to so many other viewers. However, that certainly wasn't the case for me, which became clear shortly after I started watching. After that first viewing, I wouldn't have been able to rate The Nightmare Before Christmas any higher than a six, as I found it to be a severely flawed mess, and after that, I couldn't hope to ever be able to rate the film higher than an eight. Fortunately, it now is an eight out of ten for me, so watching it a second time did help, and the film didn't seem so messy to me this time. I still can't join those who consider this 1993 animated blockbuster to be an absolute masterpiece, but I can recommend it. It may be too scary for really little kids, but for older kids and people in other age groups who like stop-motion animation, are Tim Burton fans (he had a major part in this, even though he didn't direct it), and want an entertaining film that combines Halloween and Christmas, this highly imaginative fantasy could be well worth it.

I didn't think all that much of it then. It actually improved a bit on re-watch, though I still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared. My main problem is (and was) that Spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep anti-war statement, some extremely important existential story, and it's just not. At heart, this is very much like the WWII classics The Story of G.I. Joe and Battleground (both directed by the great William A. Wellman), about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose. Sure, they are constantly asking the question Is it worth it?, but Spielberg's (painfully corny) wraparound story, with Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery, answer that question with a resounding DUH! Not to mention that the whole existential crisis (why should eight men be sent to die for one?) is a fabricated one, anyway, as it is, after all, fiction. And, during the film's release, we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an anti-war movie (one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome Joe Dante's completely forgotten Small Soldiers was, so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall). Yeah, it's so not that, either. The proof, twelve and a half years later, exists in the slew of WWII themed video games, all very clearly inspired by the film, that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years. I clearly remember Roger Ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun, but damned if people aren't having a ton of fun shooting up Nazis on their TVs. I'd guess that Saving Private Ryan has done more to recruit new soldiers than any Army of One commercial ever has.So, yeah, it misses several of its main aims. However, while you can castigate Steven Spielberg for misunderstanding his context, you can't say a thing bad about his technical work on the film. Sure, the hand-held aesthetic that he uses in the battle sequences has inspired a lot of very dire copycats over the past twelve years (try not to laugh during the big battle at the start of Gladiator), but it was pretty brilliant at the time, and it really puts you right there. War might be fun, but it's also damn scary, and I found myself shaking with some tears in my eyes after the gigantic beach storming that opens the film (I try to forget the Arlington sequences exist) finally comes to an end. The slower, more personal moments aren't the best (partly due to the variable cast, which ranges from fantastic (Jeremy Davies) to acceptable (Tom Hanks) to terribly annoying (Edward Burns and Paul Giamatti)), but they're mostly fine, and always beautifully shot. I love some of the smaller moments of the movie, especially the slap that the little French girl gives her father when the G.I.s are able to hand her back to him, after the extraordinarily tense sniper sequence.

The two men are very different. Father Pilkington is a theological and political conservative; his first sermon is effectively a paraphrase of Margaret Thatcher's famous no such thing as society speech. The considerably older Father Thomas is politically a left-wing radical and a theological liberal; Father Pilkington is shocked to discover that he is engaged in a long-standing sexual relationship with his housekeeper Maria.The younger man, however, also has his own struggles with his sexuality, as he is secretly a homosexual. He meets another man, Graham, at a local gay nightclub and the two begin a physical relationship. Father Pilkington's faith is further tested when a teenage schoolgirl confides to him in the confessional that she is being sexually abused by her father. Because of the traditional Catholic doctrine of the seal of the confessional, he is unable to notify the authorities, even though he is sorely tempted to do so.Priest was one of the most controversial British films of the 1990s because of the way in which it dealt with the issues of homosexuality, incest, child abuse and religious celibacy. As might be expected, it was particularly controversial in Catholic circles, and there have been numerous allegations, both on this board and elsewhere, that it is anti-Catholic. Critic Roger Ebert, although he is no longer a practising Catholic, was particularly scathing, saying that For this movie to be described as a moral statement about anything other than the filmmaker's prejudices is beyond belief. This is not a view with which I would agree. Priest is a dramatic exploration of various moral issues raised by Catholic theology, not an anti-Catholic diatribe. It is clearly not anti-Catholic in the sense of Protestantism good, Catholicism bad. Nor in the sense of Atheism good, Religion bad, Catholicism particularly so. Both the protagonists Father Pilkington and Father Thomas are men who, despite their disagreements with the Church authorities, find (in different ways) that Christian teachings give meaning to their lives as a source of values. Both (although they are tempted to leave the priesthood) remain loyal to the Church as an institution, believing that it is through the Church that they can best serve God. That doesn't seem to me to be either anti-Christian or anti-Catholic.At times it appears as though the scriptwriter Jimmy McGovern is arguing against traditionalist religion and in favour of a more inclusive Catholicism which accepts married priests, takes a more liberal line on homosexuality and focuses more on social issues than questions of sexual morality. Yet even this would be an oversimplification of the film's position. When Father Pilkington is finally exposed as gay, he is the target of severe criticism from his bishop, from several members of his congregation and from an elderly priest who tells him in Latin that he is a pustule on the body of Christ. (Greg's response is to tell him, also in Latin, Go **** yourself, you dirty old man). Yet his severest critic is himself. He sees his homosexual nature as something sinful, as a temptation that his is too weak to resist.Both Father Pilkington and Father Thomas can, in different ways, be seen as hypocritical. Yet Greg at least sees his hypocrisy for what it is. He realises that his priesthood gives him a position of spiritual authority within the Catholic Church and widespread respect outside it. He is therefore bound in all honesty to try to fulfil the responsibilities which go with that position, including the responsibility to abide by his vow of celibacy. Father Thomas, by contrast, is not self-critical enough to realise how hypocritical he is being. One of his favourite quotes from the Bible is Judge not, lest ye be judged. He interprets this, however, as a sort of bargain with God, hoping that if he takes a laissez-faire attitude to other people's sex-lives then God will turn a blind eye to his own blatant violation of his vow of celibacy. Father Thomas's principle of non-judgementalism does not, it should be noted, extend beyond the field of sexual ethics. In political matters he can be very judgemental indeed; in one sermon he accuses those who do not share his socialist world-view of spitting in the face of God.This was Antonia Bird's first feature film, and I was very impressed by it. She manages the difficult task of making complex religious issues seem both interesting and relevant in the cinema, but Priest is much more than a filmed theological debate. It is also a powerful psychological drama, with excellent performances from the two leading actors, Linus Roache and Tom Wilkinson, and an important contribution to the distinguished British tradition of social-realist film-making. Unlike some, I did not see it as a prejudiced attack on the Church. Rather, it is an exploration of a number of important issues which the Church needs to confront. That need is perhaps even more urgent in 2010 than it was in 1994. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 December 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Father Greg Pilkington is a young Roman Catholic priest who is assigned to a tough working-class parish in inner-city Liverpool, where he acts as assistant to the existing parish priest Father Matthew Thomas.

The considerably older Father Thomas is politically a left-wing radical and a theological liberal; Father Pilkington is shocked to discover that he is engaged in a long-standing sexual relationship with his housekeeper Maria.The younger man, however, also has his own struggles with his sexuality, as he is secretly a homosexual. He meets another man, Graham, at a local gay nightclub and the two begin a physical relationship. Father Pilkington's faith is further tested when a teenage schoolgirl confides to him in the confessional that she is being sexually abused by her father. Because of the traditional Catholic doctrine of the seal of the confessional, he is unable to notify the authorities, even though he is sorely tempted to do so.Priest was one of the most controversial British films of the 1990s because of the way in which it dealt with the issues of homosexuality, incest, child abuse and religious celibacy. As might be expected, it was particularly controversial in Catholic circles, and there have been numerous allegations, both on this board and elsewhere, that it is anti-Catholic. Critic Roger Ebert, although he is no longer a practising Catholic, was particularly scathing, saying that For this movie to be described as a moral statement about anything other than the filmmaker's prejudices is beyond belief. This is not a view with which I would agree. Priest is a dramatic exploration of various moral issues raised by Catholic theology, not an anti-Catholic diatribe. It is clearly not anti-Catholic in the sense of Protestantism good, Catholicism bad. Nor in the sense of Atheism good, Religion bad, Catholicism particularly so. Both the protagonists Father Pilkington and Father Thomas are men who, despite their disagreements with the Church authorities, find (in different ways) that Christian teachings give meaning to their lives as a source of values. Both (although they are tempted to leave the priesthood) remain loyal to the Church as an institution, believing that it is through the Church that they can best serve God. That doesn't seem to me to be either anti-Christian or anti-Catholic.At times it appears as though the scriptwriter Jimmy McGovern is arguing against traditionalist religion and in favour of a more inclusive Catholicism which accepts married priests, takes a more liberal line on homosexuality and focuses more on social issues than questions of sexual morality. Yet even this would be an oversimplification of the film's position. When Father Pilkington is finally exposed as gay, he is the target of severe criticism from his bishop, from several members of his congregation and from an elderly priest who tells him in Latin that he is a pustule on the body of Christ. (Greg's response is to tell him, also in Latin, Go **** yourself, you dirty old man). Yet his severest critic is himself. He sees his homosexual nature as something sinful, as a temptation that his is too weak to resist.Both Father Pilkington and Father Thomas can, in different ways, be seen as hypocritical. Yet Greg at least sees his hypocrisy for what it is. He realises that his priesthood gives him a position of spiritual authority within the Catholic Church and widespread respect outside it. He is therefore bound in all honesty to try to fulfil the responsibilities which go with that position, including the responsibility to abide by his vow of celibacy. Father Thomas, by contrast, is not self-critical enough to realise how hypocritical he is being. One of his favourite quotes from the Bible is Judge not, lest ye be judged. He interprets this, however, as a sort of bargain with God, hoping that if he takes a laissez-faire attitude to other people's sex-lives then God will turn a blind eye to his own blatant violation of his vow of celibacy. Father Thomas's principle of non-judgementalism does not, it should be noted, extend beyond the field of sexual ethics. In political matters he can be very judgemental indeed; in one sermon he accuses those who do not share his socialist world-view of spitting in the face of God.This was Antonia Bird's first feature film, and I was very impressed by it. She manages the difficult task of making complex religious issues seem both interesting and relevant in the cinema, but Priest is much more than a filmed theological debate. It is also a powerful psychological drama, with excellent performances from the two leading actors, Linus Roache and Tom Wilkinson, and an important contribution to the distinguished British tradition of social-realist film-making. Unlike some, I did not see it as a prejudiced attack on the Church. Rather, it is an exploration of a number of important issues which the Church needs to confront.

The film takes place the small town of Anarene, Texas during the 1950s.Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges) live in the small Texas town of Anarene and are typical teenage boys. The film starts during their senior year of high school and both have girlfriends. The boys spend time at the local pool hall or going to the picture show with their girlfriends until Sonny loses his after the two basically got bored with each other. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Shepherd) is the prettiest girl in town and at the start of the film she is a good girl but her mother (Burstyn) really wants her to break loose of Duane and explore the other men of the town. The film revolves around Sonny, Duane, and Jacy and how they experience sexuality in many ways from many suitors.Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich wrote one of the most spectacular screenplays of all time for this film. Never have I seen a film flow so brilliantly throughout and it does not have an ordinary structure of a film, it just continues through the characters' experiences. I find that the majority of great screenplays throughout history are character driven rather than plot driven because if you don't know and care about the character why should you care about the plot? The three lead roles in the film were so comprehensively built it was absolutely wonderful. I loved seeing when Sonny and his father had about a ten second conversation, in those ten seconds I was able to understand Sonny's entire family life. The theme of loss of innocence in this film was also absolutely wonderful, the screenplay was just terrific.Peter Bogdanovich's direction matched the brilliance of the screenplay that he co-wrote. There were hundreds of shots in this film that were so simply beautiful and were able to get me inside the characters mind and into a deeper level of the film. The scene with Jacy going to the naked pool party was wonderfully shot and will ironically be remembered. It just showed the curiosity of a young person trying to become an adult. Also I really loved the final scene of the film, but I will go into no detail in order to not spoil it for those who have not seen it. Sadly Bogdanovich has not directed another film as wonderful as this one.Not only did Bogdanovich write and direct a great film, he got two Oscar winning performances from his actors. One is not from Timothy Bottoms, but I thought he gave an amazing performance as an innocent young boy trying to become a man. Some of this best acting would have to be with Cloris Leachman when they are having an affair. His simple expressions are just magnificent in showing his confusion about the world that surrounds him. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for playing a simple teenager on the outside but a boy longing for love on the inside. Definitely one of the best performances of his very successful career. Cybill Shepherd's character Jacy was definitely one of the most interesting characters in this film in how she wanted to experience pure lovemaking and bliss, and not end up like her mother. She was absolutely stunning, like the rest of the cast. Ben Johnson won the Oscar for his role as Sam the Lion. The scene in which he showed why he deserved to win was when his son came home with a bloody nose and he told the other boys to leave him alone as a tired old man who was done fighting. That was one of the most effective scenes in the film and will also always remain in my memory. Cloris Leachman won an Oscar as well for her performance as a woman who is depressed with her marriage and has an affair with the young Sonny Crawford. The weakness in her face while performing was just enchanting, everything about her was so real. This film definitely has one of the greatest ensemble performances of all time.The editing by Donn Cambern was spectacularly done, I really liked how the film was in black and white making the simple town even simpler. If this was in color I could not really see myself liking it as much and that is why this decision was extremely well executed. The film flowed seamlessly going from character to character. I was completely engaged the whole entire film and never was the rhythm broken. Many films with multiple stories don't work out well because the editing makes it like a break in the film and that takes you out of the film experience.I really loved the country music that was used throughout the film. It added another layer of simplicity to small town and the black and white appearance. Music is key to making a film flow like the editing and this film did it wonderfully letting the songs express the language of the film.Overall I give this film a 10\/10. It is one of the greatest films of all time and is wonderful in every aspect of it. There is nothing I could say that is wrong with this film, I absolutely loved it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys extremely powerful dramas about the loss of innocence because this is one of the greatest ever. Ever. Go see it right now.

Some bad films are trashy but can be a bit fun, like Showgirls and some can just be wrong like Striptease. Barb Wire is a film I guess in some way I'm kind of undecided on, it has the making for just a bad movie with Pamela's bad acting but has the action scenes and cheesy lines that make it fun as well. This movie is a retelling of Cassablanca and isn't so quick to hide that fact, so I guess this is the exotic remake. Pam Anderson is a sexy female lead and isn't that hard to believe that at times she can be tough, she does wear that leather well I have to admit, but some of the way she delivers the lines was a little too Shaquil O'Neil, I think if you're going to do a movie like this, you might as well go over the top, go a little James Woods, it's all good. But we need a fun action film with the lead being female, just sad that this is a bad film that got overlooked. Set in 2017 during the Second American Civil War, Barb Wire owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in Steel Harbor the last free city in a United States ravaged by the civil war and she brings in extra cash by hiring out as a mercenary and bounty hunter. Her club is raided by Chief of Police Willis, who is looking for the fugitive Dr. Corrina Cora Devonshire. Devonshire, a former government scientist, has information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior, Colonel Pryzer of the Congressional Directorate; she is trying to escape to Canada in order to make this information public. Meanwhile, Devonshire has turned up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood, a freedom fighter whom Barb had known at the outbreak of the war, but the two were separated soon afterward. Axel is now married to Cora, and is trying to help her get to Canada. They are trying to find a contraband pair of contact lenses which will allow Cora to evade the retinal scan at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.Barb Wire really wasn't as bad as I was expecting, even though it's just a remake of a classic romantic movie, it does have some cool moments. I loved some of the action scenes, the fight on the fork lift was a lot of fun to watch and since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, it's all good and makes the fight scenes that more exciting.

If you have an open mind and are looking for a good bad film, I think you'll get a kick out Barb Wire.

Having somewhat recovered from her rape at the hands of thugs who killed her mother, Kersey's daughter is trying to pick up the pieces with her pops, but when LA produces some more slime who sexually molest the poor girl again, she can not take it and commits suicide. This pushes Kersey over the edge and he will exact his own brand of justice. I imagine director Michael Winner's sequel will push some buttons as Kersey's wallet is stolen by no-good hoods who seem to exist for the sole purpose to terrorize and harm. The gang intrude upon Kersey's home and savagely rape his maid, knock him unconscious when he comes home, and kidnaps his daughter. What's repulsive about this particular movie is the idea that the gang of mongrels are allowed to molest a mentally crippled young woman who had previously endured an awful rape, escaping from them through a window only to be impaled on a steel fence. What the maid suffers through is heinous, and to see Kersey's girl's fate is even more troubling.Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife, plays his girlfriend and Laurence Fishburne is one of the dirtbags who Kersey will eradicate like the cockroach he is. The plot essentially follows Kersey as he takes to the streets searching for those responsible for the deaths of his maid and daughter, a night predator seeking his prey. The streets are engulfed with low-lifes, gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes(and their pimps), and filth. It's like a wasteland where rats scurry about en masse, walls are decorated with graffiti, buildings of all have fallen to rot and ruin, and all sorts of cultures and creeds align the sidewalks and alley ways. And there is Kersey among them, out to annihilate the vermin which inflicted his life with further pain. Kersey is an LA architect who moved from New York due to the harassment of a cop who comes to the City of Angels hoping to catch the vigilante in the act so he can stop him.The motive of movies like DEATH WISH II is to present a gang so repugnant and revolting that they're deaths are applauded to the delight of the audience. The criminal element in LA according to Winner and company are only good for one thing and that's dying. Ireland's character is a journalist, Geri, a pacifist who believes the criminals should be rehabilitated, that the prison system doesn't stop crime, but perhaps contributes to it further.The ending tries to have it both ways. Kersey is punished for his willingness to strike back and loses Geri because of it, yet the whole movie affords him the opportunity to kill every last cretin. Is this movie supposed to question taking the law into your own hands when it seems the police are unable to deter crime? Or does it condone such vigilante actions? There's a for example scene where Kersey catches some of the gang attempting to rape the wife of a tourist, shooting them down before they were able to seal the deal. If he doesn't shoot it out with them, they will rape and possibly murder the woman, while her defenseless husband must listen from afar. When the police want his identification, the saved couple will not give it to them.Bottom line these dregs of society will continue to go about raping and pillaging, trading guns for cocaine, bullying citizens on buses, causing mischief and mayhem.

His characters have the bravery and lack of fear (or is it manliness?), which I also enjoyed with for instance John Wayne. With regard to the intellectual content, I am less certain about the excellence of Hemingways narratives. Nevertheless, For whom the bell tolls is a true epic. And the Spanisch Civil War is an outstanding stage for the unfolding of a story. Here the people had chosen a government that originated from their own ranks. And when the conservative military tried to seize power, the people put up a resistance that was both heroic and long lasting. The fascist military got support from its allies in Italy and Germany, whereas the Republic was reinforced with International Brigades of all kinds (but with a dominance of Bolshevists). In the film we see an American professor, Roberto, who works as a saboteur for the Republican Peoples Army Headquarters. He is ordered to blow up a bridge in the Spanish mountains, as part of a republican offensive. Unlike many foreign fighters, during his quest Roberto is embedded in a group of Spanish partisans. The film is easily accessible, and is never boring, alth0ugh it contains no surprises. There are little political moments, and actually the film has been dubbed as one of the greatest romances. For Roberto yields to the intimate advances of a young girl named Maria. During the war her republican parents were killed and she herself was raped by the nationalists. It is evident that she is in great emotional anguish, which combines with an adolescent instability. What does Hemingway intend to express? The dialogs seem superficial and devoid of clues. So I guess Hemingway uses the whole entourage as a parable, just to reflect on the war itself. For although the Spanish Civil War has gained an image of social progress and human liberation, contemporary sources suggest that the society was still primitive and in the feudal stage. It may well be that the Spanish situation resembled the turmoil in Russia around 1917, that has been portrayed so skillfully in Doctor Zhivago. In fact the leader Pablo of the partisan group was responsible for the massacre of the nationalists in his own village. During the expedition Pablo murders a few partisans from another group, who had joined him in an attack on enemy positions. I only care for my people, Pablo explains. It may well have been the experience of Hemingway himself, that the heraldic partisans were in fact simple farmers, who wanted to get rid of the land owners, and disliked anything outside of their field of vision. What appeared as anarchism was perhaps backwardness. Such a state of mind might explain the primitive cruelty of the war, as is portrayed in the film. Then the romance with Maria might represent Hemingways passion for the poor people of Spain. In the last scene, when Roberto prepares for the final battle, he ponders over his devotion. Is it towards America? Spain or the Republic? No, it is towards the desolate Maria. Anyway, I find the film recommendable. However, I definitely prefer the little-known film Fuenf Patronenhuelsen, also about the Spanish Civil War, and even about a similar mission. You might also consider the Ivens documentary The Spanish Earth, also with Hemingway. The Loach film Land and Freedom is also worth seeing.

And what makes it difficult is that their personalities are poles apart (at least upon the surface).The scene at the Bravewood Inn is memorable and haunting of how good of an actor Candy was and how amazing he still could have been. For Martin too though, it is well played and perfectly acted giving us the straight-anal man, Neil Page. The greatest quality to this film is the fact that Hughes, Martin, and Candy were able to blend that of comedy and drama together flawlessly.All-in-all, there are too many great parts to this film. The acting, the writing, the cheesy 80's electronic soundtrack, all contribute to the masterpiece which is easily Hughes' greatest work. Even the delivery of lines from the great Michael McKean is top-notch, but I digress... Here I write that Planes, Trains & Automobiles is my idea of everything Candy could have given us.

Audrey Tautou does a wonderful job portraying the young woman, Amélie. The pace of this film is fast, short and choppy scenes. The use of voice-over narration was a must and it blended well due to the lack of dialog in a majority of the scenes. The use of colors was used most effectively to evoke mood and emotion throughout the film. The colors were vivid, never muted, because nothing in Amélie's life was muted. Amélie is surrounded by dysfunctional people from birth. Her parents played by Rufus and Lorella Cravotta, were not the sensitive parents that small children thrive on. There are no scenes where either parent holds or hugs the child. Amélie is only six when her mother died in a freak accident. After the mother's death, the father withdraws even more and Amélie becomes even more introverted. The father, who was a retired army doctor, misdiagnosed his five year old daughter as having a heart defect. He declared her to be unfit for public school. She was left to amuse herself, which she does quite well because she had a vivid and wild imagination, which she carries into her adult life. In her early adult years, Amélie does move out of her father's house, moves into an apartment, and holds down a job, but somehow she finds herself surrounded by dysfunctional people everywhere she goes. Amélie befriends an elderly neighbor, Mr. Dyfayel play by Serge Merlin, who is known as the Glass Man. Supposedly he has bones that are brittle as glass. Whenever Amélie is with Mr. Dyfayel the pace slows and they actually have meaningful conversations. He is very intuitive and tries to draw her out of her shell. I'd like to think that he was the father figure she never had. In the meantime, Amélie becomes intrigued with a young man, Nino played by Mathieu Kassovitz, who is collecting certain torn up photos that are found near photo booths in the train stations. It was love at first sight for her. She thinks of very clever and imaginative ways in which to have encounters with him; however, she avoids direct contact with him. It isn't until Mr. Dyfayel helps Amélie realize that if she does not take a risk, she will not find the happiness that she seeks. I recommend viewing the film at least three times before making a decision as to whether or not you like it. Each viewing will bring to light more details about just how wild Amélie's imagination can be.
