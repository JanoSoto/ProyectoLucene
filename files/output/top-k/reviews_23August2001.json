This is unquestionably the best scene in the film, both for its creativeness as well as its effectiveness. This kid falls asleep on the plane as everyone is boarding (another common occurrence among high school kids on planes filled with their friends, I'm sure), and has a dream about a defective seat back table and a subsequent, and pretty impressive, explosion on the plane that kills everyone.As the plane is going up in flames and people are getting sucked out through the hole in the side of the plane and burning to death and whatnot, Alex wakes up in a cold sweat and a frantic panic. Suddenly back to reality, he climbs over people trying to get back to the seat where his dream takes place, and when he gets there, he finds the same defective seat back table that was in his dream and therefore concludes that it was a clairvoyant dream and starts yelling that the plane is going to explode. Not bad for a movie that doesn't appear to be anything more than the latest teen slasher movie. And to top it all off, the part where the plane actually does explode (as seen from inside the airport), and especially the brief pause before the windows of the airport explode inward as well, is also one of the more satisfying scenes in the film. Unfortunately, it's pretty much all downhill from there. It seems that by avoiding being blown to bits on the plane, the kids who got off (some whether they liked it or not) seem to have `cheated' Death, and Death doesn't seem to be too happy about it. They are apparently being stalked by Death, as he (or, more likely, she) begins killing them one by one in increasingly outlandish and sometimes laughable death scenes. Is this really as original and entertaining as the explosion scene at the beginning of the film? Probably not. In fact, not even close. A bunch of scared teenagers being killed off one by one. Can you name another movie where this has happened? Can you really name a horror movie made in the 90s where this HASN'T happened?On the one hand, you KNOW that nothing like these scenes would ever happen in real life. For the most part, computers that people have in their homes do not have anything in them that would explode if vodka were accidentally spilled into the monitor, and even if there was something like that inside it, it probably wouldn't explode through the screen, the strongest part of the entire thing. I also fail to feel any sympathy for someone who strangles in the bathroom because he thrashed his legs around while hanging by his neck from a cord, kicking his feet everywhere except directly underneath him. Take some knowledge, people (as this poor guy would have said), if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, stand up. It'll save your life. And don't even get me started on the power line at the end of the film that whipped around like a severed worm in fast forward. This is just garbage, couldn't they think of something better than that? Power lines do not behave like loose fire hoses on full blast when they are cut, they behave like cut cords. Probably the only death scene in the film that was really shocking and impressive (as well as relieving, given the character) was the one with the city bus.On the other hand, this stuff does have a sort of purpose. Sure, every death in the film was ludicrous (even the rather grisly one dealt to Seann William Scott), but this gives shape to the character of Death. It's one of the film's good points that the Grim Reaper wasn't personified as a huge shape in a black cloak, stalking the kids and killing them. That would have put Final Destination in the same stagnant pool with all of these other goofy teen slashers and also would have ruined the movie beyond all hope. Instead, we get these outlandish and often ridiculously exaggerated death scenes, so it almost gives the feeling that Death is taking time out of his busy schedule to hand these people their asses personally. As Mallory Knox would say, `There's no escapin' here!' There are very few interesting things about this movie, other than such things as that you can see Tony Todd, known as virtually nothing other than the Candyman, in a small role as the freakiest mortician on the planet. Also, it's interesting to ponder what would possibly have made Alex so hated and feared for saving those people's lives, especially when he is alienated the most by the very people that he saved. Carter, in particular, develops an unfathomable hatred for Alex that swells to the exploding point. You'd think those jerks would be grateful. At any rate, the film as a whole is entertaining enough, but doesn't make much progress in attempting to elevate itself above the recent abundance of terrible teen thrillers and slasher movies and horror films. It is far above the abysmal level of such messes as I Know What You Did Last Summer and Valentine, as well as hideous spoofs like the Scary Movies, but Final Destination is definitely not meant for a more mature audience. If you decide to watch it, try to enjoy it for what it is, but keep your expectations low.

It's fantastic, his imagination really runs wild, and you're never left with a moment's piece from all the jokes. If the dialog isn't making you laugh, then something in the background is. You just want to see this movie again and again. Buy all day tickets and live in that room. Every scene that's ever made you want to be in the movie biz because it would be just so damn fun to do is in this movie. It's like stepping into Jay and Silent Bob's world. The turn out of people with cameo's just goes to show how popular Smith is to this industry. Bob and Jay's duel with Mark Hamill is a mixture of Star Wars with 60's Batman and gave me the burning desire to see Sam Raimi's Spider-Man or anything comic related on the planet. His love of these movies and comics just rubs right off on you and you walk out of the flick just wanting to grab your girl\/guy\/pal and watch 24 hours of View Askew movies with some other classics in-between.The very intro clued people into just how damn silly this movie will be. If you have any worries, they'll be put to rest within the very first few moments of the film. Jason Mewes never becomes tiring, and Kevin Smith's Silent Bob is one of the most underrated acts. Smith's facial expressions, hand movements and background movement do more than words ever could. Mewes's full personality shines, as we're given the full perspective of Jay's character. Every word he says is well crafted and is given with an Oscar winning performance. Smith light-heartedly makes fun of the film industry, the internet, comics and everything else while still being as sadistic about it as possible.Some downfalls 1) If anyone's read the comics, you'll notice that some scenes are taken right out of the books. They're all great ideas, but this is a shame for some because it's like watching something all over again. This is great for those of you haven't read the comic books, but is a drag for others. Unless of course you want nothing better than to see the comics in live action. 2) Casting Will Ferrell (Federal Wildlife Marshall Wilenholly) was a mistake. His style really clashes with Smith's and takes away from the movie. He breaks your concentration, and is the type of stupid silly that people who watch Smith flicks try to stray away from. 3) The parody of other movies reminded me so much of other REALLY bad movies that I found them almost out of taste. Smith pulls them off as best as they can ever been done, and are as funny as hell, but I still get Scary Movie flash backs just thinking about it. 4) Not enough of the oldies were in it. I was hoping for more from Dante and Randle especially. Since they got Smith where he is today, I wanted to see more screen time devoted to them. And I could always do with more Jason Lee.Those are all just knit-pickings, and I think J&SBSB is Smith's best effort to date. It's fast paced, never leaves you wishing a certain scene was over and done with, and allows you to laugh at the very things you love and walk away reminding you just what great flicks those were too. His direction has really grown, and the camera takes a much more active role in the film. Smith is the biggest movie fan to become director, and has some of the greatest senses of humor a human has to offer our race.

After a few minutes into the film I became used to the idea of Keaton as Batman.  In my opinion Michael Keaton of all three actors that played Batman in films has to be the best of them all so far.  Unlike Superman the Movie(1978), Batman(1989) did not make the casting choice of picking an unknown actor to play Batman(1989). Jack Nicholson made headlines when starring in Batman(1989) because of the then large salary he was making from the picture.  In the beginning of the picture his character of Jack Napier seems like a variation of Charlie Partaine of Prizzi's Honor(1985).  His characterization of the Joker is so flamboyant and wild to the point of pushing Batman's antics to the sidelines.  Nicholson's performance's as The Joker makes him the best villain in the four Batman films.Kim Basinger puts on one of her raw very good performances as Vicki Vale. Her part was originally written for Sean Young who got injured doing a scene that didn't make it into the final script.  Robert Wuhl does an alright job as journalist Alexander Knox.  Jack Palance and Jerry Hall are in the film for too short a time to make any kind of impression.The designs of Batman's Gothem City would influence the looks of many later Scifi\/Graphic Novel motion pictures.  In one way Batman(1989) was more influential to other Comic Books adaptations into films than Superman the Movie(1978) was because of the former's stylistic themes.  The soundtrack for Batman(1989) is as good as the soundtrack John Williams did for Superman the Movie(1978).  Gothem City in Batman(1989) combines the look of Fritz Lang's Metrpolis(1926), Ridley Scott's Blade Runner(1982), and Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985).Mario Bava has influenced many filmmakers around the world especially the director of Batman, Tim Burton.  Perhaps no one has been influenced by the visual style and use of colorization of Mario Bava as has been the case with Tim Burton(Dario Argento although influenced by Mario Bava has a style that completely his own).  This influence can be seen in the way Tim Burton uses bizarre set designs to depict a strange dreamish landscape that doesn't seem real.  The Mario Bava picture that I feel was visually stylisticly responsible for the look and mood of Batman(1989) is Diabolik(1968).Although I think that Batman(1989) is a very good film and entertaining as well its still not in the same realm as Superman the Movie(1978) for three reasons.  First, there is almost no chemistry between Batman\/Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale as there was with Superman and Lois Lane.  Second, Batman(1989) fails to reach the grandeur of Superman the Movie(1978) on many ideas and themes.  Three, Superman the Movie(1978) contained a three dimensional story that made the viewer interested about what happened to the main characters.

The industry loves this stuff. So do actors when they get to play a character that acts. So do I. This time we have a very clever twist in how this is conceived, some interesting acting and a quirky director.First the conception. Actors love playing actors, because that way they can play a few characters at once. Sometimes this occurs when the character isn't actually an actor but is acting nonetheless, as in con stories. Sometimes the actor adds the levels of himself and showing how he acts. But here we have a real twist We have Defoe, playing a character which is pretending to be an actor but is actually the character that the actor is acting. What a marvelous idea! It must have swept through Hollywood.I have no doubt that many actors rushed to get in on the idea. Superficially, the most quirky involvement is Cage as producer. Cage is intense in his acting, but among many attempts, we have never seen anything intelligent, just intense -- sometimes apt, mostly not. But he obviously wants to be smart. Watching him on the DVD talk about this, one can see how puffed up he is, and how clueless.Dafoe is the right man for the job in one respect, he plays one character exceedingly well. But that's not where the gold is. The real payoff would have been him playing with the multiple layers of self-reference. He does do some amusing stuff with his poses which one could see as him trying act like a movie version of himself. Clearly this is his goal, but its not leveraged, or extended to other worlds. Still, this is worth watching.Malkovich is another case altogether. He is like the fellow in the meeting who seems to do nothing, but if you take him out of the equation the meeting falls apart. Malkovich is cursed in that when he acts, you cannot see that he his acting. This is not as advantageous as it sounds to cast no shadow. Here's where he falls down. He gives lip service to the collapse of reality and imagination but doesn't actually live that collapse.The other dimension of this film is the director's vision, and this is related to Malkovich's problem. This director does both get and have the stuff to live the collapse. His  vision is strong, competent, and transports us. It successfully bridges the genuine `other' film vision and his own modern one. The former has its anchor in surrealism, the modern one in selfawareness. Merhige races ahead in his collapsing of layers and dimensions and visions, doing what Aranofski wishes he were. Malkovich is his screen avatar and should be leading the way, but doesn't. And he bungles the key trick.That trick, which modern audiences will call the `Usual Suspects\/Sixth Sense' twist, actually comes well before the end. We know that Mernau is a drug addict and that Greta is too. Also that `we don't need a writer anymore.' Also that the director is no longer in charge. The trick dimension is that the Count isn't really a vampire, just an actor that the drugs of the cast (and the general aether of Berlin is a drug here) make appear so. Watch when Greta sees the Count's reflection in the mirror. Everyone in the audience WILL see that reflection because it really is there. But she is convinced she doesn't, and I'll bet you were too.

To be fair I did like the premise of the story, hell that's why I chose it out of 40 odd films at the festival that year, and I don't think the plot had any problems as such, but please, the character development, acting, script and directorial pretentiousness just made the whole thing an absolute joke. Unless of course that's what you were intending to do and it was meant to be a satirical farce, then I say thumbs up, 10 stars, woohoo, pure entertainment!!!

Just look at the success of Shrek and you'll see what I mean.  Now THAT'S a film with wit and intelligence behind its silly humor, and that's why it works for both kids and adults.  So I'm no longer going to say, Hey, it's a family film.  What do you expect?  Maybe all you parents out there are willing to lower your cinematic standards to please your young ones, but I sure as hell ain't.After watching that horrible, disastrous, disgusting, mindless comedy Good Burger (and you wonder why children's IQs are getting lower and lower by the second), I promised I would never watch another film produced by Nickelodeon EVER again!  Well, being that I'm also an open-minded moviegoer I decided What the heck? when I spotted this movie on the racks of my local West Coast Video.The first thirty minutes are UNBEARABLE!!!  I had extreme difficulty watching it straight-through.  My thumb was itching for the Stop button like you wouldn't believe!  Once they introduced the bumbling principal, I almost dropped dead.  Is that the biggest cliche in the book or what??? One of my favorite comedies of all time is Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which involves a dean of students (Jeffrey Students) bumbling around like an ape, but was he stupid?  No.  He was just clumsy and had very bad luck.  Here, we have a stupid principal who bumbles (predictably) around, and the kids throw snowballs at him.  I know that kids hate their principals (Hell, I didn't like mine all that much either), but I think it's the portrayal of adults that ticks me off.  It's always a cliche in kiddie flicks for the adults to be complete morons, since it's from their point of view.  And since they hate principals even more, we have to make that person the biggest idiot on the face of the planet.  One of those tired cliches that you just want to beat the hell out of the screenwriters for using.To add to our list of tired cliches, we have the inevitable romantic subplot.  But I will say, that chick who played the love interest was HOT HOT HOT!!  Like in all these stories, she's going with this airhead jock who makes you wonder, What did she see in him in the first place?  And the guy who has a major crush on her (Mark Webber) and supposedly seems invisible to her has this clingy female friend who clicks with him one hundred-percent and has the hots for him, but just doesn't know how to reveal it to him. It's no mystery how this is going to turn out.One critic made a good point.  This is one film where you actually want MORE of Chevy Chase.  He makes a few appearances as a competitive TV weatherman. Chase hasn't exactly been in his prime.  His last work was a supporting role in the low-budget comedy Dirty Work with Norm McDonald and Artie Lange. A movie I still enjoy as a guilty pleasure, but let's face it...it wasn't a box office success, like many of Chevy's previous movies.  However, he's still a fine comedian and knows how to deliver a joke.  This is one of Chevy's (recent) works, where you're actually begging to see more of him on screen.  Chris Elliott wasn't that funny as the Snowplow Man (though I wouldn't exactly blame him), but I appreciate his effort.  Elliott is usually the kind of comic actor who can be funny if given a good script, but obnoxious if given a bad one.  Here, he's in the borderline.  He doesn't try to ham it up as much as, say, he did in that annoying role in Scary Movie 2.  Some of the kids were much more annoying than him.  I actually wanted him to run those little ba**ards down with his plow.OK, enough with the negative.  I'm not giving this film a high recommendation, but I found it amazingly innocuous (once it passed the 30-minute mark) for a Nickelodeon-produced flick.  Of course, we could've done without that recurring gag involving the fat kid farting (it seems like anytime there's an obese character in a kiddie flick, he has to be the butt--no pun intended--of all the flatulence jokes), but as a general rule I found it to be a surprisingly smooth ride the rest of the way.  I still received only the occasional Ha as the film continued to progress, but at least I wasn't grumbling like I was at first.  All the story arcs are resolved in a predictable manner, but not in a way in which you're torchered by the obvious cliches.Snow Day is not a film I'd recommend for the 18 and older crowd, but if you're an adult with children who eat up this kind of fluff, it's moderately easy to take.

A pity really, I found his comedies such as 'Jingle all the way' quite a laugh. But I suppose, like Hulk Hogan was better at wrestling than acting, Arnie is still a muscle-man, and that's a role he returned to, for End of Days.I'm not going to completely shower this film with praise, as it did have faults. I felt the sex scene was needless, the way Arnie worked out the girl's name was ridiculous, and I had a major problem accepting that Arnie would be left alive on the cross, and when he woke up, he was able to get up straight away.Still, despite these obvious flaws, I immensely enjoyed it. It has a lot more substance and plot to it than something like Eraser, and I thought the ending was appropriate, as it meant Arnie didn't win outright. I really didn't want to pick any flaws in this film, and when I'd finished watching, all I could think of was praise for it.
