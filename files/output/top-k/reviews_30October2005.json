One of the things that I truly enjoyed about this movie, and probably the thing that put an already incredible movie over the top for me, is the realism of the way that things play out.Before I dig too deeply into that, allow me to say that everything about this movie was outstanding. Each actor captured their roles perfectly. In a movie that had so many name actors, you got the idea that they were all truly trying to work together to make each scene special rather than trying to upstage each other. Now I understand that Matt Damon and Edward Norton were still relatively young in their popularity when the movie came out but I believe that makes their unselfish performances even more noteworthy.Aside from the brilliant acting from the main characters right on down to the smallest bit player, the film has a seamless flow throughout. Every scene is meaningful and necessary to telling the story. At no time do you watch a scene and when it ends think to yourself that it didn't need to be in the movie. The transitions from scene to scene don't skip a beat. Each character is well defined.Getting back to my original point though, what truly put this movie over the top in my mind was the authenticity of what takes place. A straight flush and especially a royal flush are just not very common in the world of poker. In many Hollywood-ized films, one of these types of hands would be the end all to your film. It would be the type of hand that improbably highlights the hero scoring his ultimate victory. Things like this do not happen in Rounders. Common winning hands like flushes, straights and full houses are featured.Aside from that fact is the very realistic idea that many of the hands are not won because of what they are, but rather because of how they are played. People who are familiar with the game of Poker, Texas Hold Em in particular, understand the fact that this is so often the case. That is the icing on this wonderfully baked cinematic cake.Adding to the authenticity of the game is the lingo used by the card players. Watching the movie gives you a realistic feel of the banter used amongst avid card players and this gives yet another true feel to the movie.Don't be fooled though, my wife doesn't ever play cards and she (amongst many who don't play) enjoys the movie a great deal as well. The characters themselves are enough to hook you into the movie from start to finish. All-in-all, Rounders is an excellent film whether you are an avid poker nut like myself or somebody who just wants to see a great movie with an outstanding plot and beautifully developed characters.

It is one of my absolute favorites, the only good movie Emilio Estevez has ever starred and one of the best movies made in the 80's.It is really hard for me to explain why I like it. Ever since I accidentally taped it I have watched it time after time, enjoying the wacky plot, the subtle humor and truly bizarre duologue (another element in the movie which Quentin Tarantino has stolen), the cool punk rock soundtrack and the superb acting of Emilio Estevez and Harry Dean Stanton in the Otto - Bud companionship and, not the least discovering something new every time I have watched it.And that is probably why Repo Man is Tarantino ten years before Pulp Fiction and X - Files ten years before that stupid show ever got started. The only other movie that pops into my mind if I should make a comparison is Richard Kellys Donnie Darko and that movie doesn't even posses the ironic, unpretentious B -movie kind of attitude which makes Repo Man so great.The film reminds me more of novels like Don Delillos White Noise or Thomas Pynckon's The crying of Lot 49 and the script is almost like a mixture of these two. Repo Man simply manages to catch and satirize the whole feeling of the 80's in one and a half hour The fear of nuclear war,consumerism, New Age,pseudo science and a lot more. The - at best amateurish - special effects (take, for instance the hail of ice cubes)doesn't really matter. They just tend to strengthen the unconventional and off - beat mood of the film.On top of that it manages to mix several film genres comedy, thriller, Sci-fi, buddy movie etc. and integrate a punk soundtrack superbly.But let's face it Repo Man IS a cult film in the sense that not everybody would like it. Like others has commented it can never - and probably shouldn't be - included into the same league as Citizen Cane. It is best kept as is a cult pearl, loved by a small audience. Emilio Estevez'ever surly and snotty, pseudo-rebellious attitude is simply perfectly casted for the Otto character paired with Harry Dean Stantons elderly mentor in car theft and speed sniffing.It seems to me that he knows that it's his best performance ever, since he and Charley Sheen copied a lot of its elements and even used the same actors in the terrible Men at work. Just a wild guess, but anyone agree?Another wild guess upon watching the film Have you noticed how Repo Man refers to a lot of other movies, mostly big Hollywood blockbusters of the same era?So far I have found a least five references Grease (The race with the Rodriguez brothers at the bottom of the reservoir) Star Wars (the ending), E.T(The flying car), Raiders of the Lost Ark (the car burning up bad guys), Close Encounters of The Third Kind\/Degree...whatever(The ending again, off course.2001 - A space Odessey is also a possibility.

Sebastian makes the same reply to Pris, the android.Another couple of goofs In the scene where it is revealed that Marlene is in league with the Rodriguez brothers,she is dressed just like Patty Hearst was on the famous picture from the time she had joined\/was forced into The Symbionetic Liberation Army.The Stanley Millgram experiment The way Otto is tortured when he falls into the hand of the FBI agents reminds of the famous experiment Stanley Millgram made to test how far people were willing to go in inflicting pain on others.Elvis certainly IS in the movie In the famous john Wayne was a fag scene Miller mentions I installed two way mirrors in his flat in Brentwood and he comes to the door in a dress.

So many, that when you see one that isn't quite as great as the likes of 'North by Northwest' and 'Rebecca', it almost feels like a bad film. Suspicion certainly isn't up there with Hitchcock's best work; but it isn't a bad film either. This is quite a different animal to what Hitchcock fans will be used to, as here the thrills come almost completely from the mind. The film is definitely in the 'psychological thriller' vein, and this is both a good and a bad thing. As ever, the master director does an excellent job of setting the scene for the plot, and once the plot starts; it's easy to get into the central idea. However, by the time the final credits role; Suspicion does feel just a little bit underdone. The plot is rather simple, and it follows dapper, yet irresponsible, playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (played by the great Cary Grant) and his marriage to Lina (Joan Fontaine), a young woman that he met on a train. After finding out about just how irresponsible her husband is, Lina becomes convinced that he's plotting to kill her! It is often said that Hitchcock was a misogynistic director, and as far as I can see - this film adds fuel to that fire. All of the paranoia in the film falls on Joan Fontaine's character, and by the end of the film; this fact is really rubbed in by the director. Maybe the ending isn't meant to be interpreted that way; but it's an interesting point. Alfred Hitchcock was a big admirer of Cary Grant; yet he seems to give him the short end of the stick when it comes to leading roles. North by Northwest is an undeniable masterpiece, but after that Suspicion is the second best collaboration between the two, beating the very dull To Catch a Thief and the whimsically overrated Notorious. Still, even Grant's worst efforts are worth watching for the simple reason that he stars; and this certainly isn't one of the worst films that that the actor ever made. Appearing alongside the duo of Grant and Fontaine is Nigel Bruce. I was very pleased to see Bruce in the film, as I'm a big fan of his for his work on Universal's Sherlock Holmes series. The character he plays here isn't a world away from Watson, either. On the whole, this is the Hitchcock film you see when you've seen his best work already. Suspicion isn't brilliant, but it ain't half bad either.

True, he does seem to be subverting his style slightly for the story, which is at the core a tragedy of a man falsely accused (and maybe not with the same tension we'd expect like in Strangers on a Train or Psycho). But to me it shows him really with an experimental edge that just seemed to really strike me. This is Hitchcock going for something Kafkaesque ala the Trial, and on that level the film is downright scary at times. Though Henry Fonda's Manny Balestero is told of his charge after being arrested, the whole 'procedural' nature of the film's story, of how the system can be the damnedest thing, makes it downright gripping. Like with the Master's other films, one can see the suspense at times almost sweating through the frame, and the kind of Cold-War era paranoia that works magnificently (like when Manny is at the insurance office, where the plot thickens), along with the sort of Joseph K. quality to the lead of being presumed guilty more than being presumed innocent.But there is also something very powerful, and challenging, about the casting of the lead. In a sense Hitchcock was one step ahead of Sergio Leone, who would do something similar with Once Upon a Time in the West (though Leone was going for a lot more twisting the genre screws). It's a filmmaker saying, 'look, I'm giving you Henry Fonda, maybe the most, if not one of the most, good-hearted movie stars from the 40's- Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, The Lady Eve, etc- but I'm putting him in a situation where he's in this strange scenario of not playing himself, or rather being in a society that is brutal and unflinching'.Fonda was the perfect choice considering the material, and while it is based on a true story and Fonda is terrific at his role, that Hitchcock leaves out certain details of his innocence (says the trivia on IMDb) adds a certain level to the subject matter. Maybe he is guilty and we just are too gullible to think it? How long can all this doomed atmosphere continue? On an existential level almost Hitchcock delivers a kind of very recognizable world with the terror on a different but just as engaging level as his 'popular' films.If Fonda is our fatefully unlucky protagonist, Vera Miles is equally compelling as his wife, who can't seem to take what has been going on with her husband. If there is some sense of pitch black satire amid the true-story drama of the story, she is the representation of paranoia affecting a seemingly good person.

Using real locations in NYC, the great many character actors that make up the police and everyday people (there is some very good casting in the insurance office scene), and a musical score that is decidedly vintage Herrmann, Hitchcock uses this sort of documentary realism to heighten his own subjective approach (all the images of prison bars, the film-noir type lighting and staging, the use of space in the rooms).

True, he does seem to be subverting his style slightly for the story, which is at the core a tragedy of a man falsely accused (and maybe not with the same tension we'd expect like in Strangers on a Train or Psycho). But to me it shows him really with an experimental edge that just seemed to really strike me. This is Hitchcock going for something Kafkaesque ala the Trial, and on that level the film is downright scary at times. Though Henry Fonda's Manny Balestero is told of his charge after being arrested, the whole 'procedural' nature of the film's story, of how the system can be the damnedest thing, makes it downright gripping. Like with the Master's other films, one can see the suspense at times almost sweating through the frame, and the kind of Cold-War era paranoia that works magnificently (like when Manny is at the insurance office, where the plot thickens), along with the sort of Joseph K. quality to the lead of being presumed guilty more than being presumed innocent.But there is also something very powerful, and challenging, about the casting of the lead. In a sense Hitchcock was one step ahead of Sergio Leone, who would do something similar with Once Upon a Time in the West (though Leone was going for a lot more twisting the genre screws). It's a filmmaker saying, 'look, I'm giving you Henry Fonda, maybe the most, if not one of the most, good-hearted movie stars from the 40's- Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, The Lady Eve, etc- but I'm putting him in a situation where he's in this strange scenario of not playing himself, or rather being in a society that is brutal and unflinching'.Fonda was the perfect choice considering the material, and while it is based on a true story and Fonda is terrific at his role, that Hitchcock leaves out certain details of his innocence (says the trivia on IMDb) adds a certain level to the subject matter. Maybe he is guilty and we just are too gullible to think it? How long can all this doomed atmosphere continue? On an existential level almost Hitchcock delivers a kind of very recognizable world with the terror on a different but just as engaging level as his 'popular' films.If Fonda is our fatefully unlucky protagonist, Vera Miles is equally compelling as his wife, who can't seem to take what has been going on with her husband. If there is some sense of pitch black satire amid the true-story drama of the story, she is the representation of paranoia affecting a seemingly good person.

There are more than a few hilarious scenes and sight gags, but there are also some parts that are embarrassingly bad. The film proves just how difficult it is to make a comedy that is funny for 90 whole minutes.Deuce Bigalow is played by Rob Schneider, who is in my opinion a terribly underrated actor. More often that not it's the material in his films that lets him down. He plays an unlucky loser who cleans fish tanks for a living. The only action he gets with the ladies is when he can get the girl at the local pet store to reach into a fish tank causing her shirt to become wet and her nipples to be erect. In a stroke of luck, a handsome gigolo (Fehr) named Antonio hires Bigalow to watch his apartment and his sick fish while he's away in Europe. Unfortunately, Bigalow trashes the place and has to raise a good chunk of cash to repair the damage or the psychotic Antonio will dispose of him. Bigalow has no choice but to go into the gigolo business for himself, only Antonio's regular customers expect quite a bit more than he can offer. Bigalow is forced to tend to the needs of women with problems ranging from mental disorders to physical abnormalities. Most of his dates with these women are hilarious. Deuce even falls in love with one of the young ladies along the way. The race is on to see if he can raise the amount of cash needed to make the repairs to Antonio's place before he gets back home.The film has some truly hilarious moments. Some highlights include Deuce's pimp explaining to him why he is only good enough for the women at the bottom of the tank, and pretty much any scene where he's out on a date with these problematic women is funny, too. Schneider has a real human quality about him, and he's a guy you can really root for.There are some absolutely dopey parts to this film, though. For one thing, there's a running subplot involving William Forsythe playing a paranoid police detective who keeps showing Deuce his penis. There is also an agonizing scene in which Deuce and a hooker have a Kung Fu type fight scene in Antonio's apartment. Why were these scenes left in? Well, if you look at the finished product, it's still only 88 minutes long. I guess it really is nearly impossible to sustain a truly funny film for the standard 90 minutes or so that most films last. It almost makes you wish that the bad parts of comedies could be trimmed away and maybe the audience could be treated to two short comedy films back to back. For example, take the best parts of Deuce Bigalow and then show them in a double feature with the best hour of The Animal. That's my idea, anyway.Deuce Bigalow made $65 million dollars in its theatrical run. That kind of cash guaranteed a sequel would be made, and sure enough it was. The poisonous reviews it has received have kept me away from it so far.6 of 10 stars for the original.The Hound.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"30 October 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is one of the most inconsistent comedies I've ever seen. There are more than a few hilarious scenes and sight gags, but there are also some parts that are embarrassingly bad. The film proves just how difficult it is to make a comedy that is funny for 90 whole minutes.Deuce Bigalow is played by Rob Schneider, who is in my opinion a terribly underrated actor. More often that not it's the material in his films that lets him down. He plays an unlucky loser who cleans fish tanks for a living. The only action he gets with the ladies is when he can get the girl at the local pet store to reach into a fish tank causing her shirt to become wet and her nipples to be erect. In a stroke of luck, a handsome gigolo (Fehr) named Antonio hires Bigalow to watch his apartment and his sick fish while he's away in Europe. Unfortunately, Bigalow trashes the place and has to raise a good chunk of cash to repair the damage or the psychotic Antonio will dispose of him. Bigalow has no choice but to go into the gigolo business for himself, only Antonio's regular customers expect quite a bit more than he can offer. Bigalow is forced to tend to the needs of women with problems ranging from mental disorders to physical abnormalities. Most of his dates with these women are hilarious. Deuce even falls in love with one of the young ladies along the way. The race is on to see if he can raise the amount of cash needed to make the repairs to Antonio's place before he gets back home.The film has some truly hilarious moments. Some highlights include Deuce's pimp explaining to him why he is only good enough for the women at the bottom of the tank, and pretty much any scene where he's out on a date with these problematic women is funny, too. Schneider has a real human quality about him, and he's a guy you can really root for.There are some absolutely dopey parts to this film, though. For one thing, there's a running subplot involving William Forsythe playing a paranoid police detective who keeps showing Deuce his penis. There is also an agonizing scene in which Deuce and a hooker have a Kung Fu type fight scene in Antonio's apartment. Why were these scenes left in? Well, if you look at the finished product, it's still only 88 minutes long. I guess it really is nearly impossible to sustain a truly funny film for the standard 90 minutes or so that most films last. It almost makes you wish that the bad parts of comedies could be trimmed away and maybe the audience could be treated to two short comedy films back to back. For example, take the best parts of Deuce Bigalow and then show them in a double feature with the best hour of The Animal. That's my idea, anyway.Deuce Bigalow made $65 million dollars in its theatrical run. That kind of cash guaranteed a sequel would be made, and sure enough it was. The poisonous reviews it has received have kept me away from it so far.6 of 10 stars for the original.The Hound.

Let's face it, there was enough characters and ideas in this franchise to do a sequel, or six sequels as the case turned out to be. Nonetheless it made sense after showing all the cadets make it to graduation that we would get to see them on the job.Thus continues Police Academy Their First Assignment. Most of the original cast returns...Steve Guttenberg as Carey Mahoney, Bubba Smith, David Graf, Michael Winslow, Bruce Mahler, Marion Ramsey, and even George Gaynes in a more cameo type role as Cmdt. Eric Lassard. Guttenberg's Mahoney seems toned down in this sequel which is unfortunate. He doesn't show a lot of the smart-ass, prank playing personality that made the original so great. Everyone else plays their roles similar to that of the original so the jokes when it comes to the characters haven't changed a lot...just perhaps more of them. Michael Winslow as the noise making Larvell Jones is used far more in this one than in the original. Also at the forefront is Eugene Tackleberry who is a great character and he's a lot of fun and a great hero to watch. Sadly the film is noticeably missing G.W. Bailey, who plays Mahoney's perfect adversary Lt. Thaddeus Harris. He's replaced by Art Metrano who plays Lt. Hauser, the wanna-be Captain who will stop at nothing to see the force fail so that he can take over. He's good and it's fun to watch him get pranked by Mahoney but he doesn't have the seriousness\/comedic timing that G.W. Bailey had as Harris. The late Jerry Paris takes over on the directing helm and seems to keep the Police Academy recipe in full force. As mostly a TV Director but a seasoned actor Paris should know all about comedy. Also to keep things fresh that added some new faces to the cast. Bob 'Bobcat' Goldthwait stars as the leader of the gang that is ruining the neighborhood that the Academy cadets are trying to clean up. Granted the first few moments of Goldthwait played Zed or playing himself are funny. The voice and the nervous little tics are humorous but then they just aren't funny anymore. And he's far from believable as the leader of any gang. Tim Kazurinsky plays Sweetchuck, the innocent, scared little store owner being harassed by Zed and his goons. And Howard Hesseman as Captain Lassard, little brother of Eric Lassard. Hesseman is good as their leader but the story isn't strong enough so everyone kinda falters because of it.Just like the first, Police Academy 2 is STUPID!! But that is exactly what Police Academy is and meant to be. It doesn't try to be anything but. All the characters are funny and have their own little quirks and it's a revisiting that was to be expected and done in an okay style. It's still even not as good as the original, but it is a sequel. The plot and story isn't quite as interesting as the original. Everything else is practically the same, and more of it!! There are still several silly little spots that you'll find yourself laughing out loud about. It's slapstick and still low budget and just fun.

His slightest move has been anticipated and planned for.Back to these more or less random comments. The score is by Paul Giovanni and will knock your socks off. (There's a lot of music in the film.) There is nothing in the way of an underscore. No incidental music to speak of, except a curious pwong sound at moments of particular drama, like the discovery of a March hare in a coffin or a sunset during a sacrifice.The first song we hear is shortly after Neil Howie, the police officer, enters the village, which, by John Barleycorn, I recognized immediately as Plockton, though I haven't been there for 30 years! Okay, so Howie walks into the local pub for the first time and is greeted by friendly and happy villagers of various ages. Howie is an uptight Presbyterian and, refusing a whiskey, asks to be taken to his room by Willow (Britt Ekland), the daughter of the pub's manager. The assembled musicians then begin to play a folksy tune and the patrons sing along. And it is at that particular point in the film -- maybe 10 minutes into it -- that we realize that something is seriously awry. The song is The Landlord's Daughter and the lyrics are a little beyond bawdy and only a little short of obscene. Howie stares aghast as the some of the patrons begin to swing and dance to the rhythm. Willow bumps her rump against a couple of hairy men and laughing bends over while submitting to a kind of consensual frottage. This is really weird as hell -- trust me.Ekland shows Howie his room upstairs and while he lies in bed, he hears her close the door to the room next to his. Then the band downstairs commences a slowly bouncing beat until a fiddle begins to play. We expect the fiddle to bring in the tune -- but no. The fiddler repeats the same note but only in something like 16th notes. (I don't want to get in over my head here.) Upstairs a naked Willow thumps her palm softly in time with the rhythm on the wall between her and the sweating police officer. She begins to dance, writhing lewdly, and sings a strange song with erotic lyrics -- Come to me and say 'How do?'\/ Things I will give to you\/ A touch as light as feather. I'm going to run out of space and I've hardly touched on the things that make this movie so remarkable. I can't very well NOT mention the excruciating climax of the film. (The last print I saw was lacking a few scenes, including one last entirely bleak one.) The thing has a hallucinatory quality. Odd things happen at odd times. Not only that, but they seem to tap into one's collective unconscious. It's as if all of the most primitive beliefs and rituals, the most staggering of human experiences, have come flooding out of some place you never knew existed in your brain. Half-coherent fairy tales, songs, and games, and dances from our individual childhoods and our joint pagan past parade around the edges of our perception. It is as spooky as all get out, and there is hardly any violence and not a drop of blood.Whew, what an experience.This is your comment, you may delete ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"30 October 2005","score":"29 out of 54 people found the following review useful","review":" It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film .

One problem is that John Boorman, director, co-writer, and overall driving force behind the project, tries to cram the entire legend of King Arthur into 140 minutes, and as a result is unable to sustain much narrative momentum and often seems to be rushing through the story. Excalibur is often cheesy, with bad dialogue (I, the best knight in the world, bested!), and overacting, particularly in the opening scenes, where the knights can't seem to utter a word without growling. The production design, while evocative in some scenes, in others reveals Boorman's stretching of a less than generous budget, such as in the cut-rate set of Merlin's crystal cave. And despite the scope of the film, the number of participants in a battle rarely suggest more than a small-scale skirmish. For all of these flaws, I don't hate Excalibur. Some of the cheesy acting and dialogue is unintentionally funny, though the rustic accent used by Nigel Terry to play Arthur in his younger years is truly irritating. Luckily, by the end his performance has greatly improved, gradually taking on the kind of quiet, uncomplicated dignity that I always imagine Arthur as possessing. The actor who plays Percival also turns in an effective performance in the potentially embarrassing role of the holy fool. The best performance by far, however, is by Nicol Williamson as Merlin. He probably overacts more than anyone else in the movie, but in his case it's obviously intentional. Boorman's choices for Guinever and Lancelot are least impressive, with Guinevere coming across as little more than a pretty Irish peasant girl, and Lancelot as a bland hunk. Their affair is one of the film's weakest elements, a casualty of Boorman's determination to fit the entire Arthurian corpus into a single movie. This is how he establishes the beginning of their illicit feelings for each other; Guinevere runs into Lancelot, he gazes soulfully into her eyes, she gazes soulfully back, and the opening theme from Tristan and Isolde blares onto the soundtrack. This problem extends to Boorman's use of musical themes in general; his choices are unoriginal but effective, but they're also too few, and are consequently are used too many times with too little variation. On the plus side, Excalibur is visually spectacular, and Boorman crafts plenty of plenty of memorable scenes, such as Merlin's hilltop, torch-lit exhortation to the knights following a battle (cribbed liberally from Henry V). Boorman also handles Arthur's conception with plenty of audacity and stylistic panache. Arthur's father Uther, transformed by Merlin into the shape of the Duke of Cornwall, has sex with the man's wife while the real Duke lies dying in battle against the King's troops. As if this wasn't weird enough, throughout the entire sex scene Uther wears full armor (or nearly full armor, I guess), and all of this is juxtaposed with Cornwall dying, bloodily impaled on a spear. In contrast to the baroque insanity of the opening scenes, Boorman creates a touching and reverent conclusion for the story, capped off by the indelible image of Arthur, revived from a sort of spiritual coma, riding out to battle with his men through a shower of flower petals.

ERIN BROCKOVICH tells the story of -- who else -- Erin Brockovich, a single woman who has somehow lost her way and been under hard times. Urgently needing work to pay her bills as she is close to bankrupt she hustles her way into Masry's office and gets a job as a file clerk (much to his and the entire office's resistance due to her over-the-top personality) where she uncovers some papers from Pacific Gas and Electric mixed with other real estate papers which don't add up. Taking matters to her own hands she decides to investigate further and finds that PG and E had been buying people out of their homes and paying for their medical bills because they were covering up the contamination from hexavalent chromium in the community water to which she enlists Masry to bring forth one of the biggest lawsuits in California history.Where most legal thrillers, in order to succeed, litter their stories with a slew of shady figures and double-crosses and plot twists, ERIN BROCKOVICH succeeds in sticking (like its heroine) to its little train that could story from start to finish. While this curbs some of the suspense, it heightens its social aspect because we identify with the little man. We want this woman who has had a hard life to get her case across, and we also want these innocent people who are victims of the big corporation to get their compensation. It's like a much anticipated fight between Rocky and his adversary but without the sentimentalism it's not so much will he win, but what will he do to win. This is the kind of film in which we already know at a gut level what will happen, but what we focus on is the battle itself.ERIN BROCKOVICH also succeeds in its performances, and with that I don't only mean Julia Roberts who with this role has found her inner actress. There is a scene in which Brockovich reveals to Donna Jensen (played by CSI's Marg Helgenberger) that PG and E have not been on her side, going so far as to pay for her medical bills to cover the fact that they have contaminated the water -- water that her kids are playing in -- her quiet horror is registered on her face. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end -- he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. Veanne Cox is funny in a buttoned-up way as the lawyer who confronts Erin Brockovich, not knowing who she is coming up against. If anything, Aaron Eckhart is the only actor whose role seems a little like filler, or maybe the story didn't know what to do with him once he had effectively seduced Brockovich, but he has some good scenes near the beginning.Then there is Julia Roberts in a role that should have gone to a more experienced actress -- someone like Felicity Huffmann who actually resembles the real Brockovich but was not a box-office draw. Roberts fully embodies her character and is given line after sharp line to the point that almost every scene ends with a savage quip from her mouth complete with reaction shot. There are even times when her ferocious grip on her character threatens to go into scenery-chewing. However, Soderbergh brings out a complete acting range from Roberts as Brockovich the person as opposed to cartoon, and with this, Roberts can claim this as her breakthrough role which finally separates her from her trademark persona. This was the role in which she got the Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ellen Burstyn for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Stephen Soderbergh would also win, but for a different film altogether TRAFFIC, a film which would also grant acting nominations on its own.

While this curbs some of the suspense, it heightens its social aspect because we identify with the little man. We want this woman who has had a hard life to get her case across, and we also want these innocent people who are victims of the big corporation to get their compensation. It's like a much anticipated fight between Rocky and his adversary but without the sentimentalism it's not so much will he win, but what will he do to win. This is the kind of film in which we already know at a gut level what will happen, but what we focus on is the battle itself.ERIN BROCKOVICH also succeeds in its performances, and with that I don't only mean Julia Roberts who with this role has found her inner actress. There is a scene in which Brockovich reveals to Donna Jensen (played by CSI's Marg Helgenberger) that PG and E have not been on her side, going so far as to pay for her medical bills to cover the fact that they have contaminated the water -- water that her kids are playing in -- her quiet horror is registered on her face. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end -- he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. Veanne Cox is funny in a buttoned-up way as the lawyer who confronts Erin Brockovich, not knowing who she is coming up against. If anything, Aaron Eckhart is the only actor whose role seems a little like filler, or maybe the story didn't know what to do with him once he had effectively seduced Brockovich, but he has some good scenes near the beginning.Then there is Julia Roberts in a role that should have gone to a more experienced actress -- someone like Felicity Huffmann who actually resembles the real Brockovich but was not a box-office draw. Roberts fully embodies her character and is given line after sharp line to the point that almost every scene ends with a savage quip from her mouth complete with reaction shot. There are even times when her ferocious grip on her character threatens to go into scenery-chewing. However, Soderbergh brings out a complete acting range from Roberts as Brockovich the person as opposed to cartoon, and with this, Roberts can claim this as her breakthrough role which finally separates her from her trademark persona. This was the role in which she got the Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ellen Burstyn for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Stephen Soderbergh would also win, but for a different film altogether TRAFFIC, a film which would also grant acting nominations on its own.

Well we don't have to ask that question with this movie, because it's not bad enough to be bad or good, and it's really not good. Thus we conclude it's a mediocre attempt at being so bad it's good.Our hero the brazen braggart Ash goes back in time, where he is the Chosen One who will defeat the Army of Darkness...provided he can remember a few simple syllables. That's really it as far as the plot goes, along with the whole deal with Evil Ash the doppelganger leading the Army of Darkness. For some reason, it sounds better on paper, and it really shouldn't have.That said, this movie still has it's tongue-in-cheek charm. Ash's lines are made-for cult favorites, and the action is wonderfully banal. One of the strongest parts of the movie has to do with its pacing, how development is discarded to just get the action moving from scene to scene. For instance, the wise man continuing nonchalantly with his speech after Ash dispatches of a Deadite that interrupts them.It is quite definitely a fun, good time not meant to be taken seriously, more fun especially with friends and a good crowd.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"30 October 2005","score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Some movies are good, some are bad.

This is a buy your popcorn, sit your behind down, and prepare for a mind-numbing assault on your senses that will have you screaming like a primitive caveman during the final battle sequence type of movie. This is Independence Day. Sure, you have to suspend reality quite a bit, when you consider things like 1) A Marine fighter pilot dating a stripper and the two of them living a normal suburban life with her son in Orange County. 2) The President of the United States and a strung-out drunk climbing into F\/A-18s to blow the aliens away. 3) A mid-90s Macintosh PowerBook logging into a sophisticated alien network that probably has better than 2,048 bit encryption. But watching that ragtag wing of F\/A-18 Hornets and F-16 Fighting Falcons blow the hell out of the alien battleship over Nevada at the end of the movie is worth every hole in the plot. Watching Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum light up cigars as they blow the mothership away is worth every moment of stiff acting (although we could've done without Goldblum's reprise of the Must go faster, must go faster line from Jurassic Park). So there you go. If you're a movie snob, this one isn't for you.
