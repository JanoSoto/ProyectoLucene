This is a really bad choice the magic of this new advance is quickly smothered.Then, of course, we get to the acting. The only bright spots were Ewan McGregor and Frank Oz (Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, respectively). Hayden Christensen played Anakin as some spoiled brat, constantly complaining about everything.

The biggest letdown was, sadly, Natalie Portman. She was fantastic in The Phantom Menace, but thanks to Lucas' terrible script, couldn't do much here. This might explain why her performance was really half-hearted. Although appealing to the eyes, she displays little of the rich acting talent she has.We get down to the annoying characters at last. First, Jar Jar Binks. Lucas diminished his role immensely here, after all the complaints in The Phantom Menace. But his role is so minor, he shouldn't have been included at all!

R2-D2 and C3PO are back to their annoying ways, especially C3PO, whose misadventures were so idiotic, I wanted to bash him on the head.So, in conclusion, this film does only one thing prove that advanced special effects will do nothing to save a movie that's already as bad as this.

In the original Star Wars, the first 25 minutes is boring. The same argument does not (indeed, can not) apply to The Empire Strikes Back. It starts on an exciting note, and the excitement never slows down. What's wrong then? The beginning is just too confusing! A while passed between the two films, and Luke's voice sounds somewhat different. So for about the first 10 minutes of the movie, (where no faces are shown, and only Han Solo's name was mentioned) I was wondering Is it really him? Or was it someone else? Omitting that confusing first 10 minutes, this movie was, to be perfectly honest, amazing. The acting really improved, I think, from the original. I positively loved Billy Dee Williams (who should've played Two-Face in Batman III) in this movie. James Earl Jones, who delivered a fantastic performance in the original, was even better here. (Darth Vader's sardonic line Apology accepted was just amazingly delivered!) He was even scarier, I'd say. Harrison Ford's character was a little more developed, as was Carrie Fisher's. Mark Hamill did a great job, too.Of course, now we get to the list of annoying characters. C3PO really began to bug me in this movie, which he didn't do as much in the original Star Wars. I still found Chewbacca to be really irritating most of the time. R2D2's inability to communicate in anything other than beeps and whirs (that had to be interpreted by C3PO) got on my nerves really often. And, of course, before Yoda revealed who he was (although everyone knows by now how he looks like), he was the most annoying of the lot.What I loved about this movie was John Williams' music. He certainly went against my expectations. Instead of composing a sci-fi sounding score, with futuristic sounding instruments, he composed one traditionally. And it was far more effective than any sci-fi music could've been! The plot is a lot more exciting, dangerous, and, I'd say, refined, than the original. It never slows down&#151; it's a wild ride.

Old stuff in a movie lacks any new ones !).I've got more points that force me to explode  (Kenneth Branagh)'s charisma got something wrong, being uninteresting or weak or both !

And (Embeth Davidtz) is no sexy, charming nor beautiful in the first place to seduce anyone, you'll have every single man in the movie fascinating about her legs which are pathetic to begin with (ideally ugly is the word !).I can't say that there were plot holes, but there was intentional dealing with us as assholes !

To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes watchable. It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.What's wrong with the first 25 minutes? It's just plain boring. Perhaps the biggest error is having the majority of the first 15 minutes spoken in an incomprehensible alien language. It is just so flat, that the appearance of Luke Skywalker does almost nothing to balance it out. But as soon as the plot picks up, it doesn't slow down.I also hate George Lucas' direction. His eternally wooden camera does little other than panning throughout this movie, and in fact, his career.James Earl Jones delivers an amazing performance as Darth Vader (O.K., I know he does only his voice, but still, that guy's voice is AMAZING!). Vader is the perfect choice for a movie villain that mask is creepier than any deformed or disfigured face could be always expressionless, constantly breathing heavily&#x85; He's just plain, old-fashioned scary!

The trailer made it look like a good, fun movie to watch, when it is, in reality, nothing short of terrible. I'm going to go against my own rules in this review, and mercilessly spoil the movie, because, to be perfectly honest, you'll only waste your time watching it.Hearing that neither Steven Spielberg nor John Williams were returning, an alarm went off in my head. This alarm, however, was quickly stifled when I learned Sam Neill and Laura Dern were reprising their roles as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. I should've known better.The plot is flimsy, constructed around one or two memorable scenes from Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park that had to be omitted from the original movie (due to budget or time constraint, etc.). All the same, these scenes are (pitifully) the movie's only highlights (but rather poor ones at that). Also, the movie is littered with inaccuracies and plot holes. In the original JP, dinosaur embryos had to be kept at a low temperature (-10°C, according to Crichton's book). JP2 took place four years later; JP3 takes place four years after JP2. So how is it that the dinosaur embryos were perfectly preserved (emphasized in a sweeping shot that is an altogether too-obvious set-up for a Velociraptor attack) despite being stored at far over -10°C for eight years? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.The highlights of the first two movies were the dinosaurs. But all of a sudden, I couldn't care less about the advanced special effects. It doesn't matter how much damage a Spinosaurus can do; if it looks as ridiculously fake as it does here (they went overboard with the special effects), I'm not interested. In addition, the Velociraptor looks like some completely new dinosaur, changing drastically (in just four years? Evolution moves fast!) from its look in the previous two films.I addressed a flimsy plot before. Let me point out that the great big, even more dangerous challenge that faces the heroes in JPIII is&#133; wow. The Velociraptors can communicate. Let me take out my watch paint dry kit.Whereas the first two films were ingeniously crafted thrillers, JPIII is obviously crafted for quick profits resulting from the franchise's popularity. Apparently, Joe Johnston wanted to do JP2! I'm glad he didn't I hate his direction style. Scenes that are supposed to thrill or scare are so boring and dumb. As soon as the characters enter a facility where embryos were once kept, I knew they were going to be attacked by a Velociraptor. That's how bad this is.It amuses me to read Roger Ebert's review for the original Jurassic Park, and apply arguments that were inaccurate from his review to JPIII. The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters, he said about Jurassic Park. Nonsense, I say! Mr. Ebert merely had a vision of what Jurassic Park III was going to be like! Because, really, what do we learn about the characters by the end of JPIII? The mercenaries all died right away, and all we learned was that one of them filled in for someone who got sick. (How lame!) We learn that some young kid managed to survive on the island for EIGHT WEEKS when the adult who was with him didn't even get the chance to get down from his parachute before dying. And how did he survive? He hid&#133; in an abandoned truck&#133; With two gas grenades he never used&#133; And he was safe in the back of it, too, despite the fact that the Velociraptors now know how to open doors&#133; His parents were going through a divorce, but got together because of his disappearance. Yay. We learn mom is a bad driver and dad has a hardware store (who, by the way, can somehow afford to buy four cars in three years; one was an SUV and another was a Buick). And yeah, the main thing they all do is screaming. (If anyone wants, I can still find that paint!) The only word of praise I have is for Sam Neill, who flawlessly reprised his role as Alan Grant. But he couldn't save this movie.Finally, the stupidest move the makers of JPIII did was replacing the T-Rex. We see it in ONE scene, where it is killed by the Spinosaurus. And then it's gone! Apparently, a dinosaur that was non-existent four years ago has magically become king of the dinosaurs. (Another plot hole!) The T-Rex always was and will be the star of Jurassic Park&#151; some lame, swimming dinosaur (who apparently swam far enough from the island to kill the crew of a boat that was rather far from shore&#133; LAME!) with a sail on its back will never replace Mr. T-Rex.

I was not disappointed.Have I mentioned how much I love Steven Spielberg? Well, I will now. Spielberg is an amazing director, without a doubt my favourite. He has yet to let me down. First of all, the graphics in Jurassic Park are amazingly believable, even though it's obviously fake watching it today. Second, Spielberg's direction style is just amazing. Many shots were reinforced and made really powerful thanks to his handling of the camera (combined with a heavenly score from the great John Williams).Prior to Jurassic Park, I couldn't remember many thrillers where I was genuinely thrilled. Things don't explode to provide a moment's excitement in Jurassic Park, it is a pure roller-coaster of thrills from beginning to end. I also genuinely cared for what happened to the characters.

Apparently Coppola himself was not very happy with the last minute changes he had to make when Paramount refused Duvall's salary demands. The storyline as is moved quite slowly in parts. This was especially so with the scenes involving Michael's re-courting of Kay. Both Pacino and Keaton are amazing actors; but they suffered with rather trite dialogue and a difficult circumstance to make believable. It seemed like filler dialogue to me.

I can't believe that there were not a large number of very good actresses out there known and unknown that could have pulled the part off. Sofia as we know is not without talent. She has become quite an amazing filmmaker herself.

Instead you get a film where the hero kills without question, showing only a hint of remorse once through its entirety. Add to that the most anti-climactic ending in existence and you've got a real Wha? film. OK, so it's not what I was expecting. Well, the whole style of the movie - the music, the setting, the characters - everything oozes film noir. If you expect that, I guess you won't be too disappointed. But do you get sixty minutes of atmospheric shots spliced in between twenty five minutes of conversation that seems to leading up to something (but surprise! never does) and five minutes of two confusing fight scenes. I'll give Blade Runner credit, though the setting is visionary, convincing and appropriately claustrophobic. I had no problem getting absorbed into the retro sci-fi setting, but maybe that's just me. The acting is just good as well, but Harrison Ford's narration is dry and robotic for some reason. Seems out of place in a film where he acts perfectly fine everywhere else.

Is Ford trying to rape the female replicant? It's really hard to understand what's going on there. He gets hot over her, tries to make a move, she tries to escape, he stops her and makes her say she wants it. And at the end of the movie they ride off in the sunset like lovers.

Vanya on 42nd Street is something of a revelation in translating theater to film, or rather theater AS cinema, or vise-versa. As an audience watching an adaptation of a play we're often used to seeing a play taken from its roots on the stage to film, its realistic recreation presented live to an audience as an event where the spontaneity of life occurs from moment to moment without a break, fleshed out by way of the devices of the cinematic language (lighting, different focal points and shots, editing, music cues).In the case of Vanya on 42nd Street we're watching a play take shape- at first slightly awkwardly, since I had never read or seen the play performed I wasn't even quite sure when the characters were starting to talk in the Chekhov language out of their own actors-playing characters voices- and we should be drawn in like a usual theater crowd. And we are, or at least I was, thanks to the very powerful and moving performances and the inherent wonders to be found in Chekhov's text. But Louis Malle plays around a little bit, or rather more than just a little bit. Because of the placement of the camera in certain scenes, and as it is a play rehearsed in a decrepit theater on 42nd street, we see an actor here and there in the background watching as a scene which is supposed to be taking place with just two of the characters in play, and something like this small touch creates something else to the process. The process of doing this play, even as a rehearsal, is kind of in the background of how the movie works as a *movie*, not as theater.If this sounds a little complicated a dissection, it should be noted that Malle, a man who made many films and had this as his final film before he was taken away so suddenly, knows the essential thing is important put on a great production of a play. And it works, fully we're sucked into this story of a family in Russia torn apart by their love, or disconnect from it, mistrust, loneliness, bitterness, despair, and moments that ponder the very reason why we even go on living when things look to be the worst (the final speech given by Vanya's daughter played by Brooke Smith, should be considered a mini-masterpiece of the written word with it starting with All we can do is live.). It's about wasted lives, or chances that have gone by for some, like Wallace Shawn's title character, for over half of a lifetime.So Chekhov fans, of whom there are quite a few in the theater world, won't be disappointed in the least by the presentation. It's a best-of-both-worlds piece of art; we get the wonderful essentials of what it all comes down to in the world of theater as actors (such as Julianne Moore and Shawn and Smith who are all fantastic, sometimes nearing genius), totally in tune and prepared with this heavy work of intelligently gut-ripping familial drama, are revealed though Malle's careful and sometimes very subtle documentary approach. It's a double edged sword we're watching a play, yes, but there's something else about watching theater as process, as something that evolves along, that is captured as well, which is something rare (maybe one other film, Bergman's minor but great work, After the Rehearsal, has this quality).But at the same time, Louis Malle is directing a film that is fictional, and we are forced to still see things a certain way, to see real film lights hitting on what is supposed to be a realistic setting, and editing directing our eyes where to go in a big confrontation and with actors and their eyelines and the 180 degree rule and so on. There's even a very tricky moment I wasn't sure at first that I liked in the second half there's a moment where Moore's character is thinking something to herself, about getting angry, about saying something she feels to Vanya or someone (i.e. the mermaid bit). Up until now we've seen these actors relatively in naturalistic conditions in terms of their own audience- the actors' dress rehearsal is being seen by a few guests- but this suddenly takes into consideration narration, and we're reminded it is all really a film.I'm still not sure if this completely fits, but it's such a bold moment that I respect it all the same. Vanya on 42nd Street is an immensely stimulating experience both as pure drama and as an intellectual rendering of what theater and film represents as art forms.

The process of doing this play, even as a rehearsal, is kind of in the background of how the movie works as a *movie*, not as theater.If this sounds a little complicated a dissection, it should be noted that Malle, a man who made many films and had this as his final film before he was taken away so suddenly, knows the essential thing is important put on a great production of a play. And it works, fully we're sucked into this story of a family in Russia torn apart by their love, or disconnect from it, mistrust, loneliness, bitterness, despair, and moments that ponder the very reason why we even go on living when things look to be the worst (the final speech given by Vanya's daughter played by Brooke Smith, should be considered a mini-masterpiece of the written word with it starting with All we can do is live.). It's about wasted lives, or chances that have gone by for some, like Wallace Shawn's title character, for over half of a lifetime.So Chekhov fans, of whom there are quite a few in the theater world, won't be disappointed in the least by the presentation. It's a best-of-both-worlds piece of art; we get the wonderful essentials of what it all comes down to in the world of theater as actors (such as Julianne Moore and Shawn and Smith who are all fantastic, sometimes nearing genius), totally in tune and prepared with this heavy work of intelligently gut-ripping familial drama, are revealed though Malle's careful and sometimes very subtle documentary approach. It's a double edged sword we're watching a play, yes, but there's something else about watching theater as process, as something that evolves along, that is captured as well, which is something rare (maybe one other film, Bergman's minor but great work, After the Rehearsal, has this quality).But at the same time, Louis Malle is directing a film that is fictional, and we are forced to still see things a certain way, to see real film lights hitting on what is supposed to be a realistic setting, and editing directing our eyes where to go in a big confrontation and with actors and their eyelines and the 180 degree rule and so on. There's even a very tricky moment I wasn't sure at first that I liked in the second half there's a moment where Moore's character is thinking something to herself, about getting angry, about saying something she feels to Vanya or someone (i.e. the mermaid bit). Up until now we've seen these actors relatively in naturalistic conditions in terms of their own audience- the actors' dress rehearsal is being seen by a few guests- but this suddenly takes into consideration narration, and we're reminded it is all really a film.I'm still not sure if this completely fits, but it's such a bold moment that I respect it all the same. Vanya on 42nd Street is an immensely stimulating experience both as pure drama and as an intellectual rendering of what theater and film represents as art forms. And as a final feature from a director like Malle is a very fine achievement; I'm tempted to say that, even imperfect as it is, it's sort of timeless in its approach to a 19th century Russian play. 9.5\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"12 March 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" From the beginning of this film to the end Jeanne is constantly displaced. The first scene has her returning to her own apartment after a long absence to find the cousin she was allowing to borrow the place is still there in spite of her agreement to leave a day or two previously. Although she desperately wants to return to the order of her own place she pretends that she was just stopping by to pick something up on her way back to the place she shares with her out of town boyfriend. However, she does not feel comfortable returning to this disordered place so to avoid it as long as possible she goes to the party of a former acquaintance. Here she meets Natasha and the plot gets started.Natasha lives alone in a big apartment and she invites Jeanne to stay with her a few days. Jeanne mostly feels out of place here as well but her two day stay stretches into something like ten before she is finally able to return home. During this time she grows increasingly agitated which causes her to act distrustful and paranoid. Unfortunately, her new friend Natasha is acting much the same way toward her father's current love interest and the combination of a negative atmosphere and her own paranoia put her in a rather unpleasant situation.In spite of the general tension of the plot, A Tale of Springtime ends on a very upbeat note that suggests most of the distrust the characters felt toward one another was unfounded. Indeed, the blossoming of new relationships and the general happiness of the characters make Spring a fitting setting for the film. Still, I couldn't help but feel that this wasn't one of Rohmer's strongest efforts sure, the characters were just as natural as ever and the dialog was even more chock full of interesting ideas than usual but the cinematography wasn't all that special.
