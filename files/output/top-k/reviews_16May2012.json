Director Robert Altman's Popeye is one of those films that should be given credit. For being a film that was released before CGI was a prominent special effect, it does a spectacular job at making all the characters look as accurate as possible. And that's just one of the aspects of this film that makes it stand out from the rest.Robin Williams stars as the one-eyed sailor and I got to admit, it was a smart choice casting him. Williams' acting is brilliant. All the mannerisms, speech impediments, and wisecracks are all like what Popeye would probably say and they're funny to hear. Not to mention the costume he wears is great looking too. I'm curious to how they got him to have such large arms. Playing Olive Oyl is actress Shelley Duvall. Her acting is also very accurate because of how physically lanky her body structure is. Her clumsiness adds to the humor as well. My favorite character in this film was Poopdeck Pappy acted by Ray Walston. Walston has some really comical lines and it's even funnier whenever he's laughing or ranting. I'm not going to list all the actors because the cast goes on and on but to summarize, Altman picked the perfect set of individuals to portray every character in this movie. Supposedly, Altman hired many actors from a circus to participate. This make sense because throughout the film, the viewer will notice many of these actors are quite flexible. This is a good thing to have when it comes to creating a live action cartoon movie. The area I wasn't expecting in Robert Altman's version of Popeye was the music. Discovering that the actors also have their own solos was an interesting add-on. At first, it may seem like the singing parts weren't necessary but it turns out that having the cast break out into song gives the story a little bit more liveliness to it. So in retrospect, this film doesn't have a musical score because it is a musical. The songs aren't bad so there's nothing to really dislike about it. My favorite was the Everything is food song. Throughout that entire song, there were a lot of funny parts.Going back to special effects, there is absolutely no CGI in this film. Everything is formed one way another that uses anything in the physical world. This is what makes this film so good because everything is real and on screen for the actors to touch. When Popeye and Bluto fight, the way they fight is all made to look like no matter what happens, they are still on screen. Also any objects that any characters touch can fall apart or break off which adds to the comedy of the film.Comedy is the other great element to this film. Even though much of it is over the top gags, a lot of it is still funny. What was most enjoyable was how the actors coordinated the gags. For example, Popeye finds his pipe on the ground and above him a group of men carrying a piano on a ledge. The group loses grip of the piano and it sways right over Popeye's head just as he bends down to grab his pipe. If that's not well planned timing, then I don't know what is!For 1980, the cartoon live action version of Popeye is done with utmost preciseness in its characters and comical elements. This is also probably the only cartoon adaptation that is a musical too, which makes it that much more culturally deviant.

I even like the music score by Howard Shore which also fits with the movie.But most importantly I like how the real life characters were portrayed and performed. Ed Wood is my favorite role from one of my favorite actors Johnny Depp. Johnny really captured his spirit at least before the time things for Ed went down south. But what I really like about Ed is that you are on his side from beginning to end because you can easily emphasize. The guy was an underdog he was really down on his luck and constantly struggling to make his dreams come true. Most of the people that try to bring him down or discourage him are all rational people, and you don't like them because their total blow holes; I remember always thinking Cmon just let him do his own thing. And that was a good feeling, a feeling I don't get much for character real or unreal.Yes, it true that Ed is a hack and a flaw person, from writing scripts that have some really bad dialog down to being delusional and eccentric, but he was actually honest about it you actually see him putting it out there, like in one scene he wears a dress while directing a scene for Plan 9 as a way to feel good, in a way it sort of reminds me of the common idocricies we would do to help ourselves think or feel something like I've seen some girls in my collage classes that would draw or write some things on the sides before taking notes, not kidding.And he saw let alone worked on his films and there were lots of mistakes from bad production quality, bad context, acting, and other things. But it never discouraged him, he had a vision and was relentlessly determined to keep on building it and after it was done in his eyes the final product was perfect even though reality said something else.But of course it was also Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lagosi that also carried out the film, this is my favorite role from that actor because you really believe your seeing and hearing Bela. Seeing the twilight times of this actor I'll admit is really sad and made me wonder about a lot of others actors and actresses out there whom are now out of the limelight. You really felt for the guy from beginning to end, from his desire to continue acting which is one think I admired despite how old he is he could still do it let alone acting is what made sense to his life. Down to the time in the film he passed away which made me shed tears, I know this was something that happen long ago but they way they build it up gripped at emotions.The real life supporting characters are great, my favorite one is Bunny Beckaridge by one of my favorite comedian actors Bill Murray, what he says at the Babtism always cracked me up.I really like the humor in the film, it's true this film is a biopic drama but it's not oh so serious which I feel is a tone that fits perfectly and makes the characters feel more human. My favorite humorous moment is when Ed and the gang go to the movie premiere of Bride of the Monster and everyone is booing, throwing popcorn, it's crazy though the strangest thing about that scene is their doing this when the movie is just starting.

I have never seen Ishtar or Family Business- in the case of the former I have been dissuaded by its reputation as one of the great turkeys of all time- but his other three films from the decade, Tootsie, Death of a Salesman and Rain Man, although very different from one another, are all among his best.Here Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a New York actor who is finding it difficult to obtain work. Not through any lack of talent, but because he is so difficult to work with. He is the sort of perfectionist whose obsessive attention to detail and inability to suffer fools gladly make him the bane of every director's life and the despair of his long-suffering agent George. Michael decides that desperate measures are needed. He decides to audition for a part in the popular, hospital-set soap opera Southwest General, and does not allow himself to be deterred by the fact that the audition is for a female role. He disguises himself as a woman, renames himself Dorothy Michaels and wins the part. The film explores the complications which arise, especially after Michael finds himself strongly attracted to his pretty co-star Julie Nichols. How can he declare his love to Julie without exposing his deception? To make matters worse, Julie's widowed father Les is equally attracted to the supposed Dorothy.There are obvious similarities between Tootsie and that other great American cross-dressing comedy from around a decade later, Mrs Doubtfire. In that film too the main character, played by Robin Williams, is also a talented but temperamental out-of-work actor, although his motives for dressing as a woman are different. There are, however, also important differences between the two films (quite apart from the fact that Hoffman makes a more convincing woman than does Williams).Tootsie is, like Nine to Five from two years earlier, a comedy with feminist overtones which satirises male sexism in the workplace. Julie is in a relationship with the show's director Ron, who treats her badly both on and off the set, and both she and Dorothy have to cope with the unwanted attentions of the show's ageing star John Van Horn who despite his advancing years still fancies himself as a ladies' man. The satire in Mrs Doubtfire, by contrast, is not so much feminist as masculinist, criticising the way in which the American divorce system discriminates against fathers and the distress that such discrimination can cause to the children of broken marriages. The other targets of the film's satire include soap operas; there must be plenty of real-life examples which share the low production values and abysmal acting standards of Southwest General. (One infamously bad example that comes to mind is the British-made Crossroads). Even Michael himself is sent up; he might be the film's hero and, strictly speaking, in the right in most of his confrontations, but his short fuse and his dogmatic, self-righteous manner make us realise just why everyone else finds it so difficult to work with him.The main reason for the film's success is Hoffman's brilliant performance in what is essentially the double role of Michael and Dorothy. Although Michael becomes quite unrecognisable, both in voice and appearance, when he assumes his feminine persona, Dorothy is similar in personality to her male alter ego, being just as feisty and bloody-minded as he is. The difference is that she can get away with it, and is even applauded for being a strong, determined woman, whereas he is just dismissed as a pain in the ass.Jessica Lange well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the only one the film won out of the ten for which it was nominated. The previous year Lange had achieved some notoriety for her role in the steamy remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice, but here she shows a quite different side to her talents as the sweet and gentle Julie, who, under the influence of Dorothy finds the strength to stand up for herself. Julie is a single mother, something which shows how much social attitudes had changed by the eighties; at one time the idea of a romantic comedy heroine who had produced a child out of wedlock would have been unthinkable. There are also good contributions from Teri Garr as Michael's neurotic, self-pitying ex-girlfriend Sandy, a sort of female Woody Allen, from Charles Durning as Les, Bill Murray as Michael's playwright friend Jeff and Sydney Pollack, who also produced and directed, as George. A young Geena Davis appears briefly in her first film role.The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar but did not win. It would, in fact, have been surprising if it had won; the Academy in the eighties and early nineties was going through a prolonged bout of high seriousness, and no comedy won Best Picture between Annie Hall in 1977 and Shakespeare in Love in 1998. At least 1982 did produce a worthy winner in Attenborough's Gandhi.

It is one of the few comedies which can successfully combine satirical social comment with real human emotions. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" During the late sixties and seventies, Dustin Hoffman never seemed to be away from the cinema screen for long, but in the eighties he made far fewer films, probably because he was concentrating more on his work in the theatre. I have never seen Ishtar or Family Business- in the case of the former I have been dissuaded by its reputation as one of the great turkeys of all time- but his other three films from the decade, Tootsie, Death of a Salesman and Rain Man, although very different from one another, are all among his best.Here Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a New York actor who is finding it difficult to obtain work. Not through any lack of talent, but because he is so difficult to work with. He is the sort of perfectionist whose obsessive attention to detail and inability to suffer fools gladly make him the bane of every director's life and the despair of his long-suffering agent George. Michael decides that desperate measures are needed. He decides to audition for a part in the popular, hospital-set soap opera Southwest General, and does not allow himself to be deterred by the fact that the audition is for a female role. He disguises himself as a woman, renames himself Dorothy Michaels and wins the part. The film explores the complications which arise, especially after Michael finds himself strongly attracted to his pretty co-star Julie Nichols. How can he declare his love to Julie without exposing his deception? To make matters worse, Julie's widowed father Les is equally attracted to the supposed Dorothy.There are obvious similarities between Tootsie and that other great American cross-dressing comedy from around a decade later, Mrs Doubtfire. In that film too the main character, played by Robin Williams, is also a talented but temperamental out-of-work actor, although his motives for dressing as a woman are different. There are, however, also important differences between the two films (quite apart from the fact that Hoffman makes a more convincing woman than does Williams).Tootsie is, like Nine to Five from two years earlier, a comedy with feminist overtones which satirises male sexism in the workplace. Julie is in a relationship with the show's director Ron, who treats her badly both on and off the set, and both she and Dorothy have to cope with the unwanted attentions of the show's ageing star John Van Horn who despite his advancing years still fancies himself as a ladies' man. The satire in Mrs Doubtfire, by contrast, is not so much feminist as masculinist, criticising the way in which the American divorce system discriminates against fathers and the distress that such discrimination can cause to the children of broken marriages. The other targets of the film's satire include soap operas; there must be plenty of real-life examples which share the low production values and abysmal acting standards of Southwest General. (One infamously bad example that comes to mind is the British-made Crossroads). Even Michael himself is sent up; he might be the film's hero and, strictly speaking, in the right in most of his confrontations, but his short fuse and his dogmatic, self-righteous manner make us realise just why everyone else finds it so difficult to work with him.The main reason for the film's success is Hoffman's brilliant performance in what is essentially the double role of Michael and Dorothy. Although Michael becomes quite unrecognisable, both in voice and appearance, when he assumes his feminine persona, Dorothy is similar in personality to her male alter ego, being just as feisty and bloody-minded as he is. The difference is that she can get away with it, and is even applauded for being a strong, determined woman, whereas he is just dismissed as a pain in the ass.Jessica Lange well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the only one the film won out of the ten for which it was nominated. The previous year Lange had achieved some notoriety for her role in the steamy remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice, but here she shows a quite different side to her talents as the sweet and gentle Julie, who, under the influence of Dorothy finds the strength to stand up for herself. Julie is a single mother, something which shows how much social attitudes had changed by the eighties; at one time the idea of a romantic comedy heroine who had produced a child out of wedlock would have been unthinkable. There are also good contributions from Teri Garr as Michael's neurotic, self-pitying ex-girlfriend Sandy, a sort of female Woody Allen, from Charles Durning as Les, Bill Murray as Michael's playwright friend Jeff and Sydney Pollack, who also produced and directed, as George. A young Geena Davis appears briefly in her first film role.The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar but did not win. It would, in fact, have been surprising if it had won; the Academy in the eighties and early nineties was going through a prolonged bout of high seriousness, and no comedy won Best Picture between Annie Hall in 1977 and Shakespeare in Love in 1998. At least 1982 did produce a worthy winner in Attenborough's Gandhi.

It was a roller coaster of charm, thrills and wit for all ages. Following the film there were plans to make it a TV series, but the funding simply wasn't there. Instead it was made into a series of animated series aimed for the kiddie audience that about half of the movie was intended for. Mind you the animated series was respectively dark for its time and in order to bring more humor into the series, the producers brought in a comical sidekick in the form of one of the Ghost Buster's first spectral nemeses. A ghost referred to behind the scenes as Onionhead, but would come to be known as the gluttonous Slimer.In many ways Slimer represents the nature of favoring marketing over substance. he was R2D2 without the subtlety and about half as useful. Fortunately the writers of the sequel foresaw this issue and he only makes two useless cameos in the film and never completely embarrasses the film by making it interact with the main characters.Unfortunately the taint of marketing over substance didn't end with Slimer. The majority of the film is seasoned with similar laziness. The main characters are reduced in the very beginning to underdogs again instead of the heroes they were at the end of the first film. This eventually leads to a redemption scene in which the antagonist is a despotic judge who for some bizarre reason chooses not believe in ghosts, despite the fact that a 50 ft giant ghost was captured on live television during the climactic battle of the first film only five years ago.Also returning is Dana Barret who plays the mother of the impending victim, Oscar. In the original film, Dana was a victim because she simply lived in the wrong apartment complex. Now her baby is the impending victim because... he's cute? I have my own personal issues with the use of babies or young children as plot devices because it eliminates any real drama. Nothing ever happens to these kids (Hollywood wouldn't dare risk it) and so no legitimate dramatic tension can be established by placing them in harm's way. I'll get into the laziness of Oscar's character a little later. Dana portrays Peter's love interest again, because it would have made too much sense for them to simply still be together after the events of the first film and her character is just a little too well-adjusted for someone whose baby daddy just left her with a newborn for a job in Europe.Slightly less lazy is the return of Louis Tully and his new love interest, Janine Melnitz, whose character is disappointingly reduced to a sexually aggressive caricature. While the chemistry between the two isn't entirely absent, Annie Potts' character was better in the first film as a snarkier assistant at odds with her employers and a thing for intellectuals. Louis Tully is Louis Tully, but unfortunately for Rick Moranis, his character role this time around is downgraded by the two aforementioned cameos with Slimer.The meat and potatoes of the plot is established with the introduction of Vigo the Carpathian. A despotic sorcerer and tyrant whose spirit exists in a painting bearing his likeness. His main weapons of choice are a Renfield-like servant who is given vague supernatural abilities and is only slightly less annoying than Andy Dick and a powerful, spiritually charged sludge that manifests and feeds on negative emotions. The latter would have had a better execution if they had come up with a better solution to dealing with it other than happy, cheerful slime and serving the oldest possible cliché of objectified good versus objectified evil. Vigo's plan is to take over the world (Of Course!) and in order to do so he needs to possess a human body and that someone is baby Oscar.This leads us to the true laziness of using a baby for a plot device. Oscar's character is entirely unnecessary except to serve as a springboard to bring Dana and Peter back together because we need to revisit this relationship from the first film. Also, it is obvious that Vigo intends to begin his reign from very beginning and yet he favors a host that would be relatively defenseless and lacking in basic communication abilities. It is also seen through his actions that he could possess practically any other human so the question begs why not choose any older child in New York City from ages 8-13 instead of learning how to walk, talk, feed yourself and use a toilet all over again.Plot and general character laziness aside, the effects are decent but the music lacks the pop of the 'original' score from Ray Parker Jr (with my own respects to Huey Lewis and the News). Perhaps hip hop was not the way to go with this film.Despite its flaws, its still a very watchable and moderately enjoyable film. It still manages to produce some genuinely creepy and funny moments which is what a Ghostbusters movie should have and it was nice to see Ernie Hudson's Winston Zeddemore do more in the film than be a stand-in fourth and the main four characters are still true to form. Its definitely worth a watch or two.

At first I thought his use of out-dated 'Mockney' that the Yanks didn't understand was a bit of a joke but then realised it was serious. No one from London would not be aware that Yanks wouldn't understand it. Stamp also is completely out of his depth and appears embarrassed. He can't do the persona or the accent. He is supposed to be a fish out of water, but we get no sense of being in America anyway. Why Stamp should shoot six guys who basically have nothing to do with it makes no sense. And of course he just happens to have a spare gun we know in advance what's going to happen.Quite why the decent Eduardo would hang around with such a nutter is not clear. My main gripes are the dire script. Peter Fonda is shown as a dopey hippy who likes pretty young girls cos he can't let go on the 60's. Hardly the kind who would be a cold killer. Stamp seems to be reading the script for the first time and is just waiting painfully for the movie to end so he can collect his cheque and disappear. It would take an idiot not to see that it would all end at a beach house and that Stamp would finally learn just how naughty he had really been. Probably one of the worst movies ever.

I think Stamp is a more than competent actor and the cast looked great. Hadn't seen Barry Newman since 'The Lawyer' many moons ago and wondered what had happened to him. I have to say this film is execrable on every level. Stamp is supposed to be a bit of a Cockney hard man out of prison. At first I thought his use of out-dated 'Mockney' that the Yanks didn't understand was a bit of a joke but then realised it was serious. No one from London would not be aware that Yanks wouldn't understand it. Stamp also is completely out of his depth and appears embarrassed. He can't do the persona or the accent.

Basically Robert 'Bob' Montagné (Roger Duchesne) is an old well dressed gangster who has a nice apartment, two-toned convertible coupe and he respects the police, but his big problems is a compulsive love for gambling. On a losing streak he is considering a last job in the Montmartre district of Paris, he overhears that the Deauville Casino holds unimaginable quantities of money and is vulnerable during morning hours. Bob develops the scheme to steal the fortune, and he brings in a safe cracker and a few other underworld characters to help out, and at the same time the middle aged ex-con becomes involved with young Anne (Isabelle Corey), who has no place to live and stays with any man who will have her. Bob's friend and partner in crime Paolo (Daniel Cauchy) trusts the young woman when they spend some time together, he even tells her the robbery plan, and she betrays the gang on the night the heist is planned, unaware it was meant to be secret, and she tells pimp turned informant Marc (Gérard Buhr). Marc was going to tip off Inspector Ledru (Guy Decomble), who Bob saved the life of, about the robbery, but he is killed by Paulo before giving away the big details, and the police officer warns the gangster off the job. The man inside the casino, Jean the croupier (Claude Cerval), has also tipped off the police, and to occupy himself before any heist Bob gambles a winning streak inside the casino. He has ironically got a large enough fortune with his winnings, and when his friends arrive, as well as the police, there is a shoot out, where Paulo is shot, and he is finally arrested. Bob was able to stash his hundreds of chips inside Ledru's car, and he remarks the possibility he will get off lightly and be able to sue the police for damages, while lonely Anne waits for him at his place. Also starring André Garet as Roger, Howard Vernon as McKimmie and Colette Fleury as Suzanne. Duchesne gives a good performance as the gloomy and addictive risky gangster with a good poker face and all the moves, I did not notice many funny moments, but the story that is similar to Ocean's Eleven was quite good entertainment, and the gambling scenes are interesting too, a watchable crime comedy drama.

And it is a real turkey in a great many ways to the point where it really becomes like shooting fish in a barrel trying to criticize it's many flaws. I've seen it a few times, many of which came as a child who was totally sucked in by Warner Bros blatant commercialism butchering of the Dark Knight and a few times as an adult looking for a film to troll. Is 'Batman & Robin' terrible? After a recent viewing I don't know if the answer is quite simple anymore. The film is unbelievably stupid and yet I found that I actually admire the scope of it in some ironic ways. It goes without saying that 'Batman & Robin' is an absolutely ridiculous film and yet in a great many ways the comic book is all about the quality of being ridiculous. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Clooney is a monotone and frankly boring Batman. O'Donnell's Robin is a whiny one dimensional character with no sort of character arch. Uma Thurman doesn't just chew the scenery, she gobbles it. Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl is a ten year old boy's definition of being a feminist woman.And there's Arnie...'Batman & Robin' is a horrendous adaptation of the source material, this goes without saying. They completely got Batman and his motivations wrong. The thing is though I don't think any of the Burton\/Schumacher films came close to getting Batman right at all. I hate all four original Batman films as Batman adaptations. In fact I would say Joel Schumacher deserves a fair degree of credit for working with Val Kilmer in creating a really interesting Bruce Wayne in 'Forever'. 'Batman & Robin' has been a target for years and yet the criticism of the film has evolved. This idea of it being a horrible Batman adaptation is correct and yet this same criticism can be applied to Burton's films which for the lack of a really deep Batman film were heralded as masterful explorations of the character before Nolan came along. One must completely throw the gripes of adapting Batman out the window before viewing any of these films because obviously you are going to find flaws. It just so happens that these flaws are all the more apparent in this film and they are very angering to a Batman fan. The fact that the fans put Warner's feet to the fire after this is really a testament to how brilliant Batman is. In order to critically look at 'Batman & Robin' one must accept that the film will inevitably fail to be Batman.I've asked a great deal of you and if you are still here with me let me try to explain what I feel works about 'Batman & Robin' because there is stuff that work here. One person I do not wish to be as venomous with is Joel Schumacher, whom i actually think does the best with the horrible cards he has been given. Granted Schumacher could have done a great deal more in curbing the horrendous excess of his performers and yet that aside I think 'Batman & Robin' is a competently and dare I say well made film. 'Batman & Robin' is a ridiculous set piece and Batman myths aside I enjoyed a great deal of the action here. I actually think Schumacher can direct an effective action film. He has an epic vision of a bizarre Gotham City and he stretches that budget to all he can get from it. The film is much more visually appealing to look at than any recent main stream action film (anything Bay makes comes to mind). The art direction is absolutely beautiful and captures the feel of a ridiculous comic book perfectly. Contrary to popular belief comic books have been and will continue to be ridiculous. So did I like 'Batman & Robin'? No, I hated it for pretty much all the same reasons everyone loves to hate it for. Do I think it is an unredeemable film? Far from it. There is a degree of creativity and imagination here on Schumacher's part that although wasted on a script this horrible is evident and to a certain degree fun.

The movie came out in 1993. Im 25 now and I'm pretty sure it was not a good movie for a lil dude to watch . But let me tell you, when i got older, I was never so happy to find an older movie that I loved Right off the bat! So that being said, let me give you a lil plot summary to spice up this review a bit. Clarence and Alabama are newlyweds who acquire an unexpected wedding present. Unknown to the blissfully happy couple, ruthless gangsters are on their tail, determined to reclaim their lost property......First I wanna get into the writing. Quentin Tarantino Is a great, great writer, Known for writing movies like, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Natural born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn , Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol 1 and 2, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds and his upcoming film Django Unchained (which he all directed). So Obviously he has skills. but even with all those great movies under his belt. I think that True Romance is the best thing he has wrote..... SO far that is. and thats saying A lot. Just the way the story moves along and keeps you interested is Beautiful!!!!! By the end of the movie you feel like you know these characters and you actually care for them. You don't want anything bad to happen to them or worse die. The Directing, Tony F-ing Scott (Tony Scott) WOW! Known for Directing (just gonna say the ones i like) Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy Of the State, Spy Game, Man On Fire, Domino, Deja Vu, The taking of Pelham 123, and unstoppable. In True Romanced He did an Outstanding job capturing the scenes and angles where you actually feel like your in the room with the characters. You feel there tension, the love, the hate and the innocence. For Example there is a scene with a GANGTER\/PIMP (gary Oldman, Believe it or not) and Clarence (Christian Slater), In this scene you feel and see the anger clarence has towards this pimp, but its the way Tony Scott presents these scenes with there theme and mood that get the hairs on your neck to LITERALLY stand up. True Story, It happens to me every time i watch it. And it happens more then once.The Music, First off i wanna say Hans Zimmer is the man and if you have read any of my other reviews you will know that he is one of my favs. Known for (Seriously there is way to many so I'm only saying a few, and that's still gonna be a lot) Inception, Gladiator, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code, Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, The Rock and The Lion King. So in this film the music sounds like we are about to go to an island and drink pina coladas or go lay on the beach in the nice hot sun........ Sorry not happening here. Instead it throws you off a lil and makes you focus on whats going on in the film. thats what i always liked about Hans, he really sets the theme. But he doesn't always have a song playing in the background. Sometimes its just sounds and weird noises (BUT ITS MUSIC) . SO ALLLLLL OF ^THAT^ being said. Do I think you should go see this movie? What do you think? YES DUUUUUHHHH! The cast is SUPERB, You got Christian Slater (The guy who falls in love), Patricia Arquette ( The girl that falls in love with the guy), Dennis Hopper (The Guys Innoncent Father), Val Kilmer ( ELVIS....

He reports that his current job is desperately dull and boring, to which the counselor informs him that his tests reveal that he is dull and boring. The job he wants lion tamer. This despite the fact he has no training and seems to have mistaken lions for aardvarks. He does have a proper hat though. The counselor informs us that This is what accountancy does to people. That's the grand anarchic spirit of Monty Python. Grab a normal scenario and whip it into something so over-exaggerated and silly that we almost have to laugh at the concept. I think the British are experts at this. There's a drollery to their delivery that allows a scene like that to work. Week after week, this was what made the best parts of The Monty Python troup's TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus work. They adopted a sort-of shotgun approach to their sketches, firing every idea at us no matter how ridiculous and hoping that one of them would make us laugh.The laugh ratio on the show was about 40%. Some sketched worked but many did not. Their first feature film And Now for Something Completely Different culls their best sketches into a kind of Best of collection. These sketches are not just replays from the show, but actually reenactments, on film without an audience. The laugh ratio in the film is about 70\/30. Many of their ideas work if you're willing to stretch your imagination.The troup, which is comprised of six players - Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin - work exhaustively throughout this film to play more than 100 different characters, are so willing to make us laugh that they will come up with nearly anything. That would explain an opening scene featuring a man who claims to have a tape recorder up his nose. He presses one nostril and the tape plays La Marseillaise. He presses the other nostril and he can rewind the tape. Even stranger is the follow-up act featuring the man's brother who suffers from the same affliction, this time the song plays in stereo. Far from classic comedy, but you get the idea.My favorite is a sketch called Hell's Grannies, which involves a news report dealing with a roving gang of little old ladies who beat young men over the head with their pocket books. We see them in their flowered hats, swinging their purses and roaring around on their motorcycles while wrapped in shawls. One nervous citizen in a leather jacket and a Jolly Roger helmet informs us that It's not even safe to go out to the shops anymore. The news reporter lets us know that their domain is a world in which the surgical stocking is king. Only slightly worse are a roving gang of baby snatchers, grown men in diapers who snatch adults from in front of grocery stores.One of the best creative touches in the film is the way in which the sketches are linked together. One sketch leads into the next in a way this oddly fitting. For example the scene with the accountant ends with a fairy waving his magic wand and giving the accountant something more exciting. That makes him the host of the game show that is the next sketch. It is called Blackmail a sadistic game show in which privately obtained films of adultery are shown, and the person on the film has to call in with a cash offer so the show will stop running the film.All of this is very subjective and no one laughs at exactly the same thing. That's pretty much what makes Monty Python work. Either you are in on the joke or you're looking for laughter elsewhere. Either the sight of an armed bank robber committing his crime only the discover that he has walked into a lingerie shop is funny to you or it isn't. For me, I laughed most of the time, the rest I was left scratching my head.

Irwin Maurice Fletch Fletcher is a hot shot investigative reporter whose curiosity is aroused when smooth rich man Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) approaches him with a proposition murder Stanwyk for a nice five figure sum. Stanwyk claims to be already dying of bone cancer, but Fletch rightly senses something suspicious and snoops around, despite the fact that he was supposed to be working on an expose of the drug traffic at a beach. There is a certain kinship between Fletch and Beverly Hills Cop in that they feature unflappable main characters who often manufacture scams in order to get what they need from other characters; in Fletch's case, he takes it a step further and dons various disguises as well. You have to hand it to Fletch - this is a guy who rarely loses his cool, even when guns are being pointed at him. Chase knows this is a fun role and is clearly just having a blast, firing off wise ass one liners left and right. As a result, the dialogue is often quite funny and the movie does have a certain energy to it, moving along quite nicely. The supporting cast is great, including Joe Don Baker as the police chief, the lovely and appealing Dana Wheeler-Nicholson as the leading lady (she easily could have had an even better career in film), Richard Libertini as Fletch's long suffering editor, M. Emmet Walsh as a cheerful doctor, George Wendt as beach bum \/ drug pusher Fat Sam, Kenneth Mars as Stanton Boyd, Geena Davis in a perky early career film appearance as Fletch's co-worker Larry (!), and William Traylor as the unfortunate Mr. Underhill, with a bunch of familiar faces in small parts George Wyner, Tony Longo, James Avery, Burton Gilliam, William Sanderson, Bill Henderson, Beau Starr, and Ralph Seymour; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's cameo role as himself is actually quite fleeting. Comic highlights include Fletch's visit to Dr. Dolan (Walsh), wherein he gets a rectal exam, the mystery element of the movie works pretty well, and there's some good action to boot, with an impressive climactic car chase. The aliases are hysterical, as Fletch will refer to himself as Ted Nugent, John Cocktoastin, and Arnold Babar, among other names. For fans of Chase and director Michael Ritchie (Downhill Racer, The Bad News Bears, The Golden Child), this rollicking movie really does deliver the goods, maintaining interest for a solidly entertaining 99 minutes.

As a result, the dialogue is often quite funny and the movie does have a certain energy to it, moving along quite nicely. The supporting cast is great, including Joe Don Baker as the police chief, the lovely and appealing Dana Wheeler-Nicholson as the leading lady (she easily could have had an even better career in film), Richard Libertini as Fletch's long suffering editor, M. Emmet Walsh as a cheerful doctor, George Wendt as beach bum \/ drug pusher Fat Sam, Kenneth Mars as Stanton Boyd, Geena Davis in a perky early career film appearance as Fletch's co-worker Larry (!), and William Traylor as the unfortunate Mr. Underhill, with a bunch of familiar faces in small parts George Wyner, Tony Longo, James Avery, Burton Gilliam, William Sanderson, Bill Henderson, Beau Starr, and Ralph Seymour; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's cameo role as himself is actually quite fleeting. Comic highlights include Fletch's visit to Dr. Dolan (Walsh), wherein he gets a rectal exam, the mystery element of the movie works pretty well, and there's some good action to boot, with an impressive climactic car chase. The aliases are hysterical, as Fletch will refer to himself as Ted Nugent, John Cocktoastin, and Arnold Babar, among other names. For fans of Chase and director Michael Ritchie (Downhill Racer, The Bad News Bears, The Golden Child), this rollicking movie really does deliver the goods, maintaining interest for a solidly entertaining 99 minutes. Rent or buy this movie and be prepared for some hearty laughs.And feel free to go ahead and charge it to the Underhills.Eight out of 10.

It reminded me of Lena Wertmuller's Seven Beauties from 1975; though, in my opinion, not as good. Guido pursues Dora, a non-Jewish girl from a wealthy family who are not thrilled with her future husband. They have son, Giosue, and the family is put into a concentration camp on the boy's birthday, so Guido makes the experience into a game to protect his son from the horrors of the war. He tells him that if he hides from the guards and keeps quiet, he will earn points with the top prize being a tank.They continue in the ploy until the American troops arrive to liberate the camp. Benigni is likable and his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is Dora, his on screen spouse, and they have wonderful chemistry together. Giorgio Cantarini as their son, completes an excellent casting decision. Sometimes funny, but also devastatingly sad, Benigni has made an unforgettable movie which is a modern classic.

So, in his not-so-secret place, he dreams of traveling around the world to find the parents he exactly wanted. There are several scenes I couldn't let slide a stereotypical Texan couple(Dan Aykroyd from Ghost Busters and Reba McEntire) whose pompous son was killed in a stampede (Along with a cheesy musical number so bad it makes Tom and Jerry the Movie look like Singin' in the Rain); an Eskimo village that looks like Bedrock after it went through the Ice Age; a stereotypical family from a cheesy 1960's sitcom; there is more, but I'm not going to waste my time. It's probably no wonder why Roger Ebert hated this movie. And you know what, I don't blame him for hating this racist's wet dream that includes the pathetic acting of Bruce Willis that plays as a guardian angel with a jack of all trades(But personally, I think he's a stalker). Corny jokes, a billion bad gags, and a trillion disgusting stereotypes are the reason why you should avoid this movie at all costs(Unless you're a racist).

It was during the Summer of 1962 that the movie, particularly the somewhat enigmatic title, caught our fancy.GEE, NOW, WHAT could this mean? We knew that it was about 'younguns', teens that is, sorta like us. Costarring Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty, it appeared to be aimed at the youth set. Surely there'd be lots of hugging, kissing and all of that stuff! WELL, THE PROBLEM was that we (that is I) never did get to see It while it was still playing at the local show. For some reason, the film and this writer stayed strangers until just recently; when Turner Classic Movies had it on one evening.FINALLY WE GOT together and what a surprise there was; for instead of the title's being a reference to heavy kissing, hugging and other things, it was some sort of egghead's quotation about the wonders of life! OH, WELL, YOU can't win 'em all! THE PICTURE IS, however, a sort of epic family story that covers the lives of several characters in a rural community over the years. It goes from one generation to the next, passing the torch of life and the mantle of family leadership from father to son, kind of like BAMBI. It is well made and definitely an A Picture; as are all of those directed by Elia Kazan.THE STORY IS constructed in a fashion that resembles one of those life journey things done by Blankety Blank. It also, perhaps, could have been something written by Edna Ferber; while she was watching DANCING WITH THE STARS.IN THE END, we enjoyed the story-if only for having seen it for the first time and after all of these years\/decades have passed.
