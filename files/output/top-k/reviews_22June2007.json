Shermer, Illinois, 60062.Most people would give an exasperated sigh at that monotonous voice-over, but not in this case, since preceding it was a David Bowie lyric from Changes on a black screen smashed like a glass window, the pieces falling to reveal Shermer High. Such an opening visual wakes up the audience to the sleepy town of Shermer, Illinois--sleepy like the monotone of the voice-over.What you get from the voice-over is that five people have detention from 700 a.m. to dinnertime (I believe it's 600 p.m.), and each person is a typical high school teenage stereotype the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal. Following the voice-over, you witness each student arrive at school.The princess skipped class to go shopping, but her father clearly spoils her and doesn't seem to care much about her offense. Because we know so early what Claire (the princess) did to get the detention, we assume that her character is easy to read. But after a while, you find out that her parents use her for leverage in a crumbling and loveless marriage; that she's no promiscuous little-miss-popular, but rather a naive virgin; and she actually hates being the popular person she is, and hates her material world and the pressures in it.The athlete's father seems to be genuinely concerned about his son. He says that guys screw around and that's customary, except this time Andy (the jock) got caught, and he has to suffer the consequences now. His father tells him to basically get his act together, because no school will give scholarships to discipline cases--which is true, and he's right. But throughout the movie it's revealed that Andy has no desire to be a varsity wrestler; he only does it because it makes his father proud. And then you find out that the reason Andy is in detention is because he beat up a much weaker kid in the locker room. Why? Because his father dislikes weakness, and Andy wanted to please his father. Once Andy's heartbreaking story is told, you look back on the conversation between Andy and his father in the truck and realize what a douche-bag his father really is.The brain's case is possibly the most surprising of all of them. Brian (brain, with the a and the i reversed) is a straight-A student who seems to be picked on a lot by people like Claire, Andy, and the criminal. He always tries to fit in, and you wonder what got such a nice kid in detention in the first place? A gun in his locker, because he failed wood-shop (a class he thought would be easy and give him a chance to mingle with more average and popular kids) and ruined his 4.0 GPA. It's not really his family that pressures him so much (although you can see in the beginning that his mother isn't happy with him AT ALL), but rather himself, because school smarts are the only smarts that people like him really know, and they are afraid to fail at the one thing they are good at. (Take it from someone who was almost exactly like him in junior high--minus the gun.) Although the gun was only a flare, it showed everyone else at detention that Brian needed to break out of his shell and become their friend.The criminal, John Bender (they just call him Bender), doesn't come to school with a parent, he walks. When he gets inside the library (where the detention is held), he takes the phone off the hook and does a couple of other kooky things. He seems to take pride in being able to annoy people, especially Claire and Principal Vernon, the guy who basically represents the rest of Society to the five students. He pulled a false fire alarm to get into detention, and he earns another eight during this detention. But he's not really heartless, despite several arguments where he practically crucifies Claire (his crush). During the course of the movie, you find that his father is physically abusive (proven by the cigar burn on his arm), and he has just as many feelings as any other kid at school, though his are well-hidden.The last student is the basket case, Allison. She didn't do anything to earn the detention, but lied to her parents because she actually had nothing better to do on a Saturday. When she gets out of the car in the beginning (the back seat, actually), she tries to talk to her mother, but her mother rolls up the window and drives off. Apparently, she is always ignored at home, and she reaches out to the unsuspecting students at detention, actually finding out most of their stories through careful insight before they admit anything (especially Andy).So, what happened on Monday? This is a popular question for Breakfast Club fans. Do Andy and Allison stay together? What about Bender and Claire? When Brian walks up to one of them, will they shun him (as usual) or accept him? Will Andy apologize to Larry Lester for beating him up? Will all of the students resolve their problems with the parental units? And finally, will Principal Vernon find a way to actually reach out to students in need instead of always putting them down? The fact that the Breakfast Club is open-ended, and the way it makes the viewers' imaginations take off, is one of the many things that make it a perfect 10.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"22 June 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Between the years of 1827 and 1828, a strange series of murders took place in Edinburgh, Scotland, terrifying the population during the almost eleven months between the first attack and the capture of the criminals. At the moment of their capture, 17 persons had been killed by William Burke and William Hare in order to be sold as corpses to the Edinburgh Medical College for dissection, with the prestigious doctor Robert Knox as the main customer. This revelation shocked the nation and made the case (now named The West Port murders) part of popular culture, and even sing-song rhymes were written about the case. Years later, famous writer Robert Louis Stevenson would become fascinated by the case, and in 1884 wrote the short story The Body Snatcher inspired by it. This short story would be the inspiration for a movie in 1945, a classic of horror starring the legendary Boris Karloff.Set in Edinburgh in 1831, The Body Snatcher is the story of Donald Fettes (Russell Wade), a young student of medicine who is not doing well financially and will be forced to leave school. To his surprise, he is accepted as an assistant to his teacher of anatomy, the famous Dr. MacFarlane (Henry Daniell), who considers Fettes a promising student and is willing to aid him to remain in school. However, not everything is sweet for Fettes, as his new job will show him the dark side of his profession when he discovers that Dr. MacFarlane must pay John Gray (Boris Karloff), a cab-man, to bring him exhumed bodies from the cemeteries for his classes. But this will only be the beginning, as after meeting the sinister cab-man Fettes will discover that Gray is more than a mere body snatcher, as he knows a horrible secret about Dr. MacFarlane that gives him power over the reputed physician.Written by producer Val Lewton (under his usual pen name Carlos Keith) and popular crime writer Philip MacDonald, The Body Snatcher is a powerful psychological drama in that subtle style that Lewton mastered during his days as head of the horror unit at RKO studios. Using Stevenson's story as a template, the writers crafted a plot that explores some of the darkest aspects of the human soul in a way that mixes the story's Gothic origins with the films noir of the time. The screenplay excels in the development of the characters, as one can't help but feel for them as we follow their descent into the dark side. It also creates one of the most extraordinary and complex characters of horror in the figure of John Gray. Finally, it's worth to point out the outstanding quality of the dialogs, which is another of the elements that add a lot of class to the film.The Body Snatcher was Robert Wise's second solo effort as a director after making Mademoiselle Fifi for Val Lewton a year before. Like in that previous work, Wise once again proves his skills to create a visually outstanding period piece under Lewton's low budgets, as he manages to create a very dark 1830s setting with great detail. As some critics have pointed out, The Body Snatcher is an effective throwback to the classic horrors of the 30s done by Universal, as Wise brings back the Gothic atmosphere of those movies and adds the subtle ambiguity of the RKO style imposed by Lewton, creating something that could be described as a gothic film noir. As he would do years later in The Haunting, Wise uses what he learned from Lewton and takes it beyond, creating stylish and horrific scenes based almost entirely on suggestion and mood than in unabashed shock.While probably he'll always be known as the Creature in James Whale's 1931 classic Frankenstein, British actor Boris Karloff wasn't exactly a one-note performer, and this movie is a clear testament of that. As John Gray, Karloff delivers what simply is the best performance of his career, transforming himself in this sinister man that can go from a sympathetic nice cab-man to the cruel and rude body snatcher that tortures Dr. MacFarlane's mind. However, Karloff is not the only one who makes a great job, as Henry Daniell is another of the highlights of the film in his performance as Dr. MacFarlane. RKO's regular Russell Wade completes the cast as young Fettes, and is very natural and believable in his role as the naive student. Edith Atwater and horror icon Bela Lugosi appear in minor roles, but both manage to steal their scenes with great talent.During his short run at RKO studios, Lewton showed a great hand at picking the crew for his movies, and this movie wasn't the exception. Not only Robert Wise makes a wonderful job at directing the film, but also cinematographer Robert De Grasse adds his talent to the creation of many of the haunting scenes of the film. Wise learned a lot from working with Orson Welles, and together with De Grasse he employs Welles' techniques to the horror genre with excellent results. While personally I consider this movie among the best horror films ever made, it's worth to point out that modern viewers may feel the movie's pace a bit too slow, as this is not a movie that uses direct shock to be scary; this is a movie that moves around the creepiness of its ominous atmosphere and specially, the unsettling nature of its characters' psychology.Morally ambiguous and of excellent craftsmanship, The Body Snatcher is probably among the best horror films ever made. Those who think that horror is nothing more than cheap entertainment will find that this film elevates the genre to the level or an art-form, and that there is more in Boris Karloff than Frankenstein's monster. Along with Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie, The Body Snatcher is another proof that while short, Lewton's run at RKO was enormously influential for the horror genre. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Between the years of 1827 and 1828, a strange series of murders took place in Edinburgh, Scotland, terrifying the population during the almost eleven months between the first attack and the capture of the criminals.

To his surprise, he is accepted as an assistant to his teacher of anatomy, the famous Dr. MacFarlane (Henry Daniell), who considers Fettes a promising student and is willing to aid him to remain in school. However, not everything is sweet for Fettes, as his new job will show him the dark side of his profession when he discovers that Dr. MacFarlane must pay John Gray (Boris Karloff), a cab-man, to bring him exhumed bodies from the cemeteries for his classes. But this will only be the beginning, as after meeting the sinister cab-man Fettes will discover that Gray is more than a mere body snatcher, as he knows a horrible secret about Dr. MacFarlane that gives him power over the reputed physician.Written by producer Val Lewton (under his usual pen name Carlos Keith) and popular crime writer Philip MacDonald, The Body Snatcher is a powerful psychological drama in that subtle style that Lewton mastered during his days as head of the horror unit at RKO studios. Using Stevenson's story as a template, the writers crafted a plot that explores some of the darkest aspects of the human soul in a way that mixes the story's Gothic origins with the films noir of the time. The screenplay excels in the development of the characters, as one can't help but feel for them as we follow their descent into the dark side. It also creates one of the most extraordinary and complex characters of horror in the figure of John Gray. Finally, it's worth to point out the outstanding quality of the dialogs, which is another of the elements that add a lot of class to the film.The Body Snatcher was Robert Wise's second solo effort as a director after making Mademoiselle Fifi for Val Lewton a year before. Like in that previous work, Wise once again proves his skills to create a visually outstanding period piece under Lewton's low budgets, as he manages to create a very dark 1830s setting with great detail. As some critics have pointed out, The Body Snatcher is an effective throwback to the classic horrors of the 30s done by Universal, as Wise brings back the Gothic atmosphere of those movies and adds the subtle ambiguity of the RKO style imposed by Lewton, creating something that could be described as a gothic film noir. As he would do years later in The Haunting, Wise uses what he learned from Lewton and takes it beyond, creating stylish and horrific scenes based almost entirely on suggestion and mood than in unabashed shock.While probably he'll always be known as the Creature in James Whale's 1931 classic Frankenstein, British actor Boris Karloff wasn't exactly a one-note performer, and this movie is a clear testament of that. As John Gray, Karloff delivers what simply is the best performance of his career, transforming himself in this sinister man that can go from a sympathetic nice cab-man to the cruel and rude body snatcher that tortures Dr. MacFarlane's mind. However, Karloff is not the only one who makes a great job, as Henry Daniell is another of the highlights of the film in his performance as Dr. MacFarlane. RKO's regular Russell Wade completes the cast as young Fettes, and is very natural and believable in his role as the naive student. Edith Atwater and horror icon Bela Lugosi appear in minor roles, but both manage to steal their scenes with great talent.During his short run at RKO studios, Lewton showed a great hand at picking the crew for his movies, and this movie wasn't the exception. Not only Robert Wise makes a wonderful job at directing the film, but also cinematographer Robert De Grasse adds his talent to the creation of many of the haunting scenes of the film. Wise learned a lot from working with Orson Welles, and together with De Grasse he employs Welles' techniques to the horror genre with excellent results. While personally I consider this movie among the best horror films ever made, it's worth to point out that modern viewers may feel the movie's pace a bit too slow, as this is not a movie that uses direct shock to be scary; this is a movie that moves around the creepiness of its ominous atmosphere and specially, the unsettling nature of its characters' psychology.Morally ambiguous and of excellent craftsmanship, The Body Snatcher is probably among the best horror films ever made. Those who think that horror is nothing more than cheap entertainment will find that this film elevates the genre to the level or an art-form, and that there is more in Boris Karloff than Frankenstein's monster. Along with Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie, The Body Snatcher is another proof that while short, Lewton's run at RKO was enormously influential for the horror genre. 10\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"22 June 2007","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Die Hard had a significant impact on me as a child.

The film has continued to be a winner for the thirty years that followed, and no doubt it'll continue to be a timeless classic animation for many more years to come. The Rescuers is right at the top among Disney's most dramatic, touching and even darker films. That's right, don't let the usual description about two little mice fool you, this film is anything but a happy, politically correct, kiddie movie about cute rodents, it tells a deep, serious story that may be overshadowed by that vague description and hides many elements some adults would likely frown upon when it is time to share them with children.Based on two light-hearted children's novels by Margery Sharp (The Rescuers and Miss Bianca), The Rescuers tells the story of a little orphaned girl named Penny (voiced by Michelle Stacy). The girl had been kidnapped and taken away into a dark, gloomy riverboat in Devil's Bayou, in an uncharted island (No, it's not Louisianna as some want to insist). The girl sends out messages in bottles, one of which arrives in New York City, at the Rescue Aid Society in the basement of the United Nations building. The Rescue Aid Society is a mouse-run organization imitating the United Nations which sends out help for anyone in need, human, mouse or cat. After reading the heartfelt note inside the bottle, Hungary delegate Miss Bianca (voiced by Eva Gabor) volunteers to take on the mission, and with the condition that she will take along a male companion, Mr. Chairman (voiced by Bernard Fox) agrees to let her go; Miss Bianca chooses the shy janitor mouse Bernard (voiced by Bob Newhart). On their way, the two mice visit Morningside Orphanage and meet an old cat named Rufus who sends them on the trail of someone named Madame Medusa (voiced by Geraldine Page). Madame Medusa works at a pawn shop, which the two mice visit, and when the wicked woman receives a call from her partner Mr. Snoops (voiced by Joe Flynn), Miss Bianca and Bernard discover that she is indeed responsible for the disappearance of Penny and that she is looking for a great big diamond. Miss Bianca and Bernard must race to Devil's Bayou with the help of Orville the albatross, Ellie Mae and Luke, the muskrats and Evinrude, a dragonfly as well as other bayou critters, to meet and face the wicked Madame Medusa and her two ferocious alligators, Brutus and Nero and bring Penny safely home. Before doing that however, Penny, Miss Bianca and Bernard will have to survive underground inside a horrid pirate's cave where they must find the Devil's Eye, the world's largest diamond, before the tide rises drowning them all.As an adaptation of Margery Sharp's classic novels, Disney's The Rescuers is sometimes criticized for not being a faithful adaptation of any particular Margery Sharp work about the brave Miss Bianca, still, the film manages to be true to the many elements that made the original works so wonderful. Simplicity, charm, sophistication... Disney's The Rescuers blends the real with the surreal, starting with a real-world place like New York City and a fictional non-existent uncharted island named Devil's Bayou, blending orphaned little girls with tales of valuable pirate treasure or using for setting a gloomy, dark place that might just be in its own world, since it often gives the feeling of being far from civilization. The characters are sophisticated and developed, without any particular greatness they often find themselves lost, such as when Bernard says What can two little mice do?, just like we real humans feel sometimes, it's characters like these that are most endearing and have an easier time touching hearts. Madame Medusa is a human being, no supernatural powers and no real human strength, she's the perfect antagonist for an orphaned girl, a pair of mice and their critter friends. The story told here is simplistic, without pushing out any real moral (though you'll find plenty of morals and lessons throughout the film) or without relying on anything too elaborate to work. The simplicity of the characters and the story is what made both Margery Sharp's novels and Disney's film work, but in reality, both are anything but simplistic.Fans of The Rescuers are to be saddened, at least so far, by Disney's neglect of the film. As of now, the only way to enjoy The Rescuers without the restored pirate version roaming the internet is with the 2003 DVD, which frankly leaves lots and lots to be desired (The same can be said about the pathetic sequel\/rip-off produced somewhere in the early 90's). Lack of bonus features aside, The Rescuers is poorly presented with washed out, too-vivid colors, a miss-match of brightness and contrast, leaving a very dark picture that leaves out too many details. Rough lines, grain, dirt and all sorts of artifacts completely spoil the picture quality, leaving us with no more than less-than-decent picture and average sound quality. Definitely a thumbs up for an upcoming Masterpiece Edition, which we all hope will be seen soon.Happy 30th Anniversary!

Namely,that is using old movie actors' names and archaic terms for places. 'Alexander Kox' is the name of a fine film actor of the '30's, 40's and '50's.*** The script takes two early Batman stories and combines them with some original themes to produce an intelligent,gripping and action filled screen story. The 1st story was from Batman Comics #1, Spring 1940 issue. It was simply titled,The Joker, and presents him as a Contract Killer or Crime Syndicate Hit Man, if you will. He used poisonous gas which caused the deceased to die with a Sardonic Grin on their countenance. This story,though Joker's 1st Appearance,did not give his beginning as The Joker, no Origin. The Origin of the Joker was published some years later and was adapted into the occurrences we witnessed in the movie at Axis Chemicals.Mr. Burton did do The Joker and all of us a favor by Christening him, Jack Napier. For alas, he never was given any name in the comics.Okay, now for some complaints. First of all, Most any Batman reader can tell you the name of the Murderer of Mr. & Mrs. Thomas Wayne, Batman's parents. It was a low life, scum bag street mugger named Joe Chill. Burton puts the killings on the young Jack Napier. Can we reconcile this revisionist heresy? Well, how about the fact that the flash back scene of the robbery\/murders showed 2 bad guys. Could Chill and Napier have been partners? Works for me.The worst sin of all was in killing off The Joker. Bad move there, Tim and how did DC and Warner Brothers permit this?(not to mention the method used.) * It has been said that once the scenes of Jack Nicholson,with broad sardonic grin on face, chopping his way through doors in THE SHINING, the role was his . It took a while, but he finally acquiesced.** The use of names relating back to Film History and U.S. History for that matter, seem to be a favourite ploy of Tim Burton.In addition to this Alexander Knox, in the Sequel, BATMAN RETURNS(1992), the name of the Super Rich Utilities Tycoon(Christopher Walken) is given as Max Schreck, which was the German silent film actor portraying the Vampire in The NOSFERATU.

This was a plus and gave Writer\/Director, Tim Burton, a running head start on the project.The tongue in cheek,CampHumor approach could also be problematical and was not going to be used in these big budget blockbusters.And, yet, Adam West's Scout's Honor,super Straight Shooter approach to the Batman personality was strong in people's minds.

He played Humbert Humbert in Adrian Lyne's Lolita (1997) and the creepy Dr. Claus Von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune (1990). Here he gets to play two creepy guys. One is named Beverly. Now I ask you, if you had twins boys and you named one of them Elliot and the other Beverly, what did you have in mind? Dead Ringer is an old title. There are a number of movies by that name (IMDb lists four; this one of course is Dead Ringers), and clearly the titles suggest twins. Genevieve Bujold plays Claire Niveau, a celebrated actress who has a fertility problem and a great desire to have children. Elly and Bev are gynecologists who work with barren women in more ways than one. She becomes Elliot's or Beverly's patient. She has an extraordinary uterus, which they explore--I know, I know, this is pretty funny in a sick sort of way. The movie in fact is sort of sick but not funny--at least not intentionally. But it is interesting--appalling but interesting.Anyway, Claire has the obligatory affair with both of them without realizing that there are two of them. They do the doctor thing with kinky sex and pills. At one point she begins to get the idea that Dr. Mantle is a bit--she calls him schizophrenic, which is, of course, for all you shrinks out there, a bit of a misnomer for what she means. Yes, one is nice and one is not so nice, one is slick with woman and the other isn't, one is commanding and the other isn't, and yes it gets more complex than that by quite a bit. They are like siamese twins joined with a long umbilical cord.The problem for our boys, who have played this game with women many times before, is that Bev, who is always taking (you know what kind of) seconds actually falls in love with Claire. And she with him. And she knows the difference, once she finds out that there are two of them. And she is not pleased.I've already perhaps said too much, but this is the setup, and it is familiar. How it works out is really the key to this movie. Irons is very good and so is Bujold of course. Both are professional actors with a lot of experience. Claire is a feisty kind of character, primitive in some ways, but ultra sophisticated in others. And very vulnerable, pathetically so it would seem. However, she is also strong. A nice contrast that gives Bujold ample range to show off her talent.David Cronenberg, AKA the King of Venereal Horror, directs. He has a history of serving up violence as a means of seducing the mass audience. Here he foreshadows something to come with something like forceps and other scary-looking steel instruments illustrated on the screen as the opening credits roll. Frankly I feel the pain and I don't even have a uterus.I was able to watch until Bev, now a pill-popping menace, about 95 minutes in, grabs the surgical steel instruments that he designed for use on a mutant woman's body, jabs them into his coat and pants pockets on his way to a rendezvous with his beloved Claire, she of the triple uterus. That was enough. Knowing Cronenberg's love of blood-splattered violence, I ejected the DVD.But you might, at your own risk, watch the ending. I've got a feeling that the title Dead Ringers involves a pun. You can send me a note telling me happens. Or not. Preferably not.Jeremy Irons gets to exceed the range of most actors even over their lifetime in this one film, and he does it very well.

That was enough. Knowing Cronenberg's love of blood-splattered violence, I ejected the DVD.But you might, at your own risk, watch the ending. I've got a feeling that the title Dead Ringers involves a pun. You can send me a note telling me happens. Or not. Preferably not.Jeremy Irons gets to exceed the range of most actors even over their lifetime in this one film, and he does it very well. If you're a big Jeremy Irons fan, you wouldn't want to miss this. Otherwise, I suggest the Disney channel, quickly.

So it's nice to see an addition to the pantheon of detective murder mysteries with an inventive addition to its loose formula - the lead character, sent from Las Angeles to Alaska to investigate the murder of a young girl is unable to sleep for many days in a row, and begins to doubt his own judgment, and eventually sanity. This slight tweaking of the formula is what makes Christopher Nolan's Insomnia all the more compelling - a particularly captivating and thought provoking take on the genre. If there is a single current director who has been able to generate a steady quantity of relentlessly impressive work with no sign of a decrease in quality, it's Christopher Nolan, whose credentials include the fantastic Memento, Batman Begins and The Prestige. While Insomnia is by no means Nolan's strongest work, that's not to say that it isn't still a compelling and captivating film, and Nolan demonstrates his usual flair for pouring genuine cinematic heart and soul into his film, rising it above the ranks of would be imitations. Nolan shows an uncanny eye for selecting effective settings and locations for his story, and the vast, barren template of Alaska is a perfect choice for the quiet yet turbulent investigation. The use of the insomnia effect for Pacino's character proves particularly effective, as the audience shares in the character's extreme disorientation through blurry camera work and lightening quick editing, capturing a surprisingly accurate cinematic portrayal of the character's dangerous sleep deprivation. While the screenplay, adapted from the original Norwegian film and composed by newcomer screenwriter Hillary Seitz, does allow for the occasional very powerful and emotional moment, for the most part, the film's script is what ultimately prevents the film from becoming a true classic - the dialogue coming across as a touch too contrived and clunky to make for a fully satisfying work. It's a small complaint though, and the film does boast a genuinely unpredictable ending, and enough satisfying moments to overcompensate for the occasional clunky bit. The film also boasts some very succinct and to the point cinematography, shot mainly in close ups of the leading characters talking, and surprisingly rapid fire editing cuts, creating a feeling which does succeed in being deliberately disorienting, adding to the feeling of unease created throughout, though the editing does toe the line of becoming distracting at times. Altogether, the atmosphere created in the film is superb, perfectly complimenting the ominous murder mystery storyline. The always reliable Al Pacino is in familiar territory as beaten down yet determined detective Will Dormer, yet he is allowed to flex his dramatic muscles more here than in a more standard variation of the role. In particular, Pacino demonstrates particular skill in portraying a man suffering from chronic insomnia, culminating in a powerful and affecting leading performance. Robin Williams gives an intriguing and very strong performance, playing strongly against type and arguably stealing the show as the ominous lead suspect for the murder case. The only real casting misfire is Hillary Swank, whose character comes across as simply unnecessary for the most part of the film, and Swank's performance doesn't help - her earnest upcoming cop generally comes across simply as irritating rather than idealistic and passionate. Character actor Martin Donovan also gives a potent performance as Dormer's partner, who is also sent down to investigate the murder. All things considered, Insomnia comes across as a mostly fresh and innovative entry into the near exhausted genre of police murder mystery. Fueled by strong performances from Pacino and Williams, and the relentlessly classy directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, it's easy to overlook the occasional script stumbles, making for an entertaining, tense, and thought provoking film easily worth a look. -8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2007","score":"","review":" Crime thrillers are becoming increasingly popular in today's movie industry, to the point where each new entry seems almost redundant - we've seen this story before.

Although his playing of Terry Malloy was indeed Oscar caliber stuff, the award was really for a most remarkable body of work on screen up to that time. It was also for setting a new trend in acting style and influencing the next three generations of players.On the Waterfront is also alleged to be Elia Kazan's answer to his critics of why he was a namer of names at the House Un-American Activities Committee. I don't think it was an accident that the subject of this film was labor racketeering. Forgotten by a lot of the people who defame Kazan today is that the Communist Party asked him to infiltrate and spy on not just actors, but various craft unions associated with film and theater. It was something he never forget.He's often called a friendly witness. To me a friendly witness is someone who was an unabashed admirer of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its work, someone like Adolphe Menjou or Hedda Hopper or even John Wayne, people who were convinced these people were doing a patriotic service. In On the Waterfront, labor racketeer Lee J. Cobb, a bullying loudmouth of a man, runs the longshoreman's local. He commits murder, extortion, and various other crimes at will without fear of reprisal because no one will talk because of their code against informing. Waterfront priest Karl Malden realizes it, but bangs his head against the code of deaf and dumb.Marlon Brando is a washed up ex-prizefighter who finds work on the docks through his older brother Rod Steiger who works for Cobb. Unknowingly he fingers Eva Marie Saint's brother for a hit and then he falls for her. The film is essentially Brando's struggle to find out what the right thing to do in this situation.When he's on the screen Brando dominates. He invests the character of Terry Malloy with a lot of layers and the audience really struggles with Terry in his soul searching. He starts to see Cobb and to a lesser extent his brother Steiger as more exploitive than helpful even in his own life. That famous taxi scene with Steiger who's got his own life on the line if he doesn't get his brother away from Eva Marie is one where it all comes out. Brando got his ticket to Palookaville and he doesn't like the neighborhood at all.Eva Marie Saint got a Best Supporting Actress in her film debut. She's pretty far from later characters she played like the cool blond of Cary Grant's dreams in North By Northwest. Those were more the roles she played in her career than the working class girl of On the Waterfront.Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, and Rod Steiger all were nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category and they wound up splitting the vote and allowing Edmond O'Brien to win for The Barefoot Contessa. The other nominee was Tom Tully in The Caine Mutiny. All three could have been winners.I remember when Elia Kazan died a few years ago and I think the unkindest cut of all for him was to be eulogized on television by Pat Buchanan. Though the left disowned him, he always considered himself a man of the left. One could fight injustice without submitting to a regimentation of the soul that Communism was when it triumphed. Something a lot don't realize today. The regimentation that Lee J. Cobb had on those longshoremen is what Kazan was expressing himself against in On the Waterfront. over fifty years later it's a landmark expression. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2007","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" After three nominations for Best Actor in 1951 for A Streetcar Named Desire, 1952 for Viva Zapata, and 1953 for Julius Caesar, the Oscar was not to be denied Marlon Brando for the fourth time. Although his playing of Terry Malloy was indeed Oscar caliber stuff, the award was really for a most remarkable body of work on screen up to that time. It was also for setting a new trend in acting style and influencing the next three generations of players.On the Waterfront is also alleged to be Elia Kazan's answer to his critics of why he was a namer of names at the House Un-American Activities Committee. I don't think it was an accident that the subject of this film was labor racketeering. Forgotten by a lot of the people who defame Kazan today is that the Communist Party asked him to infiltrate and spy on not just actors, but various craft unions associated with film and theater. It was something he never forget.He's often called a friendly witness. To me a friendly witness is someone who was an unabashed admirer of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its work, someone like Adolphe Menjou or Hedda Hopper or even John Wayne, people who were convinced these people were doing a patriotic service. In On the Waterfront, labor racketeer Lee J. Cobb, a bullying loudmouth of a man, runs the longshoreman's local. He commits murder, extortion, and various other crimes at will without fear of reprisal because no one will talk because of their code against informing. Waterfront priest Karl Malden realizes it, but bangs his head against the code of deaf and dumb.Marlon Brando is a washed up ex-prizefighter who finds work on the docks through his older brother Rod Steiger who works for Cobb. Unknowingly he fingers Eva Marie Saint's brother for a hit and then he falls for her. The film is essentially Brando's struggle to find out what the right thing to do in this situation.When he's on the screen Brando dominates. He invests the character of Terry Malloy with a lot of layers and the audience really struggles with Terry in his soul searching. He starts to see Cobb and to a lesser extent his brother Steiger as more exploitive than helpful even in his own life. That famous taxi scene with Steiger who's got his own life on the line if he doesn't get his brother away from Eva Marie is one where it all comes out. Brando got his ticket to Palookaville and he doesn't like the neighborhood at all.Eva Marie Saint got a Best Supporting Actress in her film debut. She's pretty far from later characters she played like the cool blond of Cary Grant's dreams in North By Northwest. Those were more the roles she played in her career than the working class girl of On the Waterfront.Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, and Rod Steiger all were nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category and they wound up splitting the vote and allowing Edmond O'Brien to win for The Barefoot Contessa. The other nominee was Tom Tully in The Caine Mutiny. All three could have been winners.I remember when Elia Kazan died a few years ago and I think the unkindest cut of all for him was to be eulogized on television by Pat Buchanan. Though the left disowned him, he always considered himself a man of the left. One could fight injustice without submitting to a regimentation of the soul that Communism was when it triumphed.
