Cards on the table, I preferred the TV M.A.S.H. to the movie version and didn't laugh once during the original movie. This off-beat western with A-list casting sort of missed me too. Multi-layered, my TV guide said, well I couldn't get through the top crust. Yes it was well shot, in mostly natural light and Altman creates a beautiful snowy tableau for McCabe's demise but where was the story? Perhaps I wasn't comfortable with the depiction of women in the film, Julie Christie apart, as good-for-one-thing whores. There was little humour to leaven the seedy subject matter and just so little narrative drive about the piece. If it was about the supposed love affair between Warren Beatty's McCabe and Christie's Mrs Miller, I didn't get that either. Was it maybe about little-town ideals being corrupted by big business? I don't know, I found watching it that whole minutes had gone by without anything notable happening and having to concentrate to stay interested. I also found the movie very poorly dubbed - I'm British and I still found much of what Christie said to be unintelligible with the rest of the mostly male cast slurring or mumbling their words too. There was a lot of indiscriminate killing for little reason that I could see and little drama or excitement to savour. Perhaps I should watch it again and try harder to absorb its layers but to be truthful, I doubt I'd get much past 20 minutes.

These serious films can run from the masterful like The Color Purple or Schindler's List (despite a few missteps in its final moments) to overrated misfires (The Empire of the Sun). SPR falls squarely in the overrated, mediocre category. Oscar voters actually made the correct decision in passing it over for the Best Picture Oscar.The opening moments - depicting the Normandy landing - are impressive. Unfortunately, the film loses that momentum the moment its story kicks in. For one thing, no one is rooting for a mission that takes these men into danger for what is basically a rather asinine publicity stunt. While it is true that the U.S. Armed Forces did attempt to return home men whose siblings had all died serving their country to avoid wiping out an entire generation of a family, this was done by sending word to that soldier's unit of his planned extraction and then doing so at a convenient moment. Entire platoons were never sent on glorified rescue missions for low-level serviceman that placed large numbers of people at unnecessary risk. So the plot is largely preposterous.While there are a number of great war films that can get away with presenting types in place of three-dimensional characters, this film is not one of them. There is very little camaraderie among these men and they largely blur together. We know them less as individuals than by the types they are presented as - and none of them are truly able to break out of these constrictions. For instance, we identify them solely as the second in command, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the newbie coward, the medic, the sniper, the jerk.Incredibly for Spielberg, who usually features rich cinematography, this film is ugly to even look at. Everything is filmed in shades of gray, washed-out blue and dirt colors, often using a jittery hand-held camera for a you are there feel that functions more to generate either a headache or motion sickness rather than any sort of authenticity.Once the men start off on their mission, the story repeats the same steps over and over again. One of the men will reveal something minor about themselves (i.e., a personality trait) and then be brutally killed in the next scene in the most drawn-out agonizing way possible. Then the men will trudge forth, another man will reveal something, and then be eviscerated in the following scene. One could almost do a Lawrence Welk to this - And a one-a, and a two-a and BLAM! The predictability of the action becomes wearisome and the only suspense lies in figuring what manner of unspeakable demise will pop up next. Will it be a bloody gunshot wound or will someone be blasted apart with Spielberg uncharacteristically allowing the gore and body parts to drench the jitter-cam? This predictable nature also allows to realize exactly where the film is headed.For instance, if the film remains true to clichés, then once the surviving men meet Private Ryan, we anticipate that he will be a sunny all-American young man impossible to hate. We also anticipate that he will be a stand-up guy that will refuse to abandon the other members of his squadron in their hour of need, so that the surviving members of his rescue mission will be suitably impressed enough to stay to fight with them. When the diminished rescue party does reach him and be turns out to be Matt Damon, drawing out his biggest aw-shucks grin and practically oozing middle-American likability, you know the film has no surprise anywhere on its repertoire.The majority of the supporting cast could change their roles and no one would notice so little impact are they allowed to make and so few are the facets to their respective characters. Two exceptions that stand out (and not in a good way) are Jeremy Davies' absolute descent into pure ham with his breakdown on the stairs and Edward Burns' unintended utter obnoxiousness throughout the course of the film. Tom Hanks is likable as usual, but he is playing...Tom Hanks. Only this time, with a slight quiver to his hand to key us in on the toll this war is taking on him.By the time the film rolls into its final moments, it has been an exhausting, unpleasant viewing experience - or something misguided people like to pretend is powerful. Anyone with an iota of sense knows that war is hell, but that does not mean we want to pay to have it inflicted on us for nearly 3 hours without break. I think I finally had enough at the climax when one of the men held on to a grenade too long and literally blew apart - with all of the gore that implies. I stayed to the foregone conclusion, but I think I had shut off from that moment on.And a foregone conclusion it is since Spielberg rather strangely opens the film with the elderly living Ryan visiting Arlington cemetery and then closes it again with him in another one of his clumsy codas. I have no idea what to say when Ryan turns to his family and wonders if the men's sacrifice was all worth it. However, I do know that this film, despite its most ardent admirers should not be considered one the great war films ever made. For all of its patriotism and attempts at realism, for all its brutality and in-your-face approach, its story and characters are just not worth that amount of consideration.

The story, which involves Eastwood's cop and a star witness going on the run from both the police and the mob, seems to have inspired countless other action films from the '70s and '80s, but I didn't find it anything special about it. Instead the film seems to focus and revel in superficial, larger than life stunts and set-pieces while forgetting to give us much heart at its core. Hell, even Stallone's COBRA had more of a plot than this!Still, the movie isn't all bad and I found it difficult to really dislike. Eastwood and his love interest Sondra Locke were together in real life, so their chemistry is for real. The laughs, mostly stemming from Eastwood's deadpan humour and the bizarre situations in which he finds himself, are solid, and there are good supporting turns from actors including Pat Hingle and ex-peplum star Dan Vadis as a biker. The action scenes are impressive, although there's an overwhelming feel of macho overkill in scenes in which a house and bus are absolutely destroyed by hundreds of rounds. I would have preferred a more suspenseful and realistic feel to these sequences, but this is far from Eastwood's best as director.The lengthy motorbike-chased-by-helicopter sequence, for instance, requires an absolutely massive suspension of disbelief and has a too-obvious outcome on top of that. I've made THE GAUNTLET sound like a bad film, and it isn't, not really; the climax, for instance, is highly memorable and sets a new precedent in over-the-top showdowns.

The Best Years of Our Lives tells the moving story of three World War II veterans who return home from the war and realize that life has drastically changed since they left. They are forced to cope with the new lifestyle that they have been so far from, and resituate themselves in unfamiliar territory. The film paints a striking picture of post-war life for veterans. It is critical but remains patriotic and triumphant towards the issues it presents. I wouldn't call this a dark film, but it's no picnic either. It's a human film that brings to light the realism of the situation as best it can.The Best Years of Our Lives starts strong and then sort of goes downhill for me. It begins with tearful reunions as the three main characters return to their families who haven't seen them in so long. Changes in their lives are immediately noticed and addressed and one theme of post-war change is introduced after another. The beginning of the film does a fantastic job addressing these subtle things without outright saying them. There is a lot of room for interpretation in the beginning of the film that sets the stage for a deeply powerful film. The whole first hour of this three hour film wonderfully set up an intriguing set of ideals the film would address.

There are only 2 murders in this film, yet this film was the first slasher, which inspired John Carpenter's Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and a couple more. It's amazing thinking that this one movie did that all. I think this film probably has the most shocking ending in movie history. It freaked me out and I could only imagine how scary it must have been seeing it in a theater back in it's original 1960 release.

Altogether, Psycho is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, and I think it's probably my favorite film of his.

It isn't that the sixth Star Trek film isn't any good, on the contrary; it's moderately involving and makes fairly good use of what its biting off, but there is a clammy sense of emotional disassociation to proceedings; an episodic sense of people going through motions rather than undertaking an adventure and shipping off to exotic, creative, previously unseen locales to do battle with that which lies ahead. The Undiscovered Country is Star Trek by way of Tom Clancy; this is Alistair MacLean does spaceships, and yet in spite of this, it remains a difficult film to truly dislike out of its inherent ability to have us as involved as we are in this procession of injustice and races against time.The film will open with an instrumental score accompanying the opening titles, beginning somewhat quietly compared to the levels it will reach, before building and building into something rather sinister that appears to 'clash' with that of a more rousing; more triumphant element to the music wedged in there amongst proceedings. They clash for supremacy, and perhaps fittingly, the film will go on to document something rather rousing or triumphant, in the form of a peace process between rival inter-galactic species, that eventually comes under threat from a disturbing element of sabotage by certain other folk. After a huge explosion at an off-radar Klingon locale, which is eventually revealed as their chief energy source for life, the oft overly hostile aforementioned beings are forced into retiring their usual demeanour of aggression so as to forge some kind of bond with the more peaceful; more liberal United Federation of Planets, their long-standing enemy.Such news eventually reaches that of William Shatner's Starfleet Captain James Kirk; whom, along with most of his crew, are drafted into a top secret meeting prior to which faithful engineer Montgomerie Scott (Doohan) establishes some retirement plans he and the team had in mind. Disaster, in that regard, strikes; Kirk and co. are charged with heading out into space once more to rendez-vous with a chief Kligon ship so as to escort them back to Earth as it's revealed to him they're gunning for peace. Kirk is unamused; I suppose you would be if your mortal enemy for the duration of your career decided to run up the white flag on the eve of your permanent quitting time. Kirk, as it happens, despises the Klingon's and cannot care as to whether their kind is under threat from extinction; the film, we feel, missing a trick in putting Kirk through the wringer he goes through without allowing his opinions to change on such a stance when misestimation turns out to play a key role in the film.The film has some fun with the Enterprise's coming into contact with the Klingon crew, led by Christopher Plummer's wonderful General Chang a smirking; snarling villain with war scars all over his body, whom enjoys sizing himself up against Kirk. As warriors of space, he of the physicality of warfare, Kirk's prowess lying with that brilliant mind of his and their primary clashing is good value. The initial alienation between the crews are evident in Uhura's (Nichols) comment of Guess who's coming to dinner, a line that, with McCoy's (Kelley) take on Klingon's as .....all look(ing) alike to me imbues proceedings with a certain sense of racial tension.

It isn't that the sixth Star Trek film isn't any good, on the contrary; it's moderately involving and makes fairly good use of what its biting off, but there is a clammy sense of emotional disassociation to proceedings; an episodic sense of people going through motions rather than undertaking an adventure and shipping off to exotic, creative, previously unseen locales to do battle with that which lies ahead. The Undiscovered Country is Star Trek by way of Tom Clancy; this is Alistair MacLean does spaceships, and yet in spite of this, it remains a difficult film to truly dislike out of its inherent ability to have us as involved as we are in this procession of injustice and races against time.The film will open with an instrumental score accompanying the opening titles, beginning somewhat quietly compared to the levels it will reach, before building and building into something rather sinister that appears to 'clash' with that of a more rousing; more triumphant element to the music wedged in there amongst proceedings. They clash for supremacy, and perhaps fittingly, the film will go on to document something rather rousing or triumphant, in the form of a peace process between rival inter-galactic species, that eventually comes under threat from a disturbing element of sabotage by certain other folk. After a huge explosion at an off-radar Klingon locale, which is eventually revealed as their chief energy source for life, the oft overly hostile aforementioned beings are forced into retiring their usual demeanour of aggression so as to forge some kind of bond with the more peaceful; more liberal United Federation of Planets, their long-standing enemy.Such news eventually reaches that of William Shatner's Starfleet Captain James Kirk; whom, along with most of his crew, are drafted into a top secret meeting prior to which faithful engineer Montgomerie Scott (Doohan) establishes some retirement plans he and the team had in mind. Disaster, in that regard, strikes; Kirk and co. are charged with heading out into space once more to rendez-vous with a chief Kligon ship so as to escort them back to Earth as it's revealed to him they're gunning for peace. Kirk is unamused; I suppose you would be if your mortal enemy for the duration of your career decided to run up the white flag on the eve of your permanent quitting time. Kirk, as it happens, despises the Klingon's and cannot care as to whether their kind is under threat from extinction; the film, we feel, missing a trick in putting Kirk through the wringer he goes through without allowing his opinions to change on such a stance when misestimation turns out to play a key role in the film.The film has some fun with the Enterprise's coming into contact with the Klingon crew, led by Christopher Plummer's wonderful General Chang a smirking; snarling villain with war scars all over his body, whom enjoys sizing himself up against Kirk. As warriors of space, he of the physicality of warfare, Kirk's prowess lying with that brilliant mind of his and their primary clashing is good value. The initial alienation between the crews are evident in Uhura's (Nichols) comment of Guess who's coming to dinner, a line that, with McCoy's (Kelley) take on Klingon's as .....all look(ing) alike to me imbues proceedings with a certain sense of racial tension.

Usually, Grisham doesn't appeal to me as I usually steer well clear of courtroom dramas and thrillers alike. But after being persuaded into reading the book which I thought was pretty good and didn't give me a headache like most thriller's and cat-and-mouse chase novels do, I watched another Grisham adaptation A Time to Kill starring Samuel L. Jackson and I really enjoyed it so I decided to give The Client a try. A big reason for watching it, apart from being mercilessly persuaded into it by someone all week, was to see a very young Brad Renfro (I think he was only twelve years-old) in his film debut. Renfro tragically died three years ago from a drug overdose, and I became a fan of him after his powerful and uncompromising performance in the Larry Clarke film Bully.Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) and his little brother Ricky live alone in relative poverty with their mother Dianne in a trailer park in the deep South. Mark and Ricky head out to play and smoke in the woods surrounding the trailer park when they come upon an important lawyer who is about to gas himself to death. Mark tries to stop him but ends up being taken into the car with the man, who tells Mark something about the location of a body that the FBI are trying to find. The lawyers's client is a crazy gangster who told him the location. The man shoots himself, and Ricky is traumatised from this and slips into some kind of coma. The FBI come after Mark, along with a prosecuting attorney (Tommy Lee Jones) to try and get it out of him where the body is buried, but Mark is afraid to tell them in case the thugs who are intimidating him kill him and his family. He enlists the help of a lawyer called Reggie Love, who used to be an alcoholic, to defend him and try and make him safe from the gangsters and the FBI.Without a doubt, the best thing about this film is Brad Renfro's performance. I can't believe this was his film debut. He was magnificent, but unfortunately, he would grow up into a troubled teenager with drug problems and would eventually grow up into a depressed young man as a result before he over-dosed at the young age of just twenty five. Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones also provide excellent performances, especially Tommy Lee Jones in a performance which stands out as him at his prominent best. Anthony LaPaglia is notable in a manic performance as 'The Blade'. The Client is a pretty good film but my low-rating is possibly just down to my tendency to never really find this kind of films enjoyable. I just find them heavy-handed in their political views, extremely predictable and boring.

I first saw 2001 A Space Odyssey in high school and did not think much of it. Returning to it some years later, it is like I am seeing a whole different film. While I do think it went above my head the first time, I do not think that I understand it any better now, but HAL's statement above ironically rings truer now than it did back then.The four different acts (depending on how you count them, I guess) blend together perfectly and are all quite riveting. The opening part with the apes, which I found rather puzzling the first time around, makes for a necessary transition into the rest of the film, given the final act. The two center acts, which more closely resemble a traditional science fiction, about some astronauts investigating a strange discovery in space, are absolutely thrilling, and the final act is almost mind-bending.There is something meticulous, intense, and distinctly Kubrickian about the way many scenes unfold. The technical perfection is present throughout the entire film, but this is something that particularly struck me during the section within the spaceship, where Kubrick prolong scenes and individual shots until they almost get a different meaning, or at least tell more than they initially did; just look at Dr. Bowman's face during the scenes inside the pod. Maybe it is only by association of the music, but I think that many of the wordless segments, which are allowed to take their time and are never rushed, yet never dragging, play out almost like a symphony of their own, or at least an extension of The Blue Danube, among other pieces.While the film works extremely well at face value, there seems to be a lot going on below the surface as well. First, there is HAL, who seems like a symbol for the cold and rational, which is something I recognize from much of Kubrick's filmmaking. It is only natural, then, that his demise, which is both tragic and disturbing, and, also ironically, one of the most human moments of the film, makes way for the if not irrational, then at least irregular final act, that goes even further beyond traditional narration &#x96; beyond infinity if you will. And again, on a surface level it is one of the most visually stunning segments I have seen.Then there is the monolith, which seems to be a symbol for the unknown, mysterious and perhaps evolutionary. The sun towering above it is a striking image, and in the end, shortly after the monolith is last seen, it feels like the viewer is thrown into something completely new, perhaps the future, which is the perfect way to close an odyssey that has already spanned from the dawn of man to present time.

The point is that so many more people feel it's classic, rather than crap.The pacing of Citizen Kane is quite deliberate, in order to peel back the many clues needed to answer the mystery of the last words made by Charles Foster Kane, a recluse newspaper magnate in the mansion that sits among darkness and decay, similar to his very legacy. An investigative reporter is given the task to discover the meaning of Rosebud, exhaled in a whisper of Kane's final breath. I enjoyed how the mystery of Rosebud unfolded, especially with regard to the film's surprising climax. All of those characters left behind to (oft-times, begrudgingly) give their accounts of how Kane influenced their lives, as Kane's quest for fairness succumbed to his thirst for power. The style of storytelling was ground-breaking in its time, as Kane's persona emerged through the performance of Orson Welles and the Mercury Players, who helped put together a fitting, brilliant, and outstanding ending. Make sure to spot Nat King Cole's film debut, playing the piano at the night club.

Blissfully oblivious to the dangers lurking in the dark, one couple passes time playing piano and dancing. An idyllic image is pretty quickly shattered as some ghost or other monster (most likely, the one lurking in the dark) shatters the window glass and kidnaps the girl. After literally several seconds, the poor and innocent creature is transformed into a zombie and throws herself at her frightened-to-death boyfriend. Fortunately, playing the piano is only one of many of his talents. The guy takes a shovel and cuts off the zombie-girlfriend's head. (That is a razor-edged shovel, mind you.) Then, before the evil force also turns him into a zombie, the sun comes up and drives the evil away in an almost cleansing-the-soul moment. The guy is safe&#x85; for one scene.This atmospheric opening is but a taste of what follows. What's in store for us is lotsa incantations, otherworldly monsters, screaming chicks, zombie-mothers and ghost-fathers, and, on top of that, like a cherry on a cupcake, there is a chainsaw! When the couple from the opening, Ash (Bruce Campbell) and Linda (Denise Bixler), play a weird recording, they hear incantations read by a Professor Raymond Knowby. The recording summons up some evil creatures from another world\/dimension\/afterlife (choose the correct). What the professor reads are the passages from Necronomicon (rings any bells, HPL fans out there?). Any child knows you never read from Necronimicon out loud, dah! And you most certainly don't record it! (The professor should be renamed Knownot, not Knowby.) By the time things start to make twisted sense to Ash, there enters another four characters.

I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part.

That aspect being lost, the film could now only concentrate on the other thought experiment threads, such as the stunted development of the kids' language and world knowledge.This is done minimally but interestingly Em (Brooke Shields) and Richard (Christopher Atkins) can only sing snatches (oh, don't say 'snatch'!) of Christmas carols; they are not imbeciles, yet since third grade they have not been taught anything new or been exposed to other people, so their language is basic; his prayers interchange words from The Lord's Prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance; their superstitions about god are simplistic. Yet after all is said and done - matter of fact, while it is being said and done - all we can think of (as animals built to procreate, whether the censors believe that or not) is getting out the coconuts and clams.The notion that a film about two naked youngsters growing up on a tropical paradise and having it be about anything BUT sex is ludicrous. Ironically, those humans who consider Nature's course as prurient or perverse - are the deviants.Hundreds of thousands of years ago, our primate ancestors mated without guilt; a natural process that would continue their genetic code; a code that created a proclivity for continuance, expressed in the form of sexual lust. It was not perverse or prurient or wrong. In fact it was RIGHT. The more our primate ancestors were in heat the more our species flourished. Yet if BLUE LAGOON were made in a naturalistic or realistic manner, it would be considered soft porn, which is supposedly perverse. So though the film is a constant tumescent promise of sex between two teen models, due to the actual perversity of the censors (in stultifying Nature) it cannot possibly deliver on any level that would satisfy (oh, don't say 'satisfy'!) its target audience of 15-year-old boys with unbidden rock hard... imaginations.Of which I was one. Though it may seem like a joke, imagination is the bane of the censors, for they can stultify all they want, but we would still take from the film the fantasies for future bathroom visits. All I remember of this period in my life (oh! Don't say 'period'!) is discussing this movie's merits rapturously with my friends - how at certain angles one could actually see bush and bosoms! I imagine the mirror version of our lascivious critique was taking place in the girls' camp (yes, tweens, lots of bare-butt blond Christopher and many underwater shots of swimming penis).And that's about it for the merits. Besides the luxurious cinematography of the tropical isle, the distracted focus of this movie is on how the two kids actually get around to doing it - without the education of society or the taunting of peers or the knowledge of what doing it might result in, i.e. a high maintenance girlfriend. How would they come to the realization that to satiate their groaning loins they would eventually have to perform a natural act that has been painted as unnatural in civilized society? And thus are we bored to tears with red herring foreplay, unimaginative acting, dark angles and pasting Brooke Shields's hair over her flat chest like it's something fantastic that has to be guarded by Green Lantern.After a few years on the island (while a guy who looks like Samuel Clemens sails the seas with a telescope and a lawn chair seeking them) the teens arc from desperately wanting to leave the island to enjoying their isolated idyll with their baby. (Richard asks, Why did you have a baby, Em? I don't know, which is one of the interesting thought experiment elements how would kids equate sexual intercourse with babies if they are never told and have no peers to compare sex-to-birth causalities?)Thirty years after seeing THE BLUE LAGOON I would discover it was a remake of a 1949 movie starring Jean Simmons. If the 1980 version is so Victorian in its begrudging angles and snatches of body-double breast, I shudder to imagine the prudishness of that earlier movie. Let me guess 20-somethings playing teens, soft-focus closeups, flesh-crawling romance where there should be animalistic discovery of sexual intercourse, the teens supposedly falling in love before they actually have sex... and erogenous zones as judiciously eradicated as in the 1980 remake to stultify prurience in the 15-year-old boys of the day.So many viewers of the 1949 film laud it as a classic because they were youngsters when they first saw it. Well, I first saw the 1980 version when I was but a teen masturbatory machine yet at no point in my life did I ever consider it some kind of classic. Personally, I'd subtitle it BALLS OF FURY.
