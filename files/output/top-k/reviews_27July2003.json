Colonel responsible for some accidental deaths during a tank battle in the Gulf War. The experience leaves him feeling pretty lousy. He neglects his family and begins drinking. He's assigned to investigate the suitability of Meg Ryan as a posthumous recipient of the Medal of Honor. She was flying a medevac helicopter to a crash site when her aircraft was shot down by small arms fire and, apparently, she stayed behind voluntarily and ordered her crew to save themselves while she covered them. Washington interviews the crew members and gets different stories. In one story Ryan behaves heroically as described. In a second, she is a coward and collapses under fire. In yet a third, the truth emerges. Yeah, it's Rashomon, but not as original or subtle.Still it's pretty good. And, Gott sei dank, it is not a story in which a woman proves herself as a good as a man, despite the fact that she is a member of the weaker sex. (What condescension.) Meg Ryan is a capable and courageous officer who happens to be a woman. Her sex is important to the politicians who are positively drooling over the prospect of awarding her the decoration, but isn't really important to the narrative.The performances are better than I'd expected. Everyone, in fact, is quite good in their different ways. Matt Damon, in particular, gives a sensitive performance as a guilt-ridden medic, and looks the part, somewhat ascetic, his facial features askew with uncertainty. Meg Ryan doesn't have a chance to do more than shout orders with a Texas accent but she registers pain and determination well. Lou Diamond Phillips is perhaps the least articulated character, but that may be the fault of the role as written, which is fairly complex but a little obvious. Denzel Washington is the central figure. He's good as carrying that burden of guilt left over from his battlefield mistake but isn't too convincing as a drunk. In the end, he relieves himself of some of that torture by visiting the parents of one of the men he had killed and confessing his part in the incident. The first few times I saw this I kept thinking what some other actors would have done with this scene, but the last time I found his incarnate remorse rather moving. The battle scenes are well done, although a little confusing, as I'm sure they would have been at the time. Some generic conventions are adhered to. Four of our guys can slaughter dozens of them. The enemy runs headlong into a hail of bullets. But there are some interesting twists given to the situation. The Iraqis on the other side of the hill can be heard laughing at our boys (and our woman). And the ending is revisionist, but I won't go into it. Justice outs, let's say that.It's a worthwhile watch for any number of reasons. Craftsmanlike if not poetic.

When I started it I was put off by the corny acting and horrid cheap effects in the first 10 minutes or so and wondered `wtf have I taped?', but I stuck with it.  Once the viewing of `This Island Earth' starts, then the film really picks up.  It only drops when the viewers leave the cinema and pick up some sort of plot of trying to pilot their ship back to earth.For information I don't think This Island Earth is that good a film, but I certainly don't think it is the worst or cheesiest of the many sci-fi films made in the period, but it is certainly an easy target for the film.  To describe this movie, it can only be thought of as an evening in with friends, beer and wise cracks.  Basically the viewers sit and wise crack all the way through it.  If you are a fan of This Island Earth then it is probably akin to being in hell, but for everyone else it seems quite funny.I admit that the idea of people talking all the way through a film is unappealing to me but, once I got into the mood, I couldn't stop laughing. It is all very silly and I can see why this film never made it to UK cinemas (and took 7 years to reach UK tv) but it is funny.  And, because it is scripted, the wise cracks know what is coming and can be based on that! If you like silly smart-assed humour then this is for you, otherwise it is probably best avoided.  For me I loved it and will watch it again simply for the line where Exeter says `our people are looking for leading scientists' only to have one of the robots blurt out `you know any' - and other silly lines.While none of this sounds great, I was kept laughing simply because the jokes keep coming all the way through it - even though some miss the next one is never far off.  The effect of watching a film with a running commentary seems annoying but most of us will have done it on DVD.

The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that Resident Evil is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and mad at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch The Fast and the Furious.

The acting and dialogue are off kilter, and the overall production of the film borders on TV movie of the week. But it's Mamet, he wrote Glen Gary, and so it cannot be dismissed out of hand. This man is far too great a writer to put all these ridiculous plot holes in for no reason.Then there's the beautiful Rebecca Pidgeon's performance.  She is so utterly fascinating that it's impossible to take your eyes off her. She steals every scene she's in, and makes you crave for her in the ones she's absent from (hence the three viewings). She had the same effect on me in State and Main. I think I'm in love. Steve Martin will blow you away as well.Overall this movie is certainly worth a viewing.  Love it or hate it, you'll be intrigued, and one way or another you'll feel a bit paranoid.

However, the rather flimsy and implausable reason given for Myers' 'resurrection' is by no means the most offensive flaw in the film. No, that would be the casting of rapper Busta Rhymes. Playing a cunning internet entrepeuner who plans to show a live webcast of a group of students exploring the house where Michael lived as a child, Rhymes displays a complete lack of talent and ability to act. The inclusion of a rap icon proved successful with LLCoolJ in H20 - who brought humour to the role and provided the script with a carefully limited dose of comedic value. However, Rhymes is annoying, loud and very rarely talks in comprehensible sentences. He gurns his way through the film, performs an embarrassing display of martial arts against Myers, and generally smacks of the producers attempting to include as many aspects into the film that they deem popular with the audience - thus gaining maximum box-office returns.It has been clear that producer Moustapha Akkad sees the series as nothing more than a sure-fire way to pay the mortgage, but never has it been so evident as in 'Resurrection'. Without giving anything away, the first ten minutes of the film are completely unnecessary and poorly executed, leaving what should be the series' most poignant sequence looking like the most amateurish and embarrassing; in what is supposed to be a steady tracking shot down a corridor, the camera actually wobbles.Rick Rosenthal (who more than competently handled 'Halloween 2') however, can not be entirely blamed for the film's downfall. The script is uningaging and often embarrassing and sorely missing any of the psycho-babble that Donald Pleasance used to spout in the previous films. That - the only adult or intelligent aspect of the previous films which set the Halloween series apart from its evil cousin 'Friday the 13th'- has now completely disappeared, replaced with a focus on a bland, indistinguishable group of teenagers being methodically buthchered in 'inventive' ways.However, the film does manage to create a few moments of well crafted suspense. Although the whole intenet aspect is a naff attempt to bring the series into the 21st century (previously failing in 'My Little Eye'), the sequence where one of the characters must follow instuctions from an internet user who can watch Michael's every move is genuinely tense. For a moment. The final scenes are also well carried out - were it not for the presence of Busta Rhymes. The setting of the house proves to be quite spooky at times, although when it is realised that all the scary artifacts from Michael's childhood have merely been set up, any potential for an exploration of Michael's evil is immediately lost.Of course , for general horror fans, 'Resurrection' will still prove entertaining, though not at all on the same levels as the first two outings or H20, but for die-hard fans of the series, the half-hearted execution of (practically every aspect of) the film (even the music is dire) and undoing of the perfect conclusion to the series in H20, will cause serious frustration.

One only has to mention 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for it to be seen that he is a director who has made a massive impact on the horror genre. Both movies had large followings and produced characters that will be long remembered. Creating characters that become icons within a genre is difficult and Craven has produced two. Not only is it because the material is so original, it is also because Craven uses a talented cast who appeal to present day audiences. He is able to blend classic horror, that is, the bogeyman with the mask who stalks the main characters from the shadows, with the window dressing provided by photogenic actors and actresses which is obligatory for today's movies. In effect he has made horror movies appealing to mass audiences &#150; something that only the very best could do. This has been accomplished by way of numerous means. As previously mentioned, the cast - window dressing - are usually fresh, bright, young talent. They can act. There is also a story of note. The central characters are all engrossed in conflict with each other and this is not only due to the fact that the characters have been created with a lot of personality differences, but also because they are given real dilemmas. A good example is in 'Scream' where Sydney is struggling to come to emotional terms with her mother's death and she then also has to deal with Gale Weathers who questions the legitimacy of her testimony which put away the main suspect. She also has to deal with her mother's promiscuity. This is a great basis for conflict and has a high degree of believability. In the hands of two good actresses, it enhanced the movies plot.The suspense is of such a high level, that you could argue the fact that this movie leans more towards suspense thriller rather than horror. Although it is argumentative, I believe that this movie is still rightfully classified as horror rather than suspense since the suspense is a catalyst for the horror. The suspense sets us up for the horrific scenes. The suspense thus provides a service rather that it being the recipient of a service.In accordance with present day adaptations of teenagers on screen, they are insightful with understandings of relationships, but not the emotional maturity to deal with them. This is well used within 'Scream' as the main characters have insight into the 'rules' of horror movies, but still put themselves at risk for the climatic sequence where they are secluded and vulnerable although probably feeling safe in numbers.Neve Campbell is excellent as the fragile Sydney Prescott. She has an extremely fragile way of speaking which makes her more vulnerable to the villain. She aptly portrays the emotional turmoil which seems to sap her characters strength. Her ability to show the dilemma concerning her testimony towards Cotton Weary aids in the audience acceptance of her trusting of her boyfriend - would she be able to deal with another questionable accusation?  Given her portrayal, we think not.Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard are equally commendable. Ulrich does not get too offbeat when his characters true intentions are shown. This keeps the transition more plausible. Lillard remains as over the top as he was before which thus keeps his character consistent and hence believable. They were the best villains of the franchise and were a healthy contributing factor to the first movies success and its reputation, earned quite correctly, as the superior.You could not comment on 'Scream' without mentioning Kevin Williamson. He is the one who after all provided the seed for the most successful horror movie. Although he penned a few of the movies that followed on the success of this one, this is still the gem. The audience is kept guessing throughout and suspects are numerous meaning that some members of the audience may have changed their minds on several occasions as to who the villain is. Who guessed that there were two of them? Not many, of that I am very sure. There is ample plot here to keep attention as well as multi - layered conflict. This gave a new dimension to the slasher flick and redefined the genre for the 90's.This movie is not reverential of the genre. It rather pokes fun at the 'rules' that moviemakers kept to in order to operate within the genre.

Now it seems like even people who admired him at first are suddenly forfeiting their compliments and jumping on the bandwagon, along with the rest of the Costner haters.  Well, I'm not gonna jump on that bandwagon.  This movie is sheer proof that Costner is a wonderful actor capable of playing characters of multiple dimensions.  Here, he's given the challenge of playing a likable villain, without having us forget that he has criminal tendencies.  I'm not condoning criminals, but do you honestly think every criminal in the world is a cold-blooded motherf***er with not a single scruple?  They're human beings like everyone else, only they choose to live dishonest lives.  In other words, the easy way out--at least that's what they think.  Costner played a completely one-dimensional villain in 3,000 Miles to Graceland, but it was fitting to the tone of that film, which plays out like a comic book fantasy.  His character of Butch is much more realistic, and his main scruple is treating children like dirt.  He himself was treated like dirt as a child, and whenever he sees mothers or fathers do the same to their children, he goes nuts and sometimes homicidal.  A very interesting character, which Costner plays to absolute perfection. I have a theory about movies.  Whenever you have an adult story (excluding children's and family-oriented material) involving a child in a major role, the movie often turns out either good or great.  This one turned out great.  Good movies come more often than you think.  Great movies don't come quite that often.  A real motion picture experience is when you get lost in the story to the point where you feel you're right there with the characters, and not sitting on your couch watching these characters on a TV screen.  This is one of those experiences.  The film is totally character-driven, which also appeals to me.  It took me a journey through the lives of Butch and the young boy.  I felt a deep connection to each of them.  The ending had me pouring with tears. I have to give it up for Clint Eastwood, who usually scores behind and in front of the camera.  The film runs a little over 2 hours, but when you have solid characters like these the time flies by in a snap.  Hell, Corky Romano was under 90 minutes long and I may as well as have been watching it for 10 hours.  The most powerful scene, in my opinion, is when Butch and the boy stay over the home of the black slave.  Butch sees the way the father physically abuses his son, and goes to the extent of tying him down to a couch.  He then forces the father to say I love you to his son, like he really means it.  A Perfect World is a film I'll never forget, and I'm so damn glad I spent my 14.99 to purchase the DVD.

Now it seems like even people who admired him at first are suddenly forfeiting their compliments and jumping on the bandwagon, along with the rest of the Costner haters.  Well, I'm not gonna jump on that bandwagon.  This movie is sheer proof that Costner is a wonderful actor capable of playing characters of multiple dimensions.  Here, he's given the challenge of playing a likable villain, without having us forget that he has criminal tendencies.  I'm not condoning criminals, but do you honestly think every criminal in the world is a cold-blooded motherf***er with not a single scruple?  They're human beings like everyone else, only they choose to live dishonest lives.  In other words, the easy way out--at least that's what they think.  Costner played a completely one-dimensional villain in 3,000 Miles to Graceland, but it was fitting to the tone of that film, which plays out like a comic book fantasy.  His character of Butch is much more realistic, and his main scruple is treating children like dirt.  He himself was treated like dirt as a child, and whenever he sees mothers or fathers do the same to their children, he goes nuts and sometimes homicidal.

For Steve McQueen, we now have Frank as, Jo Von Ryan, an America POW encamped with a load of Brit POWs in deepest Italy. The first half of the film concentrates on the grimness & harsh reality spent in the sweltering prison camp, where living conditions are unbearable and the Italian guards (led by a wasted Adolfi Celi) brutal.But, unlike The Great Escape, very little time is spent fleshing out the lead characters into people we can care about. Instead, director Mark Robson, just touches the edges with the usual stereotypical characterization that simply doesn't work at all.Sinatra is your typical New Yorker with attitude, and Howard, is your typical British Stiff-Upper-Lipped cynic who doesn't like been told what to do by a Yank. And that's about it as far as characterisation before Robson, moves the film up a couple of gears to an all-out actioner.Some of the action sequences are quite well done, even though the majority of the shots are taken on board a train on its way to Switzerland.

He first sets a scene up, but then fails to develop it other than to resorting to a hamfisted shootout that's all over in a matter of minutes.Compare this style to that of The Great Escape, when the sequences are developed and ratcheted up gradually, resulting in a very satisfactory pay off at the end of each one.None-the-less, VRE does have its moments, but I think the choice of Sinata as the action hero just doesn't quite ring true somehow.

The makers had enough new ideas to justify making another sequel. You see, sequels aren't that bad if they create a new story, a movie that can stand on it's own.They almost succeeded with Resurrection. Ripley is older (48), but still strangely attractive. Being a part Alien hybrid this time around, she is also a lot meaner, although not enough in my book. I would have liked to see more of her vicious side, because a bad good guy\/gal would have really spiced things up. Turning the obligatory cold, calculating and logical android (in previous movies played by Ian Holm and Lance Henriksen) into cute, emotional, cuddly  but physically just as tough Wynona Ryder, is a new touch too. A touch that shows some evolution in thinking of what future computers and robots are going to be like - after all the first movie was made in 1979. There are some gross-out moments when Ripley discovers her mutant siblings, showing a side to cloning no one will easily forget (although for an experiment set in the future, it looks awfully crude - don't they have better control of genetics 200 years from now?).The problem comes with the structure of the story. The story is really simple. Rogue captain Dan Hedaya is conducting experiments in restricted space to clone alien-human hybrid Ripley and bring a few of the critters back to planet earth. Michael Wincott and his crew of space pirates come across the ship, mess around and kill much of the crew. Then, and this is where the movie really lets you down, it becomes a let's get to the shuttle before the aliens get us routine that-we've-seen-in-every-single-rendition-of-this-franchise. And some more movies like Pitch Black with Vin Diesel. Why do script writers find it so difficult to write a new, interesting ending to their movies? That's the major problem. The race for the capsule is almost as big a cliché as the shootout.See it if you love the previous movies, and if not see it for free on cable for some cheap thrills.

The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift, but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon.  Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons.  The alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders.  When he is refused, he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito.  The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950's sci-fi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture &#150; the score alone has been aped (or lifted in the Simpson's case) in many other films.  The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends, rather than a `beware the red menace' message of fear and hate.  In fact one character even says she thinks the `alien' is from earth (ie Russia) only to be hushed!  The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu's warning of `disarm or we'll remove your threat by destroying you' in the same light.  Isn't this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently?  I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's pre-emptive strike, while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect &#150; the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious, but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking (sorry &#150; accidental pun) at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wide-eyed all American boy (Bobby, but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy) to see the whole thing, but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism, but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a pre-emptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.

Although she may act a bit strange, she is far from mentally disturbed, and really has no business being in the institution. Her ward-mates are far worse than she is. While in the institution, she becomes attatched to another female patient, Lisa (Jolie), who is extremely charismatic, but also very independent and rebellious. During the course of Susanna's stay at the institution, the more she becomes closer to Lisa, the worse Susanna becomes, eventually emulating the behavior of Lisa, which gets her into more and more trouble with the authorities. After escaping one night, Susanna and Lisa crash the house of a former patient, Daisy, who had just been released back into the world. Daisy is still very unstable, and Lisa seems to go out of her way to belittle her. The following morning, Susanna goes upstairs to check on Daisy, and finds her dead, hanging in the bathroom. Horrified by what she sees, Susanna begins to realize that Lisa is not only a bad influence, but is the prime cause of her still being in the institution after one year. Susanna begins to turn her life around, and turn against Lisa at the same time. Eventually, after a fairly dramatic scene in the basement of the institution, Susanna is released back into the world, with a fresh new look on life.Girl, Interrupted shows some parrallels with another institution movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Along with some similar situations, it also parallels the basic theme in that institutions can sometimes drive people crazy, rather than help them. Although Cuckoo's Nest was a far better movie, Girl, Interrupted is still very entertaining, and has much of the same wit as did Cuckoo's Nest Recommended for drama fans. Rating  8 out of 10.
