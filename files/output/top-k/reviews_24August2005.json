I'm not interested in the late seventies or early eighties and disco is a form of music that has never appealed to me in such a way that it influenced my life. And since the director is a complete stranger to me, just like the majority of the cast (The only names that I immediately recognized were those of Chloë Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale), there could only one reason be left why I watched it. I gave this movie a try because there was nothing else on TV and I didn't want to spend my evening by watching some stupid game show or soap opera.The story in this movie is centered around the lives of a group of friends with different backgrounds, who spend all their weekends in a famous disco. They are all looking for something. Some are looking for a nice partner, while some don't care as long as he's rich. They all have a job that demands a lot of them and the best way to forget about all their troubles is to throw themselves in the sparkling night life. It's a life of sex, drugs, music and a lot of weirdness, but when the place where they all go out is closed, their way of life abruptly ends, leaving them behind with the most important question Is disco really dead or not? The main problem that I had with this movie is that during the first half of the movie, the story didn't seem to go anywhere. This was a movie about people full of themselves, who don't care about anything or anyone as long as they can have their regular dose of drugs and partying. The characters and there dialogs had absolutely no depth and that's about the worst thing that can happen to a movie. Only in the last part, this all got a little bit better, but by then the damage was already done, making me lose interest.But it has to be said, not everything about this movie was bad. The acting for instance was OK. Even though I hadn't heard of most of them, I must say that they really did a nice job portraying these yuppies. They can't help it that they don't get any good dialogs or script to work with. That's Whit Stillman's problem, not theirs. Also good were some of the jokes, especially the one about the movie Lady and the Tramp was very witty. Still, it wasn't enough to save this movie and to make me forget about the lack of any story or real plot. That's why I give this movie a 6\/10.

What was wrong with her previous nice girl persona? Did the writers feel that there was something WRONG with nice girls? That there should be less nice girls than raunchier (and less classy) Marilyn Monroes? I think it should be the other way around. It also didn't quite fit into the storyline. Second of all, what was with the car flying into the sky into the end? That didn't fit into the movie at all! Since when did it become a magical, Herbie-like flying car?

I checked it out on IMDb and got curious. It didn't take long to realize that this was a gem. Outstanding performances, great story, and it's both well directed and well written. It's hard to compare it to other movies, but Stand by me comes to mind, although it has as many differences from The cure as similarities. The tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys, plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and Stand by me. Other than that, The cure is a fine movie in its own right, well worth a wider recognition. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous.

When I was in the sixth grade, I read the book, The Exorcist, which scared me senseless. The idea that the Devil could infiltrate the delicate core of one's being called a soul absolutely terrified me at such a young age. After seeing the movie, I was speechless. Have been ever since. William Friedkin's transformation of the book to the movie was superb, in my opinion. (Not all adaptations are.) Dick Smith's special effects, in contrast to today's make-up advancements in the film industry, are still able to stand the test of time. The acting was splendid, from Lee J. Cobb & Jason Miller, to Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow's limited appearance in the piece. Friedkin's slice-of-life direction enhances the essence of the fear-factor in an oddly subtle fashion, as though the viewer were actually alongside the characters in the film. Lending to the creepiness of the film is the fact that there exists a minimal musical score (Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells does accompany two nuns strolling gingerly down a Georgetown street in autumn, their robes billowing slightly in the wind). The palpability of what happens to a young Linda Blair has astounded me for over three decades. Having been so taken with the notion that inhuman entities DO stalk the earth and have never existed in human form, I've written a couple of novels on the subject matter, myself.

So how better to re-tell this story in an interesting and innovative fashion which will appeal to today's audiences than to hire quirky filmmaker Tim Burton, whose eccentric sets and expertise at mood building are a fair guarantee that the film will be interesting, if nothing else. Burton lives up to his reputation here; Sleepy Hollow may prove to be his most atmospheric film yet. The sets of the town Sleepy Hollow are marvelously strange, (and very Burton-esq for any fans) perfectly capturing the feel of this shady, timewarped town. There's also a constant feel that something isn't right, as if dark forces could strike out at any moment. (aided by Danny Elfman's triumphant score, which I enjoyed, but found too intrusive at times when the tension should have been built slowly and sickeningly to draw the viewer in further, Elfman sometimes brings it to a crashing climax far too quickly) It helps of course, that the village residents have the grizzled look of having stepped out of a child's fairy tale book, especially Burton favorite Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDarmid and Jeffrey Jones as some of the town elders. Burton even manages to sneak in a brief role from another favorite of his, Christopher Lee, who manages to be typically imposing and commanding, standing out even though he was in only a single short scene.Of course, Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch, and he manages to make the role of Ichabod Crane his own, filled with twitchy mannerisms and girlish squeaks. Crane may not be the typical action hero, but he is delightfully personified, and just quirky enough to work. Christina Ricci also gives a strong performance as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of Baltus (Michael Gambon) and Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) unofficial leaders of the town. Katrina appears to be the only innocent and pure character, yet with some undisclosed dark secrets of her own. Ricci pulls off the character believably, though she struggles with her accent at times. However it is great to see such classy actors as Gambon and Richardson as the mysterious unofficial magistrates. Both turn out excellent and dignified performances, though both graze the line of going over the top during some of the more dramatic scenes. Even Casper Van Dien gives a satisfying performance as a highly suspicious village resident. And of course, it's great to see Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman during a flashback sequence with his head on - Walken proves that he is truly one of the greatest actors still around as he manages to make his role utterly terrifying without speaking a single word. (although to be fair, his makeup does help add to the effect, but it's easy to believe he could have been equally frightening without it) The strong performances from the cast help the film hold strong during some of the weaker sequences, and really help make the film a success. Although, another major draw will be Burton's unique and creative set design and trait for really giving the sense of immersing the audience into a complete other world. If you are willing to forgive the occasional weak plot point, Sleepy Hollow is an excellent way to spend an evening, immersing yourself into Burton's dark world and profound imagination. This truly does seem to be the movie he was born to make.-8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 August 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Headless Horseman is a timeless one; everyone knows it.

It takes a rare imagination to transplant a story of Ancient Indian warriors to the golf courses of American South, so it's strange that the same imagination can't free itself from the conventions of classical Hollywood plotting. While the film is always entertaining, the story it tells is never less than 100% predictable. This same can be said of many movies, but BAGGER VANCE appears to hold itself out as something different, as if it's going to offer something new and sort-of meaningful when really all it's doing is rehashing the increasingly tired 'sport as a metaphor for life' theme.Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), once a hotshot teenage golfer, lives in drunken semi-seclusion in his hometown of Savannah after a traumatic experience in the Great War. Junuh is a lost soul, a fact signified by Redford's insistence in obscuring his leading actor's face in shadow for the early scenes. His former girlfriend, Adele Invergordon (the somewhat delicious Charlize Theron) also has troubles her father committed suicide after the Great Crash wiped out his fortune, leaving her with an expensive white elephant of a golf resort and a mountain of debt. She determines to hold a challenge match between America's two greatest players to raise funds to pay off her debts and, having persuaded\/tricked them into taking part in a too-contrived fashion, discovers that the townsfolk won't stand for it unless a local hero also takes part. This is where young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), the narrator introduced to us as a dying present-day Jack Lemmon, steps in and suggests Junuh. Naturally Junuh refuses, but then has his mind changed by young Adele stripping to her undies. Trouble is, Junuh has lost his swing, which is where Bagger Vance (Will Smith) makes his entrance, braving the golf balls Junuh is whacking into the night at all angles, and jauntily proclaiming, I positioned myself right in front of you, 'cause from the way your swings were going', I figured that was the safest place. Bagger is a figure of mystery, perhaps guardian angel, perhaps God, literally emerging from the darkness in answer to the apparent cry for help Junuh made when he picked up his golf clubs again&#133;This film is such a slick and glossy example of Hollywood professionalism that at times you find yourself suddenly jettisoned from the story to reflect on how damn slick it all is. The cinematography is at times sublime, offering us rich images of the southern states in the midst of a depression, the worst consequence of which seems to be that young Hardy's father is forced to take a job cleaning the streets. This is the old MGM style of movie-making, a world that bears only a passing resemblance to our own, and in which townsfolk urge a young boy to fly with wing-ed sandals on your feet as the eager mite dashes off to plead with the town drunk to pick up the sticks once more. It's almost endearing in its way, and if it weren't for the aura of falsity that keeps seeping in and out of the proceedings, it might be something worth shouting about.A major problem is the casting. Theron is fine in a role that doesn't call for much more than a spunky female who looks good in vibrant 30s costumes, but Damon and Smith are both miscast. Damon's just about the right age to play Junuh, but his pretty boy features simply don't bear the marks of a decade-plus of alcohol-fuelled trauma. Damon is the type of guy who, when he's fifty is going to look like a 25-year-old with wrinkles; at the age of thirty he looks like a twenty-year-old who hasn't even begun to sample life; he's lost us before he even opens his mouth, which is a shame because he's a good actor who brings a lot to his roles. Nevertheless, Damon could just about squeeze by without requiring too much suspension of belief on the part of the viewer, but Smith simply doesn't have a chance. He's easily about twenty-five years too young for the role, and growing a beard doesn't make that much of a difference. All the time I was watching the film I kept thinking of a mature character actor like Morgan Freeman as more suited to the part, and was surprised to discover that Freeman had been Redford's first choice for the role but that he had decided against him in favour of a younger actor. I can understand Redford choosing to stand down as Junuh, but selecting Smith over Freeman just doesn't make sense &#150; unless you're an accountant. That's not to say Smith doesn't give a good performance, in fact he's very good and, after all the no-brainer blockbusters he's appeared in over the past few years you start feeling optimistic about what might be ahead from him, but no actor, no matter how good, could come out on top when called upon to wrestle with some of the truly laughable lines he delivers that are supposed to be laden with deep mystical meaning.Despite all this, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE kept me interested for the entirety of its long and slowly-paced running time. Redford conjures up some memorable images and manages to revisit themes he has explored a number of times now without the material growing stale. It all harks back to the kind of uplifting fare Hollywood churned out by the truckload back in its Golden Era, which is no bad thing. It's old-fashioned for sure, and shamelessly tries to manipulate the audience at times, but it has such a good-natured heart that, unless you're the deepest of cynics, you'll probably find yourself being drawn in.

Most of the time, though, they come up with a unique and compelling vision. However, with The Man Who Wasn't There, they consciously deconstruct the noir genre and in the process suck all the melodrama and life out of it.(I will skip the plot summary - nobody on IMDb wants to read them and it's not like we're all auditioning for a job) Like the usual Coen films, The Man Who Wasn't There is marked by technical perfection. Joel's direction is intelligent and probing, always looking for a new way to view the characters. In this film, the use of shadows is especially impressive (and mind you, suitably over the top for a mock-noir film). The performances are good as well, not surprising considering the talent on board. Also, Deakins the cinematographer deserves a lot of credit.Where the film fails is at the script level. The Coens have always been calculating in their preparation - there is no spontaneity to their films (not a bad thing necessarily, just a style). Each one moves along towards the inevitable denouement. However, they usually come up with brilliant scenes and invent new dialogue and phrase structure. In this film, they revise the noir genre by making the characters lifeless, opposing in the process the melodrama seen in films such as Touch of Evil and the vitality of The Third Man. Noir films are at their best when characters strive to better their lives and inevitably fail. In The Man who wasn't there, the characters merely trudge along, not caring much for their livelihoods. Ed just goes through the motions. The only life in the movie comes from Gandolfini, and he's killed early on.And Tony Shalhoub's character is pure nonsense - his lines show the film to be straining, the viewer gets the sense that the Coens are showing off; that they just read about the uncertainty principle and somehow it all fits in.

Boy meets girl. Boy likes girl. Girl likes boy. Boy and girl share time, experiences and feelings. Boy still likes girl. Girl likes boy even more. Boy and girl live together happily ever after. Normally those shared experiences include some light comedy, a few moments of embarrassment, occasions of sadness and anger, and if we're lucky, those rare moments of true connection when heart meets heart and they beat together brightly while the world goes on around them. 'Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!' ( I would use 'Atame!' but I can't do upside-down exclamation marks), is such a love story and has all of the above present and correct. Two innocents meet by chance off-screen, and their paths to the future are set. Or at least that's what they boy thinks.This film dares to use a controversial narrative to get the girl, and for that it deserves full marks. Its setting is childishly colourful and bright which is fitting considering the two leads are really teenagers in adult bodies. The mood is generally light. Even in the darker moments with the director's allusions to Hitchcockian suspense and horror, the suspense never materialises, soon bursting in a confection of whimsical threatlessness. The portrayal of a naive and obsessive love is wonderful. The fact that it celebrates this without criticism or cynicism is more wonderful still. There are no moral qualms about sex, sexuality, or nudity which might be dismissed (wrongly) as being 'European' in some quarters. This is as refreshing as it is rare. Both leads are having fun entirely appropriate to their roles.However, I feel that the story here falls short of where it wants to be. Marina's emergence from her status as victim, becoming one of the lovers is rapid and not convincing. Her feelings revolve around toothache and pain relief. Her fear of her kidnapper is never that genuine. I'm glad there's no Stockholm syndrome in play, but there do need to be some moments where she loses the fear she should have and gains a trust she's never had before. Their absence lets down the film. The film also shies away from the fetishistic aspects of bondage. Though not a part of the story, they're certainly integral to the way the camera pans up the body of Marina when she's tied to the bed. Worse still, the film seems to support the view that power exchange within a relationship is not a healthy thing, and that 24\/7 equality is to be striven for. A very safe viewpoint for such an 'edgy' film.There is more good than bad here, but as a whole, it disappoints. Perhaps the main legacy of this film is that it was (allegedly) the first film to be rated NC-17 in the US, although the importance of this is probably overstated.

Or at least that's what they boy thinks.This film dares to use a controversial narrative to get the girl, and for that it deserves full marks. Its setting is childishly colourful and bright which is fitting considering the two leads are really teenagers in adult bodies. The mood is generally light. Even in the darker moments with the director's allusions to Hitchcockian suspense and horror, the suspense never materialises, soon bursting in a confection of whimsical threatlessness. The portrayal of a naive and obsessive love is wonderful. The fact that it celebrates this without criticism or cynicism is more wonderful still. There are no moral qualms about sex, sexuality, or nudity which might be dismissed (wrongly) as being 'European' in some quarters. This is as refreshing as it is rare. Both leads are having fun entirely appropriate to their roles.However, I feel that the story here falls short of where it wants to be. Marina's emergence from her status as victim, becoming one of the lovers is rapid and not convincing. Her feelings revolve around toothache and pain relief. Her fear of her kidnapper is never that genuine. I'm glad there's no Stockholm syndrome in play, but there do need to be some moments where she loses the fear she should have and gains a trust she's never had before. Their absence lets down the film. The film also shies away from the fetishistic aspects of bondage. Though not a part of the story, they're certainly integral to the way the camera pans up the body of Marina when she's tied to the bed. Worse still, the film seems to support the view that power exchange within a relationship is not a healthy thing, and that 24\/7 equality is to be striven for. A very safe viewpoint for such an 'edgy' film.There is more good than bad here, but as a whole, it disappoints. Perhaps the main legacy of this film is that it was (allegedly) the first film to be rated NC-17 in the US, although the importance of this is probably overstated.

Boy meets girl. Boy likes girl. Girl likes boy. Boy and girl share time, experiences and feelings. Boy still likes girl. Girl likes boy even more. Boy and girl live together happily ever after. Normally those shared experiences include some light comedy, a few moments of embarrassment, occasions of sadness and anger, and if we're lucky, those rare moments of true connection when heart meets heart and they beat together brightly while the world goes on around them.

All I know is this Iron Monkey made me laugh. Not a There's Something about Mary kind of laugh--those laughs that are sometimes uncomfortable (both because you laughed so hard, and because the scenes were so vile that you had a hard time stomaching it). The kind of laughs that Iron Monkey provokes start as a seedling idea, and spread from the brain to pull at the corners of the mouth. At some point, the laughs are no longer recognized as individual, but rather a collection of pure enjoyment as you wait for the next trap, the next slap, the next vase in the face.Let's begin with the director (since he is the one part of the movie that most of us have experience with). By now, Woo-Ping Yuen is legendary, and you might even have one of his movies in your collection. He began his career as an actor in the 1960's, and moved on to director and fight choreography. He has become most famous for the latter. In the last 10 years, Yuen made a name for himself in America by choreographing the fight sequences in The Matrix trilogy, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and most recently Kill Bill (Vol. 1&2). If you liked any of those fights, with high flying effects and lots of quick reflexes, you'll be sure to enjoy this one.What about the plot? It's really quite straight forward. A doctor (Rongguang Yu) doubles as a Robin Hood known as Iron Monkey, taking money from corrupt Chinese leaders and re-distributing it to the peasants. He catches the attentions of high ranking Governor Cheng, who wishes to catch and kill the good doctor. When young Wong Fei-Hung is captured by the governor, his father (Donnie Yen) must track down Iron Monkey in order to have the boy released. It is up to Iron Monkey, his assistant Miss Orchid, and the boy's father to save the child from certain doom. In the process they must teach the governor a very valuable lesson about abusing power.And then there is the fighting. Because the filmmaker is a martial arts choreographer, the fights are phenomenal. There are some pretty impressive scenes involving staffs, swords, umbrellas, benches, and very sharp tacks. One of the more exciting scenes occurs when a pile of papers is blown from a table and Iron Monkey and Miss Orchid must retrieve the papers from midair. The dance that follows is a truly beautiful piece of camera-work.Though there has been discussion that the story was changed for the American release of the film (presented by Quentin Tarantino), it really doesn't make much of a difference. People in the know will talk about the historical significance of the characters, the edits made by Miramax in the American release, and the improper translation from Cantonese to English. But really, who cares? Since most people in these parts probably couldn't tell the difference between Mandarin, Cantonese, Shiatsu, Hibachi, Mitsubishi, or Moo Shoo Pork, I'm not going to pretend like it matters that some dialogue has been cut or mistranslated. If you've never seen the original edit, then you won't even notice these differences. The movie rings in at around 90 minutes, and assumedly most of the edits were made to hit that valuable cut-off time.Make no mistake; the fights are where this film shines. But Iron Monkey is as much about family values, government corruption, and the indomitable human spirit (*sigh&#133;a tear) as it is about a swift kicks to the midsection and beautiful camera work. I would go so far as to say it is a family film, aimed at anyone who wants to recapture the enjoyment that can be found in the great fantasy films of America (Star Wars, LOTR, Dunston Checks In). At the very least, you can sit back and laugh at the crazy dialogue and surprised looks on the character's faces as they get hit with random objects.
