It doesn't have the timelessness of some of the other movies in the raunchy teen comedy genre, and it's been greatly surpassed by movies that have come after it. It's still funny in some ways, but a lot of the gross scenes that used to be shocking, are fairly unremarkable by today's standards. The most enjoyment I get from the movie now, is from looking at the substantial cast and seeing how their careers have changed, remained stagnant, or basically ended all-together, since 1999.

The party loving bohemian lifestyle of people surrounding Holly is like that of post Beatles era of mid '60s. The '60s life style must have been well on its way in some parts of New York by 1958 when Truman Capote wrote this novel.Holly Golitely (Audrey Hepburn) lives her life off of rich men. Her aim in life is to marry money. She has parties at her apartment to attract the rich set. One day a new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves in. He's an aspiring novelist (what else ? he's probably an alter ego of Truman Capote) who's also making his life as a lover to an older woman (Patricia Neal). Holly finally gets engaged to a wealthy Brazilian millionaire. Unfortunately, she gets arrested for being an accomplice in a drug ring run by Sally who she made weekly visits to at Sing Sing prison. Holly's engagement is canceled but Paul confesses his love to her.The fashion shown in this movie is well ahead of its time. It's very different from the way people dressed in movies from the '50s. You can see new culture emerging in this movie. Even Holly's hair has highlights just like many women do today. Light irresponsible way of living life was already part of American culture before the hippies took over in the late '60s.No other movie predicted the culture to come better than this movie. In that sense this was uniquely original piece that was slightly ahead of its time.

Not after it's done a number on San Francisco and without a wrecking ball in sight. But then if Godzilla can take Tokyo, why not an octopus taking out an American city in big time stop-motion fashion. Okay, it's archaic special effects by today's digital standards, but cutting edge for its time and still a lot of movie fun.Tobey's a fine underrated actor, perfect as a military type. And Domergue-- Howard Hughes' big squeeze&#x97; shows her dewy-eyed stuff as a women are as good as men feminist. Actually, it's Curtis, a man, who states that case for the new woman, though Domergue's aggressive scientist makes a convincing case all by herself. Surprisingly for this type movie, the three share equal time on screen, and it's pretty clear director Gordon's instructions to them are to low-key it, which they do to good effect.The first atomic submarine, the Nautilus, sailed in mid-1954 to a lot of public interest. No doubt, the producers here were well aware, and wove a crowd-pleasing story around the film version. Then too, mutant monsters had not yet taken over movie screens as they would a few years later. No doubt, the success of this film was parent to many of those creature offspring. Anyway, as these movies go, this is definitely one of the better ones in all departments, (though a couple of romantic scenes could have been easily economized).In passing&#x97;I really like that last scene where our three musketeers get no recognition for their heroics. It's a nice ironic touch. And see if you agree&#x97;looks to me like they're about to break character at fade-out.

Jonathan Gems' unsparingly caustic script takes ferocious potshots at a wealth of worthy targets rampant greed (Las Vegas, that quintessentially all-American den of sin and vice, gets demolished by the Martians), smug politicians, hawkish military goons (Rod Steiger hits it out of the ballpark with his inspired portrayal of gung-ho General Decker, who desperately wants to nuke the alien invaders into oblivion), kooky religious fanatics, opportunistic media parasites, low-life white trash survivalists, nerdy scientific brainiacs, and even bleeding heart liberal pacifists (Paul Winfield delivers a wickedly spot-on caricature of Colin Powell as the benign General Casey, who naturally gets killed first). Moreover, there's a strange biblical moral purity at work A majority of folks who get annihilated by the Martains are loathsome conformist creeps who deserve to die while the survivors are an engagingly loopy bunch of fringe oddballs (in other words, the meek inherit what's left of the Earth at the end of the picture).The all-star cast have a ball with their colorfully broad roles Jack Nicholson joyfully goes to town on his dual parts as the smarmy President James Dale and sleazy Vegas hotelier Art Land (the casting of Wacky Jack in both roles suggests that scuzzy politicos and no-count businessmen are two sides of the same low-rent coin), plus there are lively and enjoyable contributions from Glenn Close as snooty first lady Marsha Dale, Annette Benning as dippy New Age space case Barbara Land, Pierce Brosnan as the pompous, pipe-smoking Professor Donald Kessler, Danny De Vito as a jerky lawyer, Sarah Jessica Parker as ditsy talk show host Nathalie Lake, Lukas Haas as likable working class schmoe Richie Norris, Sylvia Sidney as feisty, senile old bat Grandma Florence Norris, Natalie Portman as sweet first daughter Taffy Dale, Jim Brown as reformed ex-boxer Bryon Williams, Martin Short as slimy presidential secretary Jerry Ross, Michael J. Fox as shameless scoop-chasing reporter Jason Stone, Joe Don Baker as crude redneck Glenn Norris, and Jack Black as cowardly good ol' boy Billy Glenn.

Lisa Marie has a memorably sexy bit as the otherworldly, yet enticing Martian girl. Danny Eldman provides a spirited theremin score.
