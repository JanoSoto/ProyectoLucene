First of all the Truman Show has Jim Carrey (a clown 'actor' - his 'acting' abilities are badly shown up here), this has Micheal Douglas, the Truman show is totally boring and unintelligent, this is entertaining and intelligent. In summary the Truman show is rubbish this is again quite the opposite.I think this film is entertaining from start to finish as an action\/thriller intends to be, but avoids all the common action cliches involved of tacky one-liners when something blows up. It also has clever twisting plot, in that it constantly leaves the view wondering whether he's been conned out of all his money and his life, or whether it is 'just a game'. The same applies to the characters involved, you never really sure who's real and who's not. You can also see the point of the game in trying to add excitement to his mundane and seemingly unhappy life, the old chestnut of being rich, but so what? its only money - is clearly present. The direction, acting, set design, stunts etc are all very impressive as well, and most of all the attention to detail.With all these elements put together I think this is a very good film, one of the best films I've seen made in the late 1990's.

Edward Scissorhands and Mars Attacks were his first two movies that I saw (and they are his worst) so you can guess I got a bad impression from the start. So once Sleepy Hollow came out in 1999 I was like Oh great, another Tim Burton movie and once I saw it I realized that this Tim Burton person wasn't bad at all. Infact he was excellent! From then on I saw his masterpieces such as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Batman Returns, Beetlejuice, the highly underrated Ed Wood and his short film's Vincent and Frankenweenie. Now, probably the only thing that made me want to research into this guy and see his films was because I thought that Sleepy Hollow was a good movie with it's acting, plot, etc. but the one thing that really amazed me was his SET DESIGN. His views on how a movie should look set wise are brilliant! Lets also take his character design from the SUPERB movie A Nightmare Before Christmas. Sure he didn't direct that movie but the set and character design was phenomenal! So back to the movie I'm reviewing here. Sleepy Hollow is as everyone knows or should know is a classic fairy tale about the misfortunes of poor Icabod Crain and his encounters with the headless horseman. This new version for the 90's is different than the original, in a good way, but there's not a single time in all of Sleepy Hollow where it forgets it's roots. The characters and even the town of Sleepy Hollow are as I remembered them from the original and it even includes the classic flaming pumpkin. But this film also provides a fresh new look to the tale. The story of how the headless horseman becomes and the inner plot within this movie are new but don't forshadow it's realism to the book. But there are two things I wasn't fond of in this movie PLOT SPOILER! DON'T READ ON! WARNING! (1. the headless horseman's motives were different than from the book and (2. Icabod Crain lives in this version. Now I thought the ending of the book was excellent because Icabod just dissapears, no one hears from him again, and that's what makes it so good because your left wondering unlike in the movie Icabod lives and goes back to London to live happily ever after blah blah. Now, as I was saying earlier, fabulous set design. I was amazed that this movie didn't contain one tiny little beam of sunlight through the entire movie. Either it was gray and foggy or totally black. Now that to me is art and skill provided well by Tim Burton. Also how all the woods in the film were man made. Can you imagine how pain stakingly hard that must have been? Or how one part of the woods was 3 miles long to catch the realism of the horseman going on his rides of head choppiry. As in most Tim Burton films there is a kind of eerie darkness (excluding Pee-Wee's Big Adventure). Good examples are both Batman movies which were phenominal with there set design and Beetlejuice. Tim Burton is obviously a director who cares a lot about his movies but also a lot in the way they look. You will not find a movie of his that doesn't contain some bizarre set pieces. He's a man of great movie skill. Also be aware that this is not like the old Disney version of Sleepy Hollow. This movie contains quite a lot of graphic head slicin' and dicin' which is ok for me but people that expect something within the range of the Disney version will be surprised. So my suggestion to those who have not seen this movie is as soon as possible go to your local movie store, rent this movie, go home and prepare youself to look through the eyes of Tim Burton. Enjoy the feast of solid cast, plot and astonishing set design that only Sleepy Hollow can provide. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2001","score":"","review":"  I once thought that Tim Burton was a bad director.

As in most Tim Burton films there is a kind of eerie darkness (excluding Pee-Wee's Big Adventure). Good examples are both Batman movies which were phenominal with there set design and Beetlejuice. Tim Burton is obviously a director who cares a lot about his movies but also a lot in the way they look. You will not find a movie of his that doesn't contain some bizarre set pieces. He's a man of great movie skill. Also be aware that this is not like the old Disney version of Sleepy Hollow. This movie contains quite a lot of graphic head slicin' and dicin' which is ok for me but people that expect something within the range of the Disney version will be surprised. So my suggestion to those who have not seen this movie is as soon as possible go to your local movie store, rent this movie, go home and prepare youself to look through the eyes of Tim Burton. Enjoy the feast of solid cast, plot and astonishing set design that only Sleepy Hollow can provide. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"14 April 2001","score":"","review":"  I'm going to have to agree with the sentiments seen in other comments where men essentially said I went to see this with my girlfriend, thinking it would be a 'chick flick', and was surprised to find it was really funny.

Movies don't usually thrive when done in the same tight, focused manner of a stage play, so it's customary to expand adaptations with additional locations, events, and subplots.  Unfortunately for 'Nell' these are utterly conventional, filled with stereotypes and a sampling of the usual cliches.  This takes time and attention away from the fascinating core story and the superb performance by Jodie Foster.The story begins with the discovery that a reclusive old woman has died and has left a grown daughter alone in their remote cabin.  Originally she is thought to be a wild child since she doesn't understand English and only utters what sounds like gibberish.  Besides that, her behaviour is very peculiar and everyone's first impression is that she is also somewhat retarded, if not mentally ill.But the movie and Foster display an understanding of their subject matter almost unique in a Hollywood movie.  A true wild child (that is, a child who grows up isolated from human contact without learning a language) pretty much never can learn to speak normally or function independently in society.  But this isn't the case for Nell.  She lived with her loving mother all her life and did indeed learn to speak as any child would.  It's just that the language we hear her speak is unique to herself (the definition of 'idioglossia') which was caused by a couple of different circumstances.Her mother had suffered a stroke (if I recall correctly) which drastically affected her own ability to speak clearly, and this was the model for Nell's own speech, never having heard any other.  Nell also had a twin sister who died when they were children.  Typically twins develop their own language (twin speech) to talk to each other when they are very young.  Also typically they tend to outgrow and forget this language as they grow older.  The movie postulates that Nell and her sister never discarded their language, not implausible considering their circumstances, and that Nell retained into adulthood much of that language even after the death of her sister.The final elements of Nell's seemingly odd behaviour is simply a matter of a clash of cultures.  Nell and her family were essentially a people unto themselves, living in isolation and out of contact with the rest of society.  Some of their customs and beliefs were generated from the traumas suffered by the mother, others spontaneously arose from simply living the life they were leading.  These seem peculiar to outsiders from our own, very different, culture; though it's just ordinary life to Nell.  Even more peculiar is the outside world to Nell.  The shock and recoil that she often undergoes comes from being suddenly confronted by inexplicable, unimagined, and overwhelming events totally beyond a lifetime's experience and coming directly on the heels of the death of her mother.When the movie centers on these elements it is entirely engrossing.  Foster is fully convincing in her role, and clearly understands the complex nature and history of Nell.  Despite everyone's first impressions, Nell is never anything but an intelligent adult woman confronting a strange and often hostile world, and attempting to adapt to it as best she can.  Her interactions with Neeson's and Richardson's characters are often complex and traumatic enough to keep the film moving in the absence of the other, extraneous, elements.Had the movie concentrated more intently on this interaction and devoted more time to it, which is really the whole point of the film, or had it done a better and more original job of expanding it's vision during it's adaptation to film (those parts involving the sheriff's wife showed unexploited potential), 'Nell' could have been a great film.  Certainly the superb cinematography shows one of the great advantages of film over the stage.  But there was too much time spent on weak scenes for the movie to ever fully blossom. So overall, despite its flaws, 'Nell' is a good film with many fascinating elements and an excellent performance by Jodie Foster.  And that makes it well worth watching.

But the inescapable fact is that this one of the best examinations of the subject matter there has been on screen - on par with Boyz N The Hood.And it is FAR from uncreative.  In fact, on one level, it is not a hood movie, but a whodunit.  The mystery aspect of the plot is very interesting.  But there are other, more important layers.  It is the story of the confusion and crisis of a young man's life.  Most importantly, it is a brutal look at drugs, guns, and life in the projects.  It is a movie asking why so many young black men are dying in the streets.The lead character Strike has a stomach problem.  It might be an ulcer or something like that.  I believe it is a metaphor.  Just as heat represented racial tension in Lee's masterpiece Do The Right Thing, Strike's sickness represents the illnesses plaguing the ghetto drugs, guns, liquor.Like DTRT, this film looks at community.  The mothers, the cops, the young people, the kids, the men trying to make a living - there is eloquent commentary in Clockers on the situations of all.  In Spike's movies, paying a little attention is rewarding.  A good essay could be written on what I call the Spike Summarization technique.  This is when Spike compresses a serious debate or concern in the black community into a few expressive moments of action or dialogue.  There are better examples in other movies, but it manifests in Clockers a few times.  A bunch of kids are sitting in front of Rodney's (Delroy Lindo) shop; one of the kids is rapping while the others pay attention.  The two sides to the coin we feel the artistry and skill of the moment, the continuation of a rich tradition of oral art; we're also struck by the cruelty and coldness in the kid's violent lyrics, and we think about where that comes from.Stylistically, this movie is a huge success.  The cinematography is amazing, and I wonder what must be wrong with my tastes when I'm floored by a film like this and find visually bland a more oft-praised classic.  The projects become blinding panoramas, landscapes which add tons of meaning to the poignant ending (I won't reveal it here).  The sound is great; many films of this nature use hip hop in the soundtrack to produce certain effects, but Clockers does it in a more methodical way which jars some people, but contributes to the film's meaning.I could say more about the film, but I encourage you to just see it, along with the rest of Spike's oeuvre.

Joe Ross is a scientist who has developed a process which is going to make his company rich. He meets up with Jimmy Dell in an island and they spark a friendship. Ross then starts to have doubts about the intentions of his company, specifically as to how they are going to repay him for this process he created.

It does start off slow which is not a bad thing for this movie. I think a slow beginning establishes an atmosphere of safety and slowly little nicks are taken before the bigger stabs.

The exstatic face on The Joker as he enters was enough to set me off laughing, what with his ridiculous grin, and the stupid purple artists hat he is wearing. But then, he and his hoods begin to dance away to Partyman whilst ruining the artwork therein. The best part of this scene is undoubtebly the part with the statuette. The Joker looks at a small statuette on a raised display box. The statuette appears to be some sort of dancer with her arms out to either side and one leg up behind her. The Joker begins to imitate his pose, hopping on one leg. He then draws his arms across his own chest then flings them outwards, knocking the statuette off its stand. I was in tears watching this happen as it looked so ridiculous for a villain.Some of the quotes from The Joker, and Jack Napier, will stay with me for a long time, here's some of the best onesCan somebody tell me...what kind of a world we live in...where a man dressed up as a BAT...gets all my press?

It's shallow, it's gratuitously violent, it's riddled with four-letter words at every twist and turn, the plot is paper-thin, but guess what?  It works.  And it makes a great popcorn flick!!!The only mild disappointment I had was the fact that the trailers were a little misleading.  I expected the whole movie to be about the four guys rushing into the casino, dressed in Elvis suits and trying to get away clean.  That pretty much describes the first 20 minutes.  The rest of the film revolves around greed, in splitting the stolen money up and keeping a bigger share for themselves by trying to eliminate the others in the equation.  I just felt the movie had a catchy, original premise.  I am not a huge Elvis fan, but I am appreciative of his work and persona.  So I expected the film to have lots of references to The King, and lots of his greatest hits in the soundtrack.  I thought that hopped up dance remix to Viva Las Vegas they played in the previews was really cool, and that was one of the things that subliminally hypnotized me into seeing it.I wish people will leave poor Kevin Costner alone.  Sure, he's made Waterworld, The Postman and For Love of the Game.  And I'm not going to change my mind purposely and say they were, in fact, good movies.  But that doesn't make Kevin a bad actor.  I still think he's very talented. Anybody who's seen Bull Durham or Dances with Wolves (and there's a lot more to add to the list) knows that's true.  I think he looked really cool with the Elvis sideburns and the cigarette constantly hanging out his mouth. I don't condone smoking; I just think he makes it look cool.  That's not going to rope me into lighting up, though.  Costner is great at playing against typecast as an unscrupulous, take-no-crap villain.  At times he doesn't even seem to have a conscience.  Not that I can compare myself to him, but I enjoyed his character.  I liked the shoot-out between him and the cop, who pulled him over.  It was like a slick contemporary update of those patented gunfights in the old westerns.  It was very well done.  And he has some awesome lines in the movie, too.  I liked the scene between him and Christian Slater, where he says  You know what I say about the Golden Rule--F**k the Golden Rule!  Then he pulls a gun out from under the table and shoots him.  I hope I didn't give anything away.  But seeing that Slater has bottom billing, I'm pretty sure it's evident that he won't be in the film for long.The casino heist was well done.  I liked how they continually cut--with lightning-fast editing--from the robbery to the Elvis impersonator surrounded by an array of showgirls.  Even when this film gets really preposterous, there's never a dull moment.  And that's what I loved about it!If you're looking for something deep and philosophical--this is not the movie to see.  This is strictly a popcorn flick that will--probably--appeal mostly to guys.  But I enjoyed it a lot.  And I hope others will, too. Just please please please please please don't take it seriously!

I just felt the movie had a catchy, original premise.  I am not a huge Elvis fan, but I am appreciative of his work and persona.  So I expected the film to have lots of references to The King, and lots of his greatest hits in the soundtrack.  I thought that hopped up dance remix to Viva Las Vegas they played in the previews was really cool, and that was one of the things that subliminally hypnotized me into seeing it.I wish people will leave poor Kevin Costner alone.  Sure, he's made Waterworld, The Postman and For Love of the Game.  And I'm not going to change my mind purposely and say they were, in fact, good movies.  But that doesn't make Kevin a bad actor.  I still think he's very talented. Anybody who's seen Bull Durham or Dances with Wolves (and there's a lot more to add to the list) knows that's true.  I think he looked really cool with the Elvis sideburns and the cigarette constantly hanging out his mouth. I don't condone smoking; I just think he makes it look cool.  That's not going to rope me into lighting up, though.  Costner is great at playing against typecast as an unscrupulous, take-no-crap villain.  At times he doesn't even seem to have a conscience.  Not that I can compare myself to him, but I enjoyed his character.  I liked the shoot-out between him and the cop, who pulled him over.  It was like a slick contemporary update of those patented gunfights in the old westerns.  It was very well done.  And he has some awesome lines in the movie, too.  I liked the scene between him and Christian Slater, where he says  You know what I say about the Golden Rule--F**k the Golden Rule!  Then he pulls a gun out from under the table and shoots him.  I hope I didn't give anything away.  But seeing that Slater has bottom billing, I'm pretty sure it's evident that he won't be in the film for long.The casino heist was well done.  I liked how they continually cut--with lightning-fast editing--from the robbery to the Elvis impersonator surrounded by an array of showgirls.  Even when this film gets really preposterous, there's never a dull moment.  And that's what I loved about it!If you're looking for something deep and philosophical--this is not the movie to see.  This is strictly a popcorn flick that will--probably--appeal mostly to guys.  But I enjoyed it a lot.  And I hope others will, too. Just please please please please please don't take it seriously! Please! ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"}]
