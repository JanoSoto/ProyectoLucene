Based off of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the movie did an exceptional job of recreating the story. The Shawshank Redemption is a top class movie that needs to be seen by anyone and everyone with the perfect features to make it stand out in the crowd of movies.The acting in the movie The Shawshank Redemption is one of the main reasons that the movie turned out to be so wonderful. Combining the skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman proved to be a pair for the ages. With two characters, one quiet, reserved character and one popular, outspoken character, both played by actors with similar personalities. Appreciation was shown for the acting in this movie when Morgan Freeman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Academy Awards 1995). Although he lost, it is still impressive considering he lost to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump\/ These two actors were not the only actors vital to the production of this movie. Each individual side character was played by an actor perfect for the part. No actor could have done justice to any of the characters like the actors who starred in the film did.The story of the movie was possibly one of the best told stories of all time. Although it is a recent story when compared with stories from all time, it does the perfect job of immersing you in the lives and feelings of the characters and of keeping you hooked on what happens next the whole time. Stephen King started off by writing this masterpiece of a story in his novella and Frank Darabont worked with this masterpiece and wrote and directed one of the top one hundred movies of all time (AFI Top 100). The story is told over a just longer than two hour movie, that does not go on too long or too short. After the viewer has finished watching the movie, they are perfectly satisfied.The Shawshank Redemption has a Motion Picture Association of America rating of R, or restricted. This rating should be lowered too PG-13, known as Parents Strongly Cautioned. Although the movie does have slight hints at sexual activity and scenes with murders and suicide, this does not outweigh the benefit of people seeing this movie. No person of the age above thirteen, or maybe even lower, should be denied the right to view this movie. The Shawshank Redemption has the potential to have an enormous effect on the lives of those who view it. And even if it does not impact their lives, it still could easily change their perception of a good movie or just be an enjoyable two hours of their lives. Without such heavy restrictions on the age of those who can view the movie, maybe it could have a chance to be more widely viewed, and ultimately more widely appreciated.The AFI Rating of The Shawshank Redemption shows it ranked as the number seventy two American movie of the past one hundred years (AFI Top 100). I strongly disagree with this rating. The Shawshank Redemption, although it didn't cause any revelations in the movie world (mostly because it was too recent to have done so), is one of the best filmed movies of all time. I personally would rate The Shawshank Redemption in the top ten of all movies, and number one on my own personal list. The less official Internet Movie Database ranking of movies has The Shawshank Redemption as the number one movie of all time (IMDB Top 250). This is a much more agreeable rating for my own opinion on the movie. Having seen five of the top ten movies on AFI's renowned list, I do not believe any of them compare to the quality and entertainment value of The Shawshank Redemption. Although I earlier agreed with AFI's rating of The Shawshank Redemption in the top one hundred, I believe it should be much higher than the ranking they decided on.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will go down in history as one of the best movies ever created. This future historical relevance is not an exaggeration. If anything, The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated movie. It's not too often that there comes a movie that is as well made as The Shawshank Redemption, so when one is, it is important to fully appreciate it. The Shawshank Redemption is a grade A movie made up of the perfect components of story and acting which come together to make one of the best movies of all time.

It is not a coincidence, therefore, that Pulp Fiction, one of his most well recognized and known movies, is one of the best movies of all time. Between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that Tarantino used for the movie, it is inarguable otherwise. For many people, for instance some of my friends who have watched Pulp Fiction, the plot is a negative. These people have got to be Type A's who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. They usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. The movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name, background or insight into the character. These two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. In the beginning, when the Honey-Bunny scene is introduced for the first time, it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. The audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when Marsellus Wallace is talking to Butch. There are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. The audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is Marsellus Wallace and that Butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. It is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a Type A personality. To me, however, this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of Pulp Fiction. Movies are too predictable today. They present too many known and common variables. All of Quentin Tarantino's movies, or at least most are unpredictable. This unpredictability is refreshing. The randomness, especially in Pulp Fiction, is positive, new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. Much of the randomness factor in Pulp Fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. An example of this is when Vince and Mia are on the date and Mia calls Vince a square. But rather than saying square, she outlines a square with her fingers in the air, and lines follow her fingers on the screen. Another random yet comedic part of the movie is when Butch comes home to his girlfriend Fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. This is where the audience first learns that Fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. Besides these two scenes, there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. An excellent example of this is when Butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead father's comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. Of course the vocabulary Tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar, but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. The actors are also part of what makes Pulp Fiction as good a movie as it is. Tarantino usually uses many of the same actors, especially Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken. Thurman plays Mia and Walken plays a more minor role. Besides Thurman and Walken, many acting greats including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson take major roles. In my opinion, Pulp Fiction is the best movie I have seen Bruce Willis play in as he does not play some cheesy, cliché character with cliché lines like in all the Die Hard movies. John Travolta also plays his role very well, as he also does not take himself too seriously. Samuel L. Jackson, in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. His violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous Go the _____ to Sleep. Pulp Fiction also leaves the audience with questions. The biggest question is what is in the suitcase. All that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that Marsellus Wallace is the owner and needs them back. The audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought that the content was gold bars, which may explain the orange glow that hits characters' faces when they opened up the suitcase. But, after investigation on the internet, unaware that the subject was of hot debate, I learned that Tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds, but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. It is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. Because of the actors, hilarity, and mystery in Pulp Fiction, it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. He intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies.

On Little House on the Prairie, feisty Melissa Gilbert put up her fists to defend herself from spoiled Allison Arngrim. But Jane and Allison had nothing on young Patty McCormack's Rhoda, a demon seed ever if there was one. Polite almost to the point of annoyance, Rhoda smiles sweetly, impressing her teachers with her manners, and certainly, nobody (especially mother Nancy Kelly) realizes what lingers on inside the mind of this evil being.If you ever want to annoy someone or play a practical joke, simply start humming Rhoda's theme which she plays consistently on the piano just to aggravate mommy. Love does not exist in the heart of this child, only a passive\/aggressive desire to manipulate others to get what she wants. What she wants more than anything here is the medal given to a fellow student, and at a school picnic, goes out of her way to do just that. The dead boy's pathetic mother (an excellent Eileen Heckart) visits her since the boy was last seen with Rhoda, and this makes mom Nancy suspicious, especially when the medal mysteriously turns up amongst Rhoda's belongings. Grizzled handyman Henry Jones (also unforgettable) knows the evil that is Rhoda, and pays miserably for his knowledge.The very theatrical play made an entertaining movie that needed to change certain elements of the story to pass the censors, taking away some of the shock, if not the horror. Kelly, McCormack, Heckart, Jones and Evelyn Varden (as an aging upstairs neighbor who naively adores young Rhoda) all repeat their Broadway roles, and well-deserved Oscar nominations went to Kelly (Best Actress), McCormack and Heckart (Supporting Actress). The play brought up questions in regards to child psychology and as to how human minds are framed from the moment they are young, and in some cases, mental illness or evil is pre-destined. It isn't anything society today hasn't dealt with, so the power of the play has been somewhat diminished. The film was somewhat made silly by an unnecessary curtain call that ended on a sour note for those who had seen the play. But for the most part, thanks to the direction of Mervyn LeRoy, the film remains a solid shocker and Rhoda gives birth to future horror children, making her the perfect Bride of Damien.

Kelly, McCormack, Heckart, Jones and Evelyn Varden (as an aging upstairs neighbor who naively adores young Rhoda) all repeat their Broadway roles, and well-deserved Oscar nominations went to Kelly (Best Actress), McCormack and Heckart (Supporting Actress). The play brought up questions in regards to child psychology and as to how human minds are framed from the moment they are young, and in some cases, mental illness or evil is pre-destined. It isn't anything society today hasn't dealt with, so the power of the play has been somewhat diminished. The film was somewhat made silly by an unnecessary curtain call that ended on a sour note for those who had seen the play. But for the most part, thanks to the direction of Mervyn LeRoy, the film remains a solid shocker and Rhoda gives birth to future horror children, making her the perfect Bride of Damien.

On Little House on the Prairie, feisty Melissa Gilbert put up her fists to defend herself from spoiled Allison Arngrim. But Jane and Allison had nothing on young Patty McCormack's Rhoda, a demon seed ever if there was one. Polite almost to the point of annoyance, Rhoda smiles sweetly, impressing her teachers with her manners, and certainly, nobody (especially mother Nancy Kelly) realizes what lingers on inside the mind of this evil being.If you ever want to annoy someone or play a practical joke, simply start humming Rhoda's theme which she plays consistently on the piano just to aggravate mommy. Love does not exist in the heart of this child, only a passive\/aggressive desire to manipulate others to get what she wants. What she wants more than anything here is the medal given to a fellow student, and at a school picnic, goes out of her way to do just that.

Thirty years later I still think Frank Booth is a great monster.The only problem is the plot ends conventionally, with audience satisfaction at a premium.
