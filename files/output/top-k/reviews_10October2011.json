[{"date":"10 October 2011","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) ** (out of 4) Four years after the previous film, Charles Band and Full Moon decided to bring their puppets back and this sixth installment tries to be its own picture and not just connect to the previous. This time out Dr. Magrew (George Peck) and his daughter (Emily Harrison) hire a slow-witted man (Josh Green) to help them build our beloved puppets. The doctor has been able to give them partial life but he needs help giving them their own souls and of course it doesn't take long for our puppets to harm anyone who goes after their friends. CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER is considered by fans of the series to be the absolute worst but perhaps since I'm not a fan I could see it differently. Yes, this is an ultra low-budget film that doesn't have too much action in it and yes it's clear that the attempt to try and take the series into a new direction didn't work all that great but I thought it was rather refreshing seeing something different and not just a stretch of the storyline that was the first five films. I mean, is what we see here really worse than the puppets battling a Demon God? It's clear that Full Moon was working with no money because the film doesn't even have any stop motion. The puppets, for the most part, are just being pulled by strings or other devices and this is certainly a first for the series. The visual look of them isn't all that impressive and this also means that there's more story than action but I'll admit to being a sucker by getting caught up in that story. I thought there were some major flaws in the film but mostly character development. The slow-wit for some reason turns smart and into a ladies man without any explanation. The doctor has some bad motives that come out of no where and I think the twist doesn't work that well. You have a bully local who beats up the slow-wit, sexually attacks the daughter and then breaks into her home yet I guess it never dawned on anyone to call the police. The love story aspect doesn't work either. With all of that said, I still got caught up with the characters because the three leads are actually pretty good in their roles. The puppets might be lacking in terms of special effects but they do get back their killer personalities and we get a couple death scenes that add on some extra gore. The Part 6 was dropped from the title and I'm guessing this was done to try and sell the movie as something new and original, which it pretty much is. I know fans were outraged that their beloved puppets were put in a new format but I still think it was a good decision and especially after the last two flicks.

It's suspenseful most of the way through, and at times (and I'll say several times) it's downright frightening. It introduced into the lingo one of the greatest and most memorable lines ever - the two simple words they're here (spoken by Heather O'Rourke as she stared at the white TV screen) and the performances throughout are excellent. The only thing that really detracted from this, at least in my opinion, was a decision to at times take the whole thing a little bit too far. Sometimes (not often, but enough that I felt it anyway) this seemed to delve into the realm of silly fantasy rather than frightening ghost story, when it really needed to keep the focus on the latter, which was its great strength. In particular, I thought that the last 20 minutes or so really went way too far. I would have been quite happy and finished the movie completely satisfied if this had ended with Tangina (played by the diminutive Zelda Rubinstein, who really worked in the role, if only because of the contrast of this very tiny woman taking on this horrible presence) simply declaring the house to be clean. That last 20 minutes offered an explanation for what had been happening - although we had already been given enough information to be able to guess at what was happening. In some ways it seemed like a fast forward replay of everything we had already seen (the strange force coming from the children's closet, etc.) and it just added things that to be seemed ridiculous and unnecessary, such as the pool full of skeletons and coffins popping up all over the place with the house eventually being swallowed up. That ending didn't become the climax of the movie for me; it was anti-climactic and I spent most of that time wondering why add this on?Still, if at times a bit too much, this was - I say again - a really good ghost story. You can't speak about this movie without mentioning Heather O'Rourke. She was brilliant. For such a young actress (I guess she would have been 5 or 6 when this was made) she made the part of Carol Ann her own. Her terror was absolutely believable. Her story (she died suddenly at the age of 12 soon after filming Poltergeist 3) must surely be one of the great tragedies in Hollywood history. Based on what I saw in this movie, it's so sad to think of the acting career she might have developed, because she didn't seem like a typical child actor who'd never be able to break out of that image. I think she'd have gone far in the business. Such a tragedy, which has led to all sorts of silly stories about the 3-movie Poltergeist series, with some people speaking of a curse on the project. There was no curse - just a very sad tale that attached itself to the series; a series that began with a very good opener.
