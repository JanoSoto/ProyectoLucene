Each of these veteran actors turns in a superlative performance.  Hanks is sullen and loyal to his chosen profession, but as he runs from the killer sent after him by the mob he begins to bond with his son and faces the reality that he hasn't been a very good father.  Fatherhood also comes into play for Paul Newman, who suffers because of the deeds of his own reckless son.  Connor Rooney is the one who has killed Mike Sullivan's family to cover up for a shooting witnessed by the Sullivan boy.  Newman is menacing as the local boss, but also human as he struggles with his own mistakes of fatherhood and his admiration and loyalty to Hanks' character.Jude Law plays the killer sent after Tom Hanks, and he is very good in the role.  His character also doubles as a crime scene photographer in an odd twist.  He plays the part of a contract killer with chilling effectiveness.This movie tells an interesting story and the acting is superb all around.  Sam Mendes, the director, has achieved an excellent follow-up to American Beauty, which incidentally (maybe), also dealt with fatherhood and immortality.I have only one slight reservation, and it may seem petty, but the score was almost a direct rip-off of the music from The Shawshank Redemption (not surprising since Thomas Newman did both).   Since the theme appeared throughout the film, it was a bit annoying to me.  Even the ending, which took part along a beach, was reminiscent (sort of) of that other film.Very good film and I highly recommend it.

The lyrics are just as awesome an accomplishment as the melody of the song. The animation on Mulan and the Captain of the Imperial army was very lifelike.

It started to slowly get worse towards the end of themovie when I couldn't really help but think about the specifics ofwhat was going on. Denzel, yeah he acted well. He was believable. Hawk?

(2001). What a fun movie, with emotion and lots of humor. Monsters Inc. shows that life is greatly enriched and energized with the presence of joyful children. One of the scenes that emphasizes the great energy of a happy child is when the main monsters, Sulley and Mike, bring a child, Boo, to their home in an attempt to hide her. So that she does not cry and scream zapping the energy of the city of Monstropolis, Mike makes her laugh thus creating an endless amount of energy enough to light up the entire city. Early on in this movie, children are perceived as toxic intruders in the city. The monsters work frantically to get Boo back to her own environment. However, with all the chaos that develops in trying to complete this task, one monster, Sulley, learns the joy of having a child in his life. Two scenes demonstrate the enrichment of a joyful child in one's life. The first scene is when Sulley puts Boo to bed for the first time after bringing her home; his heart begins to soften with the sweetness of Boo as she sleeps. The second scene depicting this is near the end when Sulley walks out onto the Laugh Floor with a clipboard in hand. On the clipboard taped under the paperwork is a piece from Boo's door and a picture she drew of him holding hands with her. Clearly, Sulley is energized with the love and happiness of Boo in his life. Another movie that follows the same concept of a joyful child enriching one's life is I Am Sam (2001). How ironic that the two movies came out the same year. In the movie I Am Sam, a mentally-challenged father faces many obstacles raising his daughter from birth. The ultimate challenge he encounters is fighting the legal system that believes the child should be removed from his care and placed into a foster home. Yet, because of the love she gives him and the happiness she brings to his world, he is energized to continue his battle seizing what belongs to him.Monsters Inc. suggests this theme throughout the movie as Sulley realizes that children are an asset and must be kept safe. No longer should they be scared. A wealth of goodness is added to life when happy children are present. Both the children and monsters benefit from the affect of humor as it creates laughter and radiates positive attitudes. A motif of children's toys is in almost every scene. With the toys in sight, it reminds us not to take life so seriously, that one forgets how to laugh and have fun. At the scream plant, the atmosphere is dull, dark and competitive at the beginning of the movie. It is all work and meeting quotas with the large scream board indicating each monster's performance. Near the end of the movie, you see the plant lit up with sunshine coming in the windows, balloons all-about, banners saying `Think Funny' and the board now labeled as the laugh board reflecting the `Joke of the Day'. Because Monsters Inc. focuses on the delight of children, it encompasses several angles with the majority being at eye-level, a level of a child. Early on in the movie, you see a deep-focus shot of all of the monsters coming onto the scream floor of the plant to begin work. This shot was adopted from the movie All The Right Stuff. The shot highlights the importance of these monsters and what they are about to do.Pete Docter has brilliantly mastered the art of computer-animation with this movie. So much detail is involved. One example is Boo's T-shirt that freely moves while her body stays in place. Her movements express her energy level through the scene with catching Cheerios in her mouth thrown to her by Sulley. Docter eases small viewers' minds as he creates a vision of monsters who really are not evil but rather just like one of themselves. They see monsters get into trouble for being bad. And yet, he portrays most monsters in a good light reinforcing that a child can bring out the best in them. So he turns closets once feared by children like himself, into a stage of entertaining monsters filled with enthusiasm. Monsters Inc. is a wonderful, whimsical film showcasing that children as well as monsters benefit from each other through laughter and a positive outlook in their lives.

It was so funny. And to top it all off, they put Joe Pesci in the middle of the movie which makes it 10x better in comedy wise. I thought the acting was great by Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Joe Pesci. I thought this was an important movie to make because in this movie, they told what happened to Martin Riggs' wife. It was powerful to see the emotion Martin Riggs had in this movie about his wife because it showed how important she was to him and it showed how much he missed her. The most dangerous thing to do is getting under Martin Riggs' skin but never talk about his wife in a bad way because if you do, there is no doubt that you will be badly injured. I think that's the message being brought into this film and that is very important. This movie was a great movie because it did have a lot of action, comedy and suspense and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like the Lethal Weapon film and who are Mel Gibson fans. I give it ***!!!!! ","genre":null},{"date":"11 July 2003","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This was a great movie. It was so funny.

No. It is, however, as close as you'll get to feeling like you are there as the tragedy unfolds on that fateful Sunday morning.  The eerieness of the impending attack is handled beautifully. Watching the perplexed looks on the faces of the locals as the Japanese planes fly in toward the harbor is enough to spook you.  It's that same look we all had as we watched the second jet hit the WTC-- awe and disbelief.  This movie is excellent in the attack sequences and pretty damn enjoyable during the rest. The love story is thin, but I've seen worse. And the director manages to capture that feeling of innocence that all the old-timers say existed before the attack. FOrget the critics -- see this movie.

I read Dennis' book and I have to stress that anyone who loves this film but who has not read the book should read it. I think they did a great job in adapting the novel to film although I could imagine the great temptation to include the very racy parts of the novel. If they did include them, the G rating would probably have needed to be changed to R. One of my favorite lines in the film is delivered so expertly by actress Coral Browne (Vera Charles), who upon being wakened out of a drunken sleep (with bottle still in hand) looks out the window at the sun and says Ohhh---that moon is bright. Another favorite line delivered by Russell (in Mame's comment about Vera Charles' phony English accent) When your from Pittsburgh, you have to do something. Rosalind Russell brought such magic to the character of Auntie Mame so much so, that I wish I had an Aunt like her. Auntie Mame helps stress the point to appreciate diversity in life and to live life to the fullest. I have often chosen to watch my copy of this film when feeling low and I can tell you it is a spirit lifter.
