It is partly about the end of the Old West, if you can call it that (I think the old west still exists in many places), and about the intrusion of easy oil money into cattle ranging culture. It's also about family dynamics, with tragedies not described and sadness dripping everywhere.The man in the middle is Paul Newman, playing Hud, and we aren't sure if he's a bitter selfish violent young man because of these past events or if he just ended up that way and helped, in his own way, cause those events. As we get to know Hud in his aimlessness (and Paul Newman is his hunky best here, so that's just fine for most people), we see this dusty dried up Texas outland and the emptiness, it seems, of life there, people always flipping on the radio or t.v. and hanging out drinking or doing chores.Unless you handle the cattle. This is what people have done for a living there, and Hud's father is an archetype of a good, honorable, wise, and stern man. We aren't sure if his severity was really part of Hud's malaise, but it's dangled there. But in the present situation, the old man, now ailing even as he works a hard day, is a model of decency, a contrast to the egotistical and rather lazy son of his who is pretty much interested in girls and drinking. A ranching crisis (foot and mouth disease) becomes a center piece in this larger plot, and it squeezes further the tensions.A separate element is an important one, interweaving with Hud's womanizing, and that is a housekeeper living in a cabin on the property, played by Patricia Neal. She's quite amazing as a likable, tough, and lonely woman who long ago escaped an abusive husband (and she won the Best Actress Oscar for it). She fills in as the missing friend to Hud, an absent mother to Hud's nephew who is now coming of age. And yet she isn't the wife of the old man in any way beyond doing the dishes, and so her presence acts more as a reminder of what all three of the males don't have in their lives. She carries the emotional load of the movie at times, and by the end shows one simple solution to the problems around her.Martin Ritt has directed a number of probing, gritty, real life movies (The Sound and the Fury starring Newman's wife Joanne Woodward and The Front at opposite ends of his career). This one, along with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, are probably his best two, also very serious. But they are also beautiful movies. In all of them there are characters with real depth and pathos. We know who we can feel for, even as the world crumbles around nearly everyone in nearly all four of these. Hud is filmed in such clean, bright greys and whites it really feels much more like dry old Texas than it would have in color, just as his Cold War masterpiece is charcoal and black much of the time. Cinematographer James Wong Howe, born in China and moved here when five years old, and director of music Elmer Bernstein are both Hollywood's legends with three Academy Awards between them. It shows. The movie is if nothing else very well made.Larry McMurty wrote the original story for this movie, and also co-wrote the screenplay for Brokeback Mountain, which shares a lot of the loneliness of the characters. The character of the housekeeper was originally a black woman, and I'm assuming this would have pressed too hard on social issues just beginning to break down in the early 1960s, so it was simplified by keeping it an all white cast. But the movie did push against certain censorship boundaries, including the simple admission (without showing it directly) of Hud having and bragging about his affair with a married woman.

It has now been several years since I first heard of Spy Kids, but I was far from eager to watch it. I knew it was a kiddie spy flick, like Agent Cody Banks, and even though it's been several years since I last saw that 2003 release, I can still remember being put off by its cheesiness. I would probably still be ignoring this 2001 kiddie spy flick if it weren't for renowned cartoonist and filmmaker Mike Judge in the cast, as small as his role here is. This movie generally isn't considered atrocious, but I knew it would be at least somewhat cheesy, so I was not surprised by its overall mediocrity.Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez were once enemy spies from different countries, sent to kill each other, but when they met, they soon ended up falling in love, getting married, and semi-retiring from the spy business. Nine years later, they are now the parents of two children, Carmen and Juni, who are both unaware of their parents' past. The two Cortez parents return to their spy jobs after several other spies go missing, and it looks like a children's TV show called Floop's Fooglies could be responsible! They leave Uncle Felix Gumm with the kids and set out to investigate. The two secret agents are soon captured on their mission, and when this happens, an alarm goes off in the Cortez home and the place is invaded! Uncle Felix tells Carmen and Juni the truth, which is that their parents are spies and he is not really their uncle. The two young siblings manage to escape, and set out to work as spies themselves and save their parents! As well as being an action adventure film, this is also supposed to be a comedy, but absolutely nothing made me laugh, and I guess a couple parts made me smile, but hardly even did that! The Now flushing your poop part is an example of juvenile kiddie humour in the movie, and it's also certainly not amusing watching the conflict between the Cortez siblings, with the name calling and such. The story didn't really grab me for the most part, either. I found the first 25 minutes of the film or so to be consistently dull (including the part showing how two enemy spies just suddenly changed their minds when they met), and later, I did find SOME adrenaline in it, thanks to the action, but not enough to distract me from the flaws. I didn't really care much for any of the characters, and Alan Cumming's performance in the role of Fegan Floop is rather weak. I could tell that this character was supposed to be one of the more comical ones, but he just provides more failed attempts at humour for the already unfunny film.

After a long break, it appears the franchise is about to return with another sequel called Spy Kids 4 All the Time in the World coming up, one by Robert Rodriguez, just like the first three. However, I doubt I'll be watching any of these, as watching the original Spy Kids didn't capture my interest well enough. Now, maybe a 6\/10 for this movie wouldn't be too much from me, due to the reasonably suspenseful parts (it may be a bit better than Agent Cody Banks), but in the end, it still left me with an underwhelming feeling.

We have a history, part of which I will omit here for some honor, but most I'll explain.Picture it Summer of 1982, Arizona. I was 8 years old and my parents took me to see The World According to Garp with the rational that it's Robin Williams (he was Popeye for my sake) so it has to be funny, despite the dreaded R-Rating my parents were opposed to. Not only were they shocked at the nudity, sexual situations and language, they found the movie boring and not-so-funny.What was funny, was that when they showed a woman's breasts, they covered my eyes yet leaving them wide open for the guy's locker room that, pretty much, showed everything. Heh, little did they know.Probably not so strange, those were the main two scenes\/memories I can recall from when I was eight and seeing this the first time. Obviously, the rest of the movie didn't leave too much of an impact, despite seeing myself in the role of Young Garp (James McCall) since we were relatively the same age. I guess I was either bored or concentrated too far on what I saw openly or through my parent's hand.Beyond the Rated-R Content had they known what a deep, long and melodramatic film this was, I'm sure I would've been sent off to see either The Secret of Nimh or Tron. Heck, I would've loved to see Raiders of the Lost Ark's reissue as I don't recall seeing that in the theatres. My guess, they would've vetoed The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.Anyhoo&#x85;fast forward. Present Day, also Arizona. I just watched it again, only for the second time, upon a friend's recommendation. My reaction?Well, the locker room scene wasn't what I remembered it as&#x85; Just kidding. Overall, I believe the movie's title is wrong. Sure, the movie's main character is, in fact, Garp (Robin Williams,) but I got the feeling this is really Nurse Jenny's (Glenn Close) movie. And Close did a FANTASTIC job as the strict, but free-spirited, WOMAN-FIRST single mother, something simply unheard of in the 1940s and on through Garp, her only child's life.Sure, Jenny was a tad bit controlling and had wild ideas about how sex was bad, lust worse and men suck, but Close showed such incredible depth that I would loved to get to know her in real life. That is, if her men-hating groupies (today they would be militant-lesbians, and perhaps some of these were) would let me near her.The character Garp does feel throughout that he's taking a backseat to his mother, and after watching the movie, I'd have to agree.

Not only were they shocked at the nudity, sexual situations and language, they found the movie boring and not-so-funny.What was funny, was that when they showed a woman's breasts, they covered my eyes yet leaving them wide open for the guy's locker room that, pretty much, showed everything.

It's a convincing picture of the western islands off Scotland. The cool wind rushes across the bluffs and the puffy clouds are chased up and down the barren hills by their own shadows. And this is 1945 and in black and white. Special effects provide persuasive gales and rainstorms.In the middle of it all is Wendy Hiller, a young lady who knows where she's going. The introduction tells us that at age one she crawled in one direction across the floor. At age five she wrote a letter to Father Christmas, demanding a pair of silk stocking -- and not that artificial fabric either. At twelve, she had her stockings. By this time my heart was beginning to ship some water because I was reminded of my ex wife.However, this is a fairy tale. Hiller becomes engaged to one of the richest industrialists in England. Says her Dad, Why, he's old enough to be your father, and Hiller replies with dignity, And what's wrong with YOU? Her fiancé is waiting for her on the far-off isle of Kilgoran where they will be married and spend their honeymoon. He's rented a castle there from the Laird of the Manor or whatever his title is. Alas, Hiller reaches the next to the last island in the chain and is stranded there first by fog and then by howling gale.At this point, we're waiting for the romantic stranger to show up in the little town because we don't believe for one minute that Hiller is REALLY going to marry that robber baron. Well, Roger Livesey is a stranger, and an officer in His Majesty's Navy too, AND the owner of the island of Kilgoren who is renting the castle out. I hope I'm not mixing up the geography but I might be, because Livesey seems to own a ruined castle just outside the little village where he and Hiller are stranded by the weather. I don't know. Can you own two castles? No matter. Livesey might not be romantic but he's a good-natured guy with a sense of humor and principle. The gale lasts for days. Hiller and Livesey are increasingly attracted to one another and Hiller prays to get to Kilgoren and her fiancé so she doesn't fall for the wrong man.Meanwhile they enjoy all the amiability and hospitality of the little village. Three pipers -- count 'em, three -- have been imported from the mainland for a Ceilidh celebrating the 60th wedding anniversary of the old Campbell couple. It's a touching moment when the elderly husband is asked to say a few words between jigs and drams, stands up, croaks a bit, shrugs, and gives up, to great applause.In a way, this is a city versus country movie. There are a lot of them about. Murnau's Sunrise may have been one of the earlier examples. The materialistic and driven person comes from the city -- here, it's Manchester -- and discovers the real meaning of life among the happy peasants, given to eating, drinking, singing, and whistling while they work, at ease with themselves and with nature. More sophisticated examples put a blemish or two on peasant life, like The Quiet Man and Zorba the Greek. At any rate, Hiller insists on being taken by boat to Kilgoran despite the turbulent sea and there's considerable adventure in their attempt. The attempt, though, fails, as it must, if Hiller and Livesey are to be together at the end.An altogether pleasant, if minor, viewing experience. No breakthroughs.

The opening twenty minutes are still as breathtaking, shocking and disturbing realistic as they were back in 1998. It is hard to imagine that it has now been over twelve years since Saving Private Ryan broke the mold of World War II film making.Winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Director for Spielberg, Best Cinematography, and Sound, which was astonishing, even by today's standards, it failed to win Best Picture, losing out to Shakespeare In Love. Shakespeare In Love! Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but easily forgettable compared to Ryan, only proving yet again that if you touch upon the British monarchy you get Oscars.The film is a fictional account of four brothers, all serving in the U.S. Army, three of which were killed in action on or around the D-Day landings. The fourth, James Ryan played by Matt Damon is somewhere in Europe, and Tom Hanks with his platoon are sent to bring him home, to spare his mother anymore heartache.Tom Hanks, who was also snubbed at the 1998 Oscars for his perfect performance as Captain Miller, the everyman who was losing himself in the horrors of war, underplayed his role perfectly. He is believable on every level, emotionally, physically and has a sense of subtly with makes him of Hollywood's greats.The action is visceral, gritty and horrifying. But never played for crass effect. Scenes of soldiers intestines spilling out, limbs flying a sunder and brutal killing left, right and centre are recreated for one purpose. To truly demonstrate the horrors of war, and to change our perceptions of the global conflict which had almost become a joke, a setting for gung- ho action films, where the Yanks reign supreme and single-handedly win the war.This shows troops crying, hurting and making decisions which should not be made under any moral circumstances, but you understand why, whether you agree or not. There is no doubt that Spielberg is not innocent of making an American film, but it is about as even-handed as you might expect, with the exception of Tora! Tora! Tora! or The Longest Day.So, the action is first-rate, graphic and perfectly toned to recreate to horror of the last century's greatest and most of destructive conflicts. But that's only half the story.The other half is the talking, reminiscing and the almost sepia tone is more than a little cloying. The U.S. General's monologues, which seem to consist almost entirely of Lincoln quotations are overly sentimental, erring on the side of sloppy patriotism rather than Jingoism, which is hardly a bad thing but it isn't good either.The civilian scenes, such as Mrs Ryan, washing a plate as she sees the car drive down to road to inform her of her sons deaths are so sentimental that they jar against the realism of the war scenes. It's not so much contrast as it is as extreme as black and white.The action is obviously interspersed, as all war films are, with rest stops and moments of talking, pondering etc., but the scenes drag on too long and disrupt the tone of the film. On the other hand, the direction is brilliant when explaining the situations during and around the action, but Spielberg seemed to think that we needed these sloppy and often boring moments, such as The Church, and the outside the cafe in Ramelle, to express the emotional torment of the characters, but I think that these scenes are so boring and pointless that I' can hardly remember them, as my attention drifts off during them! But I do have an understanding of the soldiers, and this was achieved, quite adorably without these scenes.Overall, this is a film of two halves if ever there was one. The battle scenes and the journey through war-torn France are brilliant, gritty and educational, but the scenes of American sentimentality are in danger of derailing the whole film. Many feel that is the best war film of all time. I do not agree, favouring Black Hawk Down over this, but I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that Blank Hawk Down owes a debt to Saving Private Ryan, by opening the door to the gritty war dramas of the naughties and to the style itself.This film is on of the most important contributions to cinema ever, and has done so much to finally show to true nature of WWII and war in general. But even though I would rate this 10\/10 if it was just for the war scenes, the slop just gets in the way and devalues what should have been perfection.

The opening twenty minutes are still as breathtaking, shocking and disturbing realistic as they were back in 1998. It is hard to imagine that it has now been over twelve years since Saving Private Ryan broke the mold of World War II film making.Winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Director for Spielberg, Best Cinematography, and Sound, which was astonishing, even by today's standards, it failed to win Best Picture, losing out to Shakespeare In Love. Shakespeare In Love! Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but easily forgettable compared to Ryan, only proving yet again that if you touch upon the British monarchy you get Oscars.The film is a fictional account of four brothers, all serving in the U.S. Army, three of which were killed in action on or around the D-Day landings. The fourth, James Ryan played by Matt Damon is somewhere in Europe, and Tom Hanks with his platoon are sent to bring him home, to spare his mother anymore heartache.Tom Hanks, who was also snubbed at the 1998 Oscars for his perfect performance as Captain Miller, the everyman who was losing himself in the horrors of war, underplayed his role perfectly. He is believable on every level, emotionally, physically and has a sense of subtly with makes him of Hollywood's greats.The action is visceral, gritty and horrifying. But never played for crass effect. Scenes of soldiers intestines spilling out, limbs flying a sunder and brutal killing left, right and centre are recreated for one purpose. To truly demonstrate the horrors of war, and to change our perceptions of the global conflict which had almost become a joke, a setting for gung- ho action films, where the Yanks reign supreme and single-handedly win the war.This shows troops crying, hurting and making decisions which should not be made under any moral circumstances, but you understand why, whether you agree or not. There is no doubt that Spielberg is not innocent of making an American film, but it is about as even-handed as you might expect, with the exception of Tora! Tora! Tora! or The Longest Day.So, the action is first-rate, graphic and perfectly toned to recreate to horror of the last century's greatest and most of destructive conflicts. But that's only half the story.The other half is the talking, reminiscing and the almost sepia tone is more than a little cloying. The U.S. General's monologues, which seem to consist almost entirely of Lincoln quotations are overly sentimental, erring on the side of sloppy patriotism rather than Jingoism, which is hardly a bad thing but it isn't good either.The civilian scenes, such as Mrs Ryan, washing a plate as she sees the car drive down to road to inform her of her sons deaths are so sentimental that they jar against the realism of the war scenes. It's not so much contrast as it is as extreme as black and white.The action is obviously interspersed, as all war films are, with rest stops and moments of talking, pondering etc., but the scenes drag on too long and disrupt the tone of the film. On the other hand, the direction is brilliant when explaining the situations during and around the action, but Spielberg seemed to think that we needed these sloppy and often boring moments, such as The Church, and the outside the cafe in Ramelle, to express the emotional torment of the characters, but I think that these scenes are so boring and pointless that I' can hardly remember them, as my attention drifts off during them! But I do have an understanding of the soldiers, and this was achieved, quite adorably without these scenes.Overall, this is a film of two halves if ever there was one. The battle scenes and the journey through war-torn France are brilliant, gritty and educational, but the scenes of American sentimentality are in danger of derailing the whole film. Many feel that is the best war film of all time. I do not agree, favouring Black Hawk Down over this, but I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that Blank Hawk Down owes a debt to Saving Private Ryan, by opening the door to the gritty war dramas of the naughties and to the style itself.This film is on of the most important contributions to cinema ever, and has done so much to finally show to true nature of WWII and war in general. But even though I would rate this 10\/10 if it was just for the war scenes, the slop just gets in the way and devalues what should have been perfection.

Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay).SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white.Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a café in Holborn.The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet.The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard.The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

So there is no sensible relation with the environment, world that i dreamed. He is at the moment accounting for his life, actions which were in this life, this is so much sorrowful that not my eyes but my heart is crying, suffering. How much have i been deceived, made mistake throughout my life. In my mind were some wishes going about, like i wish michael carlione wouldn't have killed his elder brother, at last he himself like his father died on a chair all alone inspite of the trasure, proerty, money, fame. It is so sad inspite of being just a film. I'm not sure if al pacino lives, even he -took a deep breath for sad- Alas me too have died one day all alone, and now i'm asked to account for my life, my actions, my desires. However, i have deceived myself in this deceiving world, shut the sound that tells the truth, the right thing. I have always pursued something seemingly nice but in fact harmful,deceiving as now.As it were, i was the servant, -that is a bit indignity-the dog of this bad sound. Alaaas... Alaaas. What will it help if i were a godfather like don vito carlione or michael. At last, the suffering, very suffering but with the witness of thousands of deads everyday the death, the reckoning after death. I think i have no remedy other than seek forgiveness and help from God, really no remedy else. I always remember the scene that michael was falling and dying on his chair alone, and the sad film music is playing in my mind. Very sad... What remedy else could i have that, now it is really the most important need if anyone has a remedy...

It's entertaining, I admit it, but the outcome and the horror genre in here are mistaken. It's basically 136 minutes of conversation, questions and mystery. Nothing happens in this movie; just like in The Ghost Writer, we spend the whole film waiting for something and it ends poorly. How can you not have a single jump in a two hours long horror movie??? There was just one scene in the end that I thought was a little suspenseful; it was when Rose was messing with some towels in a closet with a camera that kept fading to black. But, unfortunately, like the rest of this movie, it doesn't fright or scare. If you want a movie similar to this and actually good, go see The Owen (either original or remake, both are great).Now about the acting... is that for real?? Mia Farrow really sucks!!! Her acting is laughable, there are girls in my neighborhood that may act better than her. Rosemary's Baby is really a shame for movie industry (and for IMDb for such high rating).

I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe &#x85; I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller &#x85; I, well, my verdict is clear GREAT MOVIE Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk) I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman) I told you why this movie is great, it's just &#x85; thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me &#x85; GREAT MOVIEJuror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker) First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence 12 Angry Men delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIEJuror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum) What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is GREAT MOVIEJuror #6 (Edward Binns, painter) A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIEJuror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman) Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well &#x85; I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIEJuror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect) This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. 12 Angry Men is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIEJuror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired) This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching 12 Angry Men I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIEJuror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner) I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button &#x85; you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIEJuror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker) No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIEJuror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive) Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know &#x85; you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C &#x85; let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why 12 Angry Men is a GREAT MOVIE ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2011","score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach) Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech &#x85; it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need &#x85;uh &#x85; the thrills &#x85; and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger.

In 1971, Alexandria, Virginia was a town against the integration of the black and white high schools much like the rest of the south. Obviously, this sentiment is going to trickle down to the newly combined high school and its football team. The tension in town really increases when black head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is chosen as the high school's football coach. Herman Boone is given the difficult task of trying to coach a football team that is divided by color. The football players are constantly fighting and at odds with each other. At the center of team's conflict are two pivotal players. The black players' main influence is Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) where the white players' tend to be Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst). Even Herman Boone is not exempt from the conflict as he constantly runs into problems with the team's assistant coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Through all of this, the team starts to come together after an influential run to Gettysburg. The lighting really made this part even more profound and impactive. It presented a bleak, gloomy mood as Coach Boone spoke about the reality that many men died for what was still relevant in 1971. This tied to the theme as there is not a more important uniting time then when soldiers are fighting in wars together. I also think the angle was important as it effectively made the scene more surreal as we are listening to Herman Boone talk. The angle helps us really focus on what is being said. It works because it really makes you think about his words as Coach Boone is speaking. Collectively, this scene symbolized the darkness that racism and prejudice can present. It was also a foreshadowing for the adversity the team would encounter after getting back to Alexandria and starting high school. The team might have been ready to look at each other as men and not skin colors. Unfortunely, the rest of the town is not. The team gets back to the real word and is met with this harsh realization. This in turn helps emphasize the theme even more. Even though it is two different genres of film, I can see a comparison of this film to the movie Wildcats which stars Goldie Hawn. This is simply for the fact that my chosen theme could fit both of these movies effectively. In closing, Remember the Titans epitomizes what fighting against all odds can really be about.
