[{"date":"2 December 1998","score":"","review":"  Elizabeth the First's ascension to the throne has been reinvented as a Gothic Romance.  There is no such thing as understatement here.  More is definitely MORE!!!  But it has a wonderful performance by Cate Blanchett, who grows and changes as we watch.  And some solid support from Rush, Eccleston, Ardant, etc.  Don't pay too much attention to total historical accuracy or the fuzzy script.  It is very entertaining and fast-paced.  And the production values, costumes, music (when not overwhelming the soundtrack) etc. are all quite good.

When I first saw the film I was turned against it by the outrageous sets (bare 11 century stone walls in a 16th century palace - I don't think so) and unlikely scenes (French transvestites in the vestry), but I thought the history believable, as I've never studied the period. Then I got home and to my dismay found that the history was greatly distorted, not least in chronology.Then I realised how to view this film - its not docudrama history like 'Private Ryan' or 'Platoon'.  This film is a history in the Shakespearean sense - a series of set pieces conveying the drama of the day, with sets and costume, situations and dialogue, all splendid but with little pretence of realism; as such, it's highly polished.Thumbs up for using the Greatest medieval building in the world too.
