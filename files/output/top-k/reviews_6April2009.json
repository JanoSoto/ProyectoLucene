And the sound of huge amounts of water hurling over the edge amplifies the majesty of the natural scenery. But the script's story seems uninspired.A discordant couple George Loomis (Joseph Cotten), and his wife, Rose (Marilyn Monroe), are staying at a tourist lodge near the falls. The two do not get along. Rose has a younger suitor on the sly. Meanwhile, another lodge couple unintentionally become involved in George and Rose's situation.The story is rather simple. But important events take place off-camera. These plot omissions may result in some confusion as to what is going on.A big problem in this film is the miscasting. That Marilyn Monroe would marry someone as old and thoroughly unpleasant as the Joseph Cotten character is not credible. Yet, with a more appropriate partner, the film's plot, as is, would not work. Either the script's plot needed to be rewritten, or actors other than Monroe and Cotten should have been cast.Further, there's not much back-story here. If we had known a little more about Rose and her husband, maybe we could better identify with them. As is, it's hard to get interested in their marital problems. Both the plot and the characters needed a little more development.Characters spend a lot of time walking around up and down stairs, on sidewalks, along wooden bridges. Some of this no doubt is deliberate to showcase Monroe's curvy figure. But there are times when all that walking around comes across as plot filler.The Ray Cutler character (Max Showalter) is an irritating person. I think the problem, again, is in the script characterization. The film's ending has some good suspense, though it's the result of a contrived plot point.The outdoor visuals are by far the best element of this film. I would not have minded if the director had thrown the film's script over the falls, and just given us a tour of that magnificent natural wonder.

Nevertheless, she has been seeing a shrink, for a pervasive unhappiness. Lately, too, she has begun to suspect that her husband is unfaithful, for he has not been making any advances to Ann. Causing her some grief, also, is her unmarried younger sister, Cindy (Laura San Giacomo), who is somewhat of a nymphomaniac and is pretty catty about relating her experiences to her sister.

As it happens, it turns out Graham is no trouble at all, but a handsome, seemingly kind man who really listens to Ann when she is speaking. But, after helping Graham find an appropriate apartment, Ann becomes uncomfortable when Graham asks her a few questions about her marriage and sex life. This is compounded even more when Ann tells Cindy about Graham and Cindy trots off to meet the new man in town, with considerable haste. Later, Cindy tells her sis that Graham has some highly unusual habits and possesses a collection of homemade videotapes, which consist of various women telling all about their sex lives to the camera.

Fosse took a beautiful little musical and saw immediately how to translate it into a film. Lots of us missed the romance of the landlady and the grocer, along with the lovely song, Marriage, but the issue a hand was that Fosse and Kander and Ebb agreed the subject of the insidious rise of the Nazi movement needed to be handled in a much bigger way.Bob Fosse's vision and instincts were perfect. Kander and Ebb wrote some new music. Joel Grey came from Broadway as the centerpiece of the film -- and he won a much deserved Oscar for his role as the ever so creepy emcee. The romance of the seniors was replaced by a romance between two younger Jews, one of whom is concealing that fact in an effort to avoid Nazi harassment. A very rich and very, very decedent character is introduced to underline the moral decrepitude of Sally Bowles and to facilitate displaying the downward spiral of Germany into the Nazi influence.I've never thought Liza Minelli was a great actress and I still don't. She's a very talented performer, though not nearly so as her mother. Bob Fosse directed her performance in the role of her life. He got everything she had and rolled it into Sally Bowles. Michael York could have been stronger, but that would not have fit his role. He was just a smart and very naive man who was an instrument of whichever character wanted to manipulate him. In fact, all but the Emcee and Sally Bowles are characters totally subjugated by the story.The film takes us on a brilliant downward spiral ride with extraordinary music and the amoral emcee making sure we take notice of the fact we're on the road to hell. The rich German character is a sort of assistant emcee who does his job away from the cabaret. He makes sure we see that Sally Bowles cares nothing for anyone but herself, a self that is all veneer and no real substance.Of all the scenes in the film, I recall one with a palpable shudder. It takes place on a beautiful day. The Sally Bowles menage-a-trois is off on a drive in the country and stops at an open air biergarten. A beautiful young Aryan boy in the Nazi youth organization rises to sing a song. His voice is even more beautiful than his appearance. The song, Tomorrow Belongs To Me is a heart-stopping scary indicator of how far Germany has fallen under the Nazi influence. This scene is as scary and creepy a scene as I've ever watched in all my years of movie-going.Bob Fosse was up against The Godfather when his Cabaret came out. There's no doubt The Godfather was a great film, but even with a projected tsunami of awards going its' way, all the key aspects of Cabaret beat it out. Liza Minelli won an Oscar for her morally bankrupt Sally Bowles. Joel Grey won an Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the true heart of the musical, The Emcee. The cinematography, always perfect, often totally off the charts brilliant won an Oscar. And, of course, Bob Fosse won his Oscar for best director.What a shame Bob Fosse always burned his candle at both ends -- and with the force of a flamethrower. If he had managed to stay with us longer his body of work might have shone at least as bright, if not the brightest, of all film directors. Did anyone out there see his biography-pic of Lenny Bruce? Not everything he did was a film musical. On Broadway his light as a dancer\/choreographer\/director shines so bright that even today you need to wear dark glasses to look at it. His first film set a new standard for film musicals, and set the bar so high I wonder if anyone will even approach it. Such was his brilliance, such is the brilliance of his Cabaret.

The two stories share much of the same plot, and characters, yet manages to be a completely different story. I believe that a lot of this can be is represented by one small difference; the difference in titles. Unlike, the other film versions of the book, Clueless does not share a title with it. I believe titles to hold large importance over the general meaning of whatever they have labeled, and the difference in title makes it quite obvious that the two works have different meanings. A book entitled Emma is clearly about Emma, whereas a movie entitled Clueless is clearly more about the main character's cluelessness than the main character herself.There are a few things that make this clear. The movie version is, first of all, in a more modern society, and most importantly, in a school environment. By being surrounded by professors, and other students, her cluelessness is much more exaggerated. The scenes where she is giving lectures to her peers really show this quite well, as most of the students laugh at her, the teacher clearly thinks she's an idiot, and that one rival girl looks like she wants to kill her. Her lack of driving ability, a skill that even the most average of people are expected to have, is clearly a nod towards her vapidness. Some characters, or at least their personalities, seem to be put in just to show how clueless she is. Her father, for instance, is an important lawyer; clearly quite competent and wildly different from Emma's father. His constant yelling for her to do better, (even in his misguided way) makes it clear that she isn't doing all that well, academically. Even the gay friend that she originally had a crush on had dressed better than she did, a skill she had always been the best at in the past. Cher's character is clearly developed to be a girl who has almost nothing except her beauty and good heart; her influence comes from others' love for her, and not from anything she's accomplished. Emma may not have been the most beautiful girl in the world, but at least she had some abilities in painting or on the piano, and her lack of knowledge was not nearly as apparent in a world where education wasn't standardized. Furthermore, Emma's weak and needy father make for many scenes that show off Emma's independence and use as a daughter. A final issue that can be raised on this topic is the goal of both stories. Obviously the titles of a story reflect a lot on the goals of the author, and it is not different for these two mediums. Clueless, unlike Emma, seems to be about the main character getting over her cluelessness. She realizes at the end of the movie, when she falls in love with her step-brother Josh, that she doesn't want to be liked only for her beauty. She starts watching the news and participating (and even organizing) in charity work in an attempt to better herself as a person, and to show people &#x96; especially Josh &#x96; that she's not just a ditz with a credit card. Emma was not so much about Emma getting over her cluelessness, but about Emma herself, and all of the events related to her that transpire. Jane Austen never makes it clear that Emma needed to make herself over, and start doing charity work or any kind of studying to be a better person. Jane Austen did not make Emma a character who made mistakes because she was too dumb, she just made Emma a character who was too strong minded to see that she was making a mistake. Mr. Knightley's quote Better to be without sense than to misapply it as you do, shows this pretty well. Emma is a book about Emma realizing her strong mindedness and changing out of her own will for fear of hurting further people. Mr. Knightley's marriage proposal happened to be a nice side effect, but nothing more. Clueless is a movie about Cher slowly coming to the realization that she has very little in the way of useful skills, and that if she were to ever impress Josh enough to like her, she had to wise up, or get a clue. The two characters' motives were completely different, and therefore I think the stories were completely different.While it is true that both stories had very similar plot points, uneventful structure, and settings, the main characters, themselves, were fundamentally different in a few ways, as this essay has shown, and therefore shows that that is really all that they had in common. Their titles, which are both very fitting to the respective book or movie, show that they were about completely different people, with different motives, and personalities. Though both main characters were kind hearted and good natured, Emma had some form of underlying morality that guided her later self-discovery, while Cher had nothing more than her selfish desires to feel better about herself and impress a boy. If Josh had been unintelligent but instead wildly interested in lawn mowing, Cher would have just as easily dedicated her self-discovering moments towards learning new things about lawn mowing. Emma would have become the Emma at the end of the book knowing Mr. Knightley would not fall for her, and in fact did do just that.

By being surrounded by professors, and other students, her cluelessness is much more exaggerated. The scenes where she is giving lectures to her peers really show this quite well, as most of the students laugh at her, the teacher clearly thinks she's an idiot, and that one rival girl looks like she wants to kill her. Her lack of driving ability, a skill that even the most average of people are expected to have, is clearly a nod towards her vapidness. Some characters, or at least their personalities, seem to be put in just to show how clueless she is. Her father, for instance, is an important lawyer; clearly quite competent and wildly different from Emma's father. His constant yelling for her to do better, (even in his misguided way) makes it clear that she isn't doing all that well, academically. Even the gay friend that she originally had a crush on had dressed better than she did, a skill she had always been the best at in the past. Cher's character is clearly developed to be a girl who has almost nothing except her beauty and good heart; her influence comes from others' love for her, and not from anything she's accomplished. Emma may not have been the most beautiful girl in the world, but at least she had some abilities in painting or on the piano, and her lack of knowledge was not nearly as apparent in a world where education wasn't standardized. Furthermore, Emma's weak and needy father make for many scenes that show off Emma's independence and use as a daughter. A final issue that can be raised on this topic is the goal of both stories. Obviously the titles of a story reflect a lot on the goals of the author, and it is not different for these two mediums. Clueless, unlike Emma, seems to be about the main character getting over her cluelessness. She realizes at the end of the movie, when she falls in love with her step-brother Josh, that she doesn't want to be liked only for her beauty. She starts watching the news and participating (and even organizing) in charity work in an attempt to better herself as a person, and to show people &#x96; especially Josh &#x96; that she's not just a ditz with a credit card. Emma was not so much about Emma getting over her cluelessness, but about Emma herself, and all of the events related to her that transpire. Jane Austen never makes it clear that Emma needed to make herself over, and start doing charity work or any kind of studying to be a better person. Jane Austen did not make Emma a character who made mistakes because she was too dumb, she just made Emma a character who was too strong minded to see that she was making a mistake. Mr. Knightley's quote Better to be without sense than to misapply it as you do, shows this pretty well. Emma is a book about Emma realizing her strong mindedness and changing out of her own will for fear of hurting further people. Mr. Knightley's marriage proposal happened to be a nice side effect, but nothing more. Clueless is a movie about Cher slowly coming to the realization that she has very little in the way of useful skills, and that if she were to ever impress Josh enough to like her, she had to wise up, or get a clue. The two characters' motives were completely different, and therefore I think the stories were completely different.While it is true that both stories had very similar plot points, uneventful structure, and settings, the main characters, themselves, were fundamentally different in a few ways, as this essay has shown, and therefore shows that that is really all that they had in common. Their titles, which are both very fitting to the respective book or movie, show that they were about completely different people, with different motives, and personalities. Though both main characters were kind hearted and good natured, Emma had some form of underlying morality that guided her later self-discovery, while Cher had nothing more than her selfish desires to feel better about herself and impress a boy. If Josh had been unintelligent but instead wildly interested in lawn mowing, Cher would have just as easily dedicated her self-discovering moments towards learning new things about lawn mowing. Emma would have become the Emma at the end of the book knowing Mr. Knightley would not fall for her, and in fact did do just that.

The two stories share much of the same plot, and characters, yet manages to be a completely different story. I believe that a lot of this can be is represented by one small difference; the difference in titles. Unlike, the other film versions of the book, Clueless does not share a title with it. I believe titles to hold large importance over the general meaning of whatever they have labeled, and the difference in title makes it quite obvious that the two works have different meanings.

They were unamused by a scene with a tied up young girl and a mandrill, and so I ended up not seeing the film until some years later. I've seen it a few times now, and though perhaps the least of Clive Barkers great forays into direction, lacking the immense gruesome brilliance of Hellraiser or the thrilling monster laden madness of Nightbreed, it is more coherent than Nightbreed and acres ahead of most horror fare of the mid 90's. The plot sees a private investigator, Harry D'Amour becoming embroiled in the dangerous world of magic, through dealing with a great illusionist named Swann with a dark past involving an evildoer named Nix. The opening to this film is superb, a flashback to a cult compound led by the malign Nix, with an incredibly chilling atmosphere and some disturbing moments. As the film moves to the modern day and centers around D'Amour things slow down and go more into a sort of fantasy noir territory, though not without splashes of grue and a good deal of foreboding, as things heat up again in building to coming excitement. Acting wise Kevin J. O'Connor is great as Swann, twitchy, nervous and pretty weird, wholly convincing as a man of great powers but beset by fears. As his beautiful wife, Famke Jansenn is a tad underused but is good on the eye and carries her role nicely. Scott Bakula is vaguely bland as D'Amour, but I thought this relatively weak pairing worked well as a counterpoint to the spiralling madness around them. Most interesting are Barry del Sherman as gay hit-man Butterfield, with a kinky, sinister edge and a performance of ferocious physicality, especially in a couple of fights and Daniel von Bargen as Nix, playing the role with a booming malevolence that is less scary horror villain and more fantastical demon. The film is generally well written, with some great lines, especially for the bad characters and von Bargen gives all of his evil dialogue maximum power. As well as the dialogue working nicely, there is also a lot of thematic interest, with some gay themes relating to Butterfield and his partner, the relationship between Swann and Nix and also tied into the whole business of magic and its practitioners or those involved with it in the film. The film takes a freaky look at cult obsession and magic too. The only real problems I had with this film relate to some of the special effects work and the ending. There are some instances where animation effects are used that really date the film and don't look terribly good. Normally I wouldn't criticise effects in a film but better ones were used in Hellraiser and Nightbreed and in the case of Hellraiser some were of a similar type to ones in Lord of Illusions but done much better. Also, the finale is a tad unsatisfying in some respects, definitely less grisly than it should have been and a bit cheesy. Its fun, but definitely doesn't match the opening or some other moments in the film. More nastiness splashed over the course of the film might have been nice too, but things stay interesting anyway so I can't complain to much. Altogether, this is a rich, potent and sometimes pretty scary horror film, Barker does a fine job directing for the most part, handling tension and nastiness with great skill and maintaining a sinister bubbling brew of potent horror throughout. He has done better, but I still recommend this highly indeed, one of the best horror films of the 90's.

While this film gives a human and somewhat likable persona to Starkweather's image it is still a disturbing film on several levels.The cast is dominated by a young Charlie Sheen and an even younger Sissy Spacek as the doomed lovers on their cross country killing spree. Sheen's character, Kit, is an unmotivated loser with no real ambition or drive. Spacek's Holly comes off as a shy and introverted young girls who is mostly heard in voice over as she waxes poetic about her doomed relationship with Kit.It dosen't seem that Holly is actually in love with Kit and she often times appears to just be along for the ride in an attempt to escape her repressive past. She finds Kit endearing at first, but grows tired of him throughout the course of the film, eventually abandoning him in the end. Sheen's character is a bit more interesting to watch. Taking a stand and questioning authority for the first time in his life, he comes to realize that he has power and prestige based on his random acts of violence. Much like a wolf coming of age in a land full of sheep.Having grown up in the Midwest, I was struck by how this film captured the tone and feel of the vast American heartland in the 1950s. It is seen here in almost surrealistic terms, with townscapes and landscapes that are mostly devoid of people, as if the world were empty except for the main characters and odd people that they happen to come across.Near the end of the film, Kit knows he is doomed as the society he has run amok in starts to constrict around him. Instead of making an earnest effort to escape, he becomes wrapped up in his own notoriety and is transformed into one of the first media stars. In his final scenes he is seen charming his captors and giving away trivial person possessions, knowing they will be worth something simply because 'he' owned them.The scenes of violence in this film are almost happenstance and their deaths seem random and without meaning. No reason is given for them and until the end, the killer goes unpunished. This film is a prelude to the pulp fiction dramas of the late 90s where violence is a central theme of the story (think Pulp Fiction or SinCity). The viewer can't help but be captivated by this film and its' dream-like journey through a time and place that seems asleep or in some sort of malaise.

Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves. We didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be. In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film.

I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable.

However, it's been six years since I first saw this Austin Powers sequel, and there are comedy films I found highly amusing at the time which I've found rather dull in recent years. Fortunately, this is not one of them. It has held up better than certain other silly comedies I saw around that time. My last couple viewings of this one certainly haven't lived up to my previous ones, as I have found it to be more of a hit-and-miss comedy than I did before, but at least I still found it funny enough for the most part.Dr. Evil has figured out how Austin Powers always succeeds in foiling his evil plans&#x85;the secret agent's mojo! So, the madman has created a time machine, which he uses to travel back to 1969, two years after Powers was frozen, to steal his mojo and continue his plans for world domination! While Austin Powers is still in 1999, unaware of his foe's time travel, his love-making session is cut short as he immediately knows what he has just lost! He is soon informed by Basil about what Dr. Evil has done, and sent back to 1969, where he is to try and retrieve his mojo and once again foil the evil doctor's plans to take over the world. After he arrives back in the 60's, he is soon joined by CIA agent Felicity Shagwell, who becomes his sidekick on this mission. Together, they must try and found out where Dr. Evil's hideout is, as the madman plans to blow up Washington D.C.! This sequel showed Mike Myers continuing in the roles of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, but he also introduced a new alter ego, Fat B%$#&*%, Dr. Evil's stereotypical Scottish henchmen, who weighs one metric ton, and adds quite a bit of toilet humour to the film. I was a fan of this character when I was a teenager, but no longer care much for his gross-out antics. Heather Graham's performance as Austin Powers' sidekick also brings this movie down. The way she says her lines is sometimes almost embarrassing. Fortunately, this sequel did introduce at least one amusing new character, Dr. Evil's miniature clone, Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer. Also, the original characters who returned in this film are still funny, if they were in the first place. We get more of the same antics from Myers' two previous alter egos, including more humorous conflict between Dr. Evil and his son. Like the original, this sequel has a number of comic highlights, such as Dr. Evil taunting Number Two while bouncing a big globe in his face, the crude shadow gag, Mini-Me's sudden attack on Austin Powers, and more.It seems Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me is generally considered inferior to its predecessor (like most sequels), and I guess I'm now with the majority, which wasn't the case a few years ago, though I've definitely never been as disappointed by it as certain other fans of the original Austin Powers International Man of Mystery have been. Some gags from the original Austin Powers movie from 1997 were rehashed for this 1999 sequel, but they tend to still be funny, and the film also introduced some new elements to the franchise, some good and some bad, as I've pointed out. With this first sequel to Myers' James Bond spoof, the comedian brought us more crude and sometimes juvenile humour (like he did again with the second sequel, Austin Powers in Goldmember, in 2002), which some like and some obviously hate with a passion. Despite the flaws I've mentioned, I still think this is another decent Bond spoof overall, like the original, and unlike several other Bond spoofs I've seen.

The film itself is a sort of horror-chiller film. The story certainly is not original but while there is a ghost in the movie, Zemeckis also creates a very tense atmosphere relying purely on silence and simplistic sounds (like the wind blowing the door open etc) and cinematography. The camera-work is stupendous as it follows Michelle Pfeiffer (who is very much in every single shot). I particularly liked the shots in the house when the camera would move slowly (as though tiptoeing) with Pfeiffer's suspicious character.Of course there are jump moments and twists which are usual in this genre but they're far from ridiculous. Some seem to be bothered with the Miranda Otto track arguing that it had little relevance to the main plot. However, this didn't bother me as much and it actually does make sense that Claire would believe her neighbour to be in trouble...(I'll refrain from giving out more spoilers).Another high point of 'What Lies Beneath' is indeed Michelle Pfeiffer. I think this was her comeback film after she took a short break to take care of her children. From being a vulnerable housewife, who had been through an accident and is now lonely in the house since her daughter (with whom she was very close) moved to college campus and her husband works long hours, to a stronger woman who follows her instincts and discovers dark secrets that bring her to make difficult decisions, Pfeiffer's understated portrayal is amazing to say the least. I can't say much about Harrison Ford's role without hinting spoilers but he does a commendable job.I enjoyed 'What Lies Beneath' much more during my second viewing than the first time (which was more than five years ago) but I think the main reason was that I was able to pay more attention to other parts of the movie other than just the story, such as the technical aspects (like camera-work and sound effects), and also see and enjoy the homage to so many classics (mostly Hitchcock's films). That is not to say that the story itself doesn't work. Quite the contrary because even though it's not exactly original, it is suspenseful and the events are well put together.

Night Shyamalan; a master moviemaker's layered mosaic of fear, faith, family - and alien invasion.Like every Night thriller, SIGNS is not of the Running and Screaming stripe, rather, a beautifully crafted lesson in film making; creative angles, smart reveals, subtle foreshadowing, tension-filled tableaux, nuanced humor. No frame wasted, no scene superfluous, no Night un-Shyamalaned.Mel Gibson is widower Reverend Graham Hess, a priest who has lost his faith, one day waking on his farm to discover - crop circles. Resurrecting that grand hoax, Shyamalan comes right out and attributes crop circles to extra-terrestrial aliens. But the aliens are the McGuffin - we only see this invasion through snippets on TV news and one chilling scene at a children's party. SIGNS concerns itself only with Graham's family and their unbidden involvement in this world-shaking event.Joaquin Phoenix is Merrill, Graham's brother, helping him tend his farm and raise Graham's two young kids, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in sensational performances). In most films, when a person loses their faith it doesn't mean they have come to their senses - it means they are waiting for some supernatural event to turn them BACK to that faith. Graham stopped practicing priesty things after the death of his wife, run down by a town local that fell asleep at the wheel (M. Night himself, in his usual Hitchcock-ian cameo). Usually a gutless filmic device, Night uses Graham's loss of faith as part of a much bigger picture, working it as another reference to the movie's title.The crux of SIGNS is a foreboding monologue that Graham shares with Merrill, about two kinds of people - the type that believe someone is watching over us, and the type that believe no one is. As they watch television reports of crop circles and hovering spaceships appearing throughout the world, Graham confesses his wife's unnecessary death made him cross over from someone to no one. Religionists regard this as a tragedy. The only tragedy was his wife's death. Losing faith is the best thing that could happen to anyone in this delusional society - they become responsible for the first time in their lives. What Religionists fail to realize is that if no one is watching over us, we are the rulers of our own destiny. Why imagine some great clockmaker planning our floods, quakes, flat tires and stubbed toes? We forgive Night these pseudo-theological forays because every scene in SIGNS ratchets the tension higher; Night can conjure fear from the whisper of the wind, a rustle in the cornstalks, a hand groping under a pantry door.The passive ominousness of crops laying flat shows us we don't need screaming chase scenes to create excitement, nor knives stabbed through eyes to create horror - all it takes is a shift in normalcy a shadowy figure on the roof, clicking sounds on a baby monitor, a shin disappearing into foliage.James Newton Howard's chilling, eerie, evocative soundtrack only raises the hairs more.Every subplot in SIGNS is a sign itself, as it jigsaws into the fabric of the last scene, where the Hess family confront a full frontal alien, left behind after the invasion forces abandon Earth. Graham finds that everything his wife said to him with her dying breath attains fruition to save their lives - from Bo's obsession with leaving contaminated water glasses around the house, to Morgan's asthma attacks, and Merrill's impulsive cannonball batting arm. Tell Merrill... swing away! Many people try to find signs, allegories and messages in movies with this tone, but few deride SIGNS for being absolutely bereft of intelligence when it advocates predestination. Graham's wife, while pinned to a tree by Night's car, blabbers all the info Graham will need to save his life later, explained away by Graham as the last sparks of her brain firing arbitrarily. You lost me at medulla oblongata.Predestination negates free will. I've said it at least 4,560,670 times. But Christians never seem to get it. Graham actually believes - as many viewers do - that events can be foretold by a dying woman who was fed information by some outside source powerful enough to mind-meld with her (yet not powerful enough to keep the car from hitting her); an outside source with such dubious discernment that it would relate life-saving info through a dying woman instead of simply mind-melding the info into the living people who needed that info. Smart. Graham's faith must have been Church of Nostradamus, or whatever you prophesy weirdoes call yourselves - oh, that's right Christians.But I forgive Night. Because SIGNS suspends our disbelief so artfully even with the contradiction of predestination. The love and closeness of Graham's family bedrocks their adversity, and the performances breathe beyond three dimensions. What can we say about Joaquin and Mel? Both have wells of emotion so deep and nuanced, it makes us wonder why their shelves are not creaking with Oscars.As one day, M. Night Shyamalan must surely be recognized by that insular, backslapping academy. All they need is a sign.Or SIGNS.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"6 April 2009","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" SIGNS is a storytelling masterpiece from writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan; a master moviemaker's layered mosaic of fear, faith, family - and alien invasion.Like every Night thriller, SIGNS is not of the Running and Screaming stripe, rather, a beautifully crafted lesson in film making; creative angles, smart reveals, subtle foreshadowing, tension-filled tableaux, nuanced humor. No frame wasted, no scene superfluous, no Night un-Shyamalaned.Mel Gibson is widower Reverend Graham Hess, a priest who has lost his faith, one day waking on his farm to discover - crop circles. Resurrecting that grand hoax, Shyamalan comes right out and attributes crop circles to extra-terrestrial aliens. But the aliens are the McGuffin - we only see this invasion through snippets on TV news and one chilling scene at a children's party. SIGNS concerns itself only with Graham's family and their unbidden involvement in this world-shaking event.Joaquin Phoenix is Merrill, Graham's brother, helping him tend his farm and raise Graham's two young kids, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in sensational performances). In most films, when a person loses their faith it doesn't mean they have come to their senses - it means they are waiting for some supernatural event to turn them BACK to that faith. Graham stopped practicing priesty things after the death of his wife, run down by a town local that fell asleep at the wheel (M. Night himself, in his usual Hitchcock-ian cameo). Usually a gutless filmic device, Night uses Graham's loss of faith as part of a much bigger picture, working it as another reference to the movie's title.The crux of SIGNS is a foreboding monologue that Graham shares with Merrill, about two kinds of people - the type that believe someone is watching over us, and the type that believe no one is. As they watch television reports of crop circles and hovering spaceships appearing throughout the world, Graham confesses his wife's unnecessary death made him cross over from someone to no one. Religionists regard this as a tragedy. The only tragedy was his wife's death. Losing faith is the best thing that could happen to anyone in this delusional society - they become responsible for the first time in their lives. What Religionists fail to realize is that if no one is watching over us, we are the rulers of our own destiny. Why imagine some great clockmaker planning our floods, quakes, flat tires and stubbed toes? We forgive Night these pseudo-theological forays because every scene in SIGNS ratchets the tension higher; Night can conjure fear from the whisper of the wind, a rustle in the cornstalks, a hand groping under a pantry door.The passive ominousness of crops laying flat shows us we don't need screaming chase scenes to create excitement, nor knives stabbed through eyes to create horror - all it takes is a shift in normalcy a shadowy figure on the roof, clicking sounds on a baby monitor, a shin disappearing into foliage.James Newton Howard's chilling, eerie, evocative soundtrack only raises the hairs more.Every subplot in SIGNS is a sign itself, as it jigsaws into the fabric of the last scene, where the Hess family confront a full frontal alien, left behind after the invasion forces abandon Earth. Graham finds that everything his wife said to him with her dying breath attains fruition to save their lives - from Bo's obsession with leaving contaminated water glasses around the house, to Morgan's asthma attacks, and Merrill's impulsive cannonball batting arm. Tell Merrill... swing away! Many people try to find signs, allegories and messages in movies with this tone, but few deride SIGNS for being absolutely bereft of intelligence when it advocates predestination.

Because there's no way a successful 19th century novel could be this bereft of ideas. The version is a wide-screen travelogue, and the most developed theme the movie offers is an anti-racism message, while the movie somehow still manages to be racist. Niven plays uptight, Anglocentric prig Phileas Fogg. Cantinflas, with no discernible talent whatsoever, either triumphs in various int'l tasks, in a way Fogg could never (anti-racist), or wreaks havoc on each new place (because he's also an ignorant stereotype).It a movie with a lot of problems. The first half hour is bogged down in what must be the world's most inert setup dialog, so that the rest of the movie can go silent for long stretches. The movie cheaps out too much - preferring to stick its stars in front of a flat wall in a Hollywood studio, and cut to location vistas they're seeing, to keep costs down. This is pretty shabby-looking. When we arrive in Suez we're on an interior set of an exterior (a harbor). Who wants to see that in wide screen with Todd-AO? Cantinflas' Passepartout is intended to provide comic relief, but his bits are lazy and undeveloped, and he plays his buffoon with a flat affect. He has zero screen presence. The movie eats up more than 90 minutes, before in desperation it switches to cameo overload mode in an effort to liven things up. Everything ever filmed moves quicker than 80 Days.If you had to pick one of the two movie versions to watch, it's a toss-up. They're both bad. This one at least offers a lesson about film history. Every Best Picture winner flatters viewers ideas about themselves in some way; in this case voters rewarded a movie that suggested they were cosmopolitan.

That's Boondock Saints, sort of a Guy Ritchie meets vigilante justice crime film that relishes in the cool rather than the real. Still, over- the-top as it may be at times, there's no denying Boondock Saints both its cool and cult status.Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) are a pair of Irish fraternal twins with unflinching faith and a lot of body art who after an attack on their favorite bar by Russian mobsters on St. Patrick's Day goes awry, realize they can rid Boston of its crime filth, fulfill a religious responsibility and make some money on the side by killing sinners. On their trail is arrogant and borderline crazy FBI detective Paul Smecker (Willam Defoe), known for accurately reconstructing crime scenes (as long as he has his classical music handy).Once the McManus brothers go on their spree, the film takes an interesting approach, showing Smecker go through each crime scene and guess what happened before actually showing you what happened, increasing the suspense and getting across Smecker's frustration with how clean these guys manage to be.Although the plot and style of the film is dominated by the McManus brothers and their not nearly as sharp or morally sound companion Rocco, character-wise, this film belongs to Defoe. In his strongest character maybe ever, Defoe's distinguished and inherently insane features work perfectly for a detective who is so smart he's nearly a lunatic. His performance is nuanced at times and over-the-top at others and while the other over-the-top parts of the film detract a bit from it, Defoe manages to make his ridiculousness work, namely the cool scene where director Troy Duffy films both Defoe constructing the scene and the Saints actually doing all that, together.The film's greatest weakness is that it glorifies the vigilantism of the McManus brothers in a way that detracts from the realism. They become superheroes in almost too much of the sense of the word. Their clean kills and getaways, even their reception by the public (which is more told than shown) seems a bit too far-fetched. Even the symbolism is overdone with the twins' rosaries shaking on the wall pegs or thrashing about as they get beaten. The religious angle is highly controversial, but this is also the point. Never before has religion been a motivating factor in vigilantism in film. Still, the execution is more about style and entertainment than about the real possibility of these figures existing.

It reinforced so many ideas, and it shocked millions. But even though the film is mostly known for the 'demon girl', the film itself is a great character study. The characters are so well fleshed out, especially Father Karras. Jason Miller really gives a very subtle performance. The performances by Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair are also phenomenal. The acting as a whole is very strong. The screenplay is so fully layered out, and I was surprised. The direction and cinematography is just brilliant. The film has some incredible shots and scenes. But for those horror fans expecting full entertainment might look someplace else. This is a really moral and deep emotionally haunting film. The first half is sort of slow, but I loved all the development and progress that was done in order to get where the film was going.

Basically Ted Kramer (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman) seems to have his work come before his relationship with wife Joanna (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep) and eight-year-old son Billy (introducing Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated Justin Henry). Joanna decides she can't take anymore, and leaves Ted to look after Billy on his own, which is obviously causing some strain between father and son. When Ted has learnt to adjust to his new responsibilities, and Billy seems to be coping, Joanna comes back and wants her son back. So Ted and Joanna go into court to fight for custody, Ted refuses to give Billy up, and unfortunately he loses, but in the end, Joanna realises her mistake, and that Ted is the better parent for Billy. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jane Alexander as Margaret Phelps, Howard Duff as John Shaunessy, George Coe as Jim O'Connor, JoBeth Williams as Phyllis Bernard, Bill Moor as Gressen, Howland Chamberlain as Judge Atkins, Jack Ramage as Spencer and Jess Osuna as Ackerman. Hoffman is brilliant as the struggling father, and Streep does have her moments too. The best scenes of the film, besides the gripping court case, are when Hoffman tries to bond with his son, and the moments of stress between them, it is just a very convincing and truthful to its content. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Benton, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Dustin Hoffman number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Streep was number 26, and Hoffman number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!

She draws a blank. Did she kill him or not? She cleans the guy's apartment of any trace of herself before leaving and gets home by hitching a ride with a retired policeman, Jeff Bridges. She gets drunk again, wakes up in the morning and tries to take a shower but finds the same dead body propped up in the shower stall.Her estranged husband, Raoul Julia, does what he can to help but he's involved with his tony hair dressing business and Fonda winds up turning to Bridges for safety, succor, and sex.Then the plot gets a little twisted.I think Sidney Lumet must have gotten lost during a binge in New York night spots and woke up in Los Angeles. But he gets it just about right. When Fonda first leaves the corpse's apartment she finds herself on an unfamiliar street, the kind that characterizes LA perfectly. The opening sequence shows us blank warehouse walls on empty industrial boulevards and the avenues of pastel, middle-class apartments are equally devoid of pedestrians. That's the difference between LA and New York. In Los Angeles nobody walks. In New York if you step out your door you are mugged by the crowd.Fonda is a professional actress undone by age but the role is played with craggy inconsistency. She's pretty tough. She makes wisecracks to the cadaver while she's scrubbing his apartment. She's aggressive and manipulative at LAX. On the other hand, she plays Viveca as a shrill, nervous wreck with a semiquaver in her voice, even when she's supposed to be mellowed out on Thunderbird, a cheap wine. However, Fonda looks just fine considering that she's no longer the teenager of her earlier movies. She's just my age. I saw a recent photo of her and she still looks stunningly beautiful, as do I.I've always like Raoul Julia's performances. He's reliable, reassuring, good in almost everything he does. Too bad he wasn't around longer. Jeff Bridges usually brings something unique to each of his roles but he's hobbled here by the limitations written into this stereotype of stability. He's a handyman, the eternal fixer-upper, a guy who takes old busted things and refurbishes them, every wife's dream of a man who is good with a wrench and knows how to reintroduce the sputtering home computer to the concept of reliability. He's a man of nature, comfortable enough in his own skin to use ethnic epithets like beaner and spade good naturedly and without self consciousness, a Mellors the grounds keeper for our time.The script has little hackneyed touches that I find hard to believe originated with such a seasoned and talented director as Sidney Lumet. Fonda is backing out of the dead man's apartment, bumps into someone, there is a sting in the score, and it's merely Jeff Bridges who has followed her without Fonda or the audience knowing it. It's done twice, and it's pretty cheap. And when Fonda changes her hair from phony blond to natural chestnut or burnt sienna or whatever it is, a grand dramatic display is made of it. The viewer is supposed to applaud because, now, THAT'S the iconic Jane Fonda we know and love. No phoniness here. (She smokes and drinks during the first half of the movie, but not the last half.) The score is by Paul Chihara and the main theme is carried by a soprano saxophone. This might have been a novelty in 1986 but now, after ten years of Kenny G, it's enough to induce thyrotoxic storm.On the admirable side, she simply stops drinking for a couple of days and is determined never to get drunk again. We are spared the tears and anguish we might experience if she went through withdrawal -- the bottle looming in the foreground, the trembling hand, the half-full glass poured back into the bottle. Still, I have to say that the ending of Lumet's Verdict was more realistic. There, Paul Newman's drunk has found himself at the end but it doesn't stop him from drinking. Also on the good side of the ledger, some snappy lines in the dialog. Viveca's real name is Alexandra Sternbergen. Bridges prefers her real name and so does she -- In arguments, it's harder to yell 'Alexandra'. It's got a bit of spark.
