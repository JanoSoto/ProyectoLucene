They've all been pretty good, but this one may be the most impish, thanks largely to its soundtrack.Marc Shaiman is otherwise known as `Mr Fixit'. His work on Sister Act2(1993) saved that flick from total disaster; and he's been deployed on greenlighted features needing rescue-with-an-infectious-soundtrack ever since. He's responsible for the opening- and closing video-clips of this movie, Love Will Keep Us Together (brand new recording of the Captain&Tenille hit by Vitamin-C), and September (the Earth, Wind&Fire disco anthem, re-recorded by both Vitamin-C & Sisqo).These two fully incorporated video clips come very close to stealing the show, although there are problems with that as well.Vitamin-C's procession out of Allison MacAllister's garage is a left-field inspiration, but she's never given anything else to do in the movie, so the inspiration is left hanging. As for Sisqo's big movie debut, his character (Dennis) is a mere token, and his lines irritatingly lightweight.The big closing number, September, although terrific as a standalone, is totally WRENCHING FROM the movie.At a length of 116mins without the end-clip, Get Over It is....too short. The third act, during which we're supposed to see the actual stage play, is thin on Shakespeare. Only the barest skeleton of a plot is revealed  a betrothed Athenian maiden, Hermia, has two lovers who are enchanted by fairies to act unpredictably.Hermia\/Allison McAllister's (Melissa Sagemiller)  rivals are Demetrius\/Bentley Scrumfeld (Shane West) and Lysander\/Berke Landers (Ben Foster).Bentley Scrumfeld aka `Striker' has been superbly cast-Shane West is now stuck forever as the `candy-assed' `Bentley Scrumfeld' even in totally serious roles eg A Walk to Remember(2002). Ben Foster, on the other hand, seems an overly-studied sad sack who turns into a suprisingly offputting competitive guy.The rivals notwithstanding, we really needed another 15-20mins of theatrics, Shakespearian or otherwise, with a better-developed reason for the improv ending. The deep structural problems implied by no less than 8 producers on this teen flick couldn't be just `fixed in post' (editing).This is an unfinished film, prematurely released.Even the opening montage of the young lovers is dispatched in a mere 20secs! Why such haste? The movie is obviously rushed, accounting for the split reviews it's received.There is much to like about it, however, such as Berke (Ben Foster)'s understated, quirky character design. He's so relaxed and clear about his task at the beginning that he effortlessly kisses Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), his best friend's younger sister. Unselfconscious warmth like that is rare in teen films; but this one really tries to evoke an innocent yet canny Brady Bunch feel (note the Sherwood Schwartz-like family home of the McAllisters', whose garage spews forth Vitamin-C with her band).Another great touch was the CGI-transformation of 3 real actors into fairies `with fairydust coming out of their a**es'. Their helium-ed voices are fun, and `Little Steve' (Dov Tiefenbach) is a perfect hoot. We should've gotten his backstory, eg why he was called `Little Steve'! More backstories would've added depth to a movie that sorely needed it.Most of the `Fine Arts Dept', including the `Chair', Desmond Forrest-Oats (Martin Short), the Production Assistant, Jessica (Jeanie Calleja), and the two stage crew\/stoner guys, Chook (Park Bench) and Grendan (Daniel Enright), are hammy spoofs.Martin Short is, of course, the master ham-his fantasy bubbles are hilarious, as are most of his deprecating lines spat out through his (fake) gums. His only really bad misfire is his BIZARRE hand gesture across his face in lieu of resting chin-on-palm. It's so awkward that it just doesn't look human.Young Mila Kunis as `Basin' (is that a name?) plays like a chirpy, young Laura San Giacomo to Kelly (Kirsten Dunst)'s proverbial Pretty teen-Woman. Kunis is a giggling delight, and for me the more impressive of the two. It's a shame that she can't kick-start any chemistry with Dennis (Sisqo), her supposed admirer-in my opinion because Sisqo's  character is tarred as gay Dennis is really way overenthusiastic about Madonna!The film's true standout scene finally occurs as the two rivals for Allison\/Hermia's affection continue their altercation ON STAGE `Do you marry HIM (Hermia's father)....Berke slyly looks away from 'Striker'?' `Sh!tbox.' `-W**ker.' `D!ckweed'; and again as the two rivals step through choreography to their song `Hermia-Please Love Meee' `B!tch.' `-Pansy.' `A**hole.'   `-Grrrr.'Berke's mother (the always reliable Swoozie Kurtz) even whispers in the audience to her husband (Ed Begley Jr, an old comic hand since his Spinal Tap(1984) days) that `It's so real, you can almost feel the tension'! This is, of course, the hoary old chestnut about EVERYTHING onstage being interpreted by audiences as `part of the show'.The movie registers a minus over Berke's parents being kept around basically to deliver the `so real' line; and to give director Tommy O'Haver a cameo (as their TV show director).In the end, it's Colin Hanks (not Sisqo) who walks away with the picture. He 'owns' Felix, Berke's best friend and `Leisure-suit Larry' teen Felix is an irresponsible partyhound great at causing chaos. He's so peer-cool that his funniest scene is his `manly encouragement' reaction shot in the play's audience, as Dennis, the 11th-hr play replacement, awkwardly delivers the Shakespearean line `Go bid the huntsmen; wake them with their horns'.As noted, this promising Shakespeare update remains unfinished. I only wish the filmmakers (R Lee Fleming Jr-Writer, O'Haver-Director, Jeff Betancourt-Editor, +6 Producers +2 Exec Producers!!) were given the opportunity to release the movie all over again. I'd definitely pay to see their end product, based on this early attempt.(7\/10)  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2003","score":"","review":"  Get Over It(2000) is a spoof of Fame(1980) with a Brady Bunch Movie(1994) feel, using the common nostalgia of generations of students who survived their high school theatre productions to carry it.It's the fifth classic\/Shakespearian-adaptation teen movie in recent memory (Clueless(1992) =Jane Austen's Emma, Romeo & Juliet(1996) =Baz Luhrman's Shakespeare, 10 Things I Hate About You(1999) =Taming of the Shrew, Get Over It(2001) =A Midsummer Night's Dream, and O(2002) =Othello).

","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2003","score":"","review":"  An intelligent and witty travesty on the business of children's television, from a period arguably before it became a wasteland of endlessly moronic cartoons.  Of course, all satire is based to some extent on truth, but this story isn't looking to besmirch Mr. Rogers or Sesame Street.  It is modeled more on commercialized shows going back to the 1950s such as Pinky Lee, much later with Pee Wee Herman, and most recently with Barney, all of which capitalized unmercifully on their characters.  Beyond that, the message of the film is about what happens when a genuinely sincere individual finds himself sucked into a world thoroughly corrupt, and motivated by unbridled selfishness and petty jealousies.  Although its theme is related to children's shows, it is not a film for children.  It is very dark and disturbing, with lots of strong language, violence and sexual content. Its subject for satire is the business of children's television, which behind the scenes can be very ugly, hypocritical, and exploiting.It does not try to have a message, but one still results What ever happened to children's television such that anything resembling value to children got left out?  There used to be shows in which kids were involved, and not just as voices in cartoons.  Real human children are more meaningful to other children than cartoons, but it is cheaper to make cartoons than to pay for live humans.  Cartoons sell toys and junk-food more dependably than children do, anyway, and they don't complain about issues of sincerity. It's just a business, after all, the purpose of which is to make money. It's not about children, but exploiting them for profits, and that is the message that emerges from Smoochy.  If even children's television is unscrupulous, what does that say for the rest of the entertainment business?

For example, a top-notch, space-based science fiction story may allow for faster-than-light travel, but it generally has to stick to plausible science after that.  If a work is pure fantasy, then it is possible to demand more of viewers\/readers, but even it must remain internally consistent to whatever set of rules it creates.Spielberg & Co. attempt to tell a story in which we are asked to accept that law enforcement in the near future has the ability to foresee murders before they actually happen.  Fair enough -- we accept this impossible premise in order for the story to unfold, but if the story is to be believable, we should expect no further impositions on our credibility.Other reviewers have commented on various plot problems, which, though valid, are not fundamentally impossible.  There is, however, a major plot element involving the `murder' that Anderton is supposed to commit that is impossible.  SPOILER FOLLOWSWe see the pre-cog vision of the shooting multiple times as we approach the actual confrontation.  In this vision, the victim, Leo Crow, has been shot at a distance (one image), and Anderton is seen holding his pistol with arm outstretched, pointing at Crow who is falling away (second image).  The second image would be perfectly consistent with someone firing a gun at someone standing a few feet away.  However, in the actual event, Anderton doesn't deliberately shoot Crow &#150; he starts to read him his rights (a very well done piece of acting by Cruise).  Crow then begs Anderton to kill him, revealing the planned frame-up.  In desperation, Crow rushes forward, grabs Anderton's gun hand, pulls Anderton and the gun to his chest, and is able to make the gun discharge.  We then get a short (probably less than a second) repeat of the second pre-cog image, now supposedly real, of Crow falling away with Anderton in exactly the same position, body turned sideways, arm outstretch with the pistol aimed at Crow as though he had just shot him.  Impossible!!!  This would require that after Crow was shot, Anderton would straighten his arm, turn sideways, and point the pistol at Crow.  Aside from there being no time to assume that position, no one having just inadvertently shot someone would behave in such a fashion.It gets worse.  A contact pistol wound is very distinct &#150; so much so that even the average layperson would be able to distinguish it from a wound made from several feet away.  We therefore must assume that no one would notice the obvious discrepancy between the pre-cog vision of the bullet hit from several feet away (image one) and the reality &#150;- seriously undermining the supposed perfection of future crime detection.  This problem in elementary forensics is one that was going to exist once the writers decided on how events would plausibly unfold.  Maybe one could overlook this problem by saying that police organizations didn't do forensics anymore, and no one involved ever looked closely at the body of Leo Crow.  Like the absurdities with the eyes that miraculously didn't deteriorate to unusability after a few minutes (let alone hours), it would be one more block in the pyramid of improbabilities (noted by other reviewers) needed to keep the plot advancing.Spielberg & Co. clearly wanted to explore the idea of determinism versus free will.  They also wanted to examine whether a perfect crime detection system that saved hundreds of lives every year could be balanced against the exploitation of the 3 people who made it possible -&#150; a classic moral question of, do the needs of the many (to paraphrase Mr. Spock) outweigh the needs of the few?  But there really is no moral question at all since the system is not perfect.  Pre-cog image one is wrong and free will triumphs over determinism.  Spielberg & Co. obviously decided that it wouldn't do to have all of the exposition required to explore the morality of utilitarianism go down the tubes when Leo Crow is shot, so viewers were tricked by false, impossible image two into concluding that this particular (very gifted) pre-cog's visions were perfect but incomplete.
