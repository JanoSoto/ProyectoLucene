But, in December, it received some nominations to the Golden Globe, including best picture and, even not winning anyone, I started to show some interest about it. About fifteen days ago, the nominees for the Oscar were announced and I knew that The Insider could be a strong rival for American Beauty -my new favorite film-, so it had to be almost as good as the other one. Well... I watched it this afternoon, and... if it's not better than American Beauty, or as good as that, it is a high level film which has its importance.Everything in The Insider has a high level, from the acting to the screenplay. Director Michael Mann, whose previous works were The Last of the Mohicans and Heat, does a wonderful job with the camera and is helped by a very well written screenplay, based on a true story, which makes suspense about ordinary things and keeps the attention of the audience. If Kevin Spacey weren't on the list for best actor nominees, my favorite one would be Russell Crowe. He was great in LA Confidential and here he perfectly plays a man in contradiction, who has to make an important decision and has to deal with the consequences. Al Pacino delivers a stellar performance once more, and Christopher Plummer should have been remembered by the Academy. The film has its flaws (the fact that it is slow, for instance), but this defects are covered by its great qualities.The Insider is a very important movie for some reasons. It is about the power of the media in the '90s and how it can manipulate people. But, more than anything, it is a film about ethics, and how ordinary people deal with it. Russell Crowe's character, Jeffrey Wigand, is on a very difficult situation, and the film shows very well how he faces it. That's one of the greatest points of this picture.I gave The Insider a 9 out of 10 for all its qualities and great points, showing a sad true story very, very well.

I was worried it would be a cheesy attempt at an action film that would be no deeper than the puddle I stepped in on the way into the theater. But I still held out hope that it would deliver.   I walked out of the theater content. It was a good movie. The plot had many twists and turns. The character of Ashley took on many different forms and she was always a mysterious character. Ben Affleck played a somewhat convincing role in his crude yet heroic character of Rudy. The acting in this movie was fairly good. The action wasn't the entire basis of this movie.

It is not a film to be taken seriously at all, but one to be very entertained by, and this high energy flick entertains for just about every single minute of its running time. This is yet another grand-slam piece of moviemaking by longtime director John Frankenheimer, who's last film, 1998's Ronin took the action film to a whole new level.I can never seem to get enough of Ben Affleck. The guy is simply a solid actor, one who's always eager to please, and one of the best of the younger actors out there. His groundbreaking work in the previous film Dogma proved that he can fufill any role that comes his way. He's certainly on a roll with his career now, being that his other new film Boiler Room, which I have had yet to see, opened exactly one week before this film. He's always terrific playing guys who are nothing short of astonished by the situations they're involved in. Here, Affleck is perfectly cast in the role of a down-on-his- luck ex con Rudy Duncan, who is released on parole. Upon his release, Rudy spots a beauty named Ashley (Charlize Theron), a secret admirer of his cellmate Nick, who was just killed in prison riot. Rudy assumes Nick's idendity in pursuit of a little passionate love.Enter Ashley's psycho brother Gabriel, played to manic perfection by Gary Sinese, still a very underrated talent. Gabriel, thinking Rudy is really Nick, plans to use his suspected expertise in the robbery of an indian owned casino, where the real Nick used to be employed, such as was revealed in the letters he sent Ashley's way. From that point on is a crowd-pleasing ride of a movie that perfectly combines comedy, suspense, numerous twists near the end, and some nicely executed action scenes set amongst a snowy side of Michigan.As mentioned before, Reindeer Games will go down as the first great film of the new century. Whether or not it will end up on my own ten best list for this year is undetermined, since we have ten more months to go. If it's a pure action film you want, take a chance and play these 'Games'.

Now I have seen 4 out of 5 of the Best Picture Nominees (all except THE CIDER HOUSE RULES).When I first heard about this movie and it's story, I thought, hmmmmm.... sounds like something I'd walk out on. Well, I didn't, and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly as well. However, also I'm aware of the fact that THE INSIDER is in fact based on real life events and altered for dramatic effect, I don't remember the time when those events actually took place, or what happened (News like that never interested me that much). My opinion can be called, at its core, limited.Now about THE INSIDER'S strength as a movie-- it has truckloads of it. The cinematography is quite edgy, and establishes a dark, uncertain tone with lots of bleak, muted colors. Mann generates tension without resorting to the standard chase scenes and shoot-outs. The actors play their characters as if there really is something tangible on the line, which helps highten the intensity. The film tackles some big issues and morals, including how a top-drawer news corporation like CBS was pressured by financial and legal issues to cut a major story. It's also about Jeffery Wigand's struggle with his conscience, his struggle against his former employers, and the hardship of him and his wife trying to accept the sacrifices they had to make.In some ways, THE INSIDER is like a two-act play. The first half, like I said before, concentrates mostly on Wigand and his circumstances, and he is in nearly every scene. Later on, the focus shifts to Lowell Bergman and the 60 Minutes crew as a battle ensues over journalistic integrity and the consequences of airing such a revealing story on the air. Actually, I found THE INSIDER'S first half to be unquestionably stronger than its first; the emotional core becomes slightly murky later on. Minor problems aside however, THE INSIDER is a very worthy film, and possesses a kinetic flow that never stops moving. There are very few slow scenes, and if there are, I can't remember them completely.Nothing ranks higher in THE INSIDER than the acting factor. Al Pacino is at his intense best here, even though this isn't a particularly new kind of role for him. He screams his head off in a lot of his movies ). Russell Crowe certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his excellent work here. He finds every nook-and-cranny in Wigand's character. Like many memorable heroes, this guy is certainly flawed, and Crowe depicts him forcefully. Also memorable is Christopher Plummer in his version of 60 Minutes' Mike Wallace. He also suplies a great deal of intensity, and his single standout is during a scene when some of his on-air comments have been censored on a broadcast. Everyone else is solid, but I have to stop the commentary somewhere.This is one of those films where the energy level is always high, and keeps the viewer in until the very end. The concepts will certainly confuse some people who didn't pay much attention to the real-life events based on THE INSIDER (like me), but most of the focus is on the characters here.

This looks so promising. Add a crapload of great reviews and you have winner, right? Wrong. Everything is wrong here. The mood is set when a dog is unnecessarily shot at the beginning and becomes a running joke. I'm no right-wing moralist concerned about movie content or a member of PETA for that matter but this is not funny to me. Then we have the depressing character of Michael Douglas. This guy is a teacher who does drugs, lives with a female student, is losing his third marriage or something. He is a sad character. Not funny. I hate how nothing is really explained either. Why is Tobey Maguire so weird and suicidal and a compulsive liar? Why is Katie Holmes living with Michael Douglas? Are they sleeping with eachother? Everyone in this movie is dysfunctional in a very unlikeable, unfunny way. I feel sorry for all these characters. Just because a movie has a setting at a college campus and is about intellectuals are we supposed to believe it's a smart movie? There is nothing smart about this movie. The entire movie can be summed up in one line Rip Torn is accepting an award for a book he wrote and in his acceptence speech he begins I am a writer. Which is followed by applause. This movie is masquarading as some kind of intellectual heart-warming comedy but is actually pointless trash, dull, not funny and a waste of time.

It is suppossed to be a thrilling story about the revelation of a new message from God and the reaction of the Church on Earth, but, in my opinion, it fails to thrill. The atmosphere created is lame and doesn't capture the spectator's full attention. The timing is wrong each one of the sequences last not long enough to give an accurate idea of what is happening. Maybe this is because they wanted to put too much in a short piece of film. Maybe if it was a longer movie, they could have developed it to its full potential. But, anyway, it has some other flaws. First of all, the mutual attraction between the priest and the girl is a clear commercial resource which wastes the nature of the story. At the end of the movie he says Stay with me when she's having her final attack, as if there were already a stable relation between the two of them. Besides, what happened with Frankie's original boyfriend?  No matter how far from her he might be, I bet in reality he would have paid her a visit in the hospital. And if he wasn't so close, what relevance did it have that they made love on the night before she received the rosary?  What did they show this sex scene for?   I think they showed it just for arousing the audience. The acting was disappointing. The main actors didn't reflect the normal reactions and emotions their characters would have. Frankie had a possession attack where she'd wrote an entire wall with a language she didn't know nor understand and when she woke up she was affected for a couple of minutes and then she went on with her normal life. If that really happened the girl would at least stayed motionless in a corner for a week or so. A rational, empirical priest who looks for explanations wouldn't go and calmly hold down a girl who is floating crucified in the air after she beat him speaking with a man's voice. He should, at least, have been shaky. But, well, that's a problem of the screenplay itself. And the plot is pathetic a foolish cardinal who tries to kill the girl choking her, his sidekick and two nuns!  Is that a plot or an assault?The rest speaks for itself.

A alien is chosen, and it's Harold (Garry Shandling), who goes to Earth to help the future of his planet.  Harold arrives in Phoenix to find his lucky future mate.  He meets a slimy and cold co-worker (Greg Kinnear)who gives Harold tips on how to meet, one night stand women.  When they go to a alcholic annonymous meeting, Harold meets a woman who he feels fits his  profile (Annette Bening).  But Harold then discovers what it's really like to live on Earth, and what Earth women are really like.

Sullivan's musical score was there, and showed promised, it was Gilbert's lyrics and plot that didn't work that much.Gilbert would always come up with a topsy-turvey style plot, where there would be something usual that turns into the very unusual.  Gilbert's ideas of a opera would involve a magical coin, or watch or some kind of a object that's magical. This is what makes Sullivan irritated, he's tired of writing a musical score that deals with some sort of magical object. This causes a heated dispute between the two artists.  And to make matters worse, their plays are doing horrible profits, since they barely make any at all. It isn't until Gilbert's wife, who convinces Gilbert to accompany her to a Japanesse culture exhibit, that Gilbert gets the idea to write his classic opera.  From there on, the viewer watches the pressure and trouble that Gilbert and Sullivan go through to make thier masterpiece.  They show the different personalities of the actors, one who is a single mother who drinks, another actress who is concerned about her looks and appearance, then the comedic actor who's hooked on morphine, and the star tenor who's depressed because his solo number gets cut from the musical.  In a Altman-like way, the viewer does get to know and understand what these people go through to perform and rehearse. I did enjoy TOPSY-TURVY in a theatrical sense.  Leigh does a great job showing the viewer the behind the scenes look at a theatrical performance.  There are great song numbers, dancing, costumes, and acting.  Jim Boradbent and Allen Corduner are both great as the song-writing duo who have their similarites and differences.  And the acting from the huge supporting cast makes it worth while.

Jerry Reed, who plays Clark's commander, also turns in a fine performance - a bit above par for Reed - and served as executive producer and composed some of the songs on the soundtrack.

Colonel Iceal Hambleton (Gene Hackman) is a respected, middle-aged strategist who has only seen the war from the air - and high in the air, too. During one reconnaissance mission, however, he's shot down behind enemy lines for the first time. Scared and out of his element, Hambleton must rely on Captain Clark (Danny Glover), a pilot, to help him keep his composure until a rescue can happen.Most of the scenes are of just the two leads, almost making this a two-character action play. Both men provide stellar performances, with Hackman putting a decidedly different spin on his tough-guy, in-control persona. Glover is equally aces as the tireless pilot. And just in case you think there's going to be more talk than action in this movie, don't fret. The Vietcong are around somewhere, and they know Hambleton's in the vicinity.

I was angry because I chose between seeing this movie and The Whole Nine Yards, and without seeing The Whole Nine Yards, I know I made the wrong choice.  Anyways, the movie starts off ok, and I was able to suspend my disbelief that anybody would survive the nasty crash they had, and all the other stuff that you just have to go with.  And for a while, it had me going.  There are really some great visuals in this movie, and if you are an effects buff, you might actually want to pay money to see it.----Whoever planned this movie must have thought they had a winner, and I can see why.  The visuals were awesome.  The basic plot has a couple of good themes (the animals are cannibalistic, which kind of reminds you of the humans - also there is kind of a question of whether the characters, or humans in general, are good at heart or not), 2 pretty decent characters (the pilot and the criminal).  So, the plan was there.  The execution was just flat out awful.----All this movie needed was someone to write dialogue, which really is what defines a movie.  Some of the lines are just so awful you can sometimes see the actors force them out of their mouth against their own will. Riddick has a line at the end that is pretty much the line Eddie Murphy was searching for in Bowfinger.  It's supposed to be like Arnold saying I'll be back, but I hope to never see this guy again.----The specific plot is pretty bad as well.  There are always some characters that you know are going to die in movies, but just once I would like to see the British antique collector character not act like an idiot who deserves to die.----This movie had so much potential to be an excellent movie, but when the writers got down and dirty they came up empty, and they really missed the boat.  The effects do save this movie from being a complete flop - they are some of the best I have ever seen.  That's why I gave this movie a 4 out of 10, and the only thing that made it better than Daylight, which still holds the title as the worst movie I ever paid money to see.
