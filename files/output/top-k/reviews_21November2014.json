The most comedic thing I've seen Payne do, definitely different than his post-2000s work. I really dug its narrative framework. Reese Witherspoon is all kinds of great in this. She plays it with the intensity of a psychopath, bent on doing anything she can to get ahead. Honestly, she was pretty terrifying in some of her scenes even. I don't think the film as a whole is anything all that meaningful, but it's certainly very entertaining and very funny. This is strongly recommended and can see it continuing to have a lasting impact in cinema, certainly much of it because of Witherspoon's electricity.

This film usually gets the least mentions within Payne's filmography and is probably considered his weakest, and so I was surprised and enjoyed it a hell of a lot, especially coming off of a big disappointment. Like Election, it's definitely more in the comedy-territory and while, again, it may not amount to all that much, it's still a hell of an enjoyable ride. And, of course, Laura Dern is great, she's proved she can play this sort of ditzy, unaware character and she nails it.
