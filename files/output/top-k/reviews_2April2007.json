I've found the quintessence of action movies. This is the single greatest action movie I've ever seen. My usual formula follows.Plot The plot is simple. A NYPD cop named John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife, Holly who works at Nakatomi Plaza. Later terrorists take over the building and John with his sidearm is forced to take them on. This movie has many twists and always keeps the pace moving.Acting The acting in this movie is the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Bruce Willis stars as John McClane with a stunning performance. He shows stress, fear, bravado, and creates a fallible hero who makes mistakes and is vulnerable as well. Alan Rickman in his movie debut, gives the performance of his life as Hans Gruber. Creating the perfect action villain, he even surpasses Bruce Willis in my opinion. No one gave a bad performance in this movie, everyone played their part.Action This movie is the pure quintessence of the action movie genre. This movie didn't create the action genre, but it evolved it. It made a new kind of hero who was fallible, made mistakes, and was more human. It also made a new kind of villain in the form of Hans Gruber. He was a villain who liked to let his goons do the dirty work for him most of the time but at times did it himself.Although this movie has mistakes that we notice easily, we must remember every movie has those. It should not break your praise of the movie. This is a movie I define as a masterpiece of movies. A masterpiece of the genre is something that mostly only the fans of the genre will like and a few outside. A masterpiece of movies is a movie that even people who don't generally like the genre will like.So I say if you love action movies and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for get this now.

He was a villain who liked to let his goons do the dirty work for him most of the time but at times did it himself.Although this movie has mistakes that we notice easily, we must remember every movie has those. It should not break your praise of the movie. This is a movie I define as a masterpiece of movies. A masterpiece of the genre is something that mostly only the fans of the genre will like and a few outside. A masterpiece of movies is a movie that even people who don't generally like the genre will like.So I say if you love action movies and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for get this now. If you don't like action movies that much then still see it. I say that for every 10 people who see it at least 8 to 9 people will love it.10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"2 April 2007","score":"31 out of 38 people found the following review useful","review":" Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film.Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former Assistant District Attorney, Kate Capshaw and he's a crusader against capital punishment.

It made household names of rising stars Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore and netted an Oscar for the always excellent Whoopi Goldberg. Its easy to see where its appeal lies. A heart wrenching love story. A compelling murder plot. Moments of real comedy. And fantastic special effects. All the components needed to turn Ghost into a crowd pleaser. Not everything about the film always rings true. And some of the revelations about the afterlife are disappointingly clumsy and clichéd, but for the most part Ghost is a film that's remarkably assured, and delivers on what it promises.Swayze is the yuppie investment councillor Sam Wheat who enjoys a blossoming relationship with Moore's artist Molly Jensen. It all goes sour when Sam is shot and killed by a mugger. But remains on Earth as a spirit. Unable to be seen or heard by anyone. And incapable of physical human contact. But when it turns out his death was all part of an elaborate setup, Sam enlists the aid of charlatan psychic Oda Mae Brown (Goldberg, gloriously entertaining) to warn Molly that the killers are after her now.Although a lot of people were drawn to Ghost for its romantic elements (the pottery scene is now infamous) what I found more entertaining about Ghost was the logical approach it takes in weaving a story from a spirit's POV. When Sam becomes a ghost, it takes a while for him to learn the rules. He learns right away that he can't touch anything. But it takes longer for him to learn that its not impossible for him to regain the ability to move objects. He discovers this when he meets a more seasoned ghost on a subway train (the late Vincent Schiavelli).Ghost is actually a film that draws up some fascinating dimensions concerning the spirit world. Its when it directly addresses the aspects of Heaven and Hell that it slips up but I'll go into that later. In this film, there are many people who have died but haven't moved on. There's an almost spiritual community living among us. Sam is a relative newcomer, and is taught by that subway ghost to channel his emotions into manipulating physical objects. For the simple reason that he's not physical anymore.We also learn about the limitations of being a ghost. It is possible for spirits to communicate with the living by possessing them. We get to see this twice. And it happens to Whoopi twice. The first is played strictly for laughs after Oda Mae learns her charlatan psychic powers are for real. Ghosts have flocked to her to be heard once more. One ghost gets impatient with her and possesses her body. When he's forced out, it saps his energy for a short time. The second instance is more poignant when Oda Mae allows Sam to use her body to caress Molly (although the film shows Sam doing this, and not Oda Mae).Another thing of interest is the surprisingly smart screenplay written by Bruce Joel Rubin. Not only does he handle the spiritual side of Ghost with consummate skill, but he also crafts a credible thriller, and keeps things ticking along nicely, balancing the drama with comedy whenever things threaten to get too maudlin. Jerry Zucker's direction is also worthy of mention because its so confident and assured. Surprising considering he comes from a background of screwball comedy.As for the performances, they're a little uneven. Although Patrick Swayze is not one of the greatest actors to grace the Earth, he's quite well suited to the part of a ghost. In fact this is probably his best role. But its in his scenes with Whoopi where he really shines. They make quite an amusing double act. There's one inspired scene where he has to talk her through closing an account and half the time she misinterprets his instructions. Or when he (eventually) convinces her to hand over a cheque for 4 million dollars to some nuns (a bit prophetic for what was to come for Whoopi!).Demi Moore is typically flat as a pancake and spends half the time crying her way through the movie. In the supporting cast, Tony Goldwyn does well as the sleazy best friend who set Sam up for drug money. And Vincent Schiavelli gives an interestingly live-wire performance as the ghost who helps Sam get in touch with his inner self.But its Whoopi Goldberg who steals the film out from everyone else. She's downright hilarious from the moment she appears. She's clearly having a ball as the fake medium who's more surprised than anyone when she finds her powers are genuine. She gets all the best lines and she knows it. And she has greater chemistry with Swayze than he does with Moore. She deserved to walk away with the Oscar. Sometimes they do get it right!The special effects have lost a little of their sparkle over the years but hold up well. The images of Sam moving through a human body and seeing blood and inner workings is striking. Or seeing him walk through doors and leap from train to train is memorable. But the scenes of the light of Heaven and demons from Hell are cheesy as anything, and recalls some of the limited imagination of Flatliners, made the same year.But Ghost still commands a certain attention and is a great deal of fun. It sometimes gets a bit too mushy for its own good, and wicked people punished for being bad and good people rewarded for being good is too simplistic. But thanks to a slick narrative, good plot twists and great performances (and in that I mean Whoopi!) Ghost is a film that flies high.

And my guess is, that's exactly why it's not given the proper recognition...McQueen plays a role he's perfectly suited for a bit of a rebel... With no particular background at all... No history that's very interesting (we find out)... No particular reason to be anything different than the next guy... And as a matter of fact... For the most part, he really isn't... It's three hours long, and for the majority of the film... He acts just about like the next guy would... He has some moments of what might define him as a good character... But not any more heroic than the next guy... Perhaps he has some human dignity and sense of pity left... He offers the girl no emotional reciprocation... And when faced with several turning points (Frenchy's dilemma and the saga of the Engine coolie...), he still remains complacent and unchanged...But at the end of this film, he suddenly changes... Apparently without provocation (or supposedly because of the events early in the film... Though I would say we are supposed to assume otherwise...), he takes the role of a hero... We are given no explanation... He, just decides to care... That's the message of the film, and it's a universal one... War film or not (and most of this film lacks fighting), the theme of what makes one man any more important among all the others (the sand pebbles)? Or why does one decide to care suddenly? And at what price does he begin to care about humanity and the other people around him? But isn't that what makes us human? Isn't that what means we have souls? (Which raises an important philosophical question... What does make us human? Why do we care? If, of course we soulless animals... We would have no reason... But I have digressed...) That being said, I found The Sand Pebbles to be a war genre film of the realistic type... But containing a message or point that other films of its kind are sorely lacking in... Worth a look.9 out of 10...

Arguably the film that launched Tom Cruise into the stratosphere, it is exactly what you'd expect from a Simpson\/Bruckheimer production - it's loud, macho and utterly predictable but somehow, people have fallen in love with this film including my Better Half. In fact, I had to watch it by myself because she began quoting the dialogue word-for-word! Frankly, it never really appealed to me and to be honest, I feel slightly vindicated. This is not a film that is easy to take seriously (even if you hadn't seen Hot Shots) but while it does some things very well, it's far from being the polished Eighties icon I was expecting. Yes, expecting - this is the first time I'd watched it...Cruise plays Pete Mitchell, an aggressive Air Force pilot who goes by the name of Maverick. Specialising in being unconventional and rebellious, Maverick and his co-pilot Goose (Anthony ER Edwards, of all people!) find themselves dispatched to the Navy's Top Gun flight school in order to become the best. But Maverick's attitude, combined with the disgrace of his father, puts him at odds with his fellow students and especially Ice (an uncomfortable looking Val Kilmer). Distracted by civilian instructor Charlie (Kelly McGillis), can Maverick tame his inner demons and the skies in order to be the best?Almost everyone is aware of this film in some capacity, whether its due to the frequent action scenes or its undeniable homo-eroticism - it's impossible to watch the volleyball scene with a straight face! Cruise is easily the best of the actors although Tom Skerritt almost betters Cruise as the veteran Viper. But the real stars are the planes as they fly, spin and twist their way around each other. Problem I had was that once you lose track of who is in what plane, the action becomes very confusing. For example, when Maverick talks about flying in an inverse double-barrelled somersault with two twists and a tuck, I didn't know if he was flying or Olympic board diving! You can't follow the action whereas the plot is so simple, it's damn-near insulting. The only surprise for me was that there was no flash-back scene but Hell, Tony Scott has some standards. Kilmer looks very uneasy about the whole thing but the most ironic casting was vocal anti-war critic Tim Robbins as fellow fighter pilot Merlin. Made me chuckle, anyway.I'm sure that waaay back in the day, when Top Gun was cutting edge and before it was spoofed, this would have been great. Just the tonic for an America in the dying days of the Cold War. Now, post 9\/11, it looks horribly dated and excessively patriotic. Cruise has gone on to bigger things, Kilmer seems to have ignored it altogether on his CV and McGillis vanished into thin air. Personally, it never really stirred me until the famous volleyball scene where I couldn't contain my laughter any more. In short, this film is excessively noisy and woefully unimaginative. It's a very basic, mass-appeal Boys-Own adventure that had about 10 seconds of though behind it and a director obsessed with filming lots of shots of planes flying past. If that's what you're looking for, or if you fancy seeing why everyone got very excited 21 years ago, then give it a try. But sometimes, nostalgia is a cruel mistress because the chances are, this film isn't as good as you remember.

Distracted by civilian instructor Charlie (Kelly McGillis), can Maverick tame his inner demons and the skies in order to be the best?Almost everyone is aware of this film in some capacity, whether its due to the frequent action scenes or its undeniable homo-eroticism - it's impossible to watch the volleyball scene with a straight face! Cruise is easily the best of the actors although Tom Skerritt almost betters Cruise as the veteran Viper. But the real stars are the planes as they fly, spin and twist their way around each other. Problem I had was that once you lose track of who is in what plane, the action becomes very confusing. For example, when Maverick talks about flying in an inverse double-barrelled somersault with two twists and a tuck, I didn't know if he was flying or Olympic board diving! You can't follow the action whereas the plot is so simple, it's damn-near insulting. The only surprise for me was that there was no flash-back scene but Hell, Tony Scott has some standards. Kilmer looks very uneasy about the whole thing but the most ironic casting was vocal anti-war critic Tim Robbins as fellow fighter pilot Merlin. Made me chuckle, anyway.I'm sure that waaay back in the day, when Top Gun was cutting edge and before it was spoofed, this would have been great. Just the tonic for an America in the dying days of the Cold War. Now, post 9\/11, it looks horribly dated and excessively patriotic. Cruise has gone on to bigger things, Kilmer seems to have ignored it altogether on his CV and McGillis vanished into thin air. Personally, it never really stirred me until the famous volleyball scene where I couldn't contain my laughter any more. In short, this film is excessively noisy and woefully unimaginative. It's a very basic, mass-appeal Boys-Own adventure that had about 10 seconds of though behind it and a director obsessed with filming lots of shots of planes flying past. If that's what you're looking for, or if you fancy seeing why everyone got very excited 21 years ago, then give it a try. But sometimes, nostalgia is a cruel mistress because the chances are, this film isn't as good as you remember.

Arguably the film that launched Tom Cruise into the stratosphere, it is exactly what you'd expect from a Simpson\/Bruckheimer production - it's loud, macho and utterly predictable but somehow, people have fallen in love with this film including my Better Half. In fact, I had to watch it by myself because she began quoting the dialogue word-for-word! Frankly, it never really appealed to me and to be honest, I feel slightly vindicated. This is not a film that is easy to take seriously (even if you hadn't seen Hot Shots) but while it does some things very well, it's far from being the polished Eighties icon I was expecting. Yes, expecting - this is the first time I'd watched it...Cruise plays Pete Mitchell, an aggressive Air Force pilot who goes by the name of Maverick.

Later on, it was also nominated for academy awards. As most of the Iranian films, Children of Heaven mainly deals with the ordinary people's extraordinary feelings in a philosophical and psychological manner. The child figure is also an indispensible part of Iranian cinema and I think it is because of their innocence and purity of thoughts. Children of Heaven seems to deal with a brother, a sister and their life in Iran but it has more in it. A number of political, ideological, psychological themes are dealt with in this film. Ethical values and their practical application are also referred in the film. In the film, Ali takes Zahra's shoes to the shoemaker to get them repaired. But something unlucky happens and when he is on the way back home, he loses his sister's shoes. They decide to keep the event as a secret for some time as their father has no money to buy a new pair of shoes and as they know that they will be punished for this. They make a plan and they decide to share Ali's sneakers. Zahra wear them in the morning and they change the shoes for Ali's afternoon classes. This goes on for days with different adventures on the way home and on the way to school. One day, Ali hears about a running competition and decides to participate because, the third place award is a pair of shoes. However Ali comes the first in the race and wins the first place prize instead of a pair of new shoes. BEAUTY AND INNOCENCE When we carefully observe the characters in the film we can easily realize the purity of feelings in the film. Innocence and passion for life goes hand in hand during the whole film. When Ali loses his sister's shoes, he doesn't lose his hope and promises to find her the shoes. This is, in a way, a cultural reflection of Iran and Islam. Not to give up and not to lose your hope... Likewise, when Zahra learns that her only pair of shoes are lost, she gets very unhappy but she never betrays her brother. We can see the honesty, and loyalty in such behaviors as well. Obedience is another cultural theme in the film and it is frequently emphasized. For instance, when the mother asks Zahra to help with the housework we can see how obedient Zahra is. Moreover, when the students are in the morning ceremony, they say obedience to our leader all together and reflect the importance of obedience in this culture. Unlike most of the western countries, sharing is another important aspect of Iranian culture. The sibblings share their shoes while going to school, share their sadness while crying, share their father's poverty by not informing his about the lost shoes. In short, they share nearly every possible thing as if it is a must to be completed.The role of woman in Iran is clearly illustrated in the Children of Heaven. She is always in a secondary position in the society and all her acts are dominated by man. Man is the chief in the family and in the society. Woman, on the other hand, has the right to obey... This causes her a hard challenge because of her gender and in such a culture she cannot even struggle against it. On the other hand, socio-economic class causes another big challenge for poor people. In the film, Ali and his father looks for work as gardeners and they go to the city together. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife. Such a huge difference also exist in the lives of people on different sides of the city. While Ali cries for a pair of old, lost shoes, the rich child in the city house owns everything a child should have. Another example to socio-economic classification is the attitude of the salesman in the bazaar. Ali wants to buy some potatoes but he only lets Ali to buy some from the small, half-rotten, old potatoes.All those attitudes of people towards other people or culture towards people causes some psychological situations inevitably. The women in the society are ignored and suppressed. They most of the time, seem to be unhappy but have no chance apart from contenting themselves with what they have. They behave with fear and hesitation. The children, on the other hand, are also ignored because of the poverty and they also have to be content with what they have. When Ali wins the race, he is still not happy, because he doesn't have a new pair of shoes for her sister. This shows us that even the smiles of those innocent poor children are controlled by outside effects like poverty and culture. To sum up, we can, at a glance, detect a variety of emotions and behaviors under the influence of the existing culture in this film. Children of Heaven is a successful mirror not only to the Iranian culture but also to the hearts of human beings...

There are some supporting roles worth a mention, such as Tuesday Weld, who plays Duvall's emotionally unstable wife, made worse by a tragedy in their own family. Barbra Hershey, plays Douglas' ex-wife who is looking for protection from her violent husband.Watch for several good stand-out scenes, the best involving Douglas going berserk at a fast-food burger joint. Much of what happens when Douglas is on-screen is predictable. However, he acts out the role so well, it is really reminiscent of watching say Jack Nicholson go into a slow descending rage. (He would have been just as good if not BETTER in this role!) But maybe he wasn't considered because he's getting too old. However, Douglas is THAT good in this role. When he is on screen you can't take your eyes off of him.The problem is that when he is not on screen, the film loses momentum. While an honest effort by the minor characters, they just aren't strong enough. The investigation and questioning by Duvall, his co-workers, the interviewed witnesses, takes too long to get going. Meanwhile, the viewer is waiting for the action to go back to Douglas so that he can do his next crazy thing. There also isn't enough material for Duvall's unstable wife, or Douglas' worried wife to work with. But it's a double edged sword. Had they BEEN given stronger story lines in the script, we wouldn't have been able to see Douglas in several good scenes.Because of this dilemma, I don't know what would have made Falling Down better. My best guess would be the following indicated belowThere's just one or two little ingredients that are missing, which stop this film from being great. These are too many minor characters and not enough material for them to work with. However, this is still a highly recommended film and well worth seeing.

There also isn't enough material for Duvall's unstable wife, or Douglas' worried wife to work with. But it's a double edged sword. Had they BEEN given stronger story lines in the script, we wouldn't have been able to see Douglas in several good scenes.Because of this dilemma, I don't know what would have made Falling Down better. My best guess would be the following indicated belowThere's just one or two little ingredients that are missing, which stop this film from being great. These are too many minor characters and not enough material for them to work with. However, this is still a highly recommended film and well worth seeing. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"2 April 2007","score":"","review":" Falling Down tells the story of a fired defense contractor with a hot fuse and a passion to execute violence when things don't go his way. Michael Douglas is OUTSTANDING in this role, with a very unpredictable personality. There are times when you compliment the guy for standing up for what he believes in, and while watching the same movie, you feel that he MUST pay the consequences for hurting, and in one case, killing a person.SPOILERS HERE Bill Foster, (played by Douglas) is trying to get home to his daughter's birthday party. Robert Duvall plays the cop on his last day of work before retirement trying to stop him. There are some supporting roles worth a mention, such as Tuesday Weld, who plays Duvall's emotionally unstable wife, made worse by a tragedy in their own family. Barbra Hershey, plays Douglas' ex-wife who is looking for protection from her violent husband.Watch for several good stand-out scenes, the best involving Douglas going berserk at a fast-food burger joint. Much of what happens when Douglas is on-screen is predictable. However, he acts out the role so well, it is really reminiscent of watching say Jack Nicholson go into a slow descending rage. (He would have been just as good if not BETTER in this role!) But maybe he wasn't considered because he's getting too old. However, Douglas is THAT good in this role. When he is on screen you can't take your eyes off of him.The problem is that when he is not on screen, the film loses momentum.
