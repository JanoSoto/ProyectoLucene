There are some spectacular action scenes, Bond's landing on a cruise ship with a beautiful (but lonely) young lady who wants a real man is amusing, and then comes the cool 1980s main theme song, The Living Daylights. But the plot merely recycles old material and throws in the latest flavor of the month (the mujahidin) to seem topical, and frankly I expect something more entertaining and intelligent than that from a Bond film. To make matters worse, the producers also threw in a lot of shoot em' ups and explosions which always kill and maim the bad guys (or the guys confused enough to be siding with the bad guys) while leaving the good guys unscathed.Yet the biggest problem with this movie is the characters and their relationships. Timothy plays the title role of James Bond, but unlike Moore or Connery he seems to have forgotten that most of the film's plot situations are preposterous. He lacks a sense of humour, not to mention charm. Worse still, Timothy's Bond usually treats the Russian Bond girl Kara (played by Maryam D'Abo) like an immature school girl, rather than as someone he would like to seduce. Watching Bond and Kara on screen is like witnessing a traditional school master speaking with a puerile school girl. I am still at a loss to understand why Kara would want to sleep with James Bond at all. In fact, even Sean Connery's Bond (whom Honor Blackman described as the most sexist thing on two legs) never treated any of the Bond girls like that. If the new Bond is a disappointment, this disappointment pales in comparison to the villains. A Bond film depends upon great villains to generate excitement. The Living Daylights, to be blunt, does not have any great villains. Necros (Kerry Shale) is pretty demonic, but unfortunately he gets little screen time. Joe Don Baker, the chief villain, comes across as a laid back grandpa from the South rather than as anyone particularly menacing. There is another villain, whose name I cannot divulge here, but he too seems more like a cowardly playboy rather than a villain in the great Bond tradition. Dr. No, Grant, Goldfinger, and Blofelt would have blown this guy right out of the water in the evil department. Lastly, I could not help thinking that there are far better actresses who could play Bond girls in this movie. Maryam D'Abo tries her best in taking on the Bond girl role all on her own, but unfortunately she just doesn't have the legendary stature of Bond girls Ursula Andress, Daniela Bianchi, Honor Blackman, Luciana Paluzzi (who is also a great villain), Diana Rigg, Britt Ekland, and Maud Adams in order to carry it.

I personally found this film a little uneven if I'm honest....I think where this film is at its strongest is once we get to The War Room; the scenes within the War Room are easily the funniest and best examples of satire. The phone calls between the US President and the Russian President did have me really laughing and I also liked the interplay between President Muffley and the militant Buck Turgidson and thought their various exchanges were absolute gold. Peter Sellers was fantastic in his three different roles although I must admit he was definitely at his best as the German Weapons Researcher. Sellers clearly had a lot of fun here and his performance(s) in this film do almost make up for some of the more tedious aspects. Likewise, Scott was great in his respective role and Hayden was good as the insane general and gave a real scenery chewing performance - did that cigar ever leave his mouth? I think the funniest part of the film was the scene where Mandrake is trying to get through to the President, but runs out of money and asks a soldier to shoot the Coca Cola machine so that he can get some more money in order to get through to the President. The soldier then utters the line If you don't get through to the President, you'll end up in trouble with Coca-Cola. A very funny exchange and quite unexpected if I'm honest.Where the film falters slightly is in most of the scenes outside the War Room. There were far too many scenes from within the war planes that were quite dull if I'm honest. I can understand the opening plane scene and the closing plane scenes, but the constant cuts from the War Room to the planes just seemed pointless.

Immediately afterward, a group of punks decide to rob the store, leaving the couple for dead. The Indian sculpture in front of their store, Old Chief Wood'nhead, comes to life and tracks them down one-by-one. This wasn't bad, and is overall pretty decent. The special effects for the statue are excellent, applying a 'wooden' body-suit to make it move and act just like a wooden statue coming to life, having the stiffness that comes with a moving statue. It steals all the best scenes, especially the assault in the garage and inside the trailer park which are both quite suspenseful due to its presence. The kill scenes also show some verve, as we get attacks by a volley of arrows, a swipe to the head with an axe, and a pretty nasty scalping. On the downside, the story is predictable which ruins the experience a little as you know exactly what's going to happen exactly as it would be expected, playing out basically a routine slasher film with the statue as the killer. It's quite obviously going this route, though, and it makes for a fun time overall.The Raft-Heading out to an abandoned lake, a group of friends swim out to a raft floating in the middle for some relaxation. When a floating mass nearby takes an interest in them, they have to find a way to get away before it kills them all. The biggest thing with this one is that the blob in the lake is really cool. There is a lot of mystery surrounding it and you can't really tell how it's going to end. As great as the mystery is, the creature just looks like a black tarp floating in the water. The deaths are wildly over-the-top, as the blob eats through their flesh, leaving a mound of bloody bones and melted skin. It has a lot of great suspense, and the tension in the second half, where the creature begins to break through the holes in the wood is really creepy. The story moves along at a sharp pace, hardly ever slowing down and being really entertaining once it gets started. This is the segment that features the most satisfying ending and everyone gets their just desserts, featuring a twist that is the nearest the film ever gets to capturing any of the black humor that ran through the original. It's a really good story.The Hitchhiker-Running late from a tryst, a woman hits a hitchhiker accidentally with her car, but fearing the repercussions she takes off. As she struggles with herself for doing the deed, she encounters him repeatedly as she continues on looking for revenge for her actions. The most interesting thing here is how hard the woman fights against the hitchhiker. She runs him over with her car, runs over him and crushes him against trees continually. She does practically everything a human would really do in a similar situation, and it's quite fun to see them. The special effects in here did a very good job on the hitchhiker as every time you see him he's gradually gotten more and more mashed to pieces thanks to Louis Chiles repeatedly driving over him with her car until there is but a skeleton left. The longer it goes on, the more it becomes distorted and the more gruesome it becomes. However, the segment becomes so ludicrously overblown in the escalating wrecking of the car in attempts to dispose of the hitcher that it earns far more on the laugh scale than ever does for its scares. It might have been more interesting if they played up how the mangled hitchhiker could have been a figment of her imagination. That really could've been played up more rather than a few passing hints at it. Its biggest problem, though, is that it gets repetitive after a while and they could have cut this segment down to keep it fresh. It feels like it's doing the same thing over and over, and could've been trimmed down.The Bad Stor(ies) While all have their little problems, as a whole this one is decent enough. The biggest thing that these suffer from is an overall bored feeling. They aren't that original either, as there's been tons of stories out there with the same general plot as these and do it much better. Also quite hard to sit through is the wraparound segments, which are quite terrible, have nothing to do with the features being presented afterward, and have none of the style and wit of the previous entry. That also applies to the stories, but this one mainly suffers from the lack of creativity.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and drug use.

Immediately afterward, a group of punks decide to rob the store, leaving the couple for dead. The Indian sculpture in front of their store, Old Chief Wood'nhead, comes to life and tracks them down one-by-one. This wasn't bad, and is overall pretty decent. The special effects for the statue are excellent, applying a 'wooden' body-suit to make it move and act just like a wooden statue coming to life, having the stiffness that comes with a moving statue. It steals all the best scenes, especially the assault in the garage and inside the trailer park which are both quite suspenseful due to its presence. The kill scenes also show some verve, as we get attacks by a volley of arrows, a swipe to the head with an axe, and a pretty nasty scalping. On the downside, the story is predictable which ruins the experience a little as you know exactly what's going to happen exactly as it would be expected, playing out basically a routine slasher film with the statue as the killer. It's quite obviously going this route, though, and it makes for a fun time overall.The Raft-Heading out to an abandoned lake, a group of friends swim out to a raft floating in the middle for some relaxation. When a floating mass nearby takes an interest in them, they have to find a way to get away before it kills them all. The biggest thing with this one is that the blob in the lake is really cool. There is a lot of mystery surrounding it and you can't really tell how it's going to end. As great as the mystery is, the creature just looks like a black tarp floating in the water. The deaths are wildly over-the-top, as the blob eats through their flesh, leaving a mound of bloody bones and melted skin. It has a lot of great suspense, and the tension in the second half, where the creature begins to break through the holes in the wood is really creepy. The story moves along at a sharp pace, hardly ever slowing down and being really entertaining once it gets started. This is the segment that features the most satisfying ending and everyone gets their just desserts, featuring a twist that is the nearest the film ever gets to capturing any of the black humor that ran through the original. It's a really good story.The Hitchhiker-Running late from a tryst, a woman hits a hitchhiker accidentally with her car, but fearing the repercussions she takes off. As she struggles with herself for doing the deed, she encounters him repeatedly as she continues on looking for revenge for her actions. The most interesting thing here is how hard the woman fights against the hitchhiker. She runs him over with her car, runs over him and crushes him against trees continually. She does practically everything a human would really do in a similar situation, and it's quite fun to see them. The special effects in here did a very good job on the hitchhiker as every time you see him he's gradually gotten more and more mashed to pieces thanks to Louis Chiles repeatedly driving over him with her car until there is but a skeleton left. The longer it goes on, the more it becomes distorted and the more gruesome it becomes. However, the segment becomes so ludicrously overblown in the escalating wrecking of the car in attempts to dispose of the hitcher that it earns far more on the laugh scale than ever does for its scares. It might have been more interesting if they played up how the mangled hitchhiker could have been a figment of her imagination.

Too close. Then suddenly, last summer, Sebastian died while vacationing in Europe with his cousin Catherine. How exactly did Sebastian die? A heart attack says Violet. But Catherine said something different. Her obscene babbling, as Violet puts it, about the events of last summer landed Catherine in a mental institution. And Violet wants that obscene babbling stopped. She wants Catherine lobotomized, wants those thoughts cut out of her brain. And with the wealthy Violet willing to make a large donation to the local mental hospital, financing a whole new surgical wing, hospital administrator Dr. Hockstader is all too ready and willing to have a chunk of Catherine's brain cut out. But young Dr. Cukrowicz, the man who's actually going to be doing the cutting, has serious reservations. Catherine doesn't seem particularly insane to him. She now can't remember what happened last summer. But she wants to. Why is her aunt so desperate to see this surgery performed? Is Violet looking to have insane thoughts cut out of Catherine's brain? Or is she looking to remove some horrible, unspeakable truth about Sebastian before Catherine can remember it? From the moment we, and Dr. Cukrowicz, meet Violet it is obvious there is something off about this woman. It really doesn't seem like she's all there. Her relationship with her son, as she herself describes it, was rather bizarre. It's all a mystery, everything is unclear. Well, one thing is clear actually. Violet wants Catherine lobotomized and she wants it done now. Why? Dr. Cukrowicz would sure love to find out. When he goes to meet Catherine he doesn't find her to be insane. She's a young woman who went through a traumatic event who now must deal with an aunt who would like to see her turned into a mindless zombie. If only she could remember what really happened last summer. But Violet is not going to let that happen. She's putting the pressure on Dr. Hockstader and the administrator wants his new surgical wing. He wants Dr. Cukrowicz to slice that girl's brain open right now. Time is running out.Tension really builds as the knife hangs above Catherine's head. Dr. Cukrowicz is a good man who wants to help Catherine. He wants to find the truth. As things progress it becomes more and more obvious that Violet is quite the villain. She wants that truth hidden away forever. If Catherine's brain must be destroyed to accomplish that so be it. It will all come to a head in a gripping, dramatic conclusion. Who will be able to handle the truth? The film is very well performed. Katharine Hepburn creates that air of bizarre mystery around Violet and is suitably cold and villainous as needed. Elizabeth Taylor is excellent as Catherine. She may seem a little over-the-top at times, a bit hysterical. But with Catherine confronted with a lobotomy, and trying to face up to the horrors of what happened with Sebastian, a little hysteria seems appropriate. It's a very strong, powerful performance. And it had to be to match up with Hepburn who, as always, has such a presence about her. Montgomery Clift, in playing Dr. Cukrowicz, has a much less showy part than either of the leading ladies. He has to ground the film a bit and he does so quite well. A desperately needed cool head. The film is a bit talky, there is nothing very cinematic about it. The story's origins as a stage play show up in lengthy monologues which work less well on screen than on stage. But at least those monologues are in capable hands, performed by a pair of legendary actresses who can make the most of the material. Give Clift credit for his contribution but it is clearly Hepburn and Taylor who make the film. Violet or Catherine. Which, if either of them, is truly mad? To know this we must get to the truth of what happened suddenly, last summer. The truth shall set you free? We shall see. This film's journey towards the truth is a very compelling one.

But young Dr. Cukrowicz, the man who's actually going to be doing the cutting, has serious reservations. Catherine doesn't seem particularly insane to him. She now can't remember what happened last summer. But she wants to. Why is her aunt so desperate to see this surgery performed? Is Violet looking to have insane thoughts cut out of Catherine's brain? Or is she looking to remove some horrible, unspeakable truth about Sebastian before Catherine can remember it? From the moment we, and Dr. Cukrowicz, meet Violet it is obvious there is something off about this woman. It really doesn't seem like she's all there. Her relationship with her son, as she herself describes it, was rather bizarre. It's all a mystery, everything is unclear. Well, one thing is clear actually. Violet wants Catherine lobotomized and she wants it done now. Why? Dr. Cukrowicz would sure love to find out. When he goes to meet Catherine he doesn't find her to be insane. She's a young woman who went through a traumatic event who now must deal with an aunt who would like to see her turned into a mindless zombie. If only she could remember what really happened last summer. But Violet is not going to let that happen. She's putting the pressure on Dr. Hockstader and the administrator wants his new surgical wing. He wants Dr. Cukrowicz to slice that girl's brain open right now. Time is running out.Tension really builds as the knife hangs above Catherine's head. Dr. Cukrowicz is a good man who wants to help Catherine. He wants to find the truth. As things progress it becomes more and more obvious that Violet is quite the villain. She wants that truth hidden away forever. If Catherine's brain must be destroyed to accomplish that so be it. It will all come to a head in a gripping, dramatic conclusion. Who will be able to handle the truth? The film is very well performed. Katharine Hepburn creates that air of bizarre mystery around Violet and is suitably cold and villainous as needed. Elizabeth Taylor is excellent as Catherine. She may seem a little over-the-top at times, a bit hysterical. But with Catherine confronted with a lobotomy, and trying to face up to the horrors of what happened with Sebastian, a little hysteria seems appropriate. It's a very strong, powerful performance. And it had to be to match up with Hepburn who, as always, has such a presence about her. Montgomery Clift, in playing Dr. Cukrowicz, has a much less showy part than either of the leading ladies. He has to ground the film a bit and he does so quite well. A desperately needed cool head. The film is a bit talky, there is nothing very cinematic about it. The story's origins as a stage play show up in lengthy monologues which work less well on screen than on stage. But at least those monologues are in capable hands, performed by a pair of legendary actresses who can make the most of the material. Give Clift credit for his contribution but it is clearly Hepburn and Taylor who make the film. Violet or Catherine. Which, if either of them, is truly mad? To know this we must get to the truth of what happened suddenly, last summer. The truth shall set you free? We shall see. This film's journey towards the truth is a very compelling one.

Too close. Then suddenly, last summer, Sebastian died while vacationing in Europe with his cousin Catherine. How exactly did Sebastian die? A heart attack says Violet. But Catherine said something different. Her obscene babbling, as Violet puts it, about the events of last summer landed Catherine in a mental institution. And Violet wants that obscene babbling stopped. She wants Catherine lobotomized, wants those thoughts cut out of her brain.

An entire lifetime of living in the pit of slavery is WAY beyond MY ability to understand. But I've watched several of my closest family members die in the past 3 years.

Sixty years of paper animation, tradition and more than that, magic, was coming to end. Home on the Range became the last movie made with traditional animation. This notice was received by the longtime fans as a bomb. Claiming that the style was no longer attractive, Disney forgot the past and looked for the future. But it was not just the style that Disney leaves behind, but the soul as well. This review it's about a movie that belongs to the Disney Golden Age and focuses in a character loved by generations the Goofy. The Goofy won his own series in the early of 1990 decade and also a son, Max. Goofy Troop made a great success with the kid and pre- teen public with creative stories and day by day situations. With the success, Disney decided to produce a movie focusing, only not in Goofy, but the relationship between him and his son that was not so developed on the series. But why I start this review talking about the Disney animation style? Just because The Goofy Movie it's that kind of film that Disney really doesn't can produce again, even with all the technology we have on these days. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie was premiered on April 7, 1995 (in Brazil, the movie premiered on July 21, 1995) and made a good presence on the cinema raising more than $ 6,000,000 of box office on the first weekend. As a sequel of the series, the original characters come again. Max has now 14 years old and wants his own life without his father causing shame with his goofy way. He likes a girl named Roxanne, but don't know how to talk with her, freezing when the girl is close. After create a problem on the school, Goofy is advised by the school principal that he have to rethink how he's raising his son. Worried, Goofy decide to save Max of the electric chair, taking him to fish. And then, begins a travel of self-know where father and son will rediscover the meaning of fraternity, trust and love, even if the son grows up, he'll still be a boy for his father. This is the focus of the movie that has a simple and linear screenplay. A moral message at the end and followed by musical sequences closes the production. There's something new on this film? No, absolutely nothing, but this is exactly what makes difference. Sometimes it's not necessary produce a movie full of special effects, action sequences and all of these things. Sometimes, just a good and familiar story, with a soundtrack that really stays on the memory and charismatic and memorable characters really makes difference. And talking about soundtrack, A Goofy Movie has an incredible and memorable musical sequences. Performances by Tevin Campbell, music as Eye to Eye (I2I) and Stand Out is really great. Others, more slowly and sentimental as Nobody Else but You sang by Max and Goofy together have its presence. The final sequence when Goofy and Max really seen that the relation between father and son can really be fun it's beautiful and the stage performance with Powerline it's awesome likewise! But Stand out really stand out on this film! Twenty years. But unfortunately twenty years make a great distance between generations. A Goofy Movie with all its moral lessons and animation style has no place with the kids of these days. If you want feels the nostalgia of the old days, A Goofy Movie it's a nice choice. About the new generation, tries to show this movie it's a good thing, but it's possible that the expectation may be frustrated. But make a try, its praiseworthy!

He likes a girl named Roxanne, but don't know how to talk with her, freezing when the girl is close. After create a problem on the school, Goofy is advised by the school principal that he have to rethink how he's raising his son. Worried, Goofy decide to save Max of the electric chair, taking him to fish. And then, begins a travel of self-know where father and son will rediscover the meaning of fraternity, trust and love, even if the son grows up, he'll still be a boy for his father. This is the focus of the movie that has a simple and linear screenplay. A moral message at the end and followed by musical sequences closes the production. There's something new on this film? No, absolutely nothing, but this is exactly what makes difference. Sometimes it's not necessary produce a movie full of special effects, action sequences and all of these things. Sometimes, just a good and familiar story, with a soundtrack that really stays on the memory and charismatic and memorable characters really makes difference. And talking about soundtrack, A Goofy Movie has an incredible and memorable musical sequences. Performances by Tevin Campbell, music as Eye to Eye (I2I) and Stand Out is really great. Others, more slowly and sentimental as Nobody Else but You sang by Max and Goofy together have its presence. The final sequence when Goofy and Max really seen that the relation between father and son can really be fun it's beautiful and the stage performance with Powerline it's awesome likewise! But Stand out really stand out on this film! Twenty years. But unfortunately twenty years make a great distance between generations. A Goofy Movie with all its moral lessons and animation style has no place with the kids of these days. If you want feels the nostalgia of the old days, A Goofy Movie it's a nice choice. About the new generation, tries to show this movie it's a good thing, but it's possible that the expectation may be frustrated. But make a try, its praiseworthy! Styles that Disney really has lost of decade that cannot be forget. This is A Goofy Movie!

In my opinion, the movie did a good job sticking to the content of the book. In some cases, they even use direct quotes. The actors did a superb job of portraying the characters who are all in a mental institution. Jack Nicolson is especially good as the lead character.I am a Psychology major so, I guess I could be biased toward a movie and book that take a look at the mental health care system and point out what is wrong with it. I will say that some of the content could be disturbing to those who have not read the book or are not familiar with mental illness. I feel that the movie can be enjoyed by everyone. It is funny, heartwarming, thought provoking, and has its serious moments.

So it was not until almost 90 minutes into the film -- when we got the key clue -- that I really began to enjoy and appreciate this film. A better film would have sprinkled some of these clues earlier on in the film. And the ending is a humdinger! Kenneth Branagh is good here. Emma Thompson is really good. But, at least for me, Derek Jacobi (as a psychic) really steals the show! So for me, you've got a D film for the first hour, then an A film the last half hour. Comes out to a C (7).
