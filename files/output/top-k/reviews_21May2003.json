But when Woody gets a tear he's forced to stay back. While Andy is away, Andy's mother holds a garage sale in which she's going to sell off some of the old toys. Woody manages to land himself in the garage sale and is stolen by an evil toy salesman who wants to sell Woody in a special toy collection. So it's up to Buzz, Rex, Slinky Dog, Ham and the others to go on a rescue mission to get Woody back. Of course there are some perils they must overcome during there adventure including Buzz's arch nemesis and even a second Buzz. However when Woody gets to the toy store he finds a life he never knew he had and finds some great new friends like Jessie and Bull's-Eye the horse he may never want to leave. In turn maybe making the other toys adventure all for not.Here it is a rare movie that actually is better than the original. I really don't know where to begin with the great things I have to say about this fantastic piece of film work. It brags the most state of the art computer animation to date, creating not only great toys but even people such as a Japanese baggage handler that I actually at first glance thought to be real. The film has a lot of the same elements as the first but thankfully takes on a life all it's own by having the toys voyage to the city and not just next door.Writer\/director John Lasseter puts together a great film with some great scenes. One of the scenes that really stood out for me, was the scene in which a toy repair doctor is called in to fix Woody. The doctor has a great 'evil genius' look to him and is one of the best animated characters in the movie. Credit must also be given to the fine group of programmers whose contribution really made this movie work. Lasseter brings back the same great characters from the first film like Slinky Dog, Ham and the two main stars but he also brings along with them the same fantastic voice talents such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and John Rantzenburger, who really give the characters their personalities. Some great new characters are also added in like Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer), a wise old prospector to make the film that much more original. This movie has almost nothing but great moments, even the musical numbers in this film worked. Yet I have to discredit Buzz's speech in front of the American flag because I thought it to be a little too patriotic. The writing and screenplay team members including Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao and a few others really do their part by making a great story that is not only funny but has some great sentiment and shows the viewer the meaning of values and cherishing the things you care about.Toy Story 2 really is a great family movie as a matter of fact it's one of the best movies I've seen. I rarely see good values and good clean fun displayed in many movies anymore but this movie displays that and so much more. I say to any person, whether you have a family or not, to go out to your local video store today and have a double bill with the original Toy Story and Toy Story 2.Overall Rating 8.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2003","score":"","review":" Rated G Runtime 92mins Release Date 1999Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang are all back in a whole new adventure that pits them against their worst enemy yet, an evil toy salesman who has his eyes set on obtaining Woody to add him a to a rare toy collection.Toy Story 2 starts off with the toys' owner, Andy, heading off to cowboy camp with his favorite toy Woody.

After some convincing he decides to do so, and with a little work the chickens make progress. But just as things are looking up for them, along comes the worst. A machine in which puts not one but all the chickens' lives in danger by turning them in to chicken potpies.I can honestly say that Chicken Run is a hilarious movie. It's filled with a whole different variety of great characters, including a couple of scheming rats, and I mean this literally, a veteran R.A.F rooster, and an assortment of chickens, including a genius and a chicken that knits. It also has an amazing voice cast, which suits each different character perfectly. The film adds some great story elements including certain philosophies on life and imprisonment that make it a comedy for the whole family. Surprisingly it also does what a lot of live action movies haven't seem to be able to do lately, it carries itself the whole way through.The film is directed written and produced by Peter Lord and Nick Park, two men that can take animals like chickens and turn them in to people. Now ladies and gentlemen that, in my opinion, is talent. To help add to the realism of the characters, is the fantastic claymation team that worked for months on making this film work. They actually do such a good job on things such as facial expression, that this alone had created scenes that had me in a roar of laughter. I especially have to take note of the two rats who in my opinion stole every scene they had and added that much extra hilarity to the film. It also has a great little action scene inside the pie making machine' but it's really well done so I don't want to spoil anything about it. One thing I do have to say that maybe could have been left out was the musical number. I don't understand why every children's movie has to have a musical segment. Lord, Park and co-producer David Sproxton can't really be blamed for this unoriginal moment, after all it is in every one. I was just hoping that maybe it could have been left out of one or two films, this being one of the two I had hoped for.Overall the story was wonderful entertainment at any age level. It's not by any means the perfect family comedy but it does come very close. This movie has so many good things going for it that I really hope this genius team puts together a sequel and this is something I don't say very often.

Tokyo's future is one full of brutal gangs and extreme violence, and for two teenagers, Kaneda and Testsuo, it suits them just fine. They are the head members of the city's toughest bike gang. Even their main opposition, the Clowns, can't seem to touch these guys. However, on a night when the Clowns were supposed to receive their usual beating, something most unusual happens. During the fight, Tetsuo collides with a young boy possessing extraordinary looks and powers never before seen. As it would seem, the boy turns out to be a special classified military project, and subsequently Tetsuo is taken to a highly guarded military hospital and quarantined. Not being pleased with the treatment of their friend, Kaneda and the rest of the gang set out to rescue Tetsuo. However they find out that since the collision, Tetsuo has changed, not just in personality but he now possesses powers which neither he, nor they, or even the whole of Neo Tokyo could have possibly ever believed. But soon they will all see, and soon they will all believe. Based on Izo Hahimoto's highly imaginative and captivating story, this film's North American version stars a host of well-known Japanimation voices. The film's true stars, however, are the Animation team's brilliant artistic work, and Hahimoto's brilliance and ability to twist his story and make it something unexpected and complex.  Director Katushiro Utomo does a first rate job giving this movie the look and the pace that this epic truly deserves. I really and truly can't count how many people I should give kudos to. Even the dubbing job in this film is great. The mouthing pretty much stays in time with the voiceover, which is not only a problem in Japanimation style films, it's a problem in almost every international film that gets a dubbed release. Producers Shunzo Kato and Ryohoi Suzuki should really be proud of the money they spent, because in my opinion they help put together not only one of the most fascinating Japanimation films of all time, they helped to put together one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. The sound on the special release version really adds serious feeling and intensity to the movie, and in my opinion should be watched by any Akira fan that hasn't seen it. I'd really like to say more about the film, but to mention any more than I have would give some of it away, and to do so would be wrong due to the fact that half the greatness of this film is in its ability to leave the viewer not knowing what is going to happen next. Dynamic is the best word I can use to sum up Akira. This film is really a triumph on every level, and should not be taken as any less of a film than a live action production.

This, I am certain had a lot to do with the nature of the trailer and the things I've heard other people say about it. Just to maker it clear yes Meet Joe Black is something of a romantic film and yes it is probably best enjoyed (especially at certain moments) with your girlfriend, but there is much more to this film that just the romantic side. This film is also funny, enchanting (in a non-romantic way), utterly entertaining and intriguing. The credit for creating a compelling story, that never gets boring (despite the films length), certainly must be given to Martin Brest (of Beverly Hills Cop fame), but he couldn't have done it without his actors and one actress in particular. Brad Pitt (Joe Black) and Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) certainly are the main focus of the story, because it the main point is an agreement they both have and the story between Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is &#145;just' a by product of that. But I will not focus too much on the story, as most of you will probably know that Pitt plays death who has come to earth to get Parrish, whose time has come.

I think it is quite an accomplishment to stand in the middle between Hopkins and Pitt and still be able to stand tall and not be blown away by the talent and ability those two actors possess.

I for one, feel that Pitt and Forlani should at least have gotten Globe nominations and I also feel that there cloud have been an Oscar nomination for the wonderful Cinematography or the set decoration.

Still living out his nightmarish past with Jason, his dream soon turns in to reality as, one by one, the residents of the shelter are murdered. But is it really Jason doing the killing? His time at Crystal Lake is a distant memory, but Tommy Jarvis still can't forget his hellish battle with demonic killer, Jason Voorhees. Due to his condition, Tommy is sent to a boarding home for young people with emotional problems. Right away things go horribly bad at the home, as one resident murders another. Things then go from bad to worse as a killer, with the same identity as Jason, starts murdering the surviving residents one at a time. Will Tommy be able to stand tall and defeat Jason? Or will he become the notorious killer's next victim? John Shepherd leads this cast of the most horrendous actors to ever see the silver screen. Not that the spaghetti-thin script leaves them much room to display any kind of acting, but good gracious, you figure if it was that easy these people would at least try. I understand that the films producers just wanted a good looking cast but I just think that with all the actors out there they could have at least found some good looking people who could act. Mentioning any of the supporting cast would be impossible, just because they are completely forgettable, and any thought of a recollection only turns up a blank. Danny Steinmann was paid to create a film with the same unappealing characters, same unappealing plot, and same unappealing setting as the films awful predecessors, minus the first. Never the less, the man should be ashamed of himself. Mind you, this one does have a little more story than some of the previous efforts, but by no means is this any way a compliment. The movie's end was unpredictable, but so lame and out of the blue that it's obviously going to be unpredictable.

Still living out his nightmarish past with Jason, his dream soon turns in to reality as, one by one, the residents of the shelter are murdered. But is it really Jason doing the killing? His time at Crystal Lake is a distant memory, but Tommy Jarvis still can't forget his hellish battle with demonic killer, Jason Voorhees. Due to his condition, Tommy is sent to a boarding home for young people with emotional problems. Right away things go horribly bad at the home, as one resident murders another. Things then go from bad to worse as a killer, with the same identity as Jason, starts murdering the surviving residents one at a time. Will Tommy be able to stand tall and defeat Jason? Or will he become the notorious killer's next victim? John Shepherd leads this cast of the most horrendous actors to ever see the silver screen. Not that the spaghetti-thin script leaves them much room to display any kind of acting, but good gracious, you figure if it was that easy these people would at least try. I understand that the films producers just wanted a good looking cast but I just think that with all the actors out there they could have at least found some good looking people who could act. Mentioning any of the supporting cast would be impossible, just because they are completely forgettable, and any thought of a recollection only turns up a blank. Danny Steinmann was paid to create a film with the same unappealing characters, same unappealing plot, and same unappealing setting as the films awful predecessors, minus the first. Never the less, the man should be ashamed of himself. Mind you, this one does have a little more story than some of the previous efforts, but by no means is this any way a compliment.

It has a first rate cast, especially all three of the leads who happen to pull out some of the best performances of their careers for this film, most noticeably Duvall.

This is a solid wartime thriller, but it just lacks a little too much substance such as the plotting of the caper between Caine's men, and carries itself out like a very long book.

The scenery was terrific and I have to admit writer Tom Mankiewicz came up with some sharp dialogue, especially the dialogue written for Caine's character.

Running at one-hundred and thirty-one minutes this movie would have sat better with me had it been trimmed down to ninety so it would have seemed less like a soap opera and more like a thriller. I do like to see the element of love in films, but this one was supposed to be a thriller, and with all the Sutherland love scenes added it seemed more like a love story with thrill aspects.This movie is entertaining and worth a rent, especially if you want to see three fantastic actors in one movie.

I demand to know who thought that the CGI Yoda was a good idea, the fight scene near the end made me cringe.  I felt bad for everyone who was involved with that debacle.3.)

Some of the worst dialogue around.  You would think if Lucas could not handle the screenwriting, he would of handed it off to someone else, but no...What the audience is left with is insipid drivel (see the Sand Speech).In short if ATTACK OF THE CLONES had spent even a quarter of the running time on the actual development of the characters and narrative, instead of expensive bloated set pieces, it could have been at most watchable.  I will not see the third film...how will 20th Century Fox ever recover having lost my nine dollars? That ought to show em'. 1\/10.

But instead of making the wrong things right and alleviating the emptiness, Joshua too is now an extremist killer who must flee the country and assume a new identity as Guy, a member of the French foreign legion. Here he takes refuge and joins a cause in hopes that he can redeem the wrongs that he has committed. But as the war progresses for this sniper, he just gets deeper in to the darkness. Until, however, he is called in to do a refugee escort mission and meets Verra a beautiful surbian woman who is pregnant with her Muslom rapist's child. After having a scuffle with his partner over the woman and then subsequently murdering him, Joshua, Verra and her infant son embark on a powerful journey of hope and redemption through the war torn plains of Serbia.Remarkable is the only way I can start off my review of this movie. This In my opinion is the most underrated drama of all time. The characters are so beautifully created by the great actors playing the roles that you actually believe these experiences are happening to these people. Quade who I mentioned earlier is an amazing talent who is truly one of hollywoods best shines, like the north star.

I must admit that I really hope hollywood uses this virtually unknown director much, much more in the future.Writer Robert Orr knows how to put together a movie, his script is first rate and just glows with realism. He also boasts great ideas and shows how brutal war can be. For instance a scene where Quade must sit and watch a bus load of people either get clubbed over the head with a choice blunt weapon from a golf bag or get moad down in firing squad fashion. The journey that he takes the characters on delves so far in to the black, take for instance the scene I recalled earlier wich happens to occur within the first five or ten minutes in which Rose get's the appalling opportunity to see what his family looks like after they've been charred to a crisp by a devastating explosion, that you can't even begin to think that Quade has any chance of finding the good in the world or even in himself for that matter. But through twists of fate and a little compassion Rose start's seeing a chance and so does the viewer.To Finalize this without giving this movie the exact credit that it deserves would be an absoloute sin. This is the most powerful Drama I have ever had the pleasure of viewing, and had it had a couple of more scenes in wich the viewer was able to witness a little more of the war aspect of that torn country I would have given this piece of artistry a perfect ten (and I almost and I stress almost never give out that mark).
