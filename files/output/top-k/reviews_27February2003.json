This new age masterpiece by Tom Tykwer shows the pure confidence of the writer\/director, which makes the film such a delight to watch.  It is like no other foreign film.The manipulation of music, editing and imaging are executed to perfection. The movies fast pace will keep you on the edge of your seat, and although there is not much dialogue throughout the film, the parts which see Lola (Franka Potenete) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) talking in bed, gives the viewers a chance to catch their breath.It all starts with a phone call.  Manni is in trouble and calls Lola for help.  Manni has been caught up in a deal which involves him to deliver 100 000 marks to his gangster boss at 1200pm or that is the end of him. Manni does a 'Two Hands' with the money and has 20 minutes before the meeting is scheduled to take place, to resolve the problem.Lola, being the good girlfriend she is decides to take matters into her own hands and tries desperately to get the money for Manni. The movie is split into three different storylines that retrace identical settings.  Each time the story changes depending of the behavior of Lola.  With the story being able to take any direction, it will leave you guessing on what to expect.With her symbolic bright red hair and constantly exposed tattoos, they could not have picked a more suitable actress for the role.

Running.Surprisingly, the movie was only shot with three cameras and one part was shot on a normal digital camera.  The effect that music has on the film is incredible.  The mixture of bizarre, dance beats created by Tom Tykwer and vocals by Franka will stick in your head for days.  The music accompanies the fast paced imaging and produces a high adrenaline atmosphere when Lola is running.A main theme that is evident in the film is the concept of fate.  It is totally questionable.

I have often done that. Although I cannot be absolutely certain, I'm inclined to choose Red Beard, with Hello Dolly and Judgement at Nuremberg as close contenders.If I am allowed to use only one word to describe this film, it will be warm. From Akahige flows a warmth that can be said to be almost uncharacteristic of Kurosawa, or at least much more palpable than in any other of his films. This warmth is particularly seen in his portrayal of the little people (borrowed fom Bob Hope in the 1971 Oscar Award), at which Kurosawa is very good. The best example is in a scene close to the end.To set the scene, the young doctor played by Yuzo Kayamo has almost completed his transformation from a sceptical, arrogant apprentice to a humane, loyal disciple under the eccentric but effective training of the head of the hospital played by Toshiro Mifune. In turn, the young doctor is now helping with the tranformation of a juvenile prostitute (rescued by Toshiro Mifune) from a neurotic patient into a normal person. The example I have in mind is an episode between this girl and a small boy who has been driven to theft by poverty.While the girl is well on her way to recovery and helping with manual work in the hospital, she has difficulty winning the acceptance of her co-workers. The episode started when they catch sight of the little boy trying to steal rice, but fail to stop him. In the following day, the girl managers to corner the little guy in the hospital. The conversation that ensues would break a heart of steel. What we see is two innocent children talking about poverty, hunger and life in a matter-of-course manner, without any wailing, without any bitterness, without even a trace of sadness. At the end, she tells him not to steal any more and promises to bring him some food the following day.Unknown to them, the conversation is heard by some of the girl's co-workers, who end up in quiet sobs. The next day, at lunch, the girl tries to get an extra bowl of rice. One of the women who did not hear the conversation takes it away from her, claiming that she does not need that much. Those who heard the conversation the day before immediately snatch the rice back for the girl, claiming that she is a growing child and needs a lot of food. The scene is actually quite funny, and will have you laughing, but with a lump in your throat and mist in your eyes.There is so much about this film and I won't go into details. I must mention however the wonderful music, which also has a feeling of warmth consistent with the film. In particular, there is a hauntingly beautiful little tune accompanying throughout the young doctor's untiring, patient and caring effort to help the girl recover from her traumatic experience.Toshiro Mifune put up one of his best performances. Yuzo Kayama, a most popular star\/idol at that time (comparable to Tom Cruise at his hay days) played his role as a solid, down-to-earth actor. All the numerous supporting roles were extremely well cast. Most significant, however, are the very minor roles (such as the labour women mentioned before) that are equally captivating, leaving a deep impression in the audience's mind.

Skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.This film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating.  Watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack-jawed for 90 minutes.  It's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film, and thank god for that.  The footage is brilliant.  It gave me the feeling of watching an old Buster Keaton film I've seen some of the tricks Keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless.  That's the feeling this film gave me.  Yeah, I've seen people skate pools before, but to watch the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on Keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window.  It's absolutely brilliant to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been tried by almost everyone.This film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a film.  This is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not.  I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest, and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. As for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory, I think that's an unfair disparagement.  I liked seeing these guys get excited about their past.  They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever.  They have the right to pat themselves on the back.  They were stars for doing what they loved to do.  Most of these guys\/girls never achieved the staggering success Tony Hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then.  Sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf\/skate industry.  How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do?  They can.

The acting overall was great, the one small downside being that Brendan Fraser spoke in a monotone part of the time, but that's just a minor nitpick. Everyone else was stellar. I especially loved Rachel Weisz in the drunken librarian scene.Two big highlights for me were the special effects and the score. The special effects I thought were quite impressive. Imhotep's step-by-step regeneration was well done, and the sandstorm definitely deserves a mention. I also liked the score, especially Imhotep's theme. The great music, I think, is one of the things that was sorely missed in the sequel.I have to mention just one thing about The Mummy that bugs me a few errors regarding the ancient Egyptian information in the movie. The main one that always makes me cringe is when Evelyn is telling Rick about mummification and she informs him that ...they took out the heart as well. This is incorrect. The ancient Egyptians left the heart in the body, as they believed that it, not the brain, was the center of thought and emotion and that it would be needed for the body to be resurrected in the next world.

But more then the story itself it's David Cronenberg's film-making and the photography that is incredibly well done! It's difficult to explain what I feel for this movie with only words. I think I've never seen a movie before that includes so many and different sensations than this one!

Stargate incorporates all three of those, and I think that's partially why I like it so much. In my opinion, it's great entertainment. Sure, it may not be a deep, highly philosophical movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a fantastic movie to just sit back, relax, and be transported to another world for a few hours. Just a few quick highlights Overall, I thought the acting was good. Not mindblowingly fantastic, but definitely good. I especially thought James Spader did a fine job as the geeky scientist Jackson, and Jaye Davidson was excellent as Ra. I also liked Alexis Cruz' performance as Skaara--especially the cigarette-smoking scene. I got a big chuckle out of that one.The score was a big highlight of the movie for me. David Arnold did a spectacular job here.I loved the creature effects! An earlier reviewer said, If they'd made `Stargate' today, that thing the Mastadge would have been computer animated, and it wouldn't have been nearly so real or so adorable. I totally agree with this comment. I'm all for computer animation (for example, Gollum in LOTR TTT was superb) but I think there are some cases when it's just better to have the real thing, so to speak. This is definitely one of those cases.Overall, I think Stargate has just the right combination of fluff, special effects, ancient Egypt, and humor to be highly enjoyable. I give it a rating of three and a half out of four.By the way, if you like Stargate, I recommend buying the Ultimate Edition DVD that just came out. There aren't very many extra features, but the quality is excellent and definitely makes it worth the price.

It not only boasts quite simply, the best special effects ever seen in any motion picture, but an all-star cast who put in (despite some asinine remarks to the contrary) magnificent performances all. The music is (as always with John Williams) utterly superb, and there was rarely a moment (save perhaps the occasional love scene that went on a wee bit too long) that you lose interest in the plot. And dear god; Yoda's heroic finale is a moment of utter cinematic genius.I have really had my fill of complacent Star Wars fans mouthing off about the splendor of the original trilogy (which, let's face it, has aged a great deal) and how Lucas has ruined his legacy blah blah blah, well we all know the rant. It's exhausting, and one wonders what George Lucas has to do, short of opening a vein, to please his 'die-hard' fans. The words impossible and expectations spring to mind.

First of all, it isn't nearly as violent as those films, but still has some intense brutal violence. Second of all, this wasn't an original screenplay, it was an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'. This really didn't differ all that much from Rum Punch, accept Jackie Brown was white instead of black. I think this different kind of Tarantino movie is actually a masterpiece! I think this is a fantastic film, with great writing, directing and especially acting (like all of Quentin's films). The story is about a middle-aged black woman Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who is a stewardess for a crummy airline that flies from L.A. to Cabo San Lucas. When she gets caught by two police detectives Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and Dargus (Michael Bowen) for transporting drugs and money for a brutal thug Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) she ends up in jail. When she gets out of jail on bail, an older bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forrester) who is Ordell's bail bondsman as well, falls for her. Out of jail, she must help Nicolette to catch Ordell, but if Ordell finds out her plan, he will have absolutley no problem killing her. With the choices of helping Ordell and risking going to jail and helping Nicolette and risk getting killed, she decides to play them both and work with Max to get $500,000 from Ordell, turn Ordell into the cops, and run off with the money. This film also stars Robert DeNiro as Ordell's partner in crime, Louis, Bridget Fonda as Ordell's girlfriend, Melanie, and Chris Tucker as a loud mouth petty thief, Beaumont Livingston. Great performances given in by Pam Grier, Robert DeNiro, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and especially, Robert Forrester in the role which earned him an Academy Award Nominee for Best Supporting Actor of the Year in 1997. This film is great, and I highly recommend you see it. Although not as good as 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction', this is still going to be a memorable Tarantino film. Rent it Today (But see 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' first).
