That was how I later got around to watching the original 1961 film, The AbsentMinded Professor, starring Fred MacMurray. It's been nearly a year and a half since I watched that film, but I still remember thinking it was better than the lacklustre remake. Son of Flubber is the 1963 sequel to the 1961 live action Disney movie, so I was bound to end up watching it eventually. As with most sequels, I was expecting this one to be downhill from the original, and I think it is (just slightly), but it's definitely still better than the 1997 movie.Professor Ned Brainard has introduced his invention of Flubber to the U.S. military, but when he goes to get paid for his amazing invention, he learns that the Pentagon has decided that the substance must be kept top secret, and they can't give the professor his payment for it yet. This doesn't help the fact that the future of Medfield College is once again in jeopardy due to financial problems, and that Ned and his wife, Betsy are broke and get a huge tax bill. However, the absent-minded physical chemistry professor has a new discovery which he hasn't unleashed upon the world yet. It's called Flubber gas, and it can change the weather! He believes this new gas can end his current troubles, and Biff Hawk plans to use it to help the college football team win a game. However, as Ned experiments with this Flubber gas, he ends up causing trouble which he is unaware of, and he also finds that his marriage is in trouble.This sequel didn't seem that interesting to me at first when I got around to watching it, but that soon changed. As a comedy, Son of Flubber certainly isn't hilarious, but the gags are often funny, even if there are no huge laughs. Memorable ones include the scenes with a certain Medfield College football player's uniform filled with Flubber gas, Ned making it rain inside with his new invisible substance and the way the dog reacts to it, and the professor not realizing that the Flubber gas is making glass shatter all over town, with people not knowing how it's happening! However, there also may be times when it gets a little too silly, and I wouldn't say most of the film is really that funny. Still, at least I can say I laughed at times, definitely more often than I did when I last watched Flubber, the 1997 film. Aside from the humour, the story isn't exactly great, but it was enough to hold my interest, at least somewhat, though it did seem a tad overlong to me. I also think the cast is mostly good here, including Fred MacMurray.Since I waited quite a while to watch this sequel after watching The AbsentMinded Professor early last year, they're not as easy for me to compare as they would be if I had watched one just after the other. However, I clearly remember that I wasn't amazed by the 1961 Disney film, but still thought it was pretty good family fare, and unsurprisingly a case where the original is superior to the remake. This 1963 sequel isn't as popular as its predecessor, and even though I watched it a while after the original, I guess I can understand that, but it does come close in quality. Neither is an absolute classic (many animated Disney films that Walt Disney was around to produce are superior to these two live action ones made only several years before his death), but they still have their charm decades after they were originally released in the early 60's, even if this one was more of a cash-in and didn't have much new to offer after the original.

Although the earlier scenes, which mostly involve incoming high school freshman mercilessly degraded-both physically and mentally- by older students in plain view of adults, are both comparatively ineffective and exceedingly unlikely, the film still manages to capture the characters' juvenile feelings of uncertainty about the future mixed with youth's naïve optimism and reckless hedonism. The strength of Dazed and Confused is that it focuses on creating complex, fully realized characters instead of the usual pop culture clichés of stock characters like jocks and nerds. Unfortunately, Linklater creates what can only be an unintentional juxtaposition within his own material since the early day scenes are too focused on the unrealistic initiation rites to gel well with the carefully observed character interactions of the night scenes.Dazed and Confused is known for its use of classic rock songs that first became popular during the '70s but these songs aren't just present to give the film period authenticity; in a rather blunt way they pull the viewer into the action of the film. Their (mostly) juvenile lyrics also suggest the simplistic attitudes even the most intelligent youths are sometimes drawn to. Still, the music suffers from nearly always being non-diegetic and a bit overused.The technical execution is above average; the editing is really the stand out aspect as the film flows well and there's a certain logic in the way unrelated scenes follow one another. Here again the strength is in the later parts of the film as the fight scene is surprisingly visceral and the very last scene with its sweeping crane shot and view of a wide open road of possibility is the perfect ending of a film about people going through one of life's major transitions. The acting is also universally excellent; I saw a few familiar faces who built careers on the foundation of their performances here and a few others (especially Jason London as Pink) who I'm surprised didn't manage to become household names after this.

Throw in an increasingly refined (not show-offy) widescreen color production (with the great Milton Krasner at the camera), and a generally opulent production, and you have a classic.A classic made more classic by the equally romantic Sleepless in Seattle and with echoes in the pair of Hawke\/Delpy romances, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset. It makes you want to fall in love forever, because this is all about that extended moment where two people meet and something really clicks, quickly. And in the dizzy realization, sometimes at awkward times in their lives, the movies (all of them, in different ways) soar. Of course, the first source of all of these is Love Affair, the 1939 movie directed by the same director, Leo McCarey. (There is also a miserable 1994 Warren Beatty version of Love Affair.)The reason for all these similar movies is that main hook of the plot--two lovers meet and find true love, but must go separate ways, so they agree to meet six months later after taking care of other things. And, then, well, not everything is what you want in life, and there all the twists and tears begin. If you have any romantic drippiness in you at all, you'll love the idea, and love the movie. Grant and Kerr are both beautiful in a kind of stately way, and are a good match, even if you don't quite feel the chemistry you should. Indeed, the entire movie is stately (this is a product still of the new widescreen format, which often had cameramen making perfect but stable compositions that really worked the horizontal movement but left the camera less physical, less unpredictable).Which is fine. It's a romance with dignity, not wild passions. It's beautiful in every sense, and designed from the ground up to be classic. I actually prefer the 1939 version for the honesty of the romance, the feel of it, but it's hard to get a crystal clear copy of that one now that it's in the public domaine. This 1957 version is enshrined for other reasons, and as much as it's now dated, too, it's still technically clean and modern in other ways.What kills the movie in certain key parts (and it's painful to see how avoidable this was) is a series of inserted songs, especially some sung by children in the second half. It's worse than mere filler, it's clumsy distraction, and not well done, and not pertinent to the main plot. McCarey, for all his brilliance, has always had a sentimental side that tips into schmaltz and cornball antics (see The Bells of St. Mary's for examples of both). Here it clashes with what works so well.And what works so well works amazingly well, making the movie, despite its flaws, a repeatable, lovable experience.

And, then, well, not everything is what you want in life, and there all the twists and tears begin. If you have any romantic drippiness in you at all, you'll love the idea, and love the movie. Grant and Kerr are both beautiful in a kind of stately way, and are a good match, even if you don't quite feel the chemistry you should. Indeed, the entire movie is stately (this is a product still of the new widescreen format, which often had cameramen making perfect but stable compositions that really worked the horizontal movement but left the camera less physical, less unpredictable).Which is fine. It's a romance with dignity, not wild passions. It's beautiful in every sense, and designed from the ground up to be classic. I actually prefer the 1939 version for the honesty of the romance, the feel of it, but it's hard to get a crystal clear copy of that one now that it's in the public domaine. This 1957 version is enshrined for other reasons, and as much as it's now dated, too, it's still technically clean and modern in other ways.What kills the movie in certain key parts (and it's painful to see how avoidable this was) is a series of inserted songs, especially some sung by children in the second half. It's worse than mere filler, it's clumsy distraction, and not well done, and not pertinent to the main plot. McCarey, for all his brilliance, has always had a sentimental side that tips into schmaltz and cornball antics (see The Bells of St. Mary's for examples of both). Here it clashes with what works so well.And what works so well works amazingly well, making the movie, despite its flaws, a repeatable, lovable experience.

It attacks its characters, and its audience, psychologically as well as viscerally, it makes you think about the people in it, it terrifies and haunts you, and it contends with the themes of lust and betrayal. It's a tremendously sweeping psychological thriller with some true tension and some marvelous performances that even still haunts me with its images and situations. And apparently I'm not the only one, for Glenn Close has stated many times that husbands had written her thank-you notes, claiming that her performance in the film saved their marriages. If you're interested in how, read further.The movie stars Michael Douglas in one of his finest performances as a married lawyer who one weekend, while his wife and daughter are visiting relatives in the country, commits a lusty sin by engaging in an extramarital affair with a sexy but sadistic woman played with astonishing conviction by the great Glenn Close. The one-night stand turns into a nightmare as Close becomes increasingly obsessive and compulsive with Douglas, even to the point of stalking him and his family. Douglas, fearing for his marriage and the lives of his family, scrambles to end his relationship with Close, which turns to the worse.Fatal Attraction is a psychologically solid movie that treats its themes of adultery and lust with conviction and power. That's just one thing I admired. In many other movies, I have grown increasingly tired of seeing pointless sex scenes, preferring it when the filmmakers merely suggest an errotic moment and leave it up to the imaginations of the audience to fill in the void. But her, it's different. The sex scenes, which are visceral and concupiscent, do not turn on the audience, but instead appall them. We don't cheer or become errotic, but drop our jaws and immediately start fearing the worst.But that's just one tiny element I admired. It's what followed afterward that I really found effective. First of all, we have two very solid characters, developed into rounded-out human beings that we can come to associate ourselves with and, even in the case of the Glenn Close character, who is psychotic and a threat to others as well as herself, care about. At times, we identify more with her than we do with Michael Douglas, who is our protagonist. As we discover later in the movie, Close is as much a victim of this affair as Douglas is. She's not a monster; she's a human being with feelings, who is hurting and being torn apart by the aftereffects of this intended one-night stand.The aftereffects of the affair become increasingly suspenseful long before any lives are really in danger. As Hitchcock proved to us in his masterpieces, suspense can be achieved even without any lives placed in peril. A lot of tension develops as Douglas fights to keep the affair a secret from his wife and child, and from everybody else if he can manage, and he performs some very sane decisions instead of acting stupid like so many other people do in so many other thrillers. The tension also mounts as development is spawned by the performance of Anne Archer as Douglas's wife.Fatal Attraction was directed by Adrian Lyne and it is a technically smooth movie as well as a brilliant one. The art-direction, the cinematography, the lighting, the misc en scene, everything is fabulous. The movie is great to look at as well as experience. Now some people have complained about the ending, which is considered a cop-out. And if Hitchcock had been allowed to make a movie like this, he probably would have avoided the ending that was the chosen one of two alternatives to end this story. However, though understanding the detractors, I think the end works. It works for me on the same grounds that the even more controversial ending of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece Apocalypse Now did. The movie as a whole is brilliant, brutal, intense, and wonderfully acted. Michael Douglas should have been nominated for his role and Glenn Close and Anne Archer were well-deserving of their Academy Award nominations, as was everybody else who was mentioned on the rosters that night.

His only minor flaw is his rushing towards the endings, which includes this one. Nonetheless, he expands his horizons a bit by delivering some nice animated sequences and delightful visual clues.The griping begins here. The acting, writing, directing, music, and pacing works perfectly fine---until the third act. Mysteries run like a magical act, you should never ever reveal the secret until after the trick is performed, that is if you choose to.

The main appeal of Vertigo is gone the intrigue, the mystery has disappeared. The problem has been solved to a major extent, but we still are not seeing the credits. Not sure where the blame should be placed, but I'll hand it to the writer, which spilled the beans far too soon.Films can run on multiple genres sometimes (District 9 being a recent successful example), but when the first part is mystery, it's a lot tougher to pull off a wholesome successful film.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"20 July 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Who doesn't love food?Itami Juzo's Tampopo is a heartwarming film about people who love, and are often obsessed with, food. The main narrative follows two truck drivers, Gun (Yamazaki Tsutomu) and Goro (Watanabe Ken) who stumble upon a run down, unpopular ramen noodle shop. The shop's owner, Tampopo (Miyamoto Nobuko), is running it all by herself and isn't too experienced in the art of making good ramen. After a brawl, Gun and Goro take it upon themselves to improve Tampopo's cooking and redefine her shop. The film not only focuses on this narrative, but is interspersed with brilliantly transitioned scenes of people's interaction with food a white-suited yakuza (Yakusho Koji) and his mistress perform erotic acts with food, a group of homeless turn out to be master chefs, a young corporate subordinate upstages all of his superiors with his knowledge of French cuisine at an expensive dinner, an old lady sneaks around in a supermarket just to feel the food, among others.Never missing a step, Yamazaki Tsutomu fully embodies the character of Gun. His tough assertiveness, along with the willingness to fight and instigate others, gives him many of the characteristics that John Wayne's famous cowboy persona's had. In fact, the entire cast is filled with likable, charismatic characters. Tampopo is spunky, determined, and easy to root for&#x96;we want her to succeed in her quest for ramen- making perfection. Yakusho Koji is also a welcome presence with his depiction of the erotic possibilities of food; in one scene he cracks an egg and the yolk is passed around between his mouth and his beautiful mistress's. It is ultimately the way in which these characters are portrayed on screen that gives them such a likable presence. Food is universally loved&#x96;showing characters and their intense passion for food strikes a chord with everybody. It also makes you hungry.Itami's use of scene transitions is brilliant in its unobtrusiveness. Scenes suddenly shift without the viewer even noticing&#x96;it's seamless perfection. For example, there is a scene in which Tampopo is exercising outside under Gun's supervision when a group of businessmen in suits walks past. The camera decides to follow the businessmen to their destination, a French restaurant, to watch them order their food, then follows the waiter out into the main seating area where it stops to observe a group of women receiving a lesson on proper Western dining etiquette (eating without slurping&#x85;although a Western man in the restaurant is slurping his noodles loudly, much to the chagrin of the teacher).

The Precrime Institute uses their ability to go out and stop these murders from occurring and arrest the murderer before they ever commit their crime.

Of course something this perfect has to has its flaws, and Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent in to find these flaws. His introduction kicks off a chain of events which leads to the real story, when the Precogs see Chief Anderton himself commit a murder 36 hours in the future. Anderton proceeds to flee and the chase begins.As this plot unfolds a mystery is unraveled that can keep your attention for a while, but eventually becomes tedious and overlong. A lot of this is due to Mr. Tom Cruise. I personally am not a fan of Cruise at all. Nine times out of then he delivers a lackluster performance and never convinces me that he is acting, so much as pretending.

Sadly, this is one area where Minority Report lacks to an extent. The futuristic scenery is very nice looking and the whole plot traverses a creative array of settings. Yet Spielberg irritatingly washes out all these potentially beautiful scenes with blinding white light that floods the screen and greatly distracts from everything else. It is also the action sequences which fault the film. There's nothing special about them and often times they are unbelievable and even goofy. Some of the scenes extend the laws of physics and gravity to overall silly extents. Spielberg also finds it necessary to throw in comedic relief amidst his action for no apparent reason. Every time something like this happened, instead of being entertained and amused, I was only irritated because the movie obviously couldn't get its priorities straight.I'll admit that the film picks up towards the end when an interesting twist is revealed, but overall the film lacks in its story and characters and I was mostly disappointed by what an interesting subject matter such as Precrime was able to deliver.

The film starts and it makes the viewer feel like they've missed something entirely that everyone else already knows about, but as the film unravels it snowballs into a unique vision of cinema. It kind of reminded me of Altered States, but I enjoyed this much more than Altered States. Even though A Clockwork Orange has a running time of well over two hours, it didn't feel that way. I wasn't glancing at the clock wondering when the film would end. The film didn't drag at all. It was odd, as I mentioned before, but it was interesting enough to keep my attention span throughout the entire film. That's something I take note of with the amount of films I sit through every week.The way the film looked and sounded was amazing, as well. Even though Clockwork is closing in on being forty years old, it sure doesn't look like it. Every scene had brilliant, vibrant colors that pretty much made every frame jump off the screen. The sound in the film was also near perfection. I was reading on IMDb that this was the first film take advantage of Dolby Digital surround sound and it shows.I also really love the way Kubrick shot this film. His sense of perspective is incredible. The long hallway shots and scenes that highlight an actors facial expressions are some of the most memorable scenes in the film and a lot of credit for that goes to the way he shot it. He's a director that I've come to realize I actually admire quite a bit, but need to actually see more of his work.Malcolm McDowell deserves a nod, as well. I doubt I'll be saying anything that hasn't already been said about him in this role, but humor me and pretend that this movie was just released on DVD or something. He makes the film and I'm not just saying that because he's in the lead role. I mean, it's hard to imagine A Clockwork Orange with another actor in McDowell's place.

Clockwork is a film I wouldn't recommend to anyone as I feel like it may not only go over some viewers heads, but soar over. It's for viewers with unique taste for cinema that are willing to sit down and actually pay attention to a film rather than be on the computer or do anything else while trying to watch a movie.

A dramatic\/science fiction\/thriller that is not only viewed by some as one of the ten greatest films in the sci-fi genre but also one of the greatest films of all time.

Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, This is just right!

Basically Ann Bishop (Four Weddings and a Funeral's Golden Globe nominated Andie MacDowell) is married to John Mullany (While You Were Sleeping's Peter Gallagher), and he is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia Patrice Bishop (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Laura San Giacomo). Ann is the quiet type who is having therapy to express her concerns about things in the world, and even knowing her marriage is rocky she doesn't feel like she wants to have sex. When John's old college friend Graham Dalton (Secretary's James Spader) comes along, renting a flat, he makes friends with Ann, and Cynthia is very keen to meet him from Ann's description. Ann gets to know Graham more, and she finds his box of videotapes, and he confesses that they are all women being interviewed by him talking about sex, their experiences of it, and their fantasies. Ann is a bit freaked out by this, and she voices her concerns to Cynthia, but Cynthia still goes to see him, and finds out herself about the videotapes. She asks him to videotape her to talk about sex, and during this she also masturbates in front of him, which Ann is pretty shocked to her. When Ann finds an earring belonging to Cynthia while vacuuming, she confronts John about a possible affair, which he denies, but she knows he is lying. She goes to Graham for some comfort, and she decides to do a videotape herself, which he did advise not to based on the circumstances, but she does it anyway. John finds out about Graham filming his wife, and he does go over to punch him in the face, but then he watches Ann's videotape where she discusses her problems. There is also a point where she films him about why he likes to film women doing this, and after John leaves, Graham in anger breaks all his tapes. In the end, John is possibly fired from his job, Ann and Cynthia make up with each other, Ann as far as I know leaves John and goes with Graham. Also starring Ron Vawter as Therapist, Steven Brill as Barfly, Earl T. Taylor as Landlord and David Foil as John's Colleague. MacDowell is a good quiet and bored wife, Gallagher is a really good sneaky and manipulative husband, Giacomo is great as the sneaky and seductive sister, and Spader is really good as the quiet man with a very questionable hobby. From the title you would think it featured sex, but it doesn't need any, it is one of the great films that relies on the stars talking in detail about it, so in summation, it is a brilliant mainly dialogue carried drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay.

After all, its impact and success made it a much copied movie, by giving birth to 3 sequels and different movies inspired on it (such as 'Deep Blue Sea'). But 'Jaws' is definitely THE Summer blockbuster (and also the one to own).Steven Spielberg was in the beginning of his career when he made this movie. Although he made other movies before, this was his first hit. Its success surprised even Spielberg himself. The movie is based on a 1974 book (same title) by Peter Benchley. I read the book and there are many differences...Filming of the movie took much longer than planned. It was supposed to take about 2 months, but ended up taking more than 5 months (also due to reliability issues with the mechanical sharks).'Jaws' is considered a classic in its genre. Indeed it is a great movie but also shocking. It is intense and combines strong suspense and horror. The shark is immense and intimidating. It is clearly over-sized, but that also makes the movie more terrifying. It looks a bit rubbery at times, but I don't think it looks as artificial as many do. Nicely filmed, the movie takes place in a fictional Summer resort town (Amity Island). The place looks very appealing, the sandy beach is big, beautiful and very inviting. And that's where the brutal shark's attacks occur. It's heaven and hell at the same time.The movie's got some of the most horrifying deaths ever in a movie. While not the scariest movie of its kind, it surely is scary when it is. In fact, I often read and heard that when the movie came out in 1975, never before had the cinemas been so full and the beaches so empty. It wasn't just because of the movie's euphoria, but also because of the shark's attacks seen in it (maybe more than the sharks's attacks in real life). Today the movie continues to marvel and shock audiences.And the soundtrack by the genial John Williams is strong and powerful, very appropriate for the movie. It gives the sensation of being spooky and carried with suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.Roy Scheider portrays the town's police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss stars as the marine biologist Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw plays the rude fisherman and shark hunter Quint. Murray Hamilton is Larry Vaughn, the selfish Mayor of Amity Island. Ever since the beginning, Brody wants to close the beaches to protect beachgoers from the shark's attacks, but is overruled by the Mayor, who refuses to close the beaches because of his greed for money and also refuses to listen to or believe anybody. His selfishness costs lives, as we see in the film - including a child's life.The first half of the movie focus more on the attacks and also lets us know Amity Island and appreciate its scenario. The second half focus on the attempt to hunt the great beast.The movie's poster is great, even more so in the DVD cover.

Whilst Anderson's other films are passable (but overrated), this one is filled with clichés and wooden acting. None of the dialogue is original; every single line has appeared in another film before it. The characters are banal stereotypes. The old mentor teaching a sassy, overconfident maverick has been done to death. I found the character of Sydney (apparently the original title to the film) offered nothing to the world of ideas and Philip Baker Hall could have mailed in his performance from the set of one of his many other films that he acts in (this guy is not very picky when it comes to choosing parts). I can see why the distributors changed the name from this inane character but the later title is probably worse. When Sydney talks about the hard eight in the film I was filled with the nausea that always comes from a gratuitous reference to the title within the film. As for John Reilly, I don't know what his strengths are but I often assume it is knowing people with talent. If you are one of the people who thinks that Reilly is talented then this may be the film for you. But if you are looking for someone who can go beyond being himself in a film then Reilly's performance will surely disappoint. Forget the art-house raves; this is a film to avoid at all costs.

It seemed built on the post 70's gov't sci-fi paranoia of the early 80's (see The Dead Zone or Scanners or Firestarter for further info). One day my girlfriend finally sat me down and made me watch it, if you pay attention you'll be surprised, she said. She was right.Altered States has nothing to do with the government. Sure there are some early references to it in the beginning of the film but they are dropped fairly early. This movie is a satirical look at the mind expansion though drugs movement of the late 1960's. A scientist, Eddie Jessup, played by William Hurt is attempting to push the boundaries of sensory deprivation and what it can do to the human mind. It's the late 70's and he's looked at some kind of over the hill quack by his contemporaries as most have moved beyond the LSD induced 60's to respected careers. But when he stumbles upon a mysterious combination of drugs and tank time he's swept to the dawn of humans. The line between dream experience and reality become blurred however as Jessup spends more and more time in the tank and eventually the wall comes crashing down. This is not a straight line narrative film. It jumps from time to time. The plot is secondary however, to the message the movie is trying to send. The human mind is a merely a collection of experiences and data, a bank if you will that has been storing information since monkeys first decided to stand on two legs. The information is so vast however that to compensate our mind locks most of it away to keep us sane but our most base instincts are still there, we just choose to satisfy them in a different way than our ancestors, today buying a huge TV with a nice sound system is the substitute for downing a huge antelope on the plains. The movie's main point though is what's the point? What could possibly be gained from this knowledge? That's where the farce comes in, this might be the first movie to poke fun at boomers. The big revelation of LSD induced hyper-awareness is a regression to our simian forms. Thanks for the hard work fellas. I'm neglecting the movie itself however. Technically it's quite an achievement for the time and the music, sound and cinematography really set the mood. I'm sure upon its release Altered States was taken seriously as art and a cautionary tale for science going too far but looking back its an enjoyable farce of the boomer generation and its obsession with the why? of the Universe.
