A sexy (I apply the term loosely) female is bent on stealing the light (which is never explained why or what the light even is) from Earth, where it isn't supposed to be because K hid it after the Zarthans (yeah, really crummy '70's sci-fi flick kind of name) brought it to keep it away from the evil queen.  K neuralyzed himself to rid his mind of the memory, which eventually leads to a huge plot hole.If he neuralyzed himself that long ago, the deneuralyzer should have worked, bringing out that info so he would not have to use his own clues.My betta fish could have written a better screenplay than this.

Fortunately they were only partially correct.The main complaints I had heard were that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rowan Atkinson were under used.  To a certain extent they are.  Rowan seems to be making the most of a less than great part, reminding me very much of his early work for Not the Nine O'Clock News and at the various Secret Policeman's Balls.  Sarah is criminally under used as Daphne early in the film, seemingly hired for her ability to look very good in a short skirt and low cut top, however in the last third of the film she is finally given something to work with and demonstrates why she is one of the top rated actresses in her age group.  At one point (you'll recognize it when you see the film) she demonstrates a perfect understanding of the male gender psyche and how any of us would react in a certain situation.Truly the saving grace of the film is Shaggy and Scooby.  Matthew Lillard has got Shaggy down perfectly, it's like he stepped out of the animation and into the live action unchanged.  His interactions with the CGI Scooby are faultless.  Many of the old jokes from the cartoon are here but they play like the return of old friends rather than as stale repeats of the same tired old schtick.  There are a number of drugs references and some sexual innuendo but it's so skillfully done that it will be over the heads of many younger viewers so all that will be happen is that they'll be left wondering why all the adults are laughing at certain scenes.The true identity of the villain is skillfully masked until the revelation and will be deeply satisfying for many fans of the original cartoon.

Fortunately they were only partially correct.The main complaints I had heard were that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rowan Atkinson were under used.  To a certain extent they are.  Rowan seems to be making the most of a less than great part, reminding me very much of his early work for Not the Nine O'Clock News and at the various Secret Policeman's Balls.

And while it is pretty funny, it just doesn't stand up to the first two.If you don't know Mike Myers's Austin character, then you've been living under a rock under an even larger rock.  He plays a time-travelling, swingin', shaggin' British secret service agent, always trying to foil his arch nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers).  The second movie, Austin Power The Spy who Shagged Me brought new characters, like Fat Bastard (Myers again) and Mini-Me (Troyer) into the fold, recycling the best jokes from the first, while adding a new kick in the pants.  Somehow, it still managed to be clever and, more importantly, extremely funny.Now comes Austin Powers in Goldmember and what can I say?  They try doing to same thing again but this time, it's irrelevant.  There are references to the first 2 movies, and we find out more about Dr. Evil parents, but we've seen the gags before in this very series.  Heck, they even make jokes about re-doing the same material.  And when the best laughs come from surprise cameos (and there are lots of them), that's not a good sign. Nevertheless, the movie does become pretty damn funny, once they have to establish a plot (something about Dr. Evil flooding the world).  It really picks up once Dr. Evil and Mini-Me are in prison, singing It's a Hard-Knock Life. Before that though, the movie is pretty lame.  After that point we get to the funny stuff.  20 year old movie newcomer (and Destiny's Child's singer) Beyoncé Knowles provides the eye candy as Foxxy Cleopatra, a sassy, 70s Blaxploitation spoof, who somehow hooks up with Austin to fight evil. Michael Caine is just great as Austin's spy dad and Myers adds a 4th character under his belt, playing the title character of Goldmember, a dude from Holland with junk of gold.You may think, Wow!  This sounds great.  And it does, but when you actually see, it, you're wondering why you're not laughing as hard as you should.  The first movie was fresh and new.  It was a small movie that didn't make much money in the theatres, earning a loyal video following. It was a clever, fish-out-of-water movie, sometimes poignant and most importantly, fall-down funny.  The second, despite its rehashed jokes, somehow was funnier than the first, except without the newness of the original.  But fans were so starved for new Austin material, they goggled it up.  The third now comes and we realize that the freshness is gone.  It's not new anymore.  Sure, the gags are there, but the soul isn't.  While not up to the standards of the first two in the series, Goldmember is still pretty funny, and is worth seeing if you're a fan.  Just don't expect it to collect many converts to the series.

Even though it began well I thought it became dull quite quickly because of the many uninteresting and pointless turns in the plot.We see Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting on a bench talking to a person who sits next to him about his life. When Forrest was young he had a lot of problems because he was a handicapped person. He meets a pretty girl on the school bus and begins to fall in love with her. When some envious and mean school children are chasing him he discovers he can run, finally overcoming his physical disability. This scene was amazing because it shows that people can overcome any diseases by having faith in themselves. Forrest Gump was a brave boy who tried to run, even when it was nearly impossible for him. That was an interesting beginning. However, when he grows up and graduates from college this movie turns out to be awful, as the only thing he does is keep talking about his life as a football player, as a runner and, ridiculously as a soldier, he's inexplicably the best soldier.  Forrest Gump seems to believe he's very interesting, that his achievements in life are extremely important and valuable to us, but they aren't. For instance, we see him getting medals and many other things, but I really didn't feel interested in what he received because he seems to be so arrogant, thinking he's the best person in the world.  I didn't find myself quite absorbed in the film because I didn't feel amazed by all the achievements he got. Why does he tell it? He only tells people about his achievements to show off, pretending he's a great person! He is happily and arrogantly seated on a bench telling his life to whoever sits next to him. I didn't care what he said, because he only driveled.After the disappointing climax comes the original ending, which I enjoyed because it wasn't predictable. I never thought Forrest's wife would die. She was sick but I didn't like the way she died. It seems that the writers didn't have anything interesting to add, other than a simple disease to get her out of the story. I also liked it when Forrest and his wife had a child whom they also named Forrest, but I thought the final scene where the child gets onto a bus is interesting because it's somewhat unpredictable; it looked like the whole story would begin again and I do not want to see the same insipid story again because I already went through Gump's life. I certainly do not want to go through his son's life. That'd be more grief!I do not understand why it received an academy award for best picture. I haven't seen many of 1994's movies, but I'm sure there are more inspiring and interesting movies than this one. A good example would be `Shawshank Redempion' that unbelievably lost the Oscar for best picture!Overall, this movie is not outstanding. There are many unnecessary and long scenes such as his life in the army, his life as a rich person his life as a person who waits for a bus and finally his life as a runner. I'm sure this could have been a shorter movie. If it had been this way it wouldn't be so annoying. I found the movie far-fetched because I don't think people can run as much as he did, and I don't think people can be so successful without working hard for their future. When do we see Forrest willing to be a successful person? He only did what his family and girlfriend told him to do. He was never willing to be a successful person. I know it's just a movie so I don't worry about it.  All the performances in this movie were somewhat believable, especially Sally Field who was an excellent loving mother. I felt sad when she died, since her character was very caring to her son, as some mothers are to their children. Sally Field's performance was convincing, but I didn't find Tom Hanks deserving of an academy award, because he gave an unbelievably simple and unchallenging performance.

Nathan Lane as Snowball, great voice talent who was in Titan A.E. as well, giving the cat a sense of cowardice and complimenting the opposite of Stuart Little..

If you can't make a 'simple' film well, how do you expect to make a more 'ambitious, complex' one look good?The acting was generally cartoonish.. the script is simple, but executed well enough that in the end, it doesn't really matter.. it'll fall into the 'cute' catagory for many people, so for those of you who have a thing against cute, you're probably better off to stray elsewhere, but then, if you've seen the trailer or the first film, you already know that, or should..There are some general cartoon physics spread loosely throughout.. Live action cartoon, as I said before..Some good sayings within, even if a couple of them are quite common and often overused, they fit the context of the film..Now, the animation.. this is where the film is on high marks..

Bale spends his on screen time (quite unlike his fluffy summer movie counterparts) taking his role seriously, which definitely helps the audience to do the same. Though at times his role does take a leap into the realm of silliness, the good far outweighs the bad. Bale's eyes are absolutely haunted in spots, and his incarnation of the tortured young boy who first saw the beasts that would bring about the end of the world who grows into the peaceful leader is affable, intelligent and strong. I am quite impressed by his ability to a) sit on a horse, and b) pour half a bottle of iodine into an open wound without his head exploding. Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, Dazed and Confused) stars as dragon slayer Van Zan (aka Commander Fruit Loop) and has totally sunk his teeth into this larger than life role. McConaughey plays Van Zan as a slightly more psychotic version of R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) His mood swings make for a slightly cartoonish character, but he's so much fun to watch that you never really mind. If Bale's Quinn could be imagined running through Dragonheart, McConaughey's Van Zan is the Mad Max element to the story. His grittiness, and energies are perfect summer movie fare.Though Reign of Fire does offer its share of incredibly predictable moments (i.e. the cannon-fodder scene where a group of men decide to go spelunking down a tunnel that a little boy has just come careening out of, bleeding out his eyes, screaming that `there's something down there!!') it does show a remarkable amount of stylish smarts. Everything from the dragon ravaged London, to my amusement at realizing that once again, though the rest of the world may be destroyed by fanciful creatures Canada has been left alone (like in ID4) adds to the bite of this film.

If you can't figure that out from the title, you don't really deserve to breathe let alone see movies.Eight Legged Freaks is a fun little romp that has elements of horror and comedy.  Overall, I liked the film and wish that Hollywood would make more like it.  There isn't the ever so common over-reliance on CGI here.  It's used where it works, but actual fake spiders are also used where more appropriate.  The director is really clued into human responses with the comedy.  Ostriches are inherently comical creatures, and even if you don't think the idea of giant spiders eating ostriches is a humorous subject, you really can't help but to laugh when you see these bizarre looking creatures being dragged to the ground.

In a world where TV's are drive in movie's and a toy car is your ride to school, having a mouse for a brother seems cool.Although no one seems to notice or mind when they see a little red corvette with a well dressed mouse inside, zipping along the sidewalk along the streets of New York.  They don't even stand on chairs and screaming mouse! mouse! when they see Stuart enter into a room, as the most common comedic reaction is portrayed.But don't think that this movie doesn't have its own share of funny moments, the best one liners I've heard in a while are delivered by Snowball, the sarcastic family cat.  When Stuart's new friend Margalo (perfectly voiced by Melanie Griffith) goes missing, Stuart enlists in the help of Snowball to track down her whereabouts.  Snowball's declaration that his paint can dangling hundred's of feet over the city has just become a litter box, and other such comments help balance the constant cheeriness of the movie.The sickeningly sweet Little lifestyle, includes their own greetings Little hi, little low, little hey, little ho! and Mrs. Little's overdone attempts to get the newest edition of the family, Martha, to speak her first words.  This gets old very quickly but through a child's eyes, I suspect this would all be perfectly normal. Another element that would slide right over a youngster's head, is that it also makes obvious uses of the colours yellow and red through out the film. It is never more obvious during the film than the final scene.  When Stuart soars high above everyone's heads in his brother's model plane, everyone in the park below gawks, and runs to look.  Most the extra's in the scene are wearing red, while the Littles stand out perfectly in their bright sunny yellow.  How quaint.  I wonder if they were trying to bring out attention to the Little family?Desite these oversights, the movie is enjoyable, and probably even more so with a youngster along.  Although there is no specific underlying theme in the movie, there is a strong sense of family, and a taste of adventure as Stuart sets out to rescue Margalo - his first big adventure.  Children will love this installment because it has plenty of the things they love, slap stick antics, adventure, friendship and a basic plot line.

I got a chance to see a special screening which was presented by the Just for laughs festival in Montréal. The best parts were with old characters from the two first films. Unfortunately, the new ones (Nigel Powers, Foxxy Cleopatra, Goldmember) were not as memorable and brought nothing new to the film. The movie had it's funny moments, but they were far apart or repetitive from the two first films. The part that I enjoyed the less is when we learn something about Austin and Dr. Evil. IMO that that was completely unnecessary and just didn't work. I also was hoping to see some more jokes with Austin in the whole disco scene of the 70's. But that was not to be. Even the rivalry between Scott and mini-me could have been better and longer. As for the story, it seemed unfocussed, with to many ideas, probably from the fact that they were too many characters. One could almost say that they could have made two movies with all of these ideas. Overall it's clear that it's the weakest of the three films. Still, for those who likes the two first movies, you will probably still enjoy this ones (just as I did). For the others don't bother watching this one! I certainly hope that they don't make an Austin Powers 4. Because in the end of this film, they kind of show you where they would go with it, and it doesn't look like a good place.
