It seems to have a solid fanbase, and interest in the film continues. I have heard many things about the film before I saw it. One person told me it isn't as good as it's hyped. Another told me it is the essence of brilliance. I went in open minded, and a as a lover of movies. The movie presents a wonderfully atmospheric universe. Nothing particularly special creates this sense. From the opening scene to when the main characters are walking home from school, all the images just feel like Halloween. The film also displays a wonderful feel of being observed. Throughout the movie, the stalker is seen several times creeping amidst the background. Sometimes it's kinda hard to notice. It jumps right into the story as if the camera was just turned on at this point in time in the created universe. The audience knows the main villain of the film is an escaped psychiatric patient. A patient with a sinister and mysterious past. The character of the Doctor is almost the narrator of the story, letting the audience know certain minute details about the escapee's past. From what little is garnered, he for some reason is hellbent on returning to his hometown, where he brutally committed murder man years prior. The Doctor knows him better than anyone, and quickly heads there. Then of course, there is Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie. The babysitter living in the same neighborhood that the crazed lunatic is from. A smart, strong young women who we hardly get to know. However, in the little time spent on developing her character, we learn just enough to know she is the survivor. Her friends are portrayed as well intended, but almost flaky in personality. Her close circle of friends are all different types of people which adds a sense of realism, as cliques are over used especially in 'teen' oriented plots. Laurie is the 'responsible' one of the group, and spends the evening of Halloween babysitting. All the while, being stalked by the illusive escapee. A running theme throughout the film is the essence of Halloween. Laurie explains to the young boy she is babysitting that there is nothing to fear about Halloween. It is a time when 'people play tricks on each other.' That the boogieman is not real, and that she will protect the child from him should he arrive.The audience is watching the events unfold all the while wondering the motives of the stalker. It is never revealed(unless you like the sequels). The stalker is an unstoppable force, not through magic or mysticism, but through the inherent nature of deluded evil. You can kill one stalker, or stop them, but they will return, and if not, one like them will. To me that was the greatest part of the film next to the atmosphere. Ultimately, as a viewer, one won't be disappointed if they watch looking for the right things. Halloween is a movie that needs to be watched in the context of its time. It broke a lot of rules, and created many that shine through film making, especially the horror genre even today. If watched with the proper mindset, the film is a masterpiece in what it was trying to accomplish within the viewers mind. Creating an edgy Tick or Treat universe.

She was dropped by RKO, made a picture with poverty row studio Columbia, and didn't appear on screen at all in 1939. And then all of a sudden, with The Philadelphia Story, she bounced right back as if she'd never been away.So what was the secret? Well, it certainly doesn't hurt that The Philadelphia Story is very good indeed. Playwright Philip Barry had written it especially for Hepburn, and it had had a successful run on Broadway before MGM snapped up the rights. It was the ideal role for the persona she had been crafting over the last seven years &#x96; a headstrong society woman, independent and confident, but still prone to the errors of confidence. It is a sparkling and intelligent comedy with situations and dialogue that seem natural yet are funny in an almost by-the-way manner. This is the sort of comedy Hepburn was a mistress of. In short, the part was tailor-made for her. What's more, the play had been such a hit that Hepburn found herself in a strong bargaining position with the studio.First, she secured the directorial services of her friend George Cukor, with whom she had already worked a few times. There really is no-one who could have done a better job. Cukor's speciality was in taking stage plays and making them not seem stagy. You see, a stage play can't just skip from one location to the next like a film or a novel. For reasons of practicality narrative has to be blocked into lengthy scenes. This can be very boring if it is adapted directly onto the screen. Cukor's trick is to subtly move the action along or quite literally change the angle on it. For example, there is an early scene where James Stewart and Ruth Hussey are in a sitting room, and are visited in turn by Cary Grant, Virginia Weidler, Hepburn and Mary Nash. Each time a new character comes in and the dynamic changes, Cukor begins again with a new establishing shot and new camera set ups, giving a sudden feel of freshness. We are effectively fooled into thinking we have just seen lots of little scenes, instead of one ten-minute one all set in the same room.Cukor also keeps the tone of the story &#x96; as well as the solution to the tangled love-polygon &#x96; implicit in his technique. In the earliest scenes the camera is almost continuously centred on Virginia Weidler (Dinah) following her is she bounds from room to room, matching her relentless energy. There's also a nice moment in the scene at the stable where we first meet the characters played by Roland Young and John Howard. When Hepburn and Howard speak to each other, the camera doesn't get too close, and a horse is pottering about behind them. This isn't some pretentious bit of symbolism, it merely means that no matter what the characters say or how they say it, the scene could never be misinterpreted as a deeply romantic one.But enough of Mr Cukor. Hepburn also managed to gather a fabulous cast. Her original choices of Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy were not available, although it's hard to imagine even those two heavyweights doing as well as her runners-up, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. These well-mannered comedy roles were bread-and-butter to Grant, but Stewart was more the newcomer. Still, his performance is a virtuoso act of comedic interpretation. What he actually achieves is to make that witty dialogue sound completely fluent, as if it was an improvisation rather than a memorised script. Ruth Hussey is the perfect sidekick for him, and does something similar but a little more dry, yet with deep emotion underpinning it. Then there are the absolutely divine appearances by Roland Young, Mary Nash and the wickedly funny Virginia Weidler, between them ensuring there is not a single trough in the whole picture.And what about Ms Hepburn herself? She is magnificent of course, playing the role with such naturalism and yet such wit, teasing out the humour in the ordinariness of the words. The thing is, this isn't really anything different to what she was doing in Holiday and Bringing Up Baby, so why the sudden swing in popular and critical opinion? Well, perhaps audiences just hadn't been ready for the strength of character and audacity of the grown-up Hepburn. And maybe after they had fallen for the bitchy determination of Bette Davis in Jezebel and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind, the good-natured feistiness of Hepburn seemed like a warm-blooded counterpart. Whatever the case was back then, The Philadelphia Story and its stars are just as watchable today is they were seventy years ago.

For example, there is an early scene where James Stewart and Ruth Hussey are in a sitting room, and are visited in turn by Cary Grant, Virginia Weidler, Hepburn and Mary Nash. Each time a new character comes in and the dynamic changes, Cukor begins again with a new establishing shot and new camera set ups, giving a sudden feel of freshness. We are effectively fooled into thinking we have just seen lots of little scenes, instead of one ten-minute one all set in the same room.Cukor also keeps the tone of the story &#x96; as well as the solution to the tangled love-polygon &#x96; implicit in his technique. In the earliest scenes the camera is almost continuously centred on Virginia Weidler (Dinah) following her is she bounds from room to room, matching her relentless energy. There's also a nice moment in the scene at the stable where we first meet the characters played by Roland Young and John Howard. When Hepburn and Howard speak to each other, the camera doesn't get too close, and a horse is pottering about behind them. This isn't some pretentious bit of symbolism, it merely means that no matter what the characters say or how they say it, the scene could never be misinterpreted as a deeply romantic one.But enough of Mr Cukor. Hepburn also managed to gather a fabulous cast. Her original choices of Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy were not available, although it's hard to imagine even those two heavyweights doing as well as her runners-up, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. These well-mannered comedy roles were bread-and-butter to Grant, but Stewart was more the newcomer. Still, his performance is a virtuoso act of comedic interpretation. What he actually achieves is to make that witty dialogue sound completely fluent, as if it was an improvisation rather than a memorised script. Ruth Hussey is the perfect sidekick for him, and does something similar but a little more dry, yet with deep emotion underpinning it. Then there are the absolutely divine appearances by Roland Young, Mary Nash and the wickedly funny Virginia Weidler, between them ensuring there is not a single trough in the whole picture.And what about Ms Hepburn herself? She is magnificent of course, playing the role with such naturalism and yet such wit, teasing out the humour in the ordinariness of the words. The thing is, this isn't really anything different to what she was doing in Holiday and Bringing Up Baby, so why the sudden swing in popular and critical opinion? Well, perhaps audiences just hadn't been ready for the strength of character and audacity of the grown-up Hepburn. And maybe after they had fallen for the bitchy determination of Bette Davis in Jezebel and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind, the good-natured feistiness of Hepburn seemed like a warm-blooded counterpart.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"25 March 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It seems unthinkable given her almost instant rise to stardom in the early 30s, and the almost universal acclaim she enjoyed in the later part of her career, that for a short period in the late 30s Katherine Hepburn bore the disparaging label of box-office poison and was regarded as a liability to the studio. She was dropped by RKO, made a picture with poverty row studio Columbia, and didn't appear on screen at all in 1939. And then all of a sudden, with The Philadelphia Story, she bounced right back as if she'd never been away.So what was the secret? Well, it certainly doesn't hurt that The Philadelphia Story is very good indeed. Playwright Philip Barry had written it especially for Hepburn, and it had had a successful run on Broadway before MGM snapped up the rights. It was the ideal role for the persona she had been crafting over the last seven years &#x96; a headstrong society woman, independent and confident, but still prone to the errors of confidence. It is a sparkling and intelligent comedy with situations and dialogue that seem natural yet are funny in an almost by-the-way manner. This is the sort of comedy Hepburn was a mistress of. In short, the part was tailor-made for her. What's more, the play had been such a hit that Hepburn found herself in a strong bargaining position with the studio.First, she secured the directorial services of her friend George Cukor, with whom she had already worked a few times. There really is no-one who could have done a better job. Cukor's speciality was in taking stage plays and making them not seem stagy. You see, a stage play can't just skip from one location to the next like a film or a novel. For reasons of practicality narrative has to be blocked into lengthy scenes.

Both films were shot by the great cinematographer, John Alton. Where 'Mystery Street' features a cool-headed detective finely played by a young Ricardo Montalban, 'The Big Combo's investigating officer is the hot-headed Lieutenant Leonard Diamond (with a stiff Cornel Wilde miscast in the role). Montalban's detective solves a difficult crime with finesse, always doggedly pursuing one clue after another until he arrives at a solution. In contrast, Wilde's Diamond is clueless from the beginning; he has nothing on Mr. Brown in terms of solid evidence and appears utterly impotent each time he has a face-to-face confrontation with the elusive psychopath.At the beginning, we find out that Diamond has exceeded the police department's budget for investigating a case with no leads. In terms of today's money, the $18,000 would probably be equal to $180,000 and at the very least Diamond would have been taken off the case for mismanagement of police funds.Like Mystery Street which featured ahead of its time CSI techniques, 'The Big Combo' tries to prove it too is relevant. The first 'gadget' is a tape recorder which Diamond uses to record his statement to the Commissioner about the funds used in the Brown investigation. That goes nowhere so we're then supposed to be impressed by Diamond's use of a lie detector after Brown agrees to be questioned. Brown's responses to Diamond's questions are hilarious (Question Women? Brown Expensive!). But more notable is the stupidity of Diamond's investigation techniques. The only clue he has to go on is 'Alicia'--the name Brown's girlfriend blurts out at the hospital after a suicide try. Is Diamond so stupid to believe that Brown is going to tell him who Alicia is and implicate himself in a murder? What's more Diamond is thoroughly unprofessional when he tells Brown at the hospital that he would like to 'cut him open' as if he were conducting an operation and is afraid to find out what's inside. Even in the 50s, a loose cannon like Diamond would have been reigned in by his superiors.During the lie detector test, Brown associates 'Spaghetti' with 'Betinni'. One wonders how the always-in-control Brown could make such a gaffe as it's an important clue that eventually leads to the crime boss's undoing. Betinni, an associate of Brown's former boss, disappeared after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Diamond has no idea where Betinni is, but lo and behold, after being 'tortured' by Brown and his minions and dropped off at his boss's doorstep, Captain Peterson, it turns out that Peterson knew all along where Betinni was hiding. As for the torture (some internet posters have laughably likened it to a scene from Tarrantino's 'Reservoir Dogs), it consists of Brown's use of his underling's hearing aid and a bottle of hair tonic (with 40% alcohol) which he manages to force down Diamond's throat.Still with no clues, Diamond brings in the 96 suspects in Brown's organization for questioning (funny how Brown's 'organization' really seems to consist only of Joe McClure, the gangster wannabe now demoted to gopher, and two gay thugs, Fante and Mingo (more about that in a minute). Captain Peterson quite rightly blurts out, Diamond, what am I going to do with you? The rest of the Big Combo plot emphasizes Diamond's utter inability to pin anything on Brown. Betinni's tip leads Diamond to antique dealer Nils Dreyer who used to be the captain of the yacht in which Brown and Alicia sailed on. Dreyer is murdered before he can spill any beans but leaves a photo in a bank deposit box, a more recent picture of Alicia. This time the CSI unit gets it right and is able to blow up the Alicia photo, proving that she's living in a sanitarium, only a few hours away. Alicia is about to remember who Brown murdered on the yacht but goes back to the looney bin after Brown shows up and says hello to her. Meanwhile, McClure tries to double cross Brown but Fante and Mingo turn on him and Brown blows him away (one can't forget the scene in which Brown takes out McClure's hearing aid and tells him that at least he won't hear the bullets.) Finally, Brown double crosses Fante and Mingo by bringing them what looks like a box of money but is actually a stick of dynamite. Mingo is devastated when Fante is killed and agrees to testify against Brown, not for Diamond but for his beloved gay lover (the Big Combo does win points for suggesting that Fante and Mingo are gay which is unusual for a movie from the 1950s). Diamond finally tracks Brown down at an airport (where we never see a single plane) and places him under arrest (amazing how Diamond dodges all those bullets Brown fires at him!).The Big Combo does have a few good things going for it. In addition to the sensational noirish cinematography, there is an undercurrent of dark sexuality running throughout the film's narrative. In addition to Mingo and Fante's 'different' relationship, Diamond becomes involved with a sexy show girl who ends up murdered on Brown's orders. Brown's girlfriend, Susan Lowell, a former classical pianist, also can't seem to shake off her physical attraction to her gangster boyfriend (despite the fact there is not one scene where the two show any good feelings toward one another).On the other hand, in addition to the overly moralistic and implausible Lieutenant Diamond, the Big Combo is full of histrionic performances (I love how Brown weakly slaps the prizefighter and McClure flinches as if Brown had slugged the guy, at the film's beginning).The Big Combo marks the end of the film noir anti-hero. Lieutenant Diamond is more the prototype for Sgt. Jack Friday of TV's Dragnet than Robert Mitchum's femme fatale victim in 'Out of the Past'.

The first 'gadget' is a tape recorder which Diamond uses to record his statement to the Commissioner about the funds used in the Brown investigation. That goes nowhere so we're then supposed to be impressed by Diamond's use of a lie detector after Brown agrees to be questioned. Brown's responses to Diamond's questions are hilarious (Question Women? Brown Expensive!). But more notable is the stupidity of Diamond's investigation techniques. The only clue he has to go on is 'Alicia'--the name Brown's girlfriend blurts out at the hospital after a suicide try. Is Diamond so stupid to believe that Brown is going to tell him who Alicia is and implicate himself in a murder? What's more Diamond is thoroughly unprofessional when he tells Brown at the hospital that he would like to 'cut him open' as if he were conducting an operation and is afraid to find out what's inside. Even in the 50s, a loose cannon like Diamond would have been reigned in by his superiors.During the lie detector test, Brown associates 'Spaghetti' with 'Betinni'. One wonders how the always-in-control Brown could make such a gaffe as it's an important clue that eventually leads to the crime boss's undoing. Betinni, an associate of Brown's former boss, disappeared after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Diamond has no idea where Betinni is, but lo and behold, after being 'tortured' by Brown and his minions and dropped off at his boss's doorstep, Captain Peterson, it turns out that Peterson knew all along where Betinni was hiding. As for the torture (some internet posters have laughably likened it to a scene from Tarrantino's 'Reservoir Dogs), it consists of Brown's use of his underling's hearing aid and a bottle of hair tonic (with 40% alcohol) which he manages to force down Diamond's throat.Still with no clues, Diamond brings in the 96 suspects in Brown's organization for questioning (funny how Brown's 'organization' really seems to consist only of Joe McClure, the gangster wannabe now demoted to gopher, and two gay thugs, Fante and Mingo (more about that in a minute). Captain Peterson quite rightly blurts out, Diamond, what am I going to do with you? The rest of the Big Combo plot emphasizes Diamond's utter inability to pin anything on Brown. Betinni's tip leads Diamond to antique dealer Nils Dreyer who used to be the captain of the yacht in which Brown and Alicia sailed on. Dreyer is murdered before he can spill any beans but leaves a photo in a bank deposit box, a more recent picture of Alicia. This time the CSI unit gets it right and is able to blow up the Alicia photo, proving that she's living in a sanitarium, only a few hours away. Alicia is about to remember who Brown murdered on the yacht but goes back to the looney bin after Brown shows up and says hello to her. Meanwhile, McClure tries to double cross Brown but Fante and Mingo turn on him and Brown blows him away (one can't forget the scene in which Brown takes out McClure's hearing aid and tells him that at least he won't hear the bullets.) Finally, Brown double crosses Fante and Mingo by bringing them what looks like a box of money but is actually a stick of dynamite. Mingo is devastated when Fante is killed and agrees to testify against Brown, not for Diamond but for his beloved gay lover (the Big Combo does win points for suggesting that Fante and Mingo are gay which is unusual for a movie from the 1950s). Diamond finally tracks Brown down at an airport (where we never see a single plane) and places him under arrest (amazing how Diamond dodges all those bullets Brown fires at him!).The Big Combo does have a few good things going for it. In addition to the sensational noirish cinematography, there is an undercurrent of dark sexuality running throughout the film's narrative. In addition to Mingo and Fante's 'different' relationship, Diamond becomes involved with a sexy show girl who ends up murdered on Brown's orders. Brown's girlfriend, Susan Lowell, a former classical pianist, also can't seem to shake off her physical attraction to her gangster boyfriend (despite the fact there is not one scene where the two show any good feelings toward one another).On the other hand, in addition to the overly moralistic and implausible Lieutenant Diamond, the Big Combo is full of histrionic performances (I love how Brown weakly slaps the prizefighter and McClure flinches as if Brown had slugged the guy, at the film's beginning).The Big Combo marks the end of the film noir anti-hero. Lieutenant Diamond is more the prototype for Sgt. Jack Friday of TV's Dragnet than Robert Mitchum's femme fatale victim in 'Out of the Past'.

Both films were shot by the great cinematographer, John Alton. Where 'Mystery Street' features a cool-headed detective finely played by a young Ricardo Montalban, 'The Big Combo's investigating officer is the hot-headed Lieutenant Leonard Diamond (with a stiff Cornel Wilde miscast in the role). Montalban's detective solves a difficult crime with finesse, always doggedly pursuing one clue after another until he arrives at a solution.

Having seen it and more recently Rear Window and North by Northwest (also on AFI's list), I can say I now see why Hitchcock is considered one of the greats.North by Northwest is about spies and the Cold War, and for this reason has been compared to the later James Bond movies. Yet this movie still feels like it was made for Hitchcock- the suspense, the mystery, the thrills and murder are all here. There's also some humour thrown in for good measure. This movie centres around a case of mistaken identity as an ordinary guy (he says at the end of the movie that his wives divorced him because he was dull) finds himself in a dangerous game. There's also a woman he meets. Critic Danny Peary is quoted on the DVD back cover as saying there's a great deal of sex, but really there's none, just sexual innuendo. Still, it enriches the plot. With generally believable dialogue and acting, North by Northwest is a winner.

Moving and intimate musical score though composed by synthesizer by Maurice Jarre. Atmospheric cinematography that adequate as a mood-piece by Russell Boyd. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Australian director Peter Weir who achieved several hits (Witness, Gallipoli, The last wave) and some flop (Mosquito coast, The plumber). The movie belongs to sub-genre that abounded in the 80s about reporters around the world covering dangerous political conflicts , such as Nicaragua in ¨Under fire¨ by Robert Spottswoode with Nick Nolte , Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy, Salvador in ¨Salvador¨ by Oliver Stone with James Woods and James Belushi, and Libano in ¨Deadline¨ by Nathaliel Gutman with Christopher Walken and Hywel Bennett.
