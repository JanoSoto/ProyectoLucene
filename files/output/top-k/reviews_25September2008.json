The police believe that Richard killed her, and there is enough evidence to convict him, and a serious miscarriage of justice results in Richard being on a train on his way to prison. But, there is a train accident, Richard escapes, and he goes on a quest for his wife's true killer, while trying to keep one step ahead of the police, led by Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). The television series from the 1960's, where David Janssen had the role of Dr. Kimble, was an ongoing drama, where Dr. Kimble sought the one-armed killer of his wife while trying to figure out why she was killed, and while keeping ahead of the police and helping people along the way. My father was a fan of David Janssen and of the original series, and was not thrilled with this movie. He went into it with the idea How can they condense an entire series into one movie? I did not watch the series as a small child, and I really liked this film, with a few reservations. By the way, the television series finale for The Fugitive was one of the most-watched episodes in television history. Why did I like this film? First of all, while the story is not that complex, it is a riveting tale that the film tells quite well. There are even hints that the police knew, all along, that Dr. Kimble might not be guilty. Secondly, there is a lot of action to blend in with the well-told story, and some excellent cinematography (for which Michael Chapman was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award) really enhances the suspense factor. The main reason that I liked this film, though, was the Oscar-winning performance of Tommy Lee Jones. He could have portrayed Marshal Sam Gerard in several ways, but chose the best way, giving us a Gerard who was intelligent, dogged in his pursuit of Kimble, honorable, and dedicated to doing his job to the best of his ability. Harrison Ford was the wrongly-accused Good Guy, but Tommy Lee Jones was not the Bad Guy. He was a Good Guy who just happened to be wrong. Tommy Lee Jones is a very intense actor, and that fit this role perfectly. Even as he (and Don Cheadle) rescued Volcano from an absurd premise, Jones manages to outshine Harrison Ford here. Ah, that brings me to my one reservation about this film Harrison Ford. I want to quickly say that Mr. Ford did a good job in portraying Dr. Richard Kimble. But, that role in this movie had the potential to be an Academy-Award winning performance, but Harrison Ford did not give us that. What we saw was, instead, a well-executed portrayal of a well-known character, with no stamp of individualism on it. If you asked me to name Harrison Ford movies, I would likely forget this one, as it just as well could have been several other actors, (e.g., Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson). Whereas Tommy Lee Jones gave us an A+ performance, Harrison Ford probably earned a respectable but unspectacular A- or B+. That's not bad, but it could've been better. Well, now that I've finished my little rant, which will likely tick some people off, I will conclude by saying that this is a very good action-suspense film with good cinematography and a wonderful performance by Tommy Lee Jones, and it is a very enjoyable viewing experience.

From overcoming his inability to walk, to succeeding in life while playing with the cards he was dealt. This is truly one beautiful and inspiring film.The acting, all around, is great. Tom Hanks's performance is one of the top-5 of the decade (1990-1999), and Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dan with such empowerment, sometimes we are conflicted on who to root for in the long-run. Sally Field does a nice job as Forrest's mother, and Mykelti Williamson (had to look his name up on IMDb) is very good as Bubba.The story is hilarious, endearing, inspiring, and a near-epic at times. The laughs mainly come from Gump's incidents and dialogue, as well as historical moments seen on the television or milestones in each decade the film takes place. The moments in Vietnam are when the film reaches near-epic status, as Zemeckis has us wandering around the jungles listening to Gump's narration, when suddenly his troops come under-fire. The scenes of war are shot tremendously well, especially when Forrest shows his heroic side. As the story progresses, we see him get reality check after reality check, developing his overall character to the point where he still has a mentally-challenged mind, but with experience and understanding many folk cannot come near to.Alan Silvestri's score is uplifting and very engaging. Quite arguably, this is possibly Silvestri's best ever. I highly recommend this to any one who likes orchestral music -- especially film scores.The writing by Eric Roth is spot-on; completely deserving of an applause. Zemeckis's direction is grand, and this is the best film he's ever done; far more depth and love than anything else, this film has a lot of heart.Overall, this is the best picture of 1994, and will go down cinematic history as a classic. I highly recommend Forrest Gump to fans of Tom Hanks, people looking for an inspiring and hopeful film, and any one who is just looking for a good time.

I highly recommend Forrest Gump to fans of Tom Hanks, people looking for an inspiring and hopeful film, and any one who is just looking for a good time.

It is the tale of a misanthropic astronaut, and his three comrades, sent on the first interstellar flight, somewhere towards Alpha Centauri. The tale follows Heston's character, Colonel George Taylor, and his two surviving male underlings, Dodge and Landon, after they crash land on a seemingly deserted Earth-like world. The female member of the crew, Stewart, has died due to an air leak in her hibernation capsule.While they think they are in a different solar system, and have traveled over two thousand years into the future, it not too slowly becomes apparent that they are back on Earth. The willful suspension of disbelief is needed, of course, because the chances that astronauts could not tell that they were under our sun, moon, and constellations- even a few millennia hence, is unlikely. Then there is the terrestrial flora, then the encounter with mute humans (how unlikely is that?), and then being captured by English speaking gorillas on a hunt. I mean- they speak English, and American astronauts cannot piece things together? Yet, if one can give in to that initial act, all the rest of the film- and subsequent series, unfolds with quite a bit of logic, although at times seeming at odds.Dodge ends up killed and stuffed in an ape museum while Landon is lobotomized so he cannot speak. Taylor cannot speak, initially, because he has been shot in the throat by a gorilla. He is mended by two chimpanzee scientists, Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell), an archaeologist, who believe he is 'bright.' She calls him Bright Eyes. They are under the tutelage of Dr. Zaius, an orangutan bureaucrat who knows the secret that his world is earth, and that taking humans once ruled it.Eventually, Taylor regains his voice, after being put on by trial with Zira and Cornelius, who are charged with heresy, and one of the film's many signature moments comes when Taylor is netted and captured after escaping, and rails to the apes who catch him, 'Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape!' Yet, by the time that line is uttered the viewer has so bought into the film's suspension of disbelief, that when we see the shock on the faces of the apes, upon hearing a human speak, it mirrors the viewers' shock. Later, at the trial comes the great sequence where the three orangutan inquisitors will hear no more, and cover their eyes, mouths, and ears, in the classic see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil pose.What some forget, in all the manifest political analogies the film and series put forth- such as the three ape races corresponding with the three main Classical stocks of Man Negroid\/Gorilla, Caucasoid\/Chimpanzee, and Mongoloid\/Orangutan, is that Planet Of The Apes was also a devastating critique of organized religion and its deliberate deceits. Zira and Cornelius, with Zira's nephew, free Taylor, and he and Nova (Linda Harrison)- the female human given to him as a mate, escape with them to The Forbidden Zone- the desert where Taylor first landed. Zaius and the gorillas follow, on horseback, and Cornelius shows proof that humans preceded apes on the planet, including a human doll that could speak. Taylor asks if an ape would make a doll that speaks. They also find dentures and an artificial heart valve. The gorillas attack and Taylor takes Zaius hostage, gets food, water, a rifle and ammo, and he and Nova are allowed to escape along the shoreline, after scorning the man with a citation from Ape scripture 'Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.' Zaius then blows up the cave and the secret of human history predating ape culture.One might think that Taylor should have pieced things together by now, but the film ends with him finally linking things up, when he comes across the deteriorated upper half of the Statue Of Liberty, and curses his ancestors. Whether the statue has been blown up or simply buried in sand is unclear. What is clear is that it is not only a great twist ending to the film, thought up by the film's original screenwriter, Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone fame, but an iconic political image- and the most devastating of the 1960s to come from film. Here is Heston, the embodiment of intelligent macho American goodness- far more so than the more one dimensional icon of John Wayne, on his knees and wailing, pounding the sand impotently, as all that was America is in ruins. Given that this was released not long after the Tet Offensive showed that America was losing in Vietnam, its impact was enormous.The film was one of the two great science fiction films released that year, which made sci fi a more respectable subject for serious drama. The other, of course, was Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, whose iconic imagery was on a par with this film's. Serling's original script, which more closely followed the novel's futuristic themes, was redone by Michael Wilson, who for budgetary reasons had to primitivize the ape society. The film won three Oscars- for best score, by Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Makeup- an honorary award specifically for the film's historic impact. It is the truly otherworldly and spooky score by Goldsmith that- along with Serling's original screenplay, make the film such a classic.

The Silence of the Lambs is right in my top-10 list for the best films of the decade (1990-1999), and after viewing it, it may be in yours too.The acting is brilliant from all involved. Jodie Foster's performance is one to cheer for every step of the way, but the real star of the show, even for how his character plays out in the big picture, is Anthony Hopkins. There's not one scene where we do not fear what this psychopathic genius Hannibal Lecter knows, and every moment he appears on screen your heart will sink -- even if his screen time is VERY short. Ted Levine is very good as Buffalo Bill and sightly underrated for his performance.Howard Shore's music is haunting, terrifying, and uncomfortable, making it a score I'd recommend to anyone who listens to orchestral music. From tone to realization, Shore's intense music sets the stage for what we see, making it a great achievement -- probably the best of the decade as well.The story is very graphic. The violence is pretty heavy, and the first scene between Clarice and Hannibal are disturbing -- especially the moment when she is about to leave; definitely not for young viewers.The story is very enthralling and extreme.

We've seen the same plot many times before and after 1993. Eastwood plays the cat, and Costner does the rat. However, Eastwood directs it at a high emotional level; giving its viewers much inspiration of love and joy, offering a great deal of fun and humour, especially pointing the importance of family. To the effect that, the title should have been A PERFECT FAMILY or A PERFECT FATHER. I'm sure though, Eastwood must have considered these options of titling the movie. If he chose to go with A PERFECT WORLD; for me, it means that even a shifty criminal man can raise a child better than a moralist bona fide housekeeper can, at some point.The story takes place in 1960s' Texas. Butch(Costner) is an escaped convict out of a perforce criminal. After he and his partner escape from prison, they begin to outlaw the law. As a celebration of their freedom, they supersede their own law of crime. They first planned to escape to Mexico, but the plans changed when they kidnapped a 8 year old boy. Butch's partner doesn't like the boy as he likes. So they break with each other, and Butch stays with the boy. When the Texas police are alerted of the kidnapping, police chief Garnett(Eastwood) and his officers start to chase Butch to rescue the boy. Whereas, the boy finds Butch close to him both as a hero in his dreams and as a father in his heart. The time when Butch takes the boy to buy him new clothes, which he chose to wear Casper costume, Butch names the kid Buzz. Butch wants him to be happy for he has never had the chance to be before; and Buzz turns out to be cheery as he found a daemon turning his wishes into reality. Together they formed a legendary couple like Bonnie&Clyde, like Thelma&Louise and the same bottom line was awaiting for them as Bonnie&Clyde, as Thelma&Louise.A Perfect World is truly an Eastwood classic. His style of script, his style of action, his style of simplicity and the love of the guns for sure loom large. Fundamentally like every Eastwood movie out of A Perfect World we obtain an opinion.

The Russians and the Americans are working together against international terror-mongers. A real cocktail. The Russian mafia, slightly Georgian and Caucasian in those days (for the Americans, see Red Heat), the Basque separatist gone underground, the IRA getting little by little out of the closet and back on the political turf, and then the free-lance American adventurers who are doing it for the pleasure of killing in the most visible and gross way possible.

We observe a concurrence or a precisely fulfilled expectation of some sort from one twin to another, and we perceive a certain sort of extrasensory interaction happening, when actually the entire exchange is most likely merely regular physical expression. Twins themselves constantly look as if to hold some secretive space for their being twins. They don't really talk much about it, even in interviews about twins. They start sentences that one way or another don't seem to go anywhere, as if it is not quite doable to articulate what this special bond signifies to them. I would like to have a twin. There is something tremendously superior in the idea. And I want to know what that transcendental feeling is.David Cronenberg's unique film about twins, Dead Ringers, stars Jeremy Irons in a dual role as Beverly and Elliot Mantle, gifted identicals who grow up to be exceptionally accomplished gynecologists. They are extraordinarily intimate, to the degree that they regularly pose as each other. We learn that Elliot has all the time been the dominant twin, and that it is his routine to seduce a woman and subsequently rotate her onto the submissive Beverly without the woman having any idea.Naturally the whole thing is reliant upon on Irons's performances as the twins. He is a completely discerning, subtle and intellectually sharp actor, and he truly does well in composing the twins into significantly different people. By means so discreet we are sometimes not even particularly alert to them, he makes it cloudless as a rule whether we are watching one twin or the other. He ripens them individually, in order that the madness in the last part is genuinely dramatic.Cronenberg's story is probably the only movie about twins that I have ever seen aside from the Polish brothers' Twin Falls, Idaho that doesn't just rest on the leverage given by identical twins but actually explores the truly fascinating relationship. As always with Cronenberg, his emotional portrayal is so deep that it is almost indescribable. When awkward, insecure Beverly grows emotionally involved with the troubled actress played by Geneviève Bujold, it disorganizes the stability between the twins. It transpires that Bujold has an abnormal reproductive system. Her rejection of Beverly propels him into clinical depression, drug abuse and hallucinations about mutant women with malformed genitalia. Beverly is put on administrative leave by the hospital board after some demented behavior that is much more effect without being disclosed. Because of the twins' codependent bond, Beverly's loss of control sooner or later causes Elliot to follow him like a reflection in a mirror. It could be the indescribable pace of Cronenberg's script or it could be his melancholy cinematography. One can never quite be sure of Cronenberg's technique. We only see its effect. He minds great detail, but not like completing a jigsaw puzzle and more like a single breath of air. The most noticeable drive of his way to our feelings and sense of ambiance is his dark, brooding, lovely orchestral compositions of Howard Shore. We only know the outcome of Cronenberg's style.

Then there are those copycats and while some are really good (some Friday sequels, some Halloween sequels, The Burning, My Bloody Valentine for instance) many are not at all good. Many films fall somewhere in between, displaying some features that are to be admired. Films like The Prowler, Happy Birthday To Me, Prom Night, Dead and Buried, Maniac and The House on Sorority Row have some features working for them, be it atmosphere, gore, solid display of originality or good craftsmanship - something ensures they have good entertainment value.Then there are those that have none of that, just copy from better movies and do it in a cheap, unimaginative and talentless fashion. Now seriously, those who won't find this little outburst of mine helpful will agree to the fact this this film has any of the features that make a solid horror movie.It's horribly acted with one badly staged set piece swiftly followed by another. The set ups here are painfully bad (that pizza delivery boy who's just had his eyes drilled out was a particular fav). Honestly, I wish there was a comment section here so I could have admirers of the film point out to me what they liked and why.Now, maybe I was just in a really foul mood when I watched this and I certainly don't want to imply that those who like it are any certain type of individuals, hell, I like some movies that get horrible beatings here. But, in my humble opinion, it's movies like Slumber Party Massacre that gave slashers a bad name and I'm just amazed to see that many horror lovers seem to think highly of it.

And seriously, who better to play Indiana Jones' father than Sean Connery? He gives a hilarious, and yet, sophisticated performance that does not fail to make me laugh every time.

Indy eventually learns that his father was captured by Nazis, and that they are planning to make their armies immortal by using the grails' power. The movie then really picks up, with Indy and father on the run from a ruthless Nazi Colonel (Michael Byrne) on a mission to find the grail before the Nazis do. On the way, they are spectacular action sequences, including a tank chase scene through the desert, a boat chase through Venice and car chase through rural Germany.

Usually, a director has a specific reason for selecting a project about a particular person. Biopics are usually about heroes, or at least about misunderstood good people. When such a picture is attempted about a villain or ne'er-do-well, a very fine tightrope must be walked between whitewashing and playing it safe with a politically correct hatchet job.With THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, director Milos Forman treads that tightrope with confidence. His protagonist is a man whom millions have condemned as a vile pornographer and character assassin. Telling any kind of story from the perspective of Larry Flynt or anyone like him is dangerous. But Forman is careful to be thoroughly analytical in his examination of Flynt's life. He does not try to lick the publisher's boots, but simply presents him as he was (albeit in a heightened fashion). Forman's Flynt is a man whose ambition, bad temper, and appetite for anarchy get him into a lot of trouble; at the same time, he is not devoid of relatable human feeling.Almost as if to parody Abraham Lincoln's beginnings, Forman first shows Flynt as a Kentucky youth living in a log cabin. Eager to get ahead in life, he haphazardly concocts his own moonshine and peddles it to local drunks. A few decades later, his fortunes have improved somewhat he now operates a low-rent, semi-successful burlesque house in downtown Cincinnati. But far from being content with making enough money to live comfortably, Flynt is on the cusp of unleashing on the world his own redneck manifesto. Condemning Playboy as an elitist publication, he vows to create a men's magazine that values the beer-drinker over the martini-drinker. The result is Hustler - which, far from being just another girlie magazine, vents Flynt's class anger by lashing out in vicious mockery of a world that he and his clients never made.As his recreational tastes begin to run to the abstract, Flynt becomes increasingly outspoken about his supposed relevance as a spokesman for First Amendment rights. When his magazine is banned in some cities, this confirmed hedonist transforms into something of a pagan pulpit-pounder. His barnstorming eventually brings him into contact with a more traditional kind of pulpit-pounder Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell. Under pretense of jesting, Flynt low-blows Reverend Falwell with an obscene and slanderous ad parody. The stage is now set for a somewhat farcical battle of wills that manages to mount high enough to reach the Supreme Court.Whether you admire Flynt or not, it is easy to take away from Forman's movie the basic message that his rights as a publisher were just as precious as anyone else's. Problem is, Larry seeks not just vindication but domination he is hell-bent on testing the very limits of constitutional license and public tolerance, repeatedly daring an uptight world to silence him. His megalomania causes him to be far more concerned about all the free publicity his magazine receives from the controversy than with anything as elevated as constitutional freedoms. Woody Harrelson must be commended for capturing with aplomb the audacity of a man whose circus-like antics masked a ruthless determination to hype and exploit himself no less sordidly than any of the naked women in his magazine. That this man has become an icon for the rights of American democracy and capitalism is a bitter irony for many to stomach, but it is no less true because of that.The real-life figures portrayed in this movie are rendered without compromise and with an eye toward objectivity; Forman resists the urge to place anyone on a pedestal or drag anyone through the mud. Harrelson convincingly brings to life a colorful and imaginative man who gradually becomes emboldened, then intoxicated, and finally consumed by his petty sense of self-importance. And Jerry Falwell, far from being demonized, is portrayed with great tact and understanding; that he sometimes comes across as a glad-hander may not always be bearable, but it is believable.THE PEOPLE VS.

Not only is evident it out and out graft and bribery, but in parking ticket quotas, freeby lunches, and the like of countless seemingly harmless acts. Serpico will have none of it, as he is shunted from precinct to precinct, and mocked by his fellow cops as a goody-goody, untrustworthy, and dangerous- all because he's decent and ethical.

On the Beach, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and a few others, are exceptions, and the results, though decidedly situated in the intellectual climate of the growing ideological conflicts of post-nuclear capitalism and communism, bear timeless messages.Harry Bates' classic short story about earth's first contact with an advanced, interplanetary alliance is perhaps one of the most profound, unsettling and mature anti-war films ever made. Klaatu, the protagonist, is an ambassador sent to Earth to warn all of our planet's leaders that their actions will have dire consequences if they do not change their ways.The only aspects of life on earth that Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his seemingly omnipotent robotic companion, Gort (Lock Martin), are not prepared for are our overwhelming capacity for self-delusion, bureaucracy and self-destructive behavior. Deciding that he must more fully comprehend earth culture, Klaatu decides to impersonate a human until he is able to contact people who maybe more receptive to his message than the military personnel and politicians he is first exposed to. He learns about jealousy, masculo-centrism and other sexual disorders by befriending a widow (Helen Benson, well played by Patricia Neal), but finds some hope in an astrophysicist almost certainly modeled after Richard P. Feynman (Professor Barnhardt - Sam Jaffe). But the question remains - what are Klaatu and Gort really up to and if their story is true, can they really save the earth from extraterrestial destruction or, perhaps, from itself? The Day the Earth Stood Still is perfectly cast - Rennie outdoes himself as Klaatu - his remarkable stature, build, and oddly subtle expressions greatly enhance the character. Neal, always good, makes Helen an entirely sympathetic character. And the supporting cast does yeoman's work as well.The film takes a theme which could have been overwhelmed by high-minded dialog, and distills it to its most profound and simplest elements through excellent Teo Tovar cinematography, editing, and screen adaptation (by Edmund North, who would later write Patton, and many lesser films). Fred Sersen's special effects are great - never hokey or overbearing. It is also one of the great Robert Wise's earliest major successes, and it is as much a tribute to his talent that this film remains a landmark in modern sci fi as it is a testament to the story's excellent ethical points.

This movie is typical of the early to mid 50s films of 'The Bowery Boys', 'Francis the Talking Mule' as well as Abbott and Costello's fifties films-- you go expecting something good and get mediocre unfunny humor instead.Nostalgically, it's interesting to see the comic interplay between them that was so funny in the forties. Some of the routines seem like they're taken from their TV or even earlier radio shows (such as Lou's meeting the café show girl). Others are too familiar-- the done to death scenes of Costello unknowingly sitting or being in front of a dead body or monster, his running for Abbott and their coming back to find nothing (done three times in the first part of the film); the 'point and switch' plate switching routine; and the obligatory final chase sequence (this time with three mummies, one of whom for some reason is Bud Abbott). The difference here is that they still have energy and some edge, and that makes their interplay watchable. unlike the final films of the Marx Brothers, Martin and Lewis and of Laurel and Hardy.B movie queen Marie Windsor has a major role, but Richard Deacon as the High Priest of an Egyptian cult is totally miscast; he exudes about as much menace as an archeology text book. The boys give a brief nod to their 'Who's on First?' fame with 'The shovel is my pick,' but it doesn't really get very far. Peggy King, a vocalist from the George Gobel television show, appears for no reason and sings 'You Came a Long Way From St. Louis' while showing us her semi-butch hair do and zero stage presence.I guess we're been so spoiled by 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein' (1948), that we really lament any hint of spookiness, horror, or dark shadows that are so clearly missing from this film. It's almost as if the movie's best part is the dancers! The funniest moment comes when Bud promises and then shows the high priest that he, Abbott, can keep the legend of Klaris alive by turning the tomb site into 'Kafe Klaris' complete with a dance band wrapped up as mummies! But that's about it. We've come such a long way from 'The Mummy' (1932) that it's not even funny. Even though it's fun to watch them together one more time, I'll sadly have to give the movie a 3 and four fifths, or one out of four mummies.
