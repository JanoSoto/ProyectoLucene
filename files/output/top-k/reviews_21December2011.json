I decided to watch it though because it is one of those movies that a lot of people have seen. As such we become one of the masses by watching this movie.My opinion was that it is all right. I am in two minds about Tom Cruise's entrance to the movie. We spend about five minutes hearing about a great new driver and Cruise enters all arrogant, macho like acting as if he knows everything. On the track he seems good but when he is put in the actual race he seems to be quite panicky about the style of racer. If he was that good then I doubt he would be freaking out on the track. But I guess that is a part of the character of Cole Trickler (stupid name I think). He is a natural driver, but driving on an empty track and driving on a track full of other drivers are two different things.Days of Thunder is about macho contests (I have chosen not to be crude here). Basically it is about a group of men trying to prove who is the manliest of the lot of them. In this contest people get hurt, and even killed, but that doesn't stop them. In fact, as quoted in the movie, they refuse to go to a hospital or even a funeral so that the inevitable is as far from their mind as possible.Plot wise I predicted it quite accurately. He becomes a racer and is good but has a nasty crash. He goes to hospital, meets the love interest (Nicole Kidman) and then goes back to racing where he wins the big race. The plot is not all that thin though because there is a relationship element in the film as well not the shallow relationship between him and Kidman, but rather between him and another driver. At first they are rivals but after the crash, they are brought together, and though they have a smash up with a couple of rent-a-cars, they soon become friends after the steam has been vented.What used to be a movie on the lips of everybody has now simply faded away to an 1100 time slot. They claimed that there were a lot of hot scenes between Cruise and Kidman in this movie, but there is not only for about five minutes in the middle of the movie. What I did like was the style of photography in the film. It has a very dusky feel to it that I thought added depth to the movie. To me, it is an average movie that it okay once but that is as far as I would go.

I was expecting a standard British crime film with with great performances, but while I got the latter it definitely wasn't anything standard. The tone was very unique, but also all over the place. It would go from this '80s pop heist movie to a staged character drama to a quiet noir tone, it never really felt like it was comfortable in it's skin. A common occurrence with a first time director, trying to do too many things in one go. Some of this stuff worked, I dug any scene with the characters being still and interacting, but some of it really didn't; the supernatural element was so bizarre and unnecessary.Ultimately it's all about the performances though and they really leave a mark. Ray Winstone's character wasn't one I had much of an investment in, but I always love when people give that guy the opportunity to really dig into something. He's got so much talent and he's usually stuck in the background. Of course it's Ben Kingsley who steals the show with one of the most explosive, terrifying and intimidating performances I've seen in some time. He completely steals the movie and is the thing that resonated the most for me. A wild performance.Ian McShane is really under-appreciated here though, also quite intimidating but in a polar opposite way from Kingsley; a quiet menace. McShane does his best, but the film suffers a lot whenever Kingsley isn't on screen. That's the problem with a supporting performance that takes center stage; everything else pales in comparison. Also, for an 80-minute running time, it dragged a bit in the final act.

Its neo-realism comes as a blast of fresh air after the increasingly sentimental films being produced in countries like France in the wake of the Second World War and its simplicity reflects the truth about the world as few pieces of art - in any form - have ever done.The acting is uniformly excellent as is the feeling of despair that hangs over the depressed economy of war-ravaged Italy. The devastation is neatly juxtaposed with the superficial glamour of the American movie stars in the posters the protagonist has to put up as part of his job. This indeed, marks the beginning of US ascendancy and the post-War world, where American culture will come to dominate.The film shows how a simple theft can have a devastating impact on an impoverished man, his career and his family. It also satirises an uncaring society, quick to condemn but slow to help. The police are not interested in the case and turn a blind eye to the black market in stolen goods being blatantly sold in the public square. Likewise, the Roman Church is depicted as being more interested in the solemnity of ritual than in seeing justice done inside its very doors.In his hopeless despair, the man becomes dragged down himself. In desperation, he resorts to seeing the fortune-teller he earlier derided as a charlatan, takes out his anger on his young son, alienating him and, finally, in the film's climax, becomes a thief himself.There are glimmers of hope though - when the body is dragged from the river, he sees that there are more important things than a job, even in this hopeless economic situation.Throughout the film, the cinematography is flawless, often focusing on facial expressions. The despair is not heavy-handed as it would be in an Anglo-Saxon film - there is a lightness of touch and even moments of comic relief in this most serious of films.Bicycles appear from everywhere to haunt the protagonist, but never the stolen one for which he is searching. Ironically, by the 1940s bicycles are, of course, already an outmoded form of transport but due to the collapse of Italian society, they are suddenly an essential machine again and indeed do represent the wheels of progress once more. They act as a class divide and literally distinguish those who will materially advance from those who will not. They are the protagonist's key to entering the workforce and riding forward out of poverty.The realism is reinforced by the fact that the quest fails - he will have to go to work on Monday without his mode of transport and his fate is left uncertain.The film's pace never slackens and the tension builds early. The audience knows from the title that the bicycle will be stolen and quickly sees how important it is to the main character. Hence, every time he leaves the bike alone, anxiety rises until we finally witness the actual robbery and chase, which is almost a moment of relief.Music throughout the film is minimal and is most effectively displayed in the restaurant scene. Like the expensive meal it is a luxury only the rich can afford in this society that has suddenly been stripped of culture and barely knows where to begin to rebuild.Ultimately, this is an essential film that cannot be praised highly enough. De Sica displays an extraordinary mastery and has well and truly found his voice with the neo-realist style, which reflects the harsh reality of life in defeated and depressed Italy.The film's moral lesson of how a simple theft can have a devastating effect on a whole family is timeless and the lack of resolution at the end shows just how the problems will be ongoing for the family in question. The film shows various aspects of post-War society and the lack of cohesion as State and Church both fail to help one in need, leading to desperate measures on his behalf, measures he himself finds degrading and repugnant. His innocent son reflects his conscience in these scenes and stands as a witness to this failed society. To end on the same note as this review began, this film is quite simply a masterpiece.

When the movie first started the only three characters I could recognize right away were Patrick McMurphy, Chief Bromden, and Nurse Ratched. After viewing the film for two days it still took me awhile to figure out who was who in each character. Billy Bibbit was easy to identify by his stutter, but Harding was hard to distinguish.

I find this odd because Hercules is without a doubt in my mind one of the best animated movies Disney has ever made. From the characters, to the songs, the animation and just everything about this movie is good.Hercules is not accurate to Mythology, but then again how many Disney movies are accurate to their stories? One of the reasons why Hercules is good is because it doesn't try to hide violence, it doesn't try to tame the underworld, it doesn't try to be absolutely kid friendly. The monsters can be slightly goofy, but generally they are creepy. The Hydra ranks as one of the coolest monsters ever in a Disney movie, because while it is CGI, it is animated to look more like a traditionally animated monster. The underworld is exceptionally dark for a Disney movie, but it is wonderful just how much detail they put into it to make it dark.The characters are probably the main reason why this movie is so good. None of the characters are your average Disney characters. Hercules is the brave, slightly arrogant, but a bit awkward hero. Pegasus (yes I know Hercules in mythology never rode Pegasus) is a good horse character though a lot of Disney movies have horse side characters. Meg is a unique female character because unlike most Disney Princesses who are near perfect and beautiful and everything, Meg is quite the opposite. She is sarcastic, a brunette, and doesn't seem to take anything too seriously. While there are plenty of more interesting characters, Hades is a fantastic villain. While at first he seems kind of wimpy for being the Lord of the Underworld, later you start to realize just how dark and evil he can be. He seems almost like a lawyer at times in just how well he phrases things and how well he plans.Overall Hercules is a much better Disney movie than the average animated movie because it actually focuses on action, unique characters, a beautiful art style, and a good soundtrack. The art style in this movie is good because it tries to be similar to Greek art style. Again, great movie that was actually original and had great dialogue. A great movie!

Whether it's Richard Nixon in Secret Honor, Millie Lammoreaux in 3 Women or Philip Marlowe in The Long Goodbye, when Altman keeps the lens on one protagonist he feels so much more focused and precise. As someone who isn't a big fan of his ensemble pieces, it feels like a drastic change and I wish he had done all of his films this way. The Long Goodbye gets special attention from me, because as of now I'd say it's my favorite of his work and it features one of the most interesting and unique protagonists I've ever seen.The detective genre is one that I hold near and dear to my heart, but it's also one that unfortunately features a lot of the same ideas and narrative structures. In The Long Goodbye, Marlowe innocently helps his friend by driving him to Tijuana and is rewarded for his good deed by swarms of men on both side of the law breaking down his door and roughing him up. It's a slightly standard plot, but what writer Leigh Brackett (going off a novel by Raymond Chandler) does to set this apart is create a main character so interesting that all of these experiences feel like something brand new.Marlowe is overcome with his disdain for society and it bleeds through every frame. He has this running internal monologue of cynicism and sarcasm, but he's so given up that he has lost his filter and the words just pour out of his mouth at all times. Whether he's being interrogated by the police or feeding his cat, he can't keep his thoughts in anymore and they all become externalized. It's a remarkable technique and something I've never seen done before, used to great effect here.Special attention needs to be given to Elliott Gould who gives a performance I never knew he was capable of. He nails this technique, making it feel effortless and authentic, which is maybe the most impressive thing of all here because it could have derailed the entire picture if the wrong actor were playing the part. Sterling Hayden also leaves a large impression as a terrifying alcoholic, but it's Gould's show and he makes it something remarkable.Altman here creates something that somehow feels ripped out of the '40s, yet also completely modern. There's a '70s noir tone going through the whole thing, but the social commentary and themes feel distinctly of our era. It's quite impressive.

It's a brutal attempt at satire, examining the way we idolize those who do should not be given the attention they receive. It's a twisted and chaotic film that sparked a maelstrom of controversy which even landed Oliver Stone in court defending that the movie does not incite violence in those who watch it. This was because of the killing spree two youngsters went on after watching Natural Born Killers, creating a whole other story to go along with the film, raising Natural Born Killers to an all new height as one of the most controversial films ever made.You simply will never see anything quite as chaotic or disturbingly wacky as Natural Born Killers. With over 3000 cuts, the film is a sporadic and electrifying film that is in a million places at once.

Natural Born Killers is a deep and existential film that delves deep into the mind of madness and chaos, exploring the idea behind senseless killing. The film doesn't sympathize with murder, rather, it takes a close look at what insanity is capable of. It sharply examines the demons within all of us and how nobody is safe from insanity and we can all be victims and criminals at the same time. As Mickey Knox puts it, Nobody's innocent.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and I also enjoyed viewing the film. They were both excellent pieces of work. I highly recommend this film.

The film ineffectively captured the characters development in the play. For example, Chief is a mysterious character that all the patients have led up to believed was deaf and dumb. Although his placement in the film did not suit the placement he had in the book much of it was ineffective. Information such as his childhood past was vital piece of information for the concept of the story. It was never talked about or sparked at in the film. Chief's problems on why he is in the ward are forgotten in the film. Another example would be McMurphy; he was looked as a very rude and crazy man in the film.

McMurphy character in the movie leads you to believe that he might be crazy because you don't see as much development he's still the same guy that stepped first foot in the ward. The film ineffectively captured the point of view. The point of view difference between the book and film is that the film has made it third person rather than the original first person. The book displays a first person point of view in the eyes of Chief Bromden. The film however grasps the book in a third person point of view. This is understandable because it would be rather hard to have a narrator who is supposedly deaf and dumb be our main focus point. It is a disappointment to know that Chief's story did not get touch upon in the film but the film did a good job in cooperating different perspectives in the movie. The movie and film are both excellent creation and both have their downsides but the reader should read the book because it provides very good detail and more descriptions in its final copy.

I also thought Denzel Washington's framing role as the senior army officer given the seemingly straightforward task of reporting on the apparently automatic eligibility of Meg Ryan's posthumous award of the Army medal of honour detracted from the central mystery, especially as he wrestles with his own demons after unwittingly being involved in a tragic friendly-fire incident of his own. So Denz fights the bottle and walks out on his family, before uncovering the truth about Ryan's death and the way back to his own redemption.This final resolution and the underlying implication that the US Army welcomes openness is firstly too pat and improbable, especially in the wake of some real-life events that have come to light since then. All that said, the dramatisation of the war is very well realised and the acting is of a high order, Washington giving it strong and silent in a commanding lead role, but there are even better performances from a young Matt Damon and Lou Diamond-Phillips as two of Ryan's crew who survive the ordeal physically but not mentally.Ryan does well too and I was also impressed by the actress in the menial task of playing Washington's wife.

The singer ends up creating a roadside inn where they're only opened on holidays and it gets off to a good start when he finds a singing beauty (Marjorie Reynolds) but soon his old partner is back and has his eyes on the new girl. HOLIDAY INN is considered one of the best of its type but those who aren't familiar with the movie probably only knows it as the film that introduced everyone to the Oscar-winning 'White Christmas' sung by Crosby of course. There's no question that the song deserves all the praise and love its gotten over the years but at the same time you can't help but think that there are plenty of other tunes here that deserve just as much attention and credit. It's really amazing how simple this film is because you pretty much get a variety of songs set around a holiday and then you have two legends doing some of the best work of their career. From the opening scene of Astaire dancing on the snowy streets to the closing number, everything here is just flawless. I think the film deserves a lot of credit not only for its songs and dancing but also the humor. There are some terrific comic bits including a sequence involving driving into a lake and another that takes place in Feburary that I won't ruin for those not familiar with the film. As for the music there are numerous highlights including 'I'll Capture Your Heart Singing,' 'You're Easy to Dance With,' 'Be Careful, It's My Heart,' and even the blackface routine 'Abraham.' Both Crosby and Astaire are at the top of their game and deliver the brilliance that you'd expect from them. The real surprise here is how flawless and touching Reynolds is in her part. She certainly helps the film and it's a real wonder why she never really took off in films. I think the one negative thing in the film is that Astaire's character is such a jerk that you really don't want to like it but since it's Astaire you pretty much look over his flaws. The film also doesn't want to paint him as a bad guy even though that's what he is. With that said, it's easy to see why HOLIDAY INN is considered a classic and the leads and Irving Berlin's songs are clearly some of the best out there.

Based on an actual Chinese story, Mulan is unlike anything the filmmakers of Disney ever created.Mulan herself is very unique compared to most women from the Disney universe. She's no princess or pretty girl wanting more or waiting for a happy ending, instead she's a bit of a social outcast stuck in the traditional family norm the Chinese had with women at the time who just wishes to be herself and prove that she's no obedient little housewife-to-be. Mulan takes a big risk and ends up becoming the heroine China needs to save them from the crafty and ruthless Shan Yu, who leads the invading Huns.All the other characters are a true delight. Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan's guardian dragon, is a hilarious character who proves to quite helpful on certain occasions and brings much of the comedy into the film. Captain Shang is tough and determined, but even he has his insecurities, which makes him a unique love interest to Mulan. The villain Shan Yu is not someone to be trifled with or underestimated because he's cold, calculating, and powerful as heck. The trio (Yau, Ling, and Chien-Po) are really fun to watch as they hilariously interact with other characters such as Mulan, Chi-Fu, and even each other.This movie has the perfect blend of amazing art design, epic action scenes, wonderful music that complements the various scenes, memorable songs, great comedy, intricate storytelling, flawless animation, and excellent themes. The filmmakers must have really pushed themselves to make this into an awesome and unique edition to the Disney franchise and they weren't too afraid to get a little dark and make the situations the characters are going through as real and sometimes as dangerous as possible, both the menacing Huns and their own somewhat strict social traditions.Overall, this is indeed a rare flower that blooms the most beautifully. I consider this to be one of the greatest Disney films ever made, if not the best. It is highly recommended that you check this movie out and marvel at the cultural and cinematic wonder that is Mulan.

It was meant to be a teen movie that appealed to younger audiences (of that time). 2. It wasn't exactly a zombie movie. So a lot of people were annoyed that there were a lack of zombies in this film thinking that it was just another zombie film. However this was more of a End of the world premise. 3. What flies under the radar is that unlike other films with zombies in it, the characters had more than 1 enemy. In most movies that are zombie based back then usually there was only 1 enemy (the zombies). But in this movie a team of scientists slowly turning into zombies were also the enemy. Though in more modern day movies with zombies in it like Resident Evil there is more than 1 group of enemies. But back in the 80 this dynamic was rare. 4. It was almost a self-parody of the 80s by the 80s in that it was both humorous and scary at the same time. A lot of people love darker, or I should say cliché' scary movies in which the characters, story, and other elements are overly dark and menacing oozing with negative attitude... are those who want things to be unrealistic. However I found Night of the Comet to be just as how some teens might have acted back in the 80s. Now a days, everyone in a scary movie has some connection to a dark past and are cliché' James Bond turned Emo type characters. Or even if they are everyday people they all have the same fake-cliché-dark attitudes like in the remake of Dawn of the Dead 2004. I like it better when the characters act more like people would in real life (for their age and generational groups). I'm not saying all teens in the 80s acted like the girls in Night of the Comet but they did capture the spirit of how most kids would in their demographic. This gave it a sort of realism. In today's horror movies, you mostly get a bunch of Emo, Grunge, or Goth attitudes even in the plain clothed characters. I don't mind a couple edgy characters but when all the characters act like that it takes away from the realism. OR it's like if you have that 1 main character that is Cliché' to the max like in The girl with the dragon tattoo it's overly stereotypical and ever so used up. Even though the girls in the movie Night of the comet were sort of cliché' they actually depicted what a lot of girls in 1984 acted like and was more realistic. Also in today's movies they portray scared people as always getting tons of tattoos, scares, piercings, etc etc etc. and I have to tell you I know a lot of people in real life that are very emotionally scared and they don't look like rejects that shop at Hot Topic. I myself have been through a lot in my life, a lot of stuff that as emotionally scared me that I'm in therapy for BUT you don't see me running out and shaving my eye brows. ha ha ha I miss the older movies, yes they could be a bit CAMPY but they had a better range of characters and they were more true to real people for that day and age. They also knew how to hold a camera steady back then and not shake it violently to compensate for the lack of scary stuff like in todays films, that seem to lean on quick jerky camera movements and poorly lit shots to compensate for the lack of imagination. Or lean heavily on cartoon looking CGI as a crutch.

Though in more modern day movies with zombies in it like Resident Evil there is more than 1 group of enemies. But back in the 80 this dynamic was rare. 4. It was almost a self-parody of the 80s by the 80s in that it was both humorous and scary at the same time. A lot of people love darker, or I should say cliché' scary movies in which the characters, story, and other elements are overly dark and menacing oozing with negative attitude... are those who want things to be unrealistic. However I found Night of the Comet to be just as how some teens might have acted back in the 80s. Now a days, everyone in a scary movie has some connection to a dark past and are cliché' James Bond turned Emo type characters. Or even if they are everyday people they all have the same fake-cliché-dark attitudes like in the remake of Dawn of the Dead 2004. I like it better when the characters act more like people would in real life (for their age and generational groups). I'm not saying all teens in the 80s acted like the girls in Night of the Comet but they did capture the spirit of how most kids would in their demographic. This gave it a sort of realism. In today's horror movies, you mostly get a bunch of Emo, Grunge, or Goth attitudes even in the plain clothed characters. I don't mind a couple edgy characters but when all the characters act like that it takes away from the realism. OR it's like if you have that 1 main character that is Cliché' to the max like in The girl with the dragon tattoo it's overly stereotypical and ever so used up. Even though the girls in the movie Night of the comet were sort of cliché' they actually depicted what a lot of girls in 1984 acted like and was more realistic. Also in today's movies they portray scared people as always getting tons of tattoos, scares, piercings, etc etc etc. and I have to tell you I know a lot of people in real life that are very emotionally scared and they don't look like rejects that shop at Hot Topic. I myself have been through a lot in my life, a lot of stuff that as emotionally scared me that I'm in therapy for BUT you don't see me running out and shaving my eye brows. ha ha ha I miss the older movies, yes they could be a bit CAMPY but they had a better range of characters and they were more true to real people for that day and age. They also knew how to hold a camera steady back then and not shake it violently to compensate for the lack of scary stuff like in todays films, that seem to lean on quick jerky camera movements and poorly lit shots to compensate for the lack of imagination. Or lean heavily on cartoon looking CGI as a crutch.

It was meant to be a teen movie that appealed to younger audiences (of that time). 2. It wasn't exactly a zombie movie. So a lot of people were annoyed that there were a lack of zombies in this film thinking that it was just another zombie film. However this was more of a End of the world premise. 3.

The film stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg together with William Fichtner, John C. Reilly, Allen Payne, John Hawkes, Diane Lane, Michael Ironside, Karen Allen and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.It was directed Wolfgang Petersen.In October 1991, the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne, convinces the Andrea Gail crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. They head out past their usual fishing grounds, leaving a developing thunderstorm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the Flemish Cap, where their luck improves. At the height of their fishing the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decide to risk the storm. However, between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the Andrea Gail crew underestimate.After repeated warnings from other ships, the Andrea Gail loses her antenna, forcing a fellow ship to call in a Mayday. An Air National Guard rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refuel, the helicopter crew ditch the aircraft before it crashes, and all but one of the crew members are rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, the Tamaroa. The Andrea Gail endures various problems with 40-foot waves crashing onto the deck, a broken stabilizer ramming the side of the ship, and two men thrown overboard. The crew decide to turn around to avoid further damage by the storm. After doing so, the vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. Billy tells Bobby to apply full power to ride over the wave; it seems that they may make it over, but the wave starts to plunder and the boat flips over. Billy elects to go down with his ship and only Bobby manages to surface. There are no survivors, however, and the film ends with Captain Greenlaw reading the eulogy at the memorial service, followed by Christina and Bobby's mother, Ethel, consoling each other on the dock and Billy's voice pontificating about what it means to be a sword boat captain.The film has a relatively simple story about dedicated fishermen from Gloucester,MA trying to make a catch that was caught in a disastrous storm.While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, the viewer may get concerned about this film as it suffers from any actual drama or characterization which they believe that is required in any movie.But nevertheless,I still consider it an awfully good film. Although people may dread the experience that these fishermen had,it nevertheless was full of entertainment as for the viewer gets to experience the life of fisherman and the emotions,feelings and aspiration that they go through life.Overall,it is a still a must-see for people wanting to get a view of how life is lived in the sea.

This film is in my all-time favorite films because of it being so superlative and well basically, entertaining and extraordinary. So for the repulsive, cretins that have not seen this fantastic film, I'll give them a briefing of what it's about.The Matrix starts off with an action-packed scene that leaves us scratching our heads, on what the movie is supposed to be about, but it gradually all comes together. The star of this film is Keanu Reeves, who plays an estranged lost worker in New York, Thomas Anderson, but goes by the online alias Neo, this is all 'supposably' set in the year 1999. Look I won't give too much away but I will tell you this; Neo thinks that something has always been 'different' in the world but he can't explain it, we soon find out the truth about this world and discover what the true reality is.Laurence Fishburne is great in this acting as the all-wise Morpheus, in his comeback performance, alongside some brilliant co-stars such as the Subtle and intimidating Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving, Carrie Anne-Moss as the prevailing Trinity, Joe Pantoliano as bad guy Cipher, who you may remember as 'Guido The Killer Pimp' in Risky Business.Concluding my review I would like to say that if you watch this film and thoroughly enjoy it, do not, and I repeat do not, watch the sequels to this film, for it will ruin your experience of the original.
