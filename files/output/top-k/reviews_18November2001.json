I benefited from knowing very little when I went to see the film. But when Shrek tears out a page from a Fairy Tale book to use as toilet paper and then goes pleasantly about his day to Smashmouths Allstar, I knew I was in for a treat.All four lead voices in this film are brilliant, but none more than John Lithgow as the diminutive Lord Farquaad. Farquaad is about three feet tall but does not seem to realize it, as if Lithgow was not told during the recording. But he is evil and arrogant and perfect. One of the best animation voice-overs ever. The choice to go with Mike Myers scottish brogue is the only thing in the film I would question, but then I cannot picture the lovable Shrek any other way.The plot is very simple. Shrek is enlisted by Lord Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona from a dangerous dragon. Pretty standard fairy tale fare. Shrek agrees to do so in exchange for getting his beloved swamp back all to himself. He is joined by Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy who provides almost all the laughs. Shrek does not know that Farquaad and Fiona both have secrets.To tell anything more would be silly. The plot has little to do with this film. It is a visual feast with every inch of every frame jammed with colour and action.  It is also packed with adult injokes and movie references. I counted more than 20 and the IMDb lists even more than that. And after a film of laughs, jokes, adventure, emotion and fun, the best scene comes at the end as the entire cast rocks out to I'm a Believer. (Maybe Disney needs to get the message that original sappy ballads that are written to win Oscars just aren't needed).If you are one of the few people left on Earth who have not seen Shrek, do so right now!

The movie does live up to it's hype, which is unusual in the movie industry for the last quite a few years. Much to most of your people's and critics' dismay, I liked Pearl Harbor. So for me, Pearl Harbor also lived up to it's hype. But lets get to the Harry Potter issue. Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry was fantastic, along with his two best friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn).  After reading other people's negative comments, (don't get me wrong, most of them were positive) they said it wasn't good because they left too much out from the book. Let's think about it here, shall we? Movies are suppose to be different from the book. It's been said a million times, NOT metaphorically speaking. Yes, the book is better, but just a tad better. I have to say this is the best adaption from book to movie since Jurassic Park. But for Jurassic Park, I'm currently reading the book which I'm enjoying thoroughly, although I actually like the movie a little more, so far. But if you haven't read the book of Harry Potter, read it, because it's one of the best books I ever read. My favorite book ever would have to be it's second outstanding sequel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. So when you get the chance read the series of Harry Potter and read them in miracle order, otherwise you won't like them most likely. The plot is the same from the book, so just figure that out for yourself. I also read a comment by a person who hated the movie. They said they didn't read the book before either. Once again, I say this. The book is different from the movie! When you get a chance to see this movie, see it. But read the book first. I hope you love the movie just as I did, because Chris Columbus did a fantastic job. Chris Columbus knew what he was doing when he took the job to do this phenonema. So one thing to tell you Chris, bring on #3 and #4. The first Harry gets a 10\/10. Expect to here from me again after Chamber of Secrets, because my expectations are high.

It's a great adaption from the book, which was outstanding also. The movie had a great character developement, as well it had great special effects, plot, acting, and everything else you look for in a movie. The movie does live up to it's hype, which is unusual in the movie industry for the last quite a few years. Much to most of your people's and critics' dismay, I liked Pearl Harbor. So for me, Pearl Harbor also lived up to it's hype. But lets get to the Harry Potter issue. Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry was fantastic, along with his two best friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn).  After reading other people's negative comments, (don't get me wrong, most of them were positive) they said it wasn't good because they left too much out from the book. Let's think about it here, shall we? Movies are suppose to be different from the book. It's been said a million times, NOT metaphorically speaking. Yes, the book is better, but just a tad better. I have to say this is the best adaption from book to movie since Jurassic Park. But for Jurassic Park, I'm currently reading the book which I'm enjoying thoroughly, although I actually like the movie a little more, so far. But if you haven't read the book of Harry Potter, read it, because it's one of the best books I ever read. My favorite book ever would have to be it's second outstanding sequel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. So when you get the chance read the series of Harry Potter and read them in miracle order, otherwise you won't like them most likely. The plot is the same from the book, so just figure that out for yourself. I also read a comment by a person who hated the movie. They said they didn't read the book before either.

'Cause I have to admit, this movie shouldn't be a likable movie at all as others herein have rightly noted, it does have a rather dark thread running through it, and it touches (but doesn't dwell) on a lot of off-color issues such as adultery, teen sex, sex between a teacher and student, plus lying, cheating, extreme self-obsession, and, oh yes... vote tampering. So how could this possibly be an enjoyable story?Well, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, and I think it has a lot to do with the relative credibility or believability of the main characters. (By the way, the teenagers in this film *really* seem like highschool-aged teenagers, not twenty-somethings pretending to be..). In spite of the personal shortcomings in virtually all of the characters (with the possible exception of the high school principal, Dr. Walt Hendricks (played by Phil Reeves), who was a genuinely decent guy), you can't help but see a little of yourself in each of them. Flawed, yes, but they're all just oh-so-human, and oh-so-believable. Sad but true, we really do live in a world such as the one portrayed in Election, and the movie merely has some mirthful fun as it skewers that reality.On technical merits, I think this movie is quite well put together. I really like the way the story moves at a lilting pace, steadily gathering substance and volume, with nice little twists and turns thrown in with careful timing.  You'll appreciate the way the plot inexorably develops, grabbing your interest more and more, with additional little layer after carefully measured layer of increasing plot complication thrown into the mix. You actually care about the final denouement of the story, because as the story unfolds, you really do start to care about the players as human beings, and you can't help but become interested in their individual destinies. And when the final denouement does arrive, well, I just like the way the movie wraps up it's neither a happy ending nor a sad ending.

In short, go see it &#150; just keep an open mind about the dark thread - and enjoy the ride.

I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.  Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of Toy Story give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2. From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details. The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing. One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy. Monsters, Inc. works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over. Some audiences will find this character absolutely adorable, maybe even as the film's most distinguished. Though for me, this character almost destroyed the entire movie.  I understand the need for a child to enter Monstropolis, but why couldn't the film have had fun with the idea. Perhaps it could have used a child old enough to understand his circumstances, but young enough to delight in the wonder of his newly discovered world. Instead, the movie gives us a nonsensical plot in which the infant gets herself into one problematic situation after another. This has worked before. In Baby's Day Out we laughed at the accidental irony of the situations. Here, the character gets herself into these situations. She becomes a nuisance even as she initially appears on screen. There is nothing innovative or creative with a young girl running in and out of rooms, yet Monsters, Inc. insists it's funny. The film becomes a one-joke comedy. If you're old enough to cross the street by yourself, you're probably too sophisticated for this humor. Despite this parasite of a character, Monsters, Inc. still manages to come out of the one-joke routine and display a third act of climbing excitement, surprising twists, and entertaining action that will amuse children of all ages. If not for the pesky little girl, this movie might have been one of the most colorfully creative films of the year. All though it is not, Monsters, Inc. does contain enough imagination and colorful images to warrant a trip to the multiplex. But don't say I didn't warn you about the kids. During the screening I attended, jam-packed with children running all around and making noise, I had a little boy sitting behind me that kept kicking my seat. Now that's something I never want to see coming out of my closet.

I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.  Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of Toy Story give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2. From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details. The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing. One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy. Monsters, Inc. works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over.

I like the ones that can pull you in and keep you there. And even better, when they can do it without extra added frills like special effects.This is one of those movies that is just plain terrible. I believe it would be just as disappointing to children, even the Harry Potter fans. The only worthwhile part of this movie was the use of special effects, such as recreating the actors and actresses with 3D graphics in order to better make them fit with the other computer generated things, such as riding around on the broomsticks. While this is impressive, they also used WAY too many techniques from early movies, such as... well, forget I said technique. I mean cheap methods... such as 90% of the shots of Harry on the broomstick just from the shoulders up. It makes it obscenely fake looking, and I really think they could've done a better job. You can tell they were in a hurry to make some money... especially since the sequel is already listed on IMDB for 2002! Give me a break. Expect more cheap effects.Terrible too is the way they delay everything. The only reason the movie is two and a half hours long is because every time something stupid happens, they put the camera on Harry's face for about 5 minutes so you can see his extreme expressions of surprise. Hello? Anyone remember Home Alone? The cute facial expressions thing has been done before. Let's not lengthen a movie by an hour because he's... ahem... cute?Last, but CERTAINLY not least, is the director's usage of random BS. I love it when movies keep you guessing about what's going to happen next, but I don't like it when the reason you can't guess is because it's completely RANDOM. Everything happens in a sequence, one thing after another, and never dwells on anything from earlier in the movie. Nothing is said or done early on in the movie that makes you say, Woah, clever. when you near the end. You might say, Oh, but the viewer's are kids. That's funny. I went and saw it the second day it was out in theatre's, and didn't see a SINGLE LITTLE KID. Not ONE. I'm sure the adults that were there wouldn't tell anyone else to take their kids to see this movie. For the money they spend on taking their kids, they could get them something they would enjoy, like Harry Potter action figures, or even another one of the books in the series. Maybe liven up their brains a bit with some more intellectual reading.Aside from that, the movie does have a few good parts. I won't be a complete jerk about it. If you have not yet seen this movie, stay on the lookout for the chessboard, the troll, and Fluffy. These kind of kept the movie interesting. A low, dull sort of interesting, but the only excitement you will find.Sorry again to all the Harry Potter fans. I was expecting better myself.

Take the case of `Swordfish,' a laughably bad bank heist tale that has the temerity, in its opening scene, to criticize Sidney Lumet's great 1975 classic `Dog Day Afternoon' for being too unrealistic and for catering to the audience's need to see goodness triumph over evil (the makers of this film have done such a shoddy job at research that they actually err in pinpointing the other film's release date &#150; citing it as 1976 rather than 1975).  All this from a film that boasts not a single believable moment and, indeed, works overtime trying to strain credibility (perhaps that's the point and the whole shebang is simply a sick joke - a possibility that, come to think of it, becomes more and more likely, given the stupidity of some of the plot turns we are asked to swallow).  Like so many thrillers these days, `Swordfish' tries to dazzle us with an array of complicated looking computer hardware.  It isn't enough anymore for a band of robbers to storm their way into a bank, wave a few guns, take a handful of frightened hostages and hunker down for the duration, giving the authorities conniption fits with their exorbitant demands.  No, for now the robbers have to precede these activities with a good 75 minutes of computer downloading and money transferring.  John Travolta plays yet another of his stock villain characters, this time as a deranged, anti-terrorist megalomaniac named Gabriel Shear who will stop at nothing to `maintain America's freedoms,' even if it means committing crimes, subverting the Constitution and murdering all innocent and not so innocent people who get in his way.  One would think that tackling such a subject would give the film a veneer of topicality in the wake of the events of September 11th.  On the contrary, the reality of that day only helps to underscore the absurdity and stupidity of the film's cartoonish view of both terrorism and the methods necessary to combat it.  It also doesn't help that the film comes replete with some of the most laughably bad (and badly photographed) action stunt sequences to show up in a movie in a long long time, including a ludicrous car chase and shootout along the streets of West LA and a final sequence involving a bus literally flying over downtown Los Angeles that should be in some sort of hall of infamy for bad action scene ideas. Hugh Jackman plays Stanley Jobson, a `retired' computer hacker just paroled from a stint in the big house, who allows himself to be coerced into joining Gabriel's motley crew of computer-geek assassins.  Having just endured `Blow' a few weeks ago, I was not prepared for yet another film featuring a `sympathetic,' desperate-to-reform criminal who is willing to return to a life of crime in order to secure custody of the little daughter he loves.  The parallels in their situations are simply uncanny and one begins to wonder what one finds more objectionable about these two characters their soft-heartedness or their soft-headedness.  Halle Berry portrays the stereotypical smooth, icy-cool criminal sexpot who (ho hum) may or may not be what she seems.  Not that that really matters much in the absurd closing sequences of the film, where all logic, credibility and good old fashioned common sense are cavalierly thrown out the window and we are left scratching our heads in bewildered amazement wondering just what exactly transpired that our little pea brains didn't get.  When a film refuses to play by any rules related to the laws of the real world, we have every right to laugh it off the screen.

Like so many thrillers these days, `Swordfish' tries to dazzle us with an array of complicated looking computer hardware.  It isn't enough anymore for a band of robbers to storm their way into a bank, wave a few guns, take a handful of frightened hostages and hunker down for the duration, giving the authorities conniption fits with their exorbitant demands.  No, for now the robbers have to precede these activities with a good 75 minutes of computer downloading and money transferring.  John Travolta plays yet another of his stock villain characters, this time as a deranged, anti-terrorist megalomaniac named Gabriel Shear who will stop at nothing to `maintain America's freedoms,' even if it means committing crimes, subverting the Constitution and murdering all innocent and not so innocent people who get in his way.  One would think that tackling such a subject would give the film a veneer of topicality in the wake of the events of September 11th.  On the contrary, the reality of that day only helps to underscore the absurdity and stupidity of the film's cartoonish view of both terrorism and the methods necessary to combat it.  It also doesn't help that the film comes replete with some of the most laughably bad (and badly photographed) action stunt sequences to show up in a movie in a long long time, including a ludicrous car chase and shootout along the streets of West LA and a final sequence involving a bus literally flying over downtown Los Angeles that should be in some sort of hall of infamy for bad action scene ideas. Hugh Jackman plays Stanley Jobson, a `retired' computer hacker just paroled from a stint in the big house, who allows himself to be coerced into joining Gabriel's motley crew of computer-geek assassins.  Having just endured `Blow' a few weeks ago, I was not prepared for yet another film featuring a `sympathetic,' desperate-to-reform criminal who is willing to return to a life of crime in order to secure custody of the little daughter he loves.  The parallels in their situations are simply uncanny and one begins to wonder what one finds more objectionable about these two characters their soft-heartedness or their soft-headedness.  Halle Berry portrays the stereotypical smooth, icy-cool criminal sexpot who (ho hum) may or may not be what she seems.  Not that that really matters much in the absurd closing sequences of the film, where all logic, credibility and good old fashioned common sense are cavalierly thrown out the window and we are left scratching our heads in bewildered amazement wondering just what exactly transpired that our little pea brains didn't get.  When a film refuses to play by any rules related to the laws of the real world, we have every right to laugh it off the screen.  Which brings us back to `Dog Day Afternoon,' a film that, even a quarter of a century after it was made, still has the power to draw us into its world and make us care passionately about both its situation and its characters.  I guarantee that will never be said about `Silverfish,' not today, not twenty-five years from now, not ever.  You guys should only be so lucky.

Trey Parker plays Elder Young, the above-mentioned missionary, and also writes and directs this unusually amusing b-movie.Orgazmo is a straightforward film that has a very obvious intent. It is aimed at the same audience as other infinitely inferior movies like Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2, but it actually succeeds because its creators have some filmmaking talent that goes beyond a simple purge of every disgusting joke that they learned in fourth grade. Parker and Stone are just naturally funny guys, as has become obvious by now, which is why they have managed to take the potential-free combination of the porn industry and a tiny budget and make it into a hilarious comedy.Trey Parker plays Elder Young, a missionary assigned to do his mission work in Hollywood, and in a hilarious run-in with porn director Max Orbison, he ends up defending himself against a gang of thugs and thereby earning a high paying position as the leading man in Orbison's newest porno. Seduced by the offer of a huge amount of money, which he plans to spend on a house for himself and his ridiculous girlfriend (`Jesus and I love you!'), Young agrees to take on the role, provided he doesn't have to do any actual intercourse.

The fact that he's strapping a dildo to the top of his head might have something to do with that.), and there are just some great scenes.

I was familiar with the characters, knew the basics of the story, but had forgotten most of the important specifics. This is the way I wanted it. I wanted to rediscover things via the movie and then be able to say Oh Yeah, they sure did nail that. Unfortunately, there were all too few moments like that for me.The adaptation, to say the very least, is exceptionally accurate. Very few novels have had such spot on adaptations made. Accuracy however does not a great movie make. The movie is good, but suffers from some of the worst editing I've ever encountered in a big budget motion picture. This is truly painful for me to say, because the man who edited this film, Richard Francis-Bruce, also edited some of my all time favourite films, including The Shawshank Redemption, Seven and The Green Mile. For some reason though, he has completely failed with Harry Potter. The movie's scenes are cobbled together in a very stilted, halting manner.RFB seems to have forgotten the cinematic language of editing in this film. Cuts denote little to no time passing, fades and dissolves denote the larger passage of time. In this film, We will cut from a scene of Harry in the kitchen, to another scene of harry in the kitchen which is supposed to take place several days later. The cut facilitating this however is so abrupt that if you haven't read the book, you will find yourself momentarily confused as you try to sort out where in the flow of the story this new scene is supposed to be. This kind of editing is prevalent throughout the movie. The film is in dire need of some transitional scenes and montage sequences in order to really give the sense of the passage of time.In spite of the lack-luster editing, the movie never feels slow or overlong, and clocking in at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I was surprised to find that I felt no more than 90 minutes could have possibly elapsed. I would have gladly sat in that theatre for another half hour or more, which would have been to the benefit of the film, allowing them to flesh out many of the things that are sorely missed. The ending, to those who haven't read the books, is going to feel clichéd and tacked on. An extra half hour, to flesh out the Dursley's, show more of the unfair point deductions from Gryffindor (thanks to one Prof. Snape) and to allow for some transitional montage scenes showing Harry and the gang in their various classes doing various magic things, would have helped the film out immensely. As it stands, you never really get the sense that Harry attends any classes at Hogwarts, as they are shown so briefly as to be quickly forgotten.Supposedly, the original rough-cut of the film was just over 3 hours long, and I very much hope that this cut makes it to DVD in the form of a directors cut, as any additional fleshing out of this movie can only be to its benefit.In conclusion, Harry Potter is a solid film, never feels as long as it actually is, and is a very accurate adaptation, but for all of that, there are definitely some major problems that could have been easily solved with better editing an additional scenes.

Charlotte then proceeds to marry Adam, and due to some eccentricities on the part of Adam and Maggie, the four become as one big, confused and dysfunctional family, playing out their drama in England and Italy, while Adam pursues his obsessive dream of building a museum in `American Town,' which he feels will `give back' something to those who have worked their lives away in the coal mines wherein his fortune was made.  It's a world in which the priorities of those involved, however, become twisted, and truth, fidelity and all the things that really matter, become lost or disavowed; a world in which those who seemingly have a choice opt for dreary and overcast, rather than for blue skies and sunshine. \tThough the cinematography is superb and the settings lavish, the production team of Merchant\/Ivory, who created and delivered such outstanding films as `Howard's End' and `Remains of the Day,' come up a bit short with this offering, which fairly plods along and simply takes too long to achieve very little in the way of insight or even just a satisfying cinematic experience.  And one of the main problems, perhaps, is the fact that the characters are people with whom you can neither identify nor relate, and as such, it is difficult to sympathize with their respective situations or to embrace their individual fixations.  These are people you simply have trouble caring about, and without that connection it puts you at arm's length, so to speak, and watching their story unfold becomes a tedious business at best.\tA valid argument could be made, as well, for the casting-- or should I say, `miscasting'-- of the film, beginning with Nolte, who not only seems out of place (even playing an American), but gives a performance that seems forced and too overtly `theatrical;' this kind of acting belongs on the stage, and even there would stretch credibility.  It definitely does not translate well to film, and is simply not believable.  As he has proved in many films before, most notably in 1998's `Affliction,'-- in which his performance was instrumental in enabling James Coburn to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor-- Nolte can act; but this just isn't the kind of role in which he excels.  Still, he must be given credit for the attempt.\tThe usually charming and charismatic Beckinsale also falters in this one.  Like Nolte, her performance seems forced and lacks the naturalness that would've made it at all believable.  Perhaps in attempting to internalize her feelings, as one could argue would be appropriate for a young woman of the times depicted here, she may have used a bit too much restraint, which adversely affected the perception of her character and the emotions she was attempting to convey.  And when she does finally externalize her feelings, it just doesn't seem honest.  \tNortham also fails to make his character, Amerigo, believable.  A good actor, one has to wonder at the reasons behind casting him as the Italian Prince.  His accent is decent, but far from impeccable, and the lapses have a tendency to take the viewer out of the story, which breaks the continuity and dispels the drama of the film.  And while not disastrous, it is unfortunate, and the film suffers for it.\tUma Thurman probably comes closer than any of her co-stars at capturing the essence of her character, but even her performance comes across as rather tepid; physically and emotionally, she embodies Charlotte, but even her most flamboyant moments are lackluster.  And she and Northam lack the on-screen chemistry that would've created the tension needed to make the relationship between Charlotte and Amerigo a viable, believable commodity.\tThe saving grace of the film, performance-wise, are those of Anjelica Huston and James Fox, in supporting roles as Fannie and Colonel Bob Assingham who, though in a limited capacity, give moments of the most credibility to the overall film.\tThe supporting cast includes Madeleine Potter (Lady Castledean), Nicholas Day (Lord Castledean), Peter Eyre (Jarvis, the Shopkeeper), Nickolas Grace (Lecturer) and Robin Hart (Mr. Blint).  Visually resplendent, but overlong and far from engaging, `The Golden Bowl' fails to live up to the expectations of a Merchant\/Ivory production.  To say that the story goes nowhere would be erroneous; it's simply a long, tiresome journey with an anticlimax that is less than satisfying.  A highly touted film, in the final analysis it can be chalked up as possibly the first misfire in the Merchant\/Ivory canon.  We can only hope that Emma Thompson will be available for their next project.  I rate this one 5\/10.

Very convenient, indeed.Secondly, while the story at times can be nicely constructed, some parts are lazily thrown together.

Are you telling me that Doc couldn't land the time machine after dropping Marty off during the lightning storm?  Please!

The quest for the Sports Almanac is a good one, turning up some nail-biting sequences.  Best of all are the revisited scenes from the first film.  It's a blast to see Marty sneak around the fringes of the action we know so well to achieve different ends.
