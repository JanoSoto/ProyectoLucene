It might be a week between viewings or a couple of years may pass, but I always enjoy it. This film isn't great in the sense of a masterpiece, or a seminal moment in the genre, or in originality, or in how the story is told. What it does have is a certain restraint that keeps a fairly dull sounding plot surprisingly interesting. The X-Files influence on the mood and atmosphere is clearly evident, and it's easy to imagine Cradle Bay as some secluded town that Mulder and Scully stumble upon only to discover this mind control plot.One of the highlights of the film is the acting. There's nothing there to blow anyone away, but this is easily one of the best portrayals of teenagers in almost any movie I've seen. There's enough subtlety as to not simply show them as stupid teenagers and insult their intelligence, but there's enough naiveté and impulsiveness to make the characters believable as teenagers as opposed to the overly introspective or self sufficient characters with hardly a mention of or need for any parents so prevalent in many movies.There is a certain coldness and sterility to the ambiance of Disturbing Behavior, punctuated perfectly by the warmth of the humor and irreverence of our 4 friends as well as the spontaneity of the crazy old janitor. While maybe a little smart for his age, Stahl as Gavin is a pleasure to watch on screen, especially with U.V. as his quiet and quirky sidekick. Marsden as Steve plays the new kid in school down to a tee, keeping a low profile and genuinely trying to find his place in this new world. Holmes is beautiful as Rachel and while her character doesn't serve much purpose other than Steve's love interest and later the damsel in distress, she does a fine job of being just another misfit.The plot can wear thin at times, and Caldecott goes a little too far with his mad scientist persona late in the film, but the film rarely loses it's eerie foothold. The robotic and sometimes psychotic teenagers are fun to watch as well. It's a mundane and tired concept, but it's brought forth in a believable way without becoming hokey. In many respects they are the typical jock; looks great to adults but totally evil to those outside their clique. In Disturbing Behavior we actually have a reason why this kids act in this manner.I don't know that I have much more to say. There isn't a lot about this film to dissect or read into, but it's a pleasure to watch.

This film is undeniably the most powerful, disconcerting and poignant character study of the fragility of the human condition from the forms of alienation in an urbanized landscape.The plot examines a veteran from the Vietnam war and his attempts to find solace in the Saviour of a prostitute.The most notable area of where 'taxi driver' succeeds is from the sublime direction of martin Scorsese, who establishes the camera as a window into Travis subconscious, which allows Scorsese to convey Travis emotions visual rather than aurally. For instance, the harrowing scene when Travis meets the gun dealer, the camera establishes Travis gaze as he positions the gun towards the window and takes aim at society, which evokes his thoughts of Some day a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. Also the sequence where wizard is creating small talk and the camera is again used in POV style to establish Travis view which is fixated on a glass of water which symbolically highlights Travis emotions. Scorsese also establishes his audacious direction with some great innovative, authentic shots, for instance when Travis is talking into an endless conversation on the phone and the camera slowly moves from Travis position on the phone to the emptiness of the hallway. This shot (imo) is audacious film-making at it's best, Scorsese boldness in breaking the traditional camera movements to create a brilliant ambiguous sequence.Besides Scorsese sublime direction, Robert De niro is riveting as the tormented Travis bickle, conveying effortlessly the parallel dimensions of a Psychotic but still capable of demanding sympathy, for instance when Travis attempts to find a connection in talking to the adult-theater clerk and his oblivious nature in taking Betsy to the theater, he is surrounded by alienation to the extent that he can't access the proper methods of socializing. Furthermore Bernard Hermann score is another technique which broadens the window for the audiences to enter Travis psychological state, the music conveys a sense of poignancy while simultaneously being disturbing.Like '2001' the ending of 'taxi driver' is brilliantly ambiguous, offering audience a divided opinion, was it just a dream or an ironic statement on the nature of the media?, either way you interpreted the ending, the mood is still disconcerting.Martin Scorsese 'taxi driver' is a disturbing tale of alienation in a nightmarish urbanized landscape. The film will be forever encapsulated into the 'all-time greats' because simply there is no other film that captures a character study of the fragments of the human mind as powerful as this.
