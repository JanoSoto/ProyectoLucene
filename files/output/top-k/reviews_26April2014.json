When he gets involved with Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey), she shoots him sidelining his career. Years later in 1939, Roy Hobbs re-enters the major leagues as an old rookie in the New York Knights. He's been hired by the owner The Judge (Robert Prosky). The Judge and the coach Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) have a bet. Pop could get back some of his shares of the team if he could win this year. So he assumes Hobbs is nothing more than The Judge sabotaging his year and refuses to let him play. When he finally relents, Hobbs literally knocks the cover off of the ball with his bat Wonderboy. Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) is a newspaper man who keeps hounding Hobbs for his life story. Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) is Pop's niece and bad luck who is in cahoots with bookie Gus Sands. Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) is his salvation from the past.I don't really like his introduction. It would probably make more sense to have a young lookalike to do those scenes. At first blush, the passing of years may not be as appreciated by the audience. It may be a good idea to use the younger version as simple flashbacks. Redford just don't look different enough in those two different time frames. That aside, Barry Levinson does know how to shoot a beautiful movie. The movie does have its slower spots, but it fits the mystical feel of the story. This movie runs like a fantasy.One thing is for sure. There is that iconic home run scene. Sometimes a scene or an image can stand for something bigger. For that alone, I have added one point to my vote.

Face\/Off is an awesome example of a good action film that is sure to amaze. With the use of two dynamic Hollywood actors, intense shootout scenes, and visuals that appear to be realistic; it was sure to capture my attention. In the movie, John Travolta plays the well-loved, good FBI Agent, Sean Archer, that is bound-determined to put the evil, vindictive Nicholas Cage's character, Castor Troy, behind bars for the murder of his son. However, in order for him to accomplish this, Archer must find a way to get inside Troy's head and figure out what he can do to stop him. The only, what seemed to be reasonable solution at the time, was for him to trade physical features (more specifically faces) with Castor Troy. This gives Archer an open view into the deadly secrets of Troy; however, what would happen if Castor got a hold of Archer's face? Absolute chaos, and that's exactly what happens. Sean Archer with Troy's face, and Castor Troy with Archer's face. So what makes this movie so great? The John Travolta and Nicholas Cage character switch-up. Travolta as the evil, vindictive character, Troy, was humorously interesting. He gave the character a little bit of flare through his evil charm to take over good-cop Archer's family and gave the audience a laugh when he covered up his face-change to Archer's daughter by telling her Papa's gotta a brand new bag. Ow! as he left her room. In comparison, Nicholas Cage, the now defenseless Archer eager to get his life back, plays the character with a more exposure of emotion as he struggles to get his life back to the way it was. As most people know this is an action film, but what they don't know is how intense and suspenseful the shoot-outs are. There are many parts of the movie that are pretty intense, like when Castor Troy (as John Travolta) is on one side of a mirror and Sean Archer (as Nicholas Cage) is on the other side. They're both aware of each other's being as they communicate back and forth. Then, when Troy states Plan B, let's just kill each other. They both turn to look into the mirror and fire their guns; this penetrates to an extreme shootout that ends with someone falling through a ceiling window. Throughout the whole scene, and movie, you're on the end of your seat wondering what's going to happen next, which is very exciting! Have you ever been in an operating room and witnessed a surgery? If not, here's your chance. The graphics and visuals of the face transfer scene when John Travolta's face is lasered off and put on Nicholas Cage's body seems so real that it's hard to believe that it's not. The use of taking the measurements of their faces and using computer software makes it work. Not to mention they even level out the hair length and color to make it look the same. Realistically you know it didn't happen; however, it's hard to not believe because of how legit it actually looks. All in all, this is a great movie that will leave you on the end of your seat. If you like intensity, realistic graphics and visuals, and a twist to the common good guy verse bad guy storyline; this is the movie for you!

That means there's trouble.Yet, The Blue Lagoon is probably, in my opinion, one of the most dumbest and stupidest movies I have ever seen. How dumb is it? Well, considered the story to be stupid. The movie takes place during the Victorian Period, where two young children who's names are Richard and Emmeline and a galley cook named Paddy, (Leo McKern),are shipwrecked on a South Pacific island. Paddy becomes their parental guidance in the beginning of the movie and advises the young kids to stay away from the other side of the island because the bogeyman lives there. He also establishes an law by saying that what goes on on the other side is forbidden since he knows that there's human sacrifices going on. Anyway, Paddy soon dies of a drunken binge and that leaves the two kids alone with no one to take care of them. Years past, and the two kids grow up and becomes young adults (or at least what they think are young adults.)As the movie progresses, the young man and the young woman, (both played by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields.), start to love each other and participates in a series of sexual activities on the island. Emmeline starts to experienced her menstrual period. On the other hand, Richard is rejected by Emmeline and therefore, he goes off and masturbates by himself.The only question that I have for this movie is this Why would anybody thought this material would work? While watching this turkey, I started to care more about the photography more than the actors themselves. Of course, Atkins and Shields are likable movie stars, but to have them take the starring roles in this movie is really regrettable.I never found any of the love scenes to be erotic. Instead, I found those to be very immature and very laughable. I think that when Atkins' character gets rejected by Shields' character, I thought that what he did after he was rejected was very ridiculous and it also look like the movie was trying to get us to maybe laugh at his rejection.The Blue Lagoon is one of those movies where you are taken away by the beautiful cinematography, but you just can't stand the amount of stupidity being made in front of you. The dialogue is so flimsy and at certain times during this entire movie, I thought that the movie would turn into a serious comedy because I couldn't believe anything these two characters said.

Once again, a movie has gripped me with it's slimy, creepy hands and once again a movie has taken me on a pure cinematic journey, even though that journey was an hour and a half of pure insanity. Movies like these are special to me because they are pretty much open for interpretation. A plot or story might be hidden somewhere in the film, however Director David Lynch has crafted a movie where the meaning can really be up to you and what you make it out to be. This is what I think the movie is about. Henry, a man of very small and little words makes a trip his girlfriend Charlotte's house. It seems that aren't the peachiest of couples, and to make it worst, on this visit, his girlfriend and her disturbingly strange family inform Henry that he and Charlotte have conceived a child. But not just any child, a very premature baby. The rest of the straight story is of Henry and Charlotte trying to live with this forever crying baby and keep their sanity. The last perhaps 30 minutes of the movie is nothing but surreal and haunting images and scenes. If the viewer wasn't already turned by the already hypnagogic scenes with Charlotte's family, the final parts, which include a big cheeked songstress living in Henry's radiator, giant sperm like things, and Henry taking a pair of scissors to the baby. I really dig this movie, the odd, dark, eerie black and white cinematography; it fit well with the industrious setting shown. There's too much too say the look of this movie, the pipes that run through and around Charlotte's home, the stage where the Radiator Girl sings my new favorite tune In Heaven Everything is Fine, and Henry's small apartment which reminds me of an insane asylum prison cell. There isn't much in the acting area; there's very little dialog. The actor who played Charlotte's father was a stand out as was the mother, they both boosted the insanity a bit. This is a technically impressive film; it's almost forty years old and the practical effects used throughout were very compelling. The movie may come off as too odd and artsy to most; there isn't a traditional story telling movie here. At some points I would agree.

Once again, a movie has gripped me with it's slimy, creepy hands and once again a movie has taken me on a pure cinematic journey, even though that journey was an hour and a half of pure insanity. Movies like these are special to me because they are pretty much open for interpretation. A plot or story might be hidden somewhere in the film, however Director David Lynch has crafted a movie where the meaning can really be up to you and what you make it out to be. This is what I think the movie is about. Henry, a man of very small and little words makes a trip his girlfriend Charlotte's house. It seems that aren't the peachiest of couples, and to make it worst, on this visit, his girlfriend and her disturbingly strange family inform Henry that he and Charlotte have conceived a child. But not just any child, a very premature baby. The rest of the straight story is of Henry and Charlotte trying to live with this forever crying baby and keep their sanity. The last perhaps 30 minutes of the movie is nothing but surreal and haunting images and scenes. If the viewer wasn't already turned by the already hypnagogic scenes with Charlotte's family, the final parts, which include a big cheeked songstress living in Henry's radiator, giant sperm like things, and Henry taking a pair of scissors to the baby. I really dig this movie, the odd, dark, eerie black and white cinematography; it fit well with the industrious setting shown. There's too much too say the look of this movie, the pipes that run through and around Charlotte's home, the stage where the Radiator Girl sings my new favorite tune In Heaven Everything is Fine, and Henry's small apartment which reminds me of an insane asylum prison cell. There isn't much in the acting area; there's very little dialog. The actor who played Charlotte's father was a stand out as was the mother, they both boosted the insanity a bit. This is a technically impressive film; it's almost forty years old and the practical effects used throughout were very compelling. The movie may come off as too odd and artsy to most; there isn't a traditional story telling movie here. At some points I would agree.

Being an avid player of D&D at the time, this was the movie I had been waiting for and seeing as the first instalment of The Lord Of The Rings was still a year away, this would be the film to sustain my enthusiasm for all things related to swords and sorcery. So, in a fit of what would later turn out to be madness, I took my money and bought a cinema ticket to see Dungeons & Dragons, full of expectation and excitement. Looking back, I'd say it was about half an hour after the title screen that hope had left the theatre forever as the rest of the patrons openly talked above the dialogue and a particularly mischievous bunch of kids several rows in front had taken to shining lasers at the screen, which was much more entertaining than anything being shown on it. Films such as this are what give the fantasy genre a bad reputation and but this goes one step further, making you question why you go to the pictures at all.The land of Izmer is divided between oppressed commoners and powerful mages who advise the headstrong Empress Savina (Thora Birch). Seeking power for himself, the evil Profion (Jeremy Irons) seeks the mystical Rod Of Savrille which has the power to control mighty red dragons and he soon dispatches his right-hand man Damodar (Bruce Payne) to find it. His only lead is the low-level mage Marina (Zoe McLellan) who has escaped from the magic school with a couple of incompetent thieves - Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans). Together with the Dwarven warrior Elwood (Lee Arenberg) and the Elven tracker Norda (Kristen Wilson), our band of heroes begin their quest for the Rod with Damodar never far behind...Rather than wondering too much if you'd heard that synopsis before or whether I had made it up just now, it might be worth pondering how things went so badly wrong. With the exception of Payne and Irons, every cast member is annoying, underdeveloped and saddled with the sort of crummy dialogue you'd expect from an Asylum (the studio that brought us Sharknado) version of the story. Irons is gleefully over the top as Profion, chewing his way through the picture with a sort of manic fervour. He also has the best lines - Let their blood rain from the skies! - but he's just impossible to take seriously, as is Payne. He might well be a sinister presence but why give him lipstick that's such a bright shade of blue, I thought he might have hypothermia? Certainly, those kids with the laser painters weren't taking him seriously either, judging by how often those lips were illuminated. The plot is also ridiculous with impossible leaps in logic, handy coincidences and moronic characters behaving like idiots. This might have been forgivable if the film was loaded with impressive visuals but alas, the ball was dropped here as well. As the camera zooms around the city for unknown reasons, the few mystical creatures that normally inhabit such fantasy lands looked remarkably crude even at the time.I could go on but you get the idea. Dungeons & Dragons is one of the most badly produced, directed and performed movies of any sort and must be marked as one of the fantasy genre's lowest points. Nothing convinces you that you have been whisked away to a faraway land on an epic adventure. The brief cameos from Richard O'Brien and Tom Baker raise a flicker of interest but nothing else. The only thing you can enjoy is Irons working really, really hard to ruin his career - his performance has so much ham in it, I'm surprised PETA didn't boycott the production. Otherwise, you'd be advised to stay well away from this toxic mess of a movie. As for myself, I know now that I should have waited for Peter Jackson to complete his sublime trilogy and have faith in his vision.

With a large cast filled with amazing actors, one can assume to be disappointed but that's not the case here. It's such a gripping story and everyone plays their part well, even if they are hardly used. This is a revenge story and I like the unique perspective this film gave to revenge. It's not about the violence, but it's about using the court system to exact their revenge. This film has the main theme of brotherhood and it shows what these friends would do to help each other out, no matter the cost.Barry Levinson's film is about a group of four friends who decide to play a prank, but when the prank goes wrong these kids are sentenced to a juvenile hall where they are abused by some sadistic guards. Many years later, fate unite these friends as one of the guards, Nokes is shot down by two of these abused boys and the others do what they can to prove these guards weren't so innocent after all.As mentioned at the beginning, this film boasts an incredible pedigree of talent. Kevin Bacon shines in his role of the sadistic Sean Nokes. Robert De Niro, as always, has an incredible on-screen presence and we see that when he is facing a moral dilemma. Dustin Hoffman is good in his role as he brings a tense nervousness to his character. Jason Patric is a good actor and too bad he is not in more movies since he was pretty good here. Finally, Brad Pitt does a wonderful job as usual.Overall, Sleepers is a tense, well-acted drama that is also pretty realistic. There are always cases out there involving sexual harassment of younger children, and this film brings that issue into the spotlight. It's a very emotional film to watch and sometimes hard to watch. Revenge may be a good thing after all especially when done right. I rate this film 9\/10.

The film starts by showing the bond of friendship between men who live and work in Clairton, a small working-class town in western Pennsylvania, in late 1967.The friends, of whom a few are to leave for Vietnam also go hunting together, and in these scenes we see the bonding and conflict between the friends. Part of the film focuses on Stevens wedding, Steven will later join Michael and Nicky in going to Vietnam. The film is brilliant, in that the action moves from the focus being on the sending off of the friends to Vietnam, moves very quickly to the dramatic (and brutal) part of the storyline, where the friendships are tested to the limit, when they are captured by the Vietcong. The emotion, and atmosphere in this scene is electric, and I can honestly say I have never experienced such a 'nerve jangling' moment, while watching a movie.The escape of the three friends and their separation while being rescued by US helicopter, to Michael losing Nicky in Vietnam is also made incredibly well, in these scenes, we arguably see the full affects of PTSD. Michael returns home to Clairton, and struggles to adapt to life having left Nicky behind, Steven, being paralyzed from the fall during the rescue, is a shell of the man he once was, and Nicky, believing Michael and Steven to be dead, falls into the dark world of 'Russian Roulette', something his Vietcong captors forced him to take part in when he was taken prisoner.The climax to the film is also excellent, Michael and Nicky are once again face to face, and Nicky by this stage is a completely changed man, corrupted by war, and the experiences he suffered while a Vietcong prisoner. Nicky and Michael play Russian Roulette, and Michael begs Nicky to come home, it is during this scene where it seems Nicky starts to remember his friendship, and remember Michael, all of which he had forgotten while becoming a key player in the Russian Roulette underworld. Nicky proceeds to shoot himself in the head with the revolver, to Michaels devastation. The ending is symbolic, in my opinion, of the toll of war on humanity, as Nicky is returned back to Clairton for burial, as he had requested of Michael before going to Vietnam. The ghostly and sorrowing ending, focusing on the funeral of Nicky is brilliantly captured by Cimino.This film is well worthy of cult status, the array of human emotions, the exploration of the affects of war on small communities, and the bond of friendship is shown in a respectful and beautiful way by Cimino, I'd strongly suggest this film to anyone.

The film is brilliant, in that the action moves from the focus being on the sending off of the friends to Vietnam, moves very quickly to the dramatic (and brutal) part of the storyline, where the friendships are tested to the limit, when they are captured by the Vietcong. The emotion, and atmosphere in this scene is electric, and I can honestly say I have never experienced such a 'nerve jangling' moment, while watching a movie.The escape of the three friends and their separation while being rescued by US helicopter, to Michael losing Nicky in Vietnam is also made incredibly well, in these scenes, we arguably see the full affects of PTSD. Michael returns home to Clairton, and struggles to adapt to life having left Nicky behind, Steven, being paralyzed from the fall during the rescue, is a shell of the man he once was, and Nicky, believing Michael and Steven to be dead, falls into the dark world of 'Russian Roulette', something his Vietcong captors forced him to take part in when he was taken prisoner.The climax to the film is also excellent, Michael and Nicky are once again face to face, and Nicky by this stage is a completely changed man, corrupted by war, and the experiences he suffered while a Vietcong prisoner. Nicky and Michael play Russian Roulette, and Michael begs Nicky to come home, it is during this scene where it seems Nicky starts to remember his friendship, and remember Michael, all of which he had forgotten while becoming a key player in the Russian Roulette underworld. Nicky proceeds to shoot himself in the head with the revolver, to Michaels devastation. The ending is symbolic, in my opinion, of the toll of war on humanity, as Nicky is returned back to Clairton for burial, as he had requested of Michael before going to Vietnam. The ghostly and sorrowing ending, focusing on the funeral of Nicky is brilliantly captured by Cimino.This film is well worthy of cult status, the array of human emotions, the exploration of the affects of war on small communities, and the bond of friendship is shown in a respectful and beautiful way by Cimino, I'd strongly suggest this film to anyone.

It's been considered one of the great musicals of the 80s, although, technically in Hollywood a film has to be at least forty to reach the official 'classic' label. I'm more bent on definition when it comes to movies. This was one of the highly successful films that saw a lot of cameos from Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest as the first customer to Bill Murray's fanatic dentist patient. Having gained enough recognition from the Off Broadway B musical, Frank Oz takes the helm of directing and did a darn good job. Most people would agree that his alternate ending to the film was a good idea, after doing the original test screening that proved a point. However the truth still remains that most die-hard fans of the play would are more likely to appreciate the original ending where the plant eats both Audry and Seymour. It's a delightful piece with plenty of detail to follow, much in the way Frank's last two pieces with Henson did in 1982 and 1986 when they decided to try something new with puppets - The Dark Crystal and Labrynith. Worth the watch.

Washington as Rubin Carter simple marvelous . Now about movie well i Google it ans i get mix kind of reviews about this story ....was it really like they showed n movie or not ...so i really don't say anythng about real Rubin and about his life. But yes as a story and movie i like this ....nice cinematography and great boxing scenes . I know ppl expecting raging bull kinda movie but this movie was more about story and action taken by society or i can say injustice rather then real boxing. A man who had criminal records run away from prison and joined army their he came to know what he cud capable of he started boxing...then again sentenced to prison where he decided to made him as a professional boxer and he worked hard n prison and become one of the biggest unexceptional case . Then color gap or racism ...ppl hatred and he found guilty for murder he never did. Then his fight against injustice and how a book can motivate a person and then story starts again and u will fall in to it. So one of the best acting done by Denzel and yes i enjoyed the movie and i will recommend you should watch it if u really like movies Washington might get an Oscar for this as acting was superb and he totally in to this character but again there are few files which doubt that is this story was really based on exactly what happened?? ..that was a catch ","genre":null},{"date":"26 April 2014","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The Hurricane  Denzel Washington no doubt is one of the best actor ever exist and this one of his greatest role he ever did, his acting skills in this movie is endless.

His mother bribes him with comic books. He would become an avid comic book collector and study. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is riding the train when it derails. He is the sole survivor without a scratch. He has a wife Audrey (Robin Wright) and a boy.Writer\/director M. Night Shyamalan is playing around with the traditional structure. He has extended the first act beyond any normal reason. Most of the movie is the first act of a 3 act story. It spends most of the movie in a ponderous slow moving introduction that finally reveals the truth. While the reveal is interesting and unforeseen, it isn't the Sixth Sense and lack the satisfaction.This is a superhero movie that Shyamalan has drained most of the action and excitement from. It's deliberate and that creates a certain tone. There's a creepy tone that permeates throughout. The movie starts with a massive train wreck. It's an easy action scene but Shyamalan doesn't use it for a reason. He wants the slow creep. It's an unique movie but not necessarily a compelling movie.
