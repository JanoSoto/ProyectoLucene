The characters are charmless or annoying, the dialogue and acting is laughable, there are numerous plot holes, the actors look bored speaking their lines with all the passion, charisma and conviction of wet cardboard.

A lot of other movies that try to achieve this always fall short and one of them would be my top favorite movie done by George C Scott in Patton. In Patton there use of none period equipment was horrible for such a high dollar film and is the only issue I found with that film, otherwise it still rates #1 on my list, this problem was not the case in we were solders.I would highly suggest everyone to see this film and that all the actors have done a top notch job in the making of this film.

Deliciously 50s in style and risqu√© antics, with Jane Russell's outrageous gym song\/dance number and Marilyn's unforgettable DIAMONDS' number GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES must have been one of the most profitable and well attended films of the decade (and beyond) worldwide. In a year that added THE BANDWAGON and CINEMASCOPE and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, cinemas must have rocked with delight and surprise at this clever level of new Hollywood. So successful was GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES that it was remade at RKO as THE FRENCH LINE and again by UA in 1955 as GENTLEMEN MARRY BRUNETTES each time incredibly with Jane Russell. Each film is basically the same two showgirls get on an ocean liner and go to France. BLONDES does have ridiculous storyline especially with Russell's incredulous 'falling in love' with her antagonist, but overall the delicious hilarity of Monroe, the gasp-worthy costumes, and child actor George Winslow (and the hand kissing scene) makes GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES a DVD classic to treasure. The quality of the print as seen on my DVD player is astounding, making the whole fruit salad more appetizing. Teens today would love it and like SINGIN IN THE RAIN it should be a family movie night staple.
