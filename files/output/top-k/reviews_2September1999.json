OK, it is quite slow, but it is good to forget its failures and enjoy the qualities. Stanley Kubrick proves that he was one of the greatest directors of all the times, and he still is in the memory of his fans. Everything in the film is on its place, so let's start with the cast.Nicole Kidman has a terrific performance and deserves an Oscar nomination, or even win. She surprised me, because she has already done many bad films (Practical Magic, Batman Forever, etc). Here she plays Alice Harford, the wife who has almost betrayed her husband. He is Tom Cruise, another one who surprised me for the same reason. He plays Dr. Bill Harford, the 'almost betrayed' husband ready to face some sexual adventures. The supporting actors and actresses were also great. Kubrick really cares about all the characters. We can see this in Sidney Pollack's acting, but there are others the strange owner of 'Rainbow Fashions' and his daughter, the pianist Nick Nightingale, the hotel desk clerk, the people in the orgy.The scenes are just wonderful. The orgy... Oh, the orgy! Perfect, perfect, perfect! Only Kubrick could imagine those disturbing and at the same time fascinating scenes.The soundtrack is also perfect. The music can tell you a story...We can't say Eyes Wide Shut is a drama, or a romance, or a mystery film. It is a film about many things love, wedding, betrayal, sex, revenge, redemption, etc.If you're looking for sex, really strong sexuality, you'll be disappointed. The sex and the nudity in Eyes Wide Shut are not on the screen all the time. Oh, right! It is also about sex, but Kubrick doesn't abuse of the sexuality.The art-set direction, the screenplay, the dialogues...

We all remember our High School days, and perhaps that's why the film will do quite well.  Because, love them or loathe them, it was those days that helped shape us into who we are today - and all of us have some great memories, and some not-so-great ones (I was the one always picked last for sports you remember, glasses and freckles?).Watching this kind of film frustrates me a bit, because Americans get to have proms, and fairs and are allowed to wear their own clothes - all I got in rainy England was a mountain of homework and Saturday school.  I want a carnival like at the end of Grease, too.  No fair.Well, never mind - because we don't forget those magic days, and secretly, we all want to go back and have the chance to do it all again.  But we can't, because we're stuck in our nine to five jobs and have bills to pay.  So it was nice to have Drew and the rest of the Never Been Kissed crew to remind us.  Chuck in a little romance, a lovely soundtrack, a potential crisis, the will they\/won't they factor, wait for the happy ending, and ding!

For myself, I found the Patch character so annoying, so obtuse, and so selfish-- I could only imagine how satisfying it would have been for someone to throw him out a window. What a self-involved creep! I can only hope that the REAL Patch Adams has a lot more integrity and compassion than the ego-tripping idiot portrayed on the screen. I suspect that this to be true, in fact. The writers\/director rearranged his entire career life, for example, to fit the dramatic and time requirements of a movie. In so doing, however, they made the poor guy immensely unlikeable! This is old news, though.What I would like to share is the value of watching the DVD. Skip the actual movie of course, because it's crap. Instead, switch over to the Bonus Materials, and watch the outtakes, and the director's commentary. Really-- take the time to go through the entire flick on the commentary option. I believe that this, together with the outtakes, is actually a lot closer to the movie the director had in mind when he envisioned Patch Adams.When you see the bonus materials, you get a chance to hear from the humans, actors and director, involved. Those real folks were immensely likable, and it was easy to see how high they set their sights. It's just one of those things, though-- the resultant version just tanked.Lastly, the children pictured in the hospital ward are amazing. The director says that only two of the kids were actors; all the others were the real thing. He also said that and much of their behavior with Robin Williams was ad lib. Just to point out one thing, the huge smile on that little girl's face is as powerful and wonderful an image as has ever been filmed. For those few minutes of screen time, it's worth it to sit through this entire clunker of a flick. This is not quite the compliment I wish I could give to Robin Williams and this group of otherwise talented worthies, but it's a free tip to you, if you're thinking of renting or buying the DVD.

For myself, I found the Patch character so annoying, so obtuse, and so selfish-- I could only imagine how satisfying it would have been for someone to throw him out a window. What a self-involved creep! I can only hope that the REAL Patch Adams has a lot more integrity and compassion than the ego-tripping idiot portrayed on the screen. I suspect that this to be true, in fact. The writers\/director rearranged his entire career life, for example, to fit the dramatic and time requirements of a movie.

I know they wanted to keep the film the way Kubrick made it, but it seems unlikely to me that he wasn't going to edit it anymore after other people actually saw it.  Some of the transitions between scenes are absolutely horrible, and there is a lot of wasted space, though that likely would've stayed in the film; Kubrick always liked to plod along.Which brings me to my second criticism of this film.  At times I found it, well, boring, which seems strange, since it was billed as some kind of sex-fest; instead, there isn't that much sex in it, although in my opinion, that is probably a better thing.  I also thought the scenes with LeeLee Sobieski were quite irrelevant.  At most, they were amusing but added nothing to the story at all.My fourth problem was those stupid added-in figures in the orgy scene.  It's not that I need to see what they're obscuring; the problem is that the figures were extremely distracting and really stood out. My fifth problem also relates to the orgy scene why were most of the women so skinny? The piano player talks about how amazing the women are there, and then they turn out to be a bunch of sticks.  I'm sorry, but if I can see all the bones in someone's back, even those in the lower back, bulging out, that person is too thin.  And people wonder why women sometimes feel so much pressure to lose weight.  In the case of the thighless woman who warns Cruise, I suppose it makes some amount of sense, because she's supposed to be a drug addict.  The only thing I can figure out, other than perhaps the casting director having some serious issues relating to body image in other people, is that the sometimes twisted attendants at the orgy prefer for some reason women who are highly abnormal.My last problem was the sometimes gratuitous use of the word f*ck.  I realise that many people use that word frequently. My problem with it is that, at least among people I know, when you're talking about sex with your (potential) life partner, you don't usually use such a crude word to describe having sex with that person.  Yet it is used frequently in this movie in that context.  F*ck is a word that fits very well to Kidman's fantasy about the naval guy, but not to her having sex with Cruise.  I suppose this is just my opinion, but I did have a problem with that, although it didn't affect my view of this film much.What I DID like about this film was that the basic idea of the film should provoke discussion among couples.  In perhaps a strange phenomenon, Person A knows that he or she is attracted to people other than Person B, and may even have been seriously tempted to act on such feelings, but it doesn't occur to him or her that Person B is in exactly the same situation.  And sometimes it bothers Person A immensely, just like in this film.  I suppose this is because we all know what goes on in our own heads, but we have to guess at what goes on in other people's; we don't know just HOW tempted they were, or if they acted on the impulse and just aren't admitting it.  It seems to me that this is a subject matter that every couple needs to discuss, rather than assuming something and living in a fantasy world, until it all comes crashing down when the illusion is shattered (like in the film- all that stiff about women being different than men).Warning slight spoiler ahead.  Some people, including those I saw this movie with, seem to have missed the point of the HIV+ hooker.  My take on that was to show just what Cruise could have lost by acting on his jealous, untrusting, and perhaps vengeful impulses.  Instead, he got lucky- not in the way one usually would with a hooker, but because his wife called him on his cell right before he did the deed.  Would he have gone through with it had she not called? I would not have been sure he would, except that the next evening, he was already to get it on with hooker number 2, until she informed him of Domino's bad news.  This to me is another good point of discussion should such things count as infidelity, when a person did not commit the deed but would have if he had not been interrupted (in the first case)? And in the case of Kidman's fantasy with the naval guy should her insistence that, had the evening gone by a little differently, she would have had sex with him, be taken as an act of infidelity on her part,or should she be given the benefit of the doubt that she wouldn't have been able to go through with it? I think it is important for both parties in a relationship to know where the line gets drawn.I also thought that acting was, for the most part, good.  I did not find Kidman's laughing fit remotely unbelievably; it was perfectly consisted with my experience, however limited, with pot smokers. So basically, I thought this movie could have been substantially better (especially considering the number of retakes Kubrick insisted on), but it is still worth watching because it is thought provoking; it makes a person ponder both his or her own boundaries as well as those of his or her partner.

The Wild Wild West music video is also a must-see.Just keep in mind that, in the words of Ulysses S. Grant, James West loves to ...shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more and then when everybody's dead try to ask a question or two.RATING **1\/2 out of ****.

Its greatest success is in attributing each of its characters with a complexity of characteristics each one can be liked in his or her own way, and each is presented with such realistic vision that the viewer is suspended in his predicaments.

The 13th Warrior is based on the Crichton book, Eaters of the Dead, which in turn I believe is based on a Viking legend, and if the movie was any indication, the book must be fantastic.The story revolves around a group of Norsemen (Viking) warriors that have volunteered to a request for help from one of their neighbouring villages. Antonio Banderas' character is an ambassador from Bagdad that has come to this group of warriors to observe their culture and customs (I will let the movie describe the circumstances to his arrival). His timing couldn't have been worse as not long after he joins up with this group of warriors they recieve a request for help. As a result, 13 warriors must volunteer for this mission and by the luck of local customs, the 13th warrior cannot be of Norse decent, which means, Banderas is automatically selected to join them. The rest of the story I will let you see for yourself.The cinematography is absolutely wonderful. The sweeping shots of the land show the ruggedness and mystery of the country and in some cases it feels somewhat like a documentary, which adds to the realism of the story. The beginning of the movie starts out with much of the dialogue spoken in the Norsemen's native language with no subtitles. What is spoken is not of great importance as what you're supposed to observe is the cultural interactions between the warriors. But as Banderas' character is slowly integrated into the plot, the director chooses an absolutely wonderful way of making the transition from the native tongue to english. To me, this was definately one of the creative highlights of the movie. This is one film where I have to stress that the dialogue is very good. I found that every line spoken was of significance to the story and often revealed insight into what the main characters were thinking and feeling. Although Antonio Banderas was billed as the lead actor, he did not dominate the movie. In fact, his charactor had more of a supporting role that was there to document the mission. The movie did a very good job of focusing around the warriors as a group and gave enough attention to each of the main characters to allow the audience to gain an insight into their personalities. The acting was very good. Every character was played very well and definately created an authenticity to them. There is quite a bit of graphic violence so if you are the faint of heart type, you might want to consider a different movie. Despite many of the positives that I've mentioned there are some points that should be noted. This movie does have a religious tone to it so if you are a religious person, keep in mind that you are watching a movie about another culture's take on religion. Also keep in mind that this story is based on a folklore\/legend, which means that not everything is going to make sense. Most of the story does but there are things that don't lend itself to logic but if you pick every little thing out, you will end up ruining the movie. Also, there are some parts of the battle scenes that take place in very dim lighting which make it hard to see but I have a feeling this was done on purpose to add realism. Overall, I found this to be a very gripping and entertaining movie. I also think that Eaters of the Dead would have been a more intriguing title....9\/10.

True, it had two of my favorite actors (Spacey and Jackson), but even their presence did not allay my boredom, since the script was so poor.  This story needed some twists and turns regarding the baddie cops.  By the way, who WERE the baddie cops?!  All the antagonists looked the same to me and no one stood out distinctly as suspects to watch out for when we were supposed to wonder if they could do Danny Roman (Jackson) in.  Maybe they could have had more suspense when they cracked into the computer...or ANYTHING that was original.  Some people compared this to Die Hard.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give Die Hard a 10, because it was exciting and a totally original premise at the time. I gave this a 5, because it is a tepid copy years later when someone should be thinking up something new. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"}]
