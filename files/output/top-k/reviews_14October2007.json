Richard Ward Sturges is not a passenger but he buys a third class ticket off someone else then makes his way up to first class. He has done this because his wife has taken his son and daughter on board the Titanic. Tired of an uncomfortable life among the British upperclasses, Julia Sturges is seeking a normal life for her family back in her native America, and if that means being away from the stiff and very English Richard then so be it. As their marital drama is played out, the Titanic sails on ever faster, with bigger problems just over the horizon for all of the passengers.Many decades before James Cameron delivered Titanic as a disaster movie with a dramatic relationship at its core, someone else had already done it with this 1953 disaster melodrama. The main difference in the narrative is perhaps a note on the difference with our time because the story is not about romantically intertwined young people but rather an older married couple and their romance. Aside from this difference the approach is similar because the majority of the film is a melodrama driven by the characters, which then is fitted into the bigger drama of the ship sinking, taking many with it. Unlike the effects-heavy modern version, this film puts the focus on the family drama happening.This works well in making for an engaging film as we see the very English Richard clashing (in an English way) with the more modern Julia in their relationship. Of course it all comes good in the end (well, in a way) but up till then this centre-piece held my attention well. The emotion during the actual sinking of the ship is well received as well, it is restrained and very much the stiff-upper-lip type of thing of the period. Compared to the manipulative use of music and sweeping expressions of emotions in the remake, I must admit I found the changes in the characters played out with restrained emotions of the disaster. The cast work well with this. Webb is strong in his character, retaining what makes the man while also softening towards the end. Stanwyck does likewise, convincing in her early character but yet able to find the love inside her character from the past. The rest of the cast are solid enough but do not really have the same material as the two leads; Dalton, Aherne, Wagner, Basehart and others are all good enough for what is asked of them and, as normal, Ritter is entertaining in her usual character.Overall then, an engaging melodrama that maintains a very British sense of emotion but yet is still quite moving. Those who have not yet seen the remake for what it is should perhaps take a pass at this and see if they prefer this version for being shorter and more restrained.

Filled with wonderfully funny moments, Goldie Hawn's best performance at the height of her film career, surprising twists and turns in the story line that keeps the audience guessing every moment how Judy Benjamin's lifelong journey will end up, and one of the finest casts of any comedy film ever made. The richly drawn characters of each member of the supporting cast is what helps make this film so memorable and even unique. Eileen Brennan's Captain Lewis is beyond inspired. She is a joy to watch every second she is on the screen. And each member of Judy's army unit - the poor overweight nebbish, the tough girl criminal, the Southern Belle is so perfectly cast and written, that one feels like they know their whole life's story. Then there's Judy's family - upper class Jewish stereotypes made famous by the Borscht Belt comedians - but SO funny! And the eccentric Euro-trash - uh-oh, more stereotypes. But again SO funny. Even though fun is poked at these characters endlessly, they somehow become real people, that the audience cares about - laughs at - but cares about. This is a real credit to the writers of the screenplay and again the great casting. With so much going on, so many characters, so many situations, be it a wedding, a funeral, boot camp, Paris in the Springtime, this film could so easily have become an unwieldy three ring circus. BUT, holding it all together is the magnificent Goldie Hawn, with her unflappable good spirits, her million dollar smile, her Laugh-In Go-Go girl good looks, and her disarming charm. This was a role in a lifetime for Goldie Hawn, and she more than rose to the occasion. She helped create a classic American Film. And oh the priceless moments in the film Captain Lewis' Blue Shower (no one in the audience ever saw that coming); the stoned Campfire chat of the soldiers - notice how it goes from absolute hilarity to that wonderful look of wistfulness on Judy's face; Judy's Turkish Boss' accent; Judy's friends joyful dance to We Are Family; and the intriguing unresolved ending. Haven't we all wondered whatever happened to our beloved Judy Benjamin after she walked down that long forest pathway at the end of the film?

'Dr. No' was, of course, the first feature film based on Ian Fleming's series of novels featuring the suave, womanising British Secret Service Agent, James Bond. Directed by Terence Young, and produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli (the first film in a lengthy partnership), 'Dr. No' made an international superstar of Scottish actor Sean Connery and spawned one of the most lucrative movie franchises in cinematic history. I must admit that, beyond Pierce Brosnan's efforts and last year's excellent 'Casino Royale' with Daniel Craig, I am a complete novice when it comes to Agent 007. I can very vaguely remember seeing 'Dr. No' in my younger years, but about 98% of it had since abandoned my memory, and so watching the film very much remained a fresh experience. The story unfolds in Jamaica, where Bond is sent to investigate the suspicious death of British agent John Strangways (Tim Moxon). The mystery, he discovers, stretches to the feared island of Crab Key, where the formidable villain, Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman), has hatched a fiendish scheme to topple American rockets.Sean Connery is perfect in his signature role, and, according to many, no subsequent actors have been able to surpass him. His rugged facial features and prominent Scottish accent complement the tone and charm of Ian Fleming's literary character, and Connery's characteristic pronunciation of Bond. James Bond has been endlessly imitated ever since, and always with that hint of Scottish drawl about it. However, the character is not all about good looks and charming witticisms; James Bond have been granted a license to kill and he certainly intends to use it. In one scene that caused some controversy on release, Connery shoots a wounded and disarmed henchman in the back, an act of emotion rather than necessity. The titular villain is somewhat low-key, appearing only in the film's final act, but Joseph Wiseman plays him as an intelligent, cool and calculating evil genius. We don't quite understand the greater intentions of Dr. No's rocket-toppling efforts, but at least he doesn't seem interested in destroying the world, which appears to be the primary goal of many of cinema's less intelligent antagonists.Being the first film, 'Dr. No' also set the trend for many of the gimmicks that would become James Bond mainstays. These include the now-iconic James Bond musical theme (composed by Monty Norman and John Barry), the gun-barrel sequence (notably, the shooter is not Connery, but his stunt double Bob Simmons), the highly-stylised opening credits sequence, shaken, not stirred vodka martinis, Bond's Walther PPK, arch-villains, henchman and the terrorist organisation SPECTRE. Oh, yes, and the Bond girls! Though she isn't the first female shown with Connery in the film, Honey Ryder, an independent and beautiful shell-collector, is certainly the most fondly-remembered. She was portrayed by Swiss actress Ursula Andress, though her thick accent meant that her lines were dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl and her singing voice by Diana Coupland. All in all, 'Dr. No' is an excellent spy\/espionage mystery thriller, made even sweeter by the thought that many more hours of 007 adventures await. I just hope that there are more films this good!

However, the character is not all about good looks and charming witticisms; James Bond have been granted a license to kill and he certainly intends to use it. In one scene that caused some controversy on release, Connery shoots a wounded and disarmed henchman in the back, an act of emotion rather than necessity. The titular villain is somewhat low-key, appearing only in the film's final act, but Joseph Wiseman plays him as an intelligent, cool and calculating evil genius. We don't quite understand the greater intentions of Dr. No's rocket-toppling efforts, but at least he doesn't seem interested in destroying the world, which appears to be the primary goal of many of cinema's less intelligent antagonists.Being the first film, 'Dr. No' also set the trend for many of the gimmicks that would become James Bond mainstays. These include the now-iconic James Bond musical theme (composed by Monty Norman and John Barry), the gun-barrel sequence (notably, the shooter is not Connery, but his stunt double Bob Simmons), the highly-stylised opening credits sequence, shaken, not stirred vodka martinis, Bond's Walther PPK, arch-villains, henchman and the terrorist organisation SPECTRE. Oh, yes, and the Bond girls! Though she isn't the first female shown with Connery in the film, Honey Ryder, an independent and beautiful shell-collector, is certainly the most fondly-remembered. She was portrayed by Swiss actress Ursula Andress, though her thick accent meant that her lines were dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl and her singing voice by Diana Coupland. All in all, 'Dr. No' is an excellent spy\/espionage mystery thriller, made even sweeter by the thought that many more hours of 007 adventures await. I just hope that there are more films this good!

'Dr. No' was, of course, the first feature film based on Ian Fleming's series of novels featuring the suave, womanising British Secret Service Agent, James Bond. Directed by Terence Young, and produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli (the first film in a lengthy partnership), 'Dr. No' made an international superstar of Scottish actor Sean Connery and spawned one of the most lucrative movie franchises in cinematic history. I must admit that, beyond Pierce Brosnan's efforts and last year's excellent 'Casino Royale' with Daniel Craig, I am a complete novice when it comes to Agent 007. I can very vaguely remember seeing 'Dr. No' in my younger years, but about 98% of it had since abandoned my memory, and so watching the film very much remained a fresh experience. The story unfolds in Jamaica, where Bond is sent to investigate the suspicious death of British agent John Strangways (Tim Moxon). The mystery, he discovers, stretches to the feared island of Crab Key, where the formidable villain, Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman), has hatched a fiendish scheme to topple American rockets.Sean Connery is perfect in his signature role, and, according to many, no subsequent actors have been able to surpass him. His rugged facial features and prominent Scottish accent complement the tone and charm of Ian Fleming's literary character, and Connery's characteristic pronunciation of Bond. James Bond has been endlessly imitated ever since, and always with that hint of Scottish drawl about it. However, the character is not all about good looks and charming witticisms; James Bond have been granted a license to kill and he certainly intends to use it.

These sorts of movies are comedies for sure, but they add a serious amount of drama and gruesomeness making us wonder if it's OK to laugh with what has been shown. Very bad things is such a comedy but unlike usual I actually love this film for its brilliant mixture of sweet comedy and dramatic horror.The movie has an impressive cast and all actors do a more than fine job. It all starts with Cameron Diaz who only wants to get her perfect wedding, but since this movie is about a bachelor party gone horribly wrong she doesn't get to play the main part. Nevertheless we still get to see pretty much of her and she does an outstanding job as the nervous and obsessive soon-to-be-wife. The only other woman playing an important part is actress Jeanne Tripplehorn who is emotionally steadier, but then again she's not very much involved.The lead roles are all for the men. This dark comedy tends to focus mostly on the incidents during the party and how each of these men tries to deal with its aftermath. They each wanna pick up their lives again afterwards, but not all of them find it so easy to do. It all involves five men actually.The centerpiece of this story is of course the one who's about to get married soon. This character, named Kyle Fisher, is played by actor Jon Favreau who's probably most recognizable for playing an astronaut in the disaster movie Deep impact. Even though he gets dragged into this mess, emotionally he tries to stay away from it as far as possible. He doesn't panic nor relax. Basically he can't believe that this is actually happening. He is your average sweet guy who couldn't cheat on his wife despite the sexy prostitute invited at his own bachelor party.Secondly, there is Kyle's best friend who's a mechanic and doesn't talk an awful lot. He's somewhat weird but in a harmless way. Actor Leland Orser is one of those unknowns who has been in a couple of famous films though. He plays a similar role of a crazed man in Se7en and Alien resurrection.Then there are also two brothers coming along. The first one is played by Jeremy Piven who's virtually been playing nothing but smaller parts in pretty famous movies (such as Heat, Rush hour 2 and Black hawk down) but the most famous of the two brothers is without a doubt actor Daniel Stern (whom we know as one of two clumsy burglars in the first two Home alone-movies.) These brothers seemingly can't stand each other because they are so very different. Jeremy Piven is the one who initiates the tragedy in this movie and Daniel Stern is the one who's constantly in panic worried that the police will find out about their atrocities. The acting performance of the latter one is in fact one of the very best things.Last but certainly not least is the guy who makes sure that the story keeps going forward. He's is the leader of this outfit and makes all the hard decisions even though after a while he seems likely to cross the line indefinitely. The actor playing this ever self-confident character is Christian Slater and of all the men in this movie, he is easily the most popular one. Slater was the pupil of Sean Connery in The name of the rose back in 1986, played at the side of Kevin Costner in the 1991-romantic adventure film Robin Hood Prince of thieves and even got himself the main part in the marvelous cult-classic True romance which was written by Quentin Tarantino himself. His acting is not only top-notch and the best thing in this movie, but it's also quite possibly his finest performance ever!In short A very funny yet at times pretty disturbing dark comedy with a colorful cast to say the least.

It was pretty surprising to see how closely the film followed real events in the life of The Kid, born Henry McCarty in New York City's Lower East Side in 1859. All the business with John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) and Alex McSween (Terry O'Quinn) is based in fact, although the real name of the Jack Palance character was Jimmy Dolan. He was a real life businessman (read that town boss of Lincoln County) who was challenged by Tunstall for rights to government contracts at Fort Stanton in the New Mexico Territory. Dolan headquartered his 'Company' at an establishment named the House of Murphy, hence the name Lawrence G. Murphy used in the picture. The ensuing Lincoln County Wars, often depicted as a range war, was in fact a mercantile war fought essentially over the right of one faction to make more money than the other.I've often wondered whether the real life Billy would have been as maniacal as the way he was portrayed by Emilio Estevez. I would almost think so, but with the kind of charisma that made him entirely likable as a person to those who knew him well and called him friend. Estevez, along with his brat pack buddies have an engaging chemistry on screen, even if most of it is spent dispatching members of Murphy's thugs. If not for Estevez's pacing of the character, the tone of the film would have been entirely different, as most of the men gunned down in the course of the story were simply murdered to avenge the death of Tunstall.My favorite scene had to do with the gunslinger in the saloon who Billy mocked into a gun-down. I'd consider that one of the fictional elements thrown into the story to highlight just how duplicitous the real life Kid could be. Did you notice how the gang reacted instinctively to back up their leader just in case?I'm not as familiar with the sequel to Young Guns as the original. Both were written by John Fusco, so I'd expect that the continuity relative to historical accuracy is similarly maintained. Over forty films have been made about the legend of Billy the Kid, along with the blatantly contrived two season TV Western The Tall Man from the early 1960's. Your best bet apart from the documentary mentioned earlier, while maintaining an element of entertainment, would be tuning into Young Guns.

Then they find three aliens (Mathilda May, Chris Jagger & Bill Malin) in Cocoons cases, which they looked dead and they are human looking as well in suspending animation!

Which the Churchill ship got caught on fire but these three Alien cases are still intact. NASA brings back the cases with them back to Earth in the UK. Which they are brought to a scientific government building in London, England. The true disaster starts, when the female alien (May) awakening from the building. She starts sucking the life of various people, she meets. Along with the two male aliens as well. While the UK Gouverment doesn't know why the aliens are doing this until an mysterious American astronaut Carlson (Steve Railsback). Who escape from the space shuttle and he has an strange connection with the female alien.Directed by Tobe Hooper (Invaders from Mars 1986, Poltergeist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) brings a stylish, sci-fi thriller, that is absolutely crazy and overpowering. Which this film is based on a novel by Colin Wilson. The original novel was titled The Space Vampires. Also that the now defecting Cannon Films nearly went with the original title. It was also their biggest budgeted film to date at $25 million. Probably the main problem with Lifeforce, it doesn't know what kind of picture, it wants to be. Which it's beings well as a adventure, then an alien-invasion thriller and a apocalyptic end of the world story! Which it's tries to have it three ways but that kind of mentally for this ambitious project doesn't always pay off. Well designed special effects by Oscar-WinnerJohn Dykstra (Spider-Man, Star Wars, Staurt Little) are one of the best things in this film.DVD has an good non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer and an fine digitally remasteredDolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which this version is the original European version that adds fifteen minutes of additional footage. DVD also has the original theatrical trailer and an collector's booklet. Probably the most memorable thing of Lifeforce is the talented people, who worked behind the camera than the movie. Like the special effects people, make-up effects crew, terrific music score by the four time Oscar-WinnerHerny Mancini (The Great Mouse Detective, The Pink Panther, Switch) and Alan Hume's excellent widescreen cinematography (A View to a Kill, Return of the Jedi, A Fish Called Wanda).Lifeforce is a very flawed movie but an fascinating one. The film beings well but once the second act kicks in, the unintentional laughs starts. The movie has an sense of humour but not always in the right moments. Railsback's performance is good but when he starts dreaming about the female alien and feeling what's she doing. It is just laugh-out silly, his dialogue doesn't help and director Hooper seems that he let his lead actor goes way over the top in several rather tense moments. Hooper's British cast are first-rate here, especially Peter Firth, Frank Finlay and Patrick Stewart. One of the reasons why Lifeforce is a cult classic is May's presence. Which she plays her alien femme fatale extremely well and her naked body is well... extraordinary to be sure.Before Lifeforce was release. The US Version got re-edited and it doesn't look as good as the European Version. The Zombie Vampires sequence is set-up earlier in the US Version and it had additional music cues of the late Michael Kamen (The Dead Zone, Event Horizon, Open Range) in the key moments of the US Theatrical Cut. The American Cut is actually shorter and it runs 101 minutes. While the European version runs 116 minutes. Tobe Hooper's original cut was 128 minutes and it will probably never see the light of day. The picture has some arresting visual effects moments and i love the final special effect shot of the movie.Lifeforce is a mess but it's aspiring entertaining film. For all it's flaws, this box-office failure is certainly worth a second chance. If Lifeforce got remade today, it would be the perfect opportunity to remake it as soon as possible. But this picture got mixed reviews, when it was first release in 1985 and probably Hooper was never satisfied with the final product. I am sure, he was happier with the European cut. Hooper's promising career was never the same after Lifeforce. Especially he made two more movies for Cannon Films Invaders from Mars remake and the wildly, outrageous black comedy\/horror film The Texas Chainsaw Masscare Part 2. Although the TCM sequel was the more successful of the three movies for Cannon Films. Lifeforce is a wildly creative picture but it's just what audiences were not looking in 1985. Terry Gilliam's Brazil is probably the most Bizarre movies of the 1980's and Lifeforce is one of them for different reasons. Certainly worth a look.

The interaction between the 2 as they make their way along a dangerous river in a beat up little steam powered boat named African Queen, all the while trying to avoid Nazi forces, is absolutely unforgettable. It's one of those movies that sucks you in and won't let go until the final scene rolls and the screen fades to black. Of course, how many movies did Bogey make that have an identical affect?...

African Queen was probably one of the first Bogart movie that I ever saw and I was simply mesmerized by his and Katherine Hepburn's portrayals of a hard drinking roustabout teamed up with a prim and proper lady. The interaction between the 2 as they make their way along a dangerous river in a beat up little steam powered boat named African Queen, all the while trying to avoid Nazi forces, is absolutely unforgettable. It's one of those movies that sucks you in and won't let go until the final scene rolls and the screen fades to black. Of course, how many movies did Bogey make that have an identical affect?... Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, To have or Have Not, Dark Passage... and the list goes on.
