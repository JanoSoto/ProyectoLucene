I remember watching it with my mother in the Theatres when it debut, she was as entranced as I was by the whole thing. The music was delightful, the characters were fun, the animation gorgeous, and the tale simply timeless. However, as I grew older, the true magic of this film began to fade behind walls of cynicism, and it only got worse as I grew older. I completely forgot about this movie over time, until one day, over ten years since the last time I sat down to watch it with my mother, I found my old VHS of Beauty and the Beast. I decided I'd sit down and watch it; after all, all my work for the day was already done. Might as well pop it in as I got ready to hit the sack.I was enthralled by what I saw; this movie is simply delightful. The characters are surprisingly complex for a Disney film. The Romance between the films two main characters is well realized and is achieved with the perfect balance of campiness and subtly, through both small moments which are rather clever, and not exactly something a child would pick up on; and lovely musical numbers in which the characters sing their hearts out to us in true Broadway fashion. This is much preferable to the generic formula of magic kiss\/love at first sight we've grown to expect from fairy tales, and the fact that the characters actual have a real relationship with pitfalls adds a lot of appeal for the movie's older audience. In fact, of all Disney's animated films, this one is the most mature. The two primary characters, Belle and the Beast, are wonderfully three dimensional, as is their relationship. Belle, is quite unlike the typical Disney female, in that she seems more womanly and less blandly asexual, and overall is a much better realized character than those Disney heroine's which came before (or after) her. She's quite modernized when compared to Cocteau's version of the story (read She's a feminist); The idea however is very well realized, and the end result is one of Disney's best characters to date. The same thing could be said of the other films star; The Beast, who also boasts an... um... interesting design.Even the supporting characters are interesting, and quite hilarious, especially the suave-talking Lumiere, his musical number is among the best in the film, and Orbach's performance is fantastic. Unlike many other Disney movies, these supporting characters are well integrated into the film and don't feel like tacky add ons; they have part in the Beast's plight, and try to help him win over Belle for their own benefit. Though they provide fantastic comic relief, they fit into the film well enough that they aren't annoying, unlike some other Comic relief characters. (Timon & Pumbaa)While the film is an interpretation of an age old story, it's simply so well done that it doesn't seem like another mindless fairy tale simply devised to instill morals into our children. The moral message in this movie while quite obvious, is never stated or overdone, thus increasing it's effectiveness tenfold, and even though the tale is as old as time, Disney's has taken given the story a unique twist, through such additions such as the Handsome villain, Gaston, who just so happens to share all the qualities of a beast, something which deviates from the formula typical of this sort of story. This richness extends to every part of the film; from the romance, to the comedic elements. Unlike so many films which appeal to all age, the children's comedy in this movie is never overly stupid, and rather than interject out of place sexual innuendo to appeal to older viewers, the mature comedy in this film is often more involved and poetic (An example would be the comical exaggeration of the films villain, Gaston's manliness in literally every way.), or Belle\/The Beast's facial expressions during certain scenes. The comedy fits into the film so well that it never seems contrived at all, which is a welcome change.The films musical score is no doubt one of it's greatest strengths (Though it has no real weaknesses in the first place). The background music is extremely well written and a pleasure to listen too, as are the Broadway numbers. This is no doubt Menken and Ashman's finest work for Disney; there isn't a weak track in the whole bunch. Aesthetically the movie is simply beautiful; the gorgeous hand drawn images don't look the least bit dated, and the colors are vivid and vibrant. The artwork is also incredibly detailed; and the characters faces portray a fast array of emotions throughout the film. Belle herself expresses at least ten different feelings without the use of words, which isn't typical of animation and is once again a prime example of what makes this film a classic.In summation, this movie is well made on all fronts, and clich√© as it may sound, the movie truly is a timeless classic that really has that Disney Magic which is so often referenced. In the end, the wonderful characters, beautiful animation, incredible original score and unusually smart scripting come together to create a great film, by any standard. Quite possibly, the greatest animated movie ever created, and I've no doubt that if you give it a watch, you too will fall under it's enchantment.

Just reading here a few pages of commentaries one can see how different people's reactions are to it, some people loathe it with a passion that is fascinating to me, I, who love it with delirium.Going over some reviews and comments from the sixties, you can find people who have seen the movie hundreds of times and their conclusion is that it's because it really helps their psyche in a similar way that a therapy would. Indeed, I'd say a 99,99% of the people who adore the Sound of Music don't find the words to express or understand the reason. But obviously, they keep on watching over and over because there is a positive essence that affects them in a nurturing way. The movie brings into spotlight purity and happiness as something totally possible and independent of personal circumstances. One can see in Maria, as Julie Andrews herself said, the person you'd like to be if things wouldn't be so rough in their own lives. Maybe that is why Julie's performance in the movie is timeless and fresh so sincere and real, she really *wanted* to be Maria.As a big fan of the movie, I've found myself seriously reflecting upon one question. Does it deserve the place it has in my heart as the best movie ever? I am torn at the question, because I find myself comparing it to something so disparagingly as Citizen Kane, the movie that is heralded by most critics circles and serious polls as the greatest movie ever. Yes, Citizen Kane is perfect and genius from a technical point of view. Cinematography and photography are flawless. But it's a shallow classic even if it's perfect. As Ebert said in his comments to the movie, the appeal of the story is to the interest of people in gossiping and intruding in the lives of the famous. So the heart of the best movie of all times is this? This is what is represented by the Number one movie humankind has produced? Deep question indeed. Maybe I take it too seriously, but truth is I really love arts and I think they should be taken seriously cause they are some of the few things that will survive long after we all are gone.Now, although it's a completely different genre, the Sound of Music is Art. It's the movie that contains the most perfect balance of beauty I have ever found in any other film. The beauty of the soul of Maria, the positive ethics the story has, the joy that is underneath has nothing of sugary as many shallowly purport, but instead it's a soundless song by itself. The lovely and simple score with it's unforgettable songs is just natural because so much energy and youth as it is transmitted by the movie cannot be contained and bursts out naturally. The scenery of Austria gives the beauty a character and truthfulness. It's like a master painting that transmits and communicates directly even with the less sophisticated of the spectators and manage to make a direct bridge with their heart.The script is what keeps it all together, while it's not complex it is not superficial, it has humor, irony, and fast paced wit.It all put together seamlessly makes up for, what for me personally, is the greatest movie of all time. If indeed in one thousand years nothing is left of humankind, maybe The Sound of Music would by itself be a testimony of what is the best of the human spirit.

True, this 1972 collection of extremely lewd skits isn't quite as impressive and thought-provoking as some of Allen's best works, like 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' or for that matter even the follow-up 'Sleeper'; yet there's an energy to 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know' that Allen has not shown for at least a decade, and in that light it's still entirely classic.If anything, the film is closest in its spirit to early Allen films like 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper', but it actually feels more like a British comedy, and is clearly influenced by shows like 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and 'The Benny Hill Show', in it's chaotic and rude humor. Still, Allen's mark is all over the skits, even when he isn't in them. One of the best of the bunch, in fact, is the skit titled 'What Is Sodomy', which stars Gene Wilder. Influences of both Monty Python and Mel Brooks can be felt in it, but it's entirely Allen; and still, it's Wilder that makes it perfect. Even more Pythonish is the fabricated game-show 'What's Your Perversion'.The best and most memorable is the last skit, entitled 'What Happens During Ejaculation', in which Allen does a wonderful portrayal of a sperm, and we catch a glimpse of the action in the control room of a man's body during sexual intercourse. The skit is brilliantly satirical and ranks with Allen's best moments, nearly overshadowing the rest of the film. Still, it's not without it's unforgettable moments; other than Wilder, also worthy of special praise is John Carradine who is wonderful as the ultimate parody of a mad scientist, and let's not forget Woody Allen as a fool in the Middle Ages misquoting Hamlet and getting his hand stuck up the Queen's chastity belt, and his wonderful performance as an Italian Casanova.So no, it's not quite one of Allen's best films, but it's close. The humor is dirty, yes, but not childish; Allen's intelligence is there, but it's much lighter than 'Annie Hall' or other classics, and like a Monty Python or a Mel Brooks it bears multiple viewings. A movie that's funny as hell, essential for Allen fans, and recommended for all.

True, this 1972 collection of extremely lewd skits isn't quite as impressive and thought-provoking as some of Allen's best works, like 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' or for that matter even the follow-up 'Sleeper'; yet there's an energy to 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know' that Allen has not shown for at least a decade, and in that light it's still entirely classic.If anything, the film is closest in its spirit to early Allen films like 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper', but it actually feels more like a British comedy, and is clearly influenced by shows like 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and 'The Benny Hill Show', in it's chaotic and rude humor. Still, Allen's mark is all over the skits, even when he isn't in them. One of the best of the bunch, in fact, is the skit titled 'What Is Sodomy', which stars Gene Wilder. Influences of both Monty Python and Mel Brooks can be felt in it, but it's entirely Allen; and still, it's Wilder that makes it perfect. Even more Pythonish is the fabricated game-show 'What's Your Perversion'.The best and most memorable is the last skit, entitled 'What Happens During Ejaculation', in which Allen does a wonderful portrayal of a sperm, and we catch a glimpse of the action in the control room of a man's body during sexual intercourse. The skit is brilliantly satirical and ranks with Allen's best moments, nearly overshadowing the rest of the film. Still, it's not without it's unforgettable moments; other than Wilder, also worthy of special praise is John Carradine who is wonderful as the ultimate parody of a mad scientist, and let's not forget Woody Allen as a fool in the Middle Ages misquoting Hamlet and getting his hand stuck up the Queen's chastity belt, and his wonderful performance as an Italian Casanova.So no, it's not quite one of Allen's best films, but it's close. The humor is dirty, yes, but not childish; Allen's intelligence is there, but it's much lighter than 'Annie Hall' or other classics, and like a Monty Python or a Mel Brooks it bears multiple viewings. A movie that's funny as hell, essential for Allen fans, and recommended for all.

Wallace was a moderately religious man and attempted to debate Ingersoll. The story has it that Ingersoll whipped him to a frazzle and Wallace knew it. But he resolved to study the Bible and learn about his faith so that he would be better prepared.He never got to debate Ingersoll again, but Wallace got so immersed in religion that he decided to put that knowledge to use. While he was Territorial Governor of New Mexico and while he wasn't dealing with the Lincoln County War and the hunting down of Billy the Kid, he spent his spare time creating what became the widest selling work of fiction in his century, Ben-Hur, A Tale of the Christ.He did his research well. Judah Ben-Hur and his mother and sister are descended from a very ancient family of Hebrew nobility. The founder of this house was Hur who in the Bible was the husband of Miriam who was Moses's sister. Hur pops up as a peripheral character during the whole story of the Exodus. He invested the characters that Charlton Heston, Martha Scott, and Cathy O'Donnell play with a heroic lineage which makes their fall all the more tragic.So on the consciousness of the public were the Hur family that one often thinks of them as real people. Case in point, many years ago a teacher of mine wanted to demonstrate how many true characters Charlton Heston played on the screen. I count 15 in his list of credits on IMDb, some he's played in more than one film or television show. Inevitably more than just one person named Ben-Hur as a real character. A tribute to the timelessness of the character and to Charlton Heston's abilities as actor.The story is that Heston and his family greet an old friend newly arrived back in Judea province, Messala who is now a tribune. Messala played by Stephen Boyd, is one ambitious fellow and he wants Heston to rat out potential leaders of rebellion in this most unruly of Roman provinces. Heston refuses.The next day Boyd frames an incident where a piece of old tile accidentally falls from the Hur family home while the new Judean governor is passing by into an assassination attempt. Scott and O'Donnell are thrown in prison and Heston is sentenced to the galleys. The story is then Ben-Hur's adventures in trying to get back to Judea and set things right.Ben-Hur meets a whole host of people who aid him in his endeavor. Jack Hawkins as a commander of the galley fleet he's serving on, Finlay Currie as Balthazar one of the Three Wise Men now seeking the child whose birth he witnessed in the year Anno Domini, Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim whose horses Ben-Hur races.It's not often mentioned, but among the Oscars collected for this most honored film, besides the ones that the film itself, Wyler, and Heston won, was Hugh Griffith's for Best Supporting Actor. His Arab sheik is a blustering, but very wise and compassionate fellow. The events of this film are taking place some six centuries before the Prophet Mohammed arrived on the scene. The Arab people at that time were involved in a hedonistic animist kind of religion, but it's left up in the air that they might turn Christian. Certainly some of them did and some are Christian to this day as the country of Lebanon attests.Griffith had the wildest pair of eyes in film history next to Jack Elam's and he used them to great effect. Watch his expressions during the film, they're what got him the Oscar.Stephen Boyd also got rave notices for the evil Messala. When he's not stepping on people to move up in Roman politics, Messala likes to race chariots. During his odyssey Ben-Hur becomes a charioteer and the climax of the film is the thrilling chariot race that turns into a race for survival. You'll see in the film, Messala doesn't exactly play by Marquis of Queensbury rules for charioteers. Boyd did some leads after Ben-Hur, but never really took as a hero. But he was one grand villain.While Ben-Hur is a prisoner being led to the galleys the Roman prison convoy stops in a town called Nazareth and a carpenter faces down a Roman guard to give the thirsting Ben-Hur a drink of water. The two men go their separate ways, Ben-Hur's is described in the book by Lew Wallace, the carpenter's way in the first four books of the New Testament. Later on after Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister and what's become of them, they hear about Jesus of Nazareth, a rabbi with a message of hope and reputation for miracles. Of course when they seek Jesus it's when He's just been tried and condemned and on the way to the cross. It's now Ben-Hur's turn to offer the carpenter a drink of water on the way, to show his trust and faith. And as the sky darkens and Jesus breathes his last, the film depicts what the New Testament describes as the blackest day in Earth's history. But even at that point Heston's new found faith is rewarded, a miracle at the point of death. What was the miracle, for that you buy the DVD or wait until Ben-Hur is on television.Ben-Hur should really be seen in a theater, even a letter box version doesn't do justice to the chariot race or the sea battle with pirates.Ben-Hur is the story of two paths, one of vengeance and one of faith. Our protagonist tries his way and in the end realizes the path of faith is the more rewarding.

The cinematography is sweeping in it beauty (not unlike other films from its day such as the Sound of Music) and the actors were talented but the love story was so simplified that it lacked the emotional depth needed to give the characters arcs or even elicit sympathy. Such is the stuff that fluff is made.Another disappointing aspect of this film was it's award winning score. The short dominating theme (which can be heard in its entirety as the DVD menu music) reoccurs every time the star crossed lovers met or are about to meet. The variations on the theme are not well developed so we hear the same 30 seconds of mandolin music again, and again and again. Out of all of the Academy's nominations in 1965 for Substantially Original Musical Score (which included Alex North's brilliant work Agony and the Ecstasy-- Alfred Newman's awe-inspiring Greatest Story Ever Told and what many consider to be the finest musical ever filmed Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg) this was the least deserving of an Oscar. I would have awarded Frank DeVol the prize for Cat Balou (also nominated) before I would have given it to Maurice Jarre for this score. After finally seeing the film--and being so disappointed--i looked into the history of the movie to discover why this is such a well-known work, and here is what i discovered Dr Zhivago was a epic book by Boris Pasternak that was truncated for the movie stripping it of many layers of meaning. As a film it was not critically acclaimed--in fact the reviews were so bad that David Lean swore he would never make another movie again (and he didn't for almost 20 years until Passage to India). But the public loved it. Dr. Zhivago made more money, up until that point in time, than all of David Lean's previous films combined. Dr Zhavago was an anti-communist film made during the cold war (probably not an unpopular position) during an era of greater sexual repression. So a movie made in 1965 about a cheating man whose pride and extra-marital affair trumps his concern for his child and wife could--in its time--be seen as romanticized heroism. But not from many people's point of view today. The movie isn't even erotic--just shallow, slow and sad.Dr Zhavago is more comparable to Titanic (which is superior musically and artistically) than it would be to a truly great epic such as Lawrence of Arabia or The Bridge on the River Kwai.

Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back. With the new sheriff not due for a day, he just can't let go of the extraordinary sense of duty and responsibility he feels towards his town. However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose history with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces. There's nothing else to say - if you haven't already, go out and see this film NOW!

However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose history with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces.

Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back.

To see that colossal Imperial star-ship growing out of the screen until the front is in middle distance whilst the complete fuselage is not yet made visible, was to see science fiction and fantasy changed for ever. Instead of being the poor nephew of production, overnight it became the new box-office spectacle.The first 2 minutes alone were worth the price of the whole movie. And indeed; 30 years on, they still are.CGI effects have taken over as the preferred medium of invention, and there is certainly a place for that technique too. But ineptly done they are no more plausible than stop-go latex. It is possible to create more features and movement with them, but whether or not they're necessary is debatable. Later offerings seem overblown. There's just a bit too much of everything. Well-made models and micro-cameras have a realism and substance that computer technology has yet to replicate.Consider the robots R2D2 and C3PO. The latter was a real person dressed up to look and act like a robot. Even R2D2 sometimes contained a small actor at times. Once again, they have a presence on the set that CGI robots lack. Compare them with those of 'I Robot' and you will see what I mean.I could go on, but there's no need. This movie has it all. A hero rescuing a heroine, good versus evil, one of the greatest baddies of all time with the most spectacular entr√©e imaginable, title music as rousing as any national anthem...

","genre":"Biography, Drama, War"},{"date":"16 April 2006","score":"","review":" In early 1943, a battalion of British POWs from Singapore, led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), arrive at a Japanese camp along the Kwai River in Thailand, which is commanded by Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), a brutal martinet who is determined to build a bridge across the river by May. Trouble is, Nicholson refuses to cooperate due to Saito's demand that his officers do manual labor (contrary to the Geneva Convention, of which Nicholson just happens to have a copy), and while he and his officers languish in confinement, the bridge construction goes poorly, and eventually Saito reluctantly gives into Nicholson's demands. Despite his victory, Nicholson orders his troops to build the best bridge possible - to the total bafflement of Major Clipton (James Donald), the surgeon who wonders whether Nicholson is being a good soldier or collaborating with the enemy. Meanwhile, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), a prison at Saito's camp, escapes and is rescued by British soldiers. Recuperating in Ceylon, he is recruited by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) to join him and a wimpy Canadian commando (Geoffrey Horne) to go on a raid to destroy same bridge, forcing Shears to join them by threatening to reveal the truth about his rank. It all builds to a climax involving all of the above-mentioned characters, the bridge, a crap-load of plastic explosive, and a Japanese troop train.Ignore the fact that this movie is historically inaccurate; the film makers never claimed it to be a true depiction of what happened on the Kwai River. This is simply an amazing movie all around, a potent anti-war film and intriguing character study by David Lean, making the first of his epic films and showing no signs of growing pains at making the transition from romantic comedies (Brief Encounter) and Dickens adaptations (Oliver Twist) to an epic scale.Sir Alec Guinness gives what has to be the best performance of his career as Nicholson. His character is a martinet who believes that all rules must be followed to the T; his refusal to cooperate with Saito is based on that point alone. He forbids escape attempts because his men were ordered to surrender, and he fears it may get him into trouble with his superiors (if I were a prisoner, that would be the least of my worries). When he wins his battle with Saito, he proceeds to actually make his men work harder towards their goal. When Clipton calls him on this, Nicholson justifies his activities by saying it is his code of professionalism. Nicholson is not a likable or sympathetic character (except towards the very end, as he reflects on his life as a soldier), but he is an undoubtedly fascinating one. Rarely was an Oscar more justly won than Guinness's for this film.On the other end, Sessue Hayakawa is excellent as Saito. Though initially depicted as bombastic and cruel, Saito actually comes across as much more sympathetic than Nicholson. He treats his prisoners reasonably well, and it's hard not to feel sorry for him - after all, if the bridge is not ready in time, he will have to commit sepuku. It is to Hayakawa's credit that he takes what was a caricature in the novel, and makes him into a sympathetic human being. How he didn't win an Oscar for this is beyond me.William Holden is an old hand at the POW genre, having recently been involved in Stalag 17, and he is full of his usual swagger and cynicism as Shears, the American who initially tries to get out of fighting but is a hero when the chips are down. Some have complained that Shears (who was British in the novel) was American, but to them I say what's your point? Shears' characterization in the movie works a lot better than in the book, because it allows for his independent Yankee spirit to clash with Major Warden's all-too-familiar (in this film) British martinetism (not that that's a word or anything). Jack Hawkins is wonderful as Warden, and he and Holden have great chemistry together. James Donald is also solid as Clipton, and Andre Morrel and Geoffrey Horne do good work in their smaller parts.Lean's direction is solid. Though not quite on a par with his later achievements of Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago (we suspect because of the lack of Freddie Young behind the camera), we still get some amazing sights the endless jungles of Siam; the bat stampede during a skirmish with Japanese patrols; and the climax, which is drawn out over thirty minutes but never lets up with the tension. Malcolm Arnold's score (other than the ubiquitous Colonel Bogey March), on the other hand, is unmemorable for the most part.That minor complaint aside, Kwai deserves all of the recognition it gets, and then some. The only WWII movies that even come close to this are Saving Private Ryan and The Guns of Navarone. And the amazing thing is this film was in essence just a warm up for Lean's greatest achievement Lawrence of Arabia. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2006","score":"","review":" In early 1943, a battalion of British POWs from Singapore, led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), arrive at a Japanese camp along the Kwai River in Thailand, which is commanded by Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), a brutal martinet who is determined to build a bridge across the river by May.

Its a great tale of epic battles and one young mans crusade through the military ranks. The film shares many similarities, but has jettisoned the 'skinnies', a race of subhumans who are also at war with humanity. The film focuses on the war between humanity and the bugs, a race of spider like creatures living many miles away. Because of this streamlining, the film is a modern classic. Cut into two parts (training and fighting) Starship Troopers deserved much more than the feeble US gross it achieved.Starring a bunch of relative unknowns, this is a bombastic action epic that batters the senses with fantastic images of war torn landscapes and huge warships. Casper Van Dien is Johnnie Rico, the square jawed hero, Denise Richards his beautiful girlfriend Carmen who wants to be a pilot, Dina Meyer the girl with the huge crush on Johnnie and Doggie Howser the hilarious scientist with the even more hilarious quavering eyebrows. Michael Ironside is the metallic armed teacher cum warrior who watches over Rico at the beginning and then end of the movie. And there is also a dashing young pilot who wants to steal Carmens heart.....Yes thats right, Starship Troopers copies the Titanic method of plonking a love story onto the back of the epic storyline. However, Rico and Carmens romance is short lived as they part ways, so it doesn't put a dampener on the film.Rico and his buddies are put through a rigorous training regime by the improbably named Clancy Brown. Training involves showering in a giant unisex shower, having your hand stapled to a wall by a knife and being shot by cardboard laser firing soldiers. Rico causes the death of a fellow pupil, threatens to walk out, yadda yadda yadda. Carmen is off learning how to fly her giant spaceship while Doggie Howser feeds a cow to one of the bugs. This first half of the film is great fun as it builds up the characters. None of them are especially great at acting, and Casper Van Diens jaw does seem to do most of the acting in his scenes. However, its when the evil bugs destroy Buenos Airies that things get nasty.Yes thats right- Buenos Airies. One element from the book that didn't need to be kept. None of the people in the film speak Argentinian yet when that city is destroyed everybody gets angry and goes off to war.The first battle scene is spectacular. The giant spaceships hover in space being pummelled by giant bursts of sticky blue emissions that appear to be coming out of some giant bugs bum-holes. Dropships take the troops down to the planet, and then the troops meet the bugs (but not until they have fired miniature nuclear weapons at targets no less than a hundred meters away). The humans get slaughtered by 'superior tactics' which translates as the bugs simply having more legs than us humans. The humans reply by invading the exterior planets of the bugs solar system, and an incredible last stand style battle in an abandoned fortress is the highlight of the film. Giant tank bugs fire well, fire at the fortress while millions of bugs charge towards the fortress and then STAND STILL. Up above flying green bugs manage to decapitate half of the infantry while Johnnie Rico single handedly kills the bugs, fixes the radio system, pulls half of his commanding officer out of the mouth of a tank bug, causes the death of Dina Meyers character and shoots one of the flying bugs in such a way that it crashes into the admiral of the fortress.....yes this is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and its all the better for it. Other noteworthy things to mention follow- Jake Busey plays Ace, a character who seems to always have his eyes shut to a squint. Rico jumps on the back of a tank bug and defies gravity by being able to stand on it without support, fire into the bugs back, drop a grenade into the bug, jump off and survive without barely a scratch. All of this takes place while the bug is moving at around fifty miles an hour. Doggie Howser catches a gigantic brain bug, the captain of Carmens ship is cut in half BY A DOOR, a man has his brain sucked out of his head by a bug with a straw.....Starship Troopers contains some of the best special effects ever devised. The spaceships are perfectly realised and the bugs are lifelike. The shot of hundreds of bugs converging on the abandoned fortress is mesmerising, as is Casper Van Diens jaw. There is humour, with a cameraman taping one of the battles and then being ripped apart. An Asian officer attempts to beat the entire bug army on his own, Michael Ironside loses his legs. Its all fun, as is the movie.One thing is never really explained. WHY are we fighting the bugs? The bugs planet is able to shoot giant asteroids towards Earth because of its 'gravity well.' What does this have to do with the bugs? When the humans invade the infamous Planet P, they capture a brain bug to find out why the bugs fight. They fight because we have declared war on them! A minor gripe yes, but surely something could have been done about our motives for this war.A great film with fantastic effects. its just a shame that it wasn't a bigger hit, and that it inspired the mediocre sequel.

I strongly recommend this to anyone who loves this genre, but I doubt anyone will read this..This film, is just a lost masterpiece from my point of view...

Chris Reeves plays a playwright, Richard Collier, who decides to spend a few nights of 1979 in a really, really old hotel on Lake Michigan. There, while browsing through a little historical exhibit, he is suddenly stricken by a divine portrait of 'Elise McKenna', an actress of the stage, the portrait dating 1912. In what could be described as one of the most melodramatic moments in color cinema, he approaches the portrait eyes bulging out in awe, all synced to the roaring melodies of Rachmoninoff's Rhapsody on the Theme of Paganini. After this, the movie quickly moves to where he attempts to hypnotize himself into thinking that IT IS 1912!!! YOU BELIEVE IT!!!! Of course, when he wakes up from his trance, he is in a room, circa 1912. Why does Richard do this? He desperately wants to meet Elise McKenna, who is staying there while she performs at the hotel theater. He is obsessed, to say the least.Act II starts out very well, with sly bits of movie time-traveling gimmicks. But as soon as Elise McKenna enters the film, it's downhill from there. We get involved in a subplot with Elise's manager, Mr. Robinson, who also is an oddity, nevertheless portrayed fantastically by Christopher Plummer. But his whole meaning is just a big mystery the movie never solves. The screenwriter obviously was trying to fill in Act II so they could make it a feature length film. Nearing the end of Act II, you can feel the screenwriter getting tired of trying to fill up screen time, so he has Elise and Richard have sex and then their romance is torn apart so as to end the movie and begin the sentimental tissue grabbing. And it does. The morning after, they are playing around uttering extremely stupid, flimsy dialogue. Then Reeves puts on his old suit for fun, but accidentally takes out a 1979 PENNY!!!!! OOOPS! 1912 fades away, with Elise screaming, RICHARD!, and he comes back sprawled on the floor of a 1979 room. Awww, darn! Now THAT was not a lucky penny! The movie fizzles out, and Richard dies from grief. I can kind of feel his pain were you ever suddenly woken from a really beautiful dream because some jerk roared past your house with the Black Eyed Peas blaring from his stereo? Now besides being a feast of melodrama and disappointing resolutions, Somewhere in Time has a few bright points. Arthur the old hotel guy is a great character, both in 1912 and in 1979. The guest registration book was a good bit. Sometimes the gauzy, painted cinematography worked, and the costumes were great. But other than that, Somewhere in Time was a time-waster. The set-up was just too good for the resolution. You want to rewind it and watch Chris Reeves meet Elise all over again. If you want a really good time-travel movie, rent Back to the Future. It makes Somewhere in Time look like cinematic molasses.
