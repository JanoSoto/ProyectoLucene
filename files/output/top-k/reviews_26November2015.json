In many moments, it seems to echo its previous instalments, but with a lesser sense of wonder and escapism that Star Wars first wowed audiences with, and which Empire improved upon. There is another intergalactic band entertaining at Jabba's palace, but although the design and costuming of the aliens is creative and often unique, the derivative jazz song is not nearly as memorable as the Cantina Band theme. In Tattoine we had endless deserts, twin suns, houses submerged blow ground to avoid the heat, sand creatures and scavengers roaming the cliffs...here we have a impressive looking sail barge and an imposing creature in the dirt, but it does not feel entirely otherworldly, and the conflict and threat (specifically the iconic Boba Fett) are quickly extinguished, and it does not feel nearly as engaging as the Battle on Hoth. I point to a different little moment that expresses the world of Star Wars more effectively; as Jabba's rancor beast is killed, its handler emerges and sobs at this personal loss, and this is something which we can all identify with, and speaks volumes of the depth of Lucas' universe. The technical accomplishments remain, and are even crisper in the last of the trilogy. There are three particularly stunning matte painting backgrounds; Jabba's palace jutting out from the rocky cliff as one sun is already half submerged, the legions of stormtroopers saluting the Emperor's first live appearance as the Imperial theme blasts, and the last shots of the Ewok's treetop village huts where spots of light and celebration sing of the Empire's defeat. Jabba's costume is amongst the most impressive of them all; an immense animatronic puppet which took six people each controlling a different segment of the body and whom booms in a deep guttural Huttese. The various fighter jets, pod- racer and star destroyer miniatures are likewise lovingly crafted and detailed; some of these bluescreen backdrops create the most immersive and chaotic space battles yet in the series. The problem lies not in those areas but issues in the story. Star Wars, for the immense achievement that it was, was more an intro to the world and did not delve too deeply into the Darth Vader narrative, or the peril of the galaxy, and it was up to Empire to establish those strands. It perhaps left too much for RoTJ to lift; there are blocks of time in the film where characters will simply bring us back to speed and talk at length of the next plot development. Obi-Wan's ghost is conveniently informative (and the mention of the thematic relevance of point of view is not quite as bad as the infamous line in the prequels, but still slightly shallow), as is Yoda, who proclaims Luke battle-ready immediately after he returns to complete his training, and the reveal of the siblings is painfully drawn out, which perhaps exposes a small weakness of the dramatic acting of the main cast. Luke has a mission, and a climatic reunion with his father. The rest of the cast is pushed aside to Endor, the home of the Ewoks, whom twelve year olds loved because of their likeness to teddy bears, but everyone else despised because of their irrelevance and ability to so easily decimate high tech legions of stormtroopers. The cross-cutting of this battle with Lando's assault on the second Death Star only further emphasise the tonal issues with the entirety of the Endor subplot; not only does it seem ludicrous that the shield generators are located on a separate moon (so what happens when you need to leave this random planetary system), but the methods in which the Ewoks wipe out the stormtrooper battalions have become laughably cheesy in time and lacking compared to the tension of the real battle high above. The real strength of the movie is within Hamill's changed Skywalker, and in Sebastian Shaw's brief but crucial final moment. Post time- skip Luke is older, more mature, and understands the lure of the Dark Side which corrupted his father, so much so that he refuses to fight back even as the rebels are being defeated and throws his lightsaber away. As Vader witnesses his son be tortured by his master, the Kuleshov effect cuts back and forth between Luke's screams of agony and Vader's faceless mask, but the power of his characterisation enables us to know exactly how he is feeling, and in the final reveal of Shaw, redemption is attained. It is a pity that Lucas chose to mar this character (Anakin finds his redemption as the elderly Shaw, not as the moody Hayden Christensen - the force ghost should correspond with this) but the original trilogy stands the test of time.

What more could you want? Acting is top notch, scenery and visuals are fantastic, pacing is spot on. The many elements of the story are hardly original but they come neatly together to make this movie into a masterpiece.Yet I think what captures the audience in this movie is deeper than that. One sits through the movie feeling, knowing that there really is no resolution for our protagonist at the end. Sure he'll get his revenge and overcome the odds, kill the bad guy and die peacefully believing he'll be reunited with his lost loved ones yet something is missing. Apart from the small diatribe about giving power to Roman citizens and restoring democracy, so much of it feels like it's been done in vain. If one wasn't overly invested in the death of the evil emperor, I can't see where that resolution would come. Strangely enough, this is a better movie for it. I compare it to Troy in this aspect.The wholesome\/moral\/upright part of the story about a good man avenging the gruesome murder of his family while central to the course of events, doesn't lend itself to an epic finale where all wrongs will be righted and where justice would prevail. No wrong in this instance can truly be righted and what we are asked to accept as justice is ambiguous and less than fulfilling to say the least which I think is all for the better. This is not the epic story of the life of Ramesses II, this is Shelley's Ozymandias ridiculing our notions of greatness as The Gladiator lacks one thing he wants, a simple life with his family, to die of old age in his bed during his sleep yet every step of his life he's pushed by external forces to rise to a challenge he would rather avoid.He's not really a good guy in the classical sense either. He's a Roman General which means he's been told to go and kill hundreds if not thousands of people to invade their land, pillage their resources and ironically enslave them as cheap labor or for recreational purposes. This rings true for many of the other characters as well. The revered emperor who neglected and abused his son having the nerve to chastise him for his immorality and incompetence, whose actions in raising the poor kid turned Commodus into a man whose ambition and thirst for greatness and power can't be satisfied until all is obedient and subservient to his power, his vision, his ambition. The lovely princess Lucille whose own desire for power and survival skills extend to conspiring to kill her brother. The senate, a corrupt bunch of politicians hiding behind the veil of democracy and claim of representing the people lavishly living off the finances of Rome. Last but not least, the people of Rome who have no qualms about being entertained by slaves being forced to murder each other for their entertainment, trusted by the wise emperor to make decisions for the well being of themselves and other Romans. This is where the critique of democracy kicks in, contrasted with Commodus' ambition for greatness, his drive for actualizing his vision for Rome these masses of Romans are only interested in their illusions of democracy, in their misguided virtues, in their violent sports and in their desire to feel victorious against the barbarians, the end of the movie becomes somewhat anticlimactic with the thought. One could get political and start drawing parallels between this and the Rome of our era, United States, but I believe this review has gone long enough already.

He absolutely hated it, let everyone know it and talked about what a terrible movie it was for years afterwards. I didn't dislike it then and in re-watching it (by myself) now I really liked and appreciated it. Sure it's too long, with so many scenes stretched out that it could easily have been pared back to a 2 hour viewing time but the story itself about family and the meaning of love, about discovery, seizing the day and sacrifice is just beautiful.The plot is intriguing and has apparently been done before in 'Death Takes A Holiday' which might explain why this had such an old fashioned feel to it, style, music and even dialogue. It follows the grim reaper, who comes to earth to retrieve a media tycoon shortly before his 65th birthday, but agrees to grant him a little more time if the mogul will teach him about life. In the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter.Stand out performances from everyone involved, I love watching Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt together on screen (Legends Of The Fall) they have fantastic chemistry and once again Pitt is almost too good looking here. Excellent back up cast too, Claire Forlani as the love interest is lovely in a simple trusting way, Marcia Gay Harden, trying to get her father to notice her and I loved Jeffrey Tambor's character Quince, such a nice man. As Joe Black says one of my favourites. The character of Black must have been a hard one to play and I'm not sure Pitt ever quite got it right, he just felt awkward at times in his wide eyed, robotic and childlike portrayal, in his discovery of life's pleasures and quest for more peanut butter. I will say he provided one of the most ...interesting love scenes I've witnessed on screen, watching death get it on, feeling things for the first time. Oh my! Ultimately a thoughtful, wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama that left me thinking about it for days afterwards. 7\/27\/15 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2015","score":"","review":" I originally saw this in the theatre with my husband who fidgeted and laughed his way through it.

We see a family 2 sons and a father and suddenly the father has a god epiphany and needs to murder all the bad people god tells him to, so what do we think? A highly paranoiac father going in to a killing spree forcing his sons to help him sounds like a fair plot. Mystery on which son did the murders , watching character development of the main protagonists , acting seeming good enough for this plot , Bill Paxton punishing the child of his who refuses to just random kill people in the name of god, yeah it looks like a nice dramatic psychological thriller but NOPE no no no The movie takes a 360* angle flip. Was the father deranged? NOPE where the killings an act of paranoia ? NOPE are the protagonists some how in any way mentally ill ? NOPE is child torturing acceptable in the name of god and not disturbing at all YEP. In other words this movie tells us, dudes if you see a vision of some angel and some list to kill people go do it its an act of god and don't worry you wont be punished cause believe it or not god protected them (none remembered their faces , cameras where blurred during McConaugheys interrogation so yeah good god cleaned up for those murders). So recapping the father of the family was not insane he was 100% sane.. so the acting goes from decent to horrible, same goes for all the protagonists of this movie excluding the young ones. In this religious sick movie the main idea is of following your visions and slaughtering in the name of god is acceptable and also rewarding. So instead of watching a psychological thriller with a mentally deranged killer going into a spree and instead of watching his abused children continuing his spree what do i get? A good Christian teaching his children the good ways of god , a good father who rightfully abuses his infidel child and the rewards of an eternal good and merciful god. In my opinion crap movies like this one need to be banned ,and no crap is a good term cause even a piece of crap has a greater morale to teach than this movie. The only reason this movie gets a 3\/10 is cause the acting , directing and generally the movie excluding the final 30 minutes is decent, but i ll rather prefer to burn my eyes with boiled tomato sauce and then remove them with a spoon than watching this sick piece of film making again....

I'm going to simply state the reasons why it's such a great film. At the top of the attributes is the name Faye Dunaway. As Andy Warhol said after watching this film, if that's not acting what is?! She IS Joan. They are officially one-in-the-same. The soul of Joan entered Faye's body on the day that the makeup was first applied to Faye's face. All the acting, in fact, is spot-on. Then we have the script. There are so many quotable moments to this film that one might as well just read the entire script - it's a non-stop quotable feast. The sets are gorgeous and I still claim that the most beautiful house in Brentwood set is one the greatest ever. Who can forget those crushed blue velvet sofas and that white bar? The STAIRCASE! The tree in the living room, accomplice in covering up so much dirt! How about the costumes? The gowns are spectacular. I could go on and on and on. In the DVD commentary Frank Yablans indicates that the director Frank Perry could have pulled Joan back a bit during the bring me the axe scene. I ask the simple question WHY PULL HER BACK?! At the end of the day film is meant to entertain. That means many different things to many different people.

A film by George Lucas, who took in influences ranging from spaghetti westerns to samurai films to classic fairy tales and crafted a film that would become the epitome of space opera genre. Since then it has inspired a following unlike almost anything we've ever seen before. Everyone raised in modern culture knows this film, knows what it's about and has probably seen it numerous times. And for a good reason.You can definitely see that while they were clearly ambitious about this film, they weren't shooting for the stars, nor did they have the best resources available. The special effects, while groundbreaking, innovative and very, very impressive, do show the limitations of the budget and would be greatly updated in the two coming sequels. For example, all the space explosions are kind of flaky, the lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader is in reality rather slow and looks cumbersome, the blaster bolts are obviously painted on the screen, and numerous other small things like that. In a way they add to the charm of the film, as do the corny dialogues, because really, it's not meant to be anything else but a pulp adventure and those need to be a bit cheesy to work.What the film does nail absolutely is the mythos. From the very first text scrawl to Obi-Wan talking about a more civilized age to all the mentions about the Jedi Order to a casual mention about the Galactic Senate, the film builds its world effortlessly and without flaws. There's a very good reason why people identify so strongly with this franchise and are so endlessly passionate about its intricacies, legends and lore. And this film is the one that started it all and laid all the groundwork for future films to utilize. I cannot in all honestly name any other film that can pull me in so quickly and have me begging more for crumbs of information.Star Wars is one of my favourite films of all time.

Firstly, the director. This film is directed by Stanley Kubrick, who made a lot of horror films like The Shining or 2001 A Space Odyssey, and he is a very good director, the shots he used are amazing! he uses a hand-held camera for most of his shots and even threw his out a window at one time, to imitate someone falling. Malcolm McDowell gave a convincing performance as Alex, mixing class and sophistication with savage and beast like, as his characters 'interests are rape, Ultra-Violence and Beethoven.' Also, there were some lines in the film that meant to sound serious but were funny and there were some lines that were just funny for the heck and I loved that tone.Now on to the negatives, and I would like to say this film isn't for everyone, there was loads of graphic content in this film like violence, sexual content, nudity and even a Rape Scene! While those scenes aren't that bearable to watch in 2015, this was released in the 70's and opinion has quite changed since then. Also, if you guys haven't read the novel to this film, then you won't have a clue what they're saying. This film takes so much from the novel, including it's vocabulary, which is more impossible to pronounce than Cockney Rhyming Slang. And, also some characters are really bland, but that's understandable because it mainly focuses on Alex. and some of the actors put all their effort into this film. eg. Michael Bates as Chief Officer Barnes who puts 100% into such a small role.On the whole, its a fantastic film, and it deserves a place in film history, even for the wrong reasons. Before I get to the score, I will say that if you do get a chance to see this film, like Shia LeBouf would say, DO IT!!! However if you feel uneasy with all the Violence and sexual content in this film, I don't blame you because its not the best thing to see, but I didn't mind. (It's not nice to watch, but it's also not that unbearable that I turned off my TV.)
