He never presents the character as pure evil (though he did freak me out on many an occasion) and Karloff is always playing on the character having some unresolved mystery to him.

Kentucky Fried Movie, the little movie that could, delivers it. Regrettably, its successor Airplane! didn't.  Both movies were made by the famous comedy moviemakers David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, best known as ZAZ.  Kentucky Fried Movie, or KFM as it is known, was directed by John Landis, who went to big projects as Animal House and The Blues Brothers.  As a small movie, KFM would pave the way for the filmmakers successes.  But in DVD terms, KFM did a much better job than Airplane! with extras aplenty.  Airplane! only had a trailer and ZAZ's mediocre commentary track, which ZAZ did much better in KFM.  As for KFM's extras, they included a hilarious 8-minute home movie which ZAZ proved to their relatives they were making a real movie in Hollywood, a clear-cut photo gallery, bios of ZAZ and John Landis, and the best commentary track they have done so far.As for KFM, what makes this small movie so special?  Although much of the movie is done tastelessly, it is fun tastelessness that everyone in it is enjoying it.  There is a lot of nudity and foul language, but it had it's heart in the right place.  And as for the cast, there are mostly unknown actors, and many of them are quite attractive and talented, with cameos by more famous actors such as the late Bill Bixby in a headache sketch, Donald Sutherland as a clumsy waiter in a sketch spoofing disaster movies, and Leave it to Beaver stars Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow kidding themselves as bickering brother jurors in the courtroom sketch.This movie, I think, is the best spoof of pop culture I've ever seen, outdoing its predecessor The Groove Tube, made 3years earlier than KFM and featuring bits by a then-unknown and pre-Saturday Night Live Chevy Chase. One of my favorite skits are A.M. Today with a gorilla rampaging the studio, scaring off everyone, while a calm anchorwoman (played by the lovely little-known actress Janice Kent)continues her duties of reporting the news. Another favorite isSex Records, with a black couple being instructed on lovemaking by a record until the woman is whisked away by a black muscleman, Yet another favorite is Feel-A-Round, where a theatre usher listens to the dialogue of a movie, gets out his props to feel a movie goer, even scaring him with a knife when the actress announces she'll cut up her lover with a knife. Then there is the final skit where a newsman from TV has the power to peer into the living room of a young couple having sex, and his crew (well-played by ZAZ themselves) leer on.  But the best sketch of all is A Fistful of Yen, a 17-minute takeoff of Bruce Lee Movies featuring a lisping Karate champ fighting against the master despot Dr. Klahn, who wants to take over the world, and ends with the Hero in Dorothy drag spoofing The Wizard of Oz.If you like your DVDs, and of a low-budget movie, KFM delivers the goods.  Hopefully, there will be a special edition of Airplane! in the future for fans of that movie who were disappointed in the DVD treatment of that great classic , but let's not hold our breaths.  But for ZAZ fans, KFM was the best DVD work they have done so far, and it's a special edition in its own right, outshining and outselling Airplane! by a substantial margin.

Another favorite isSex Records, with a black couple being instructed on lovemaking by a record until the woman is whisked away by a black muscleman, Yet another favorite is Feel-A-Round, where a theatre usher listens to the dialogue of a movie, gets out his props to feel a movie goer, even scaring him with a knife when the actress announces she'll cut up her lover with a knife. Then there is the final skit where a newsman from TV has the power to peer into the living room of a young couple having sex, and his crew (well-played by ZAZ themselves) leer on.  But the best sketch of all is A Fistful of Yen, a 17-minute takeoff of Bruce Lee Movies featuring a lisping Karate champ fighting against the master despot Dr. Klahn, who wants to take over the world, and ends with the Hero in Dorothy drag spoofing The Wizard of Oz.If you like your DVDs, and of a low-budget movie, KFM delivers the goods.  Hopefully, there will be a special edition of Airplane! in the future for fans of that movie who were disappointed in the DVD treatment of that great classic , but let's not hold our breaths.

Kentucky Fried Movie, the little movie that could, delivers it. Regrettably, its successor Airplane! didn't.  Both movies were made by the famous comedy moviemakers David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, best known as ZAZ.  Kentucky Fried Movie, or KFM as it is known, was directed by John Landis, who went to big projects as Animal House and The Blues Brothers.  As a small movie, KFM would pave the way for the filmmakers successes.  But in DVD terms, KFM did a much better job than Airplane! with extras aplenty.  Airplane! only had a trailer and ZAZ's mediocre commentary track, which ZAZ did much better in KFM.  As for KFM's extras, they included a hilarious 8-minute home movie which ZAZ proved to their relatives they were making a real movie in Hollywood, a clear-cut photo gallery, bios of ZAZ and John Landis, and the best commentary track they have done so far.As for KFM, what makes this small movie so special?  Although much of the movie is done tastelessly, it is fun tastelessness that everyone in it is enjoying it.  There is a lot of nudity and foul language, but it had it's heart in the right place.  And as for the cast, there are mostly unknown actors, and many of them are quite attractive and talented, with cameos by more famous actors such as the late Bill Bixby in a headache sketch, Donald Sutherland as a clumsy waiter in a sketch spoofing disaster movies, and Leave it to Beaver stars Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow kidding themselves as bickering brother jurors in the courtroom sketch.This movie, I think, is the best spoof of pop culture I've ever seen, outdoing its predecessor The Groove Tube, made 3years earlier than KFM and featuring bits by a then-unknown and pre-Saturday Night Live Chevy Chase.

It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedy is overdone or boring. The music is marvelous, as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting. The acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie... Elwes is a great comedian, and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical Robin Hood, more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie(and spoofed majorly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of silly humor, or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, this is definitely the film for you. The HBO First Look special on the film is also worth watching, and in that, you may want to keep watching throughout the credits, too.

I had expected yet another immature, self-indulgent Generation X flick filled with gratuitous sex, drugs, rapping, cursing, and tattoos. What I got was a genuinely funny film featuring realistic characters we can care about, and a story with a lot of heart. The cast is perfect, the screenplay tight, the soundtrack appropriate (some of the songs are simply wonderful), and there are a plenty of clever surprises to remind you that you're watching this to have FUN. Even the subplots are subdued and well-balanced so they do not detract from the main story of a dejected young man coming to terms with being dumped by the girl of his dreams.The young leads are all excellent, but special mention has to go to old timers Martin Short, Ed Begley, Jr., and Swoosie Kurtz, who prove beyond any doubt that they can still do it after all these years.Best of all, it's refreshing to see a film with a mostly young cast that does not try to be a showcase for the popular culture of the day. For this reason, I expect Get Over It to remain entertaining for decades without suffering from the outdated cliches of the times that leave me embarrassed to watch even the greatest teen flicks of the 80's. This is a truly FUN movie if you just go with it--and not only for teenage girls. Highly recommended!

I'm not as die-hard as some, but I've enjoyed the movies greatly over the years. As for The Phantom Menace, it's definitely not my favorite of the films, but I definitely don't despise it.I still feel transported into the Star Wars world when I watch Phantom Menace.  I get to see what led up to the original trilogy, and truthfully, I didn't pay that much attention to Anakin in this movie.  I get more intrigued about Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and the Jedi Council.  Sure there are moments where there's too much talk, but Episode I displays some great sci-fi action scenes; such as the pod race with its awesome visual and sound effects, and the light saber duel between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon.People also complain about Jar Jar, but he honestly didn't bug me too much. He's a minor character who's just a clumsy oaf.  He may generate a few laughs, but he's not a character that I concentrated on.  I also thought the animation used to create Jar Jar and the other digital characters wasn't too shabby either.

Brad Pitt is charged with the much more difficult task to render the delicate tones of a more complex, real-life character, as the IRA soldier Frankie McGuire.

(Note that -and that's an issue- in all likelihood he would be a hero if he were a member of a regular army, killing by his intelligent weapons the enemies of his country along with some innocent citizens by mistake). He's not a common criminal, since he believes that in this way he defends the rights of his country and since he has not been hardened or anaesthetized enough yet he can still feel remorse for his terrible actions and liking (affection) for a man with different convictions (cop Tom).Frankie has been deprived of a peaceful life and of all of its small joys that we normal people take for granted.

A story told a thousand times before in countless movies,namely boy meets girl,boy loses girl,boy gets girl back,but never before or since has a movie portrayed teenage love so sweetly or shown the degree of intensity that comes when 2 young people fall in love for the first time,and how all encompassing first love can be. The scene with John Cusack's character holding the boom box over his head as Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes plays is obviously an all time classic, but the one scene that sums up the whole movie to me is the one with Lloyd and Dianne in the back seat of the car with a blanket wrapped around them,and Dianne asks Lloyd why he is shaking.

The ideas are completely zany and absolutely brilliant. The acting is fabulous, the dialogue is full of classic lines that you can laugh at again and again. Oh, and the heartfelt lesbian love-story doesn't make it worse! I once loved Cameron Diaz (esp. in The Mask), but some of her later work made me revise my opinion about her in a negative direction. I will say that here, though, she performs sensitively and admirably in every way. Catherine Keener, however, gets my vote for most attractive character in this entire beautiful mess of screwy order!This is a GREAT movie, right up there with the best of the best.10 out of 10.

Of course, a nice looking film doesn't mean it's a good film, but Lost Souls does have some nice eye candy. I particularly liked the dream sequences, the one in the toilet was very well constructed.--The film starts well, with some good philosophy. I liked the ideas that the leads (Winona Ryder and Ben Chaplin as Maya and Peter) had on good and evil, God and Satan, they interested me.THE BAD--Haven't I already seen this movie tons of times before? In films like The Exorcist, Stigmata, End of Days, The Omen and many more? Lost Souls doesn't bring anything new to the forefront, in fact it is basically a cardboard copy of the previous films mentioned. You'd think that copying so many movies would bring about a solid plot, but it is not to be. The film is almost plotless, it seems like there wasn't very much of a story so Kaminski had to fill in some time (to make the 90 minute mark) by the characters just looking at objects.--I was pretty bored by this movie. It didn't hold my interest, probably because I found it so predictable and wasn't interested in the characters or the so-called plot of the film.--I expected a better ending. We've watched all the crap up until these climactic moments, and what we're given is very, very simple and definitely not as clever as it thinks it is. The movie gives us a lame twist and then sort of just ends, without caring much for the slight bit of development we got or the time we spent to get to this point. I expected a bit of action but what we get is just one disappointment after another - a bore, much like the rest of this rehash.RATING4\/10 - Lost Souls is the kind of film that thinks its deep and conceptual, when in the end there really isn't that much there in the first place.
