If he had they probably would have made a movie much like Niagara. Henry Hathaway directed this film but it definitely has a Hitchcock feel to it. It's certainly not the typical Marilyn Monroe film. Here Marilyn gets to show off some serious acting chops as she plays a femme fatale.While Monroe, as per usual, commands most of the attention it could be argued that the more important role in the film actually belongs to Jean Peters. Peters plays Polly Cutler who, with her husband Ray, is taking a delayed honeymoon to Niagara Falls. When the young couple arrives they find that the cabin they have reserved is still occupied by another couple, George and Rose Loomis, so the Cutlers end up staying in another cabin nearby. The two couples will soon see their fates intertwine in rather dramatic fashion. It is obvious right away that there are serious problems in the Loomis marriage. George, played by Joseph Cotten, seems to be rather unstable. The much younger Rose, played by Monroe, wants out of the relationship. In fact we soon learn she plans to have her husband killed and run off with a young lover who we never really see or know that much about. The Cutlers are determined to mind their own business and enjoy their honeymoon but they will be swept up in everything that is swirling around them.While Monroe does very well with her role and of course looks spectacular Peters matches her stride for stride. The story mostly unfolds from Polly's perspective and Peters creates a very sympathetic, compelling central character. Monroe's the femme fatale, Peters is the innocent and beautiful girl you fall in love with. So Monroe is terrific. Peters is terrific. Cotten is as well. Unfortunately there is one actor whose performance leaves much to be desired. Max Showalter plays Polly's husband Ray as a total goofball. The way he delivers his lines, the constant silly facial expressions, the shameless mugging for the camera...none of it works. The filmmakers dropped a clown into what is otherwise a tense, atmospheric thriller and the character sticks out like a sore thumb. Showalter's performance distracts and definitely detracts from the overall experience. But all in all the good outweighs the bad with this film. There's plenty of suspense, some moments of great tension and even a big action scene tossed in. The acting performances, with the one notable exception, are excellent and the film always looks terrific. The falls and all the surrounding scenery are shot beautifully. And if Niagara Falls aren't enough of a natural wonder for you there's Marilyn too. It's not a perfect film but as Hitchcock Lite it works well.

Glenn Ford as the upright cop has a boyishness, an innocence which is just right for the role..the sadness in his eyes, the purpose in his stride as he sets out to avenge the death of his wife..he maybe an actor with limited talent but this role was tailor-made for him. Gloria Grahame! She's out of this world...she was outstanding in In a Lonely Place and she's stunning here. Lang does a wonderful job of making the audience understand the characters motives and their past lives without spending too much time on it. In a fast paced movie like this, its hard to relate to the characters..to get emotionally linked to them but the way Gloria's character is brought out pure class. In one of the beginning scenes she's shown acting like a kid, drinking too much and making fun of Vince's (her boyfriend's) servitude to Lagana (the mob boss)..she hops around the hall singing a nursery rhyme. In a later scene, she tells Ford that she's been both poor and rich and rich is any day better even if it means being beaten up by her boyfriend once in a while. An innocent young girl who's seen a lot in life and feels the deal she's got - a rich boyfriend who can be abusive at times - is good enough - but still retains her innocence - she identifies with and gets attracted to a good man who's been wronged (Ford). Gloria's attraction to Ford's character is NOT the dumb blonde likes tall, handsome male stereotype.What makes this movie even more amazing is that you can actually believe it could've happened. Lang doesn't make the mistake of making anyone the superman of the show. Ford's character is not shown as masterminding the downfall of the mafia. He's helped by unlikely friends..and some of them have their own motives too.Fast paced, gripping, believable, twisted, bordering on Gothic and then rebounding to a cop revenge story and then changing again...this is a must watch for Film Noir fans!

After watching it again, POLTERGEIST is distinctly a Steven Spielberg picture, just without his name under the director's credit. I feel bad for Tobe Hooper..it's the THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD all over again with Hooper taking the Nyby credit, not leaving an indelible mark that defines his style at almost any point(..perhaps the face peeling away to reveal a skull or the graves bursting at the end were partially his, but I figure if this were his film, the family wouldn't have escaped intact). Despite that tiresome debate, I felt that what excels in this movie is the superb acting from about as good a cast as you could ask for. From top to bottom, the cast is uniformly excellent..the film establishes a family you can identify with, and the suburbia backdrop is ideal for the fantastic twist at the end. It's perfectly 80's as, at one point, you see Realtor Craig T Nelson reading a Ronald Reagan biography while wife Jobeth Williams spokes a dooby. The supporting cast is simply divine with particular work from Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein adding an incredible amount of value to the film. Straight's work opposite Jobeth Williams is impeccable.The plot is infinitely Spielberg..a middle class family discover that their home is being invaded by poltergeists who kidnap daughter Heather O'Rourke holding her due to the spirits wishing not to depart into the light. The reason the spirits are restless is uncovered at the very end in quite a hair-raising finale as the bodies of buried dead rise from the earth seeking revenge. James Karen's limited role is of vital importance in that he represents corporate greed, lacking any kind of conscious in his decisions on starting neighborhood projects on hallowed ground. Zelda Rubinstein, of course, bursts onto the scene in an unforgettable portrayal of a paranormal house cleaner. Beatrice Straight is a psychologist who operates a small paranormal group whose interest lies in helping those who are supposedly haunted(..or to prove if clients are making bogus requests). I can not praise the performance of Straight enough and her character so emotionally invests in this victimized family, there's such warmth in her moments on screen with Williams..you believe this woman genuinely cares for them. O'Rourke is adorable in her iconic performance as Carol Anne, just a beautiful girl who stirs your heart which is important for the plot because you need to wish for her safe return from the place between the world of life and death. Richard Endlund's team really provide some stunning set-pieces with what were state-of-the-art effects at the time as we witness the series of paranormal activity which plague the Freeling family. Wonderful melodic score from the late great Jerry Goldsmith. Some terrific supernatural monsters, wonderful light effects, and great use of skeletons all provide visual eye candy. Some thrilling sequences include the tree which wishes to swallow Oliver Robbins(..as well as the scene with the creepy clown doll which attempts to strangle him with it's arms), Jobeth Williams being pulled across the walls unwillingly, and O'Rourke's room being sucked into the closet where a vortex exists. Dominique Dunne(RIP)has a minor part as the older sister in the Freeling family, but makes the best of it with such an independent attitude, a cynicism that is expressed in scenes like when O'Rourke buries her dead bird and when she flips off construction workers ogling her.

The move away from Hitchcock's classic towards 80s teenage slasher which in my opinion is a sell out which is disappointing, The first one didn't need sex and gore to make it brilliant and instead concentrated on suspense and character development, and the sequel although not as good as the first one was a good and worthy follow up and still maintained the suspense the first one had. All of which in this sequel have gone which is a shame and wasn't necessary, and I don't get why. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, it is actually pretty good and very entertaining the Mother with a knife in hand is a great addition to the franchise and certainly what makes the Psycho films stand out in they're own way.Anthony Perkins performance is as great as always, his portrayal of troubled psychopath Norman Bates is what saves this movie from being just another forgettable slasher movie, no-one can play cross dresser serial killer with such depth like Anthony Perkins can and again he was the best star of the movie. Jeff Fahey is also suitably slimy as the drifter Duane, his character was enjoyable and fun who stupidly tries to get one over on Norman Bates...Big Mistake. Diana Scarwid played her part of Maureen Coyle really well with such vulnerability, she's such a great actress in this movie as the kind but troubled former nun, running away from her troubled past. Roberta Maxwell was not bad but she didn't stand out from the rest, I found her character pretty annoying and rather bland and 80's Slasher icon Juliette Cummins the sexy red-head was fun to watch again she's gorgeous and again shows her beautiful body, her part was smaller in this slasher than her previous slashers (Friday The 13th Part 5 and Slumber Party Massacre 2) which is a shame but oh well at least we get to hear her scream, it would have been nice to have seen more of her in this movie.All in all Psycho III is a decent Slasher but Unfortunately whereas we were unaware of Bates' secret past in the original and he was purposely framed by a copycat in the sequel, here we know all too well where the film is heading. Any attempts at hiding it are weak to say the least so of course when the finale occurs, there is no twist. Sadly the franchise continues to keep going down hill after this one.

While he gives the role a great effort, he seems very self-conscious in the role. He was too old and too weathered and his innate intelligence just comes right through.But the larger flaws in the production first comes from the need to dampen down the sexual references and repression of the piece so that it might perhaps fit the film codes of the day.Daniel Taradash's screenplay, most probably inhibited by the film codes, is still stiff and has none of the internal angst of the play.Also, Joshua Logan seemed more intent on making a big film out of something far more intimate and intense. The play has light moments, but it is really more brooding and intense. You have s sense that these people are either sleep-walking through their lives or are about to explode from their own personal repression or shame. Only the wise Mrs. Potts in both play and film is finally at home with herself; perhaps so because now at the end of her days she just is at peace with her expectations versus her actual life. But Logan loses the subtly in favor of a big film, with big shots and sets, wonderful (but at times way to dramatic) film music. The film needed the intimacy that films like Streetcar Named Desire or even A Place in the Sun could provide. Now the latter is a good example of a big film that doesn't lose the intimate nature and intensity of the characters. This is not Logan's forte' and he too was not the best choice for the film's director. I think Kazan would have been one of the few at the time to breathe the kind of life in the film that enhanced the plays best qualities. This is a story of very real and desperate people trying to live in a rather sterile environment while not realizing how suffocating that environment is to their souls. It is Hal and Madge who are at least for the moment able to break free.It is Logan's broad interpretation of the story that not only loses the heat and intensity of the play, but makes the film itself more dated today.Supporting performances range from okay to wonderful. The wonderful being in particular Verna Felton as Mrs. Potts. Also great is Arthur O'Connell as Howard (oscar nomination for best supporting actor). Betty Field is one of the few who really creates the angst and multi-layered-inner struggle that is in the play itself. Rosalind Russell almost pushes the limit to overacting, but in the long run; it is a very affecting performance. Cliff Robertson does a capable job in a more poorly written screen role and maybe the least well written role in the play. Susan Straberg is great and outshines many in the film with her energy and sense of truth. She is spot on throughout and it almost makes those around her like Holden or Novak look more out of place or stiff. What a real film talent was lost in the lack of studios to know what to do with Ms. Strasberg.I would love to see the real heat and intensity of the play be revisited in a remake today where you could see it all.

He is one of these Blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before their normal time. The already old film though does not show how important Biko was, what he really represented. His life and his teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks. The film being from 1987, the objective was to push South Africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. So the film aims at showing how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are, in 1987. To show this the film has to look beyond Biko's death, hence to center its discourse not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living. His escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko, after his death, and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has tremendously aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical distantiation, the very distantiation that has taken place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. The film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books or films all have that defect they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view.

My dad loves this movie and he rented it a couple of times in the past and every time he came back with it,just the movie cover THE FLY was enough to make me avoid it at all costs.The story itself is simple, an eccentric scientist Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) was frustrated on why his telepods weren't able to teleport life forms. That was until he met the love of his life Veronica Quaife(Geena Davis) whose words inspired him such that he was able to change his program which succeeded in teleporting life forms. Well everything in his mundane life has changed for the better He found his soul mate and his invention is on its way to becoming part of the nobel prize stage. However jealousy got the better of him and in an attempt to spite Veronica, he entered one of his telepods and did the teleportation without her to witness it. However, he didn't realise that a fly had gotten into the telepod with him and the program has fused his genes with the fly's genes at genetic level.That's when all the horror starts as he starts mutating more and more into a gigantic fly which Seth himself labelled as Brundlefly. Everything in this film is top notch, from the acting to the props and the story. Jeff Goldblum was able to play Seth Brundle to such a level that you will pity, fear and love him for what he is. Even though you know the ending in which he will die eventually, you will still feel emotions welling up at the end. Geena Davis was also brilliant as Veronica Quaife,the girlfriend who loved Seth so much and struggled when he underwent changes. She tried her best to stay with Seth, however her fear and Seth's insanity was too much for her to handle and she tried to leave him with no avail. Geena's acting of silent fear, desperation and love for seth hit right on the mark. Of course I couldn't just comment on the acting,the props were also top notched and this was a time when CGI wasn't popular and readily used. The crew really put in a lot of effort into creating brundlefly which you could see towards the ending of the show whereby there was nothing physically human about seth but just a huge monster. I had no idea that it was just a puppet, I thought Jeff Goldblum was in a body suit or something but yeah it was a machine towards the end. Two words for the props Gory, disgusting.This film is seriously underrated in IMDb. 7.4\/10, are you kidding me?

The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with Predator. This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes Halloween look like Chicken Little. You can forget about all those rubbish Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street movies, 'cause Alien just takes horror up to so many levels! In Alien, we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an SOS from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the Company regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, Alien does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what Alien has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And Alien is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite\/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life.

Only loose bits of footage i found on the extras of this DVD.I can only think of one reason why Hitchcock wanted to remake his own film, and that would be for the music. In the original, he didn't have Herrmann to count on. With Herrmann, he knew he could made truly powerful scene out of the Albert Hall bits. And the scene indeed is powerful, and fully anchored on the music. You have the tension of knowing what is about to happen, or supposed to. You follow 4 lines. Doris Day, trying to avoid a crime, the potential murderer and what he is doing, James Stewart trying to get there, figuring the whole thing and most importantly, the music itself, which is actually literally filmed at some moment (the cymbal's score, which the camera follows as the music develops). This fourth thread, of course, involves the other 3, marks the pace and itself becomes the narrative manipulator as everything happens to the sound of music. This is a very powerful concept which really is perfectly built here, and a coordinated effort of Hitch and Herrmann, one of their finest moments, and they had so many... Notice specially how the music conducts the actions of Stewart's character even when he is no yet at the Albert Hall. How the editing helps, as we follow Stewart through the corridors, outside the concert room, and as he talks to people and tries to find his way to the murderer, we feel about him what the music allows us to feel. The whole sequence is a perfect piece of film\/music adequation, and thus, a perfect piece of collective film-making. Worth watching on that alone. This is, i suppose, where Coppolla picked his powerful finale for the Godfather trilogy, though he made it even more (literally) theatrical. Well he was working with an Italian opera, of an even more artificial nature than other Italian operas.Further more, we have another attempt at scene development through music. At the embassy, when Doris Day sings for her son to whistle, so his father can find him. We had this scene prepared from the very beginning, from the part of the film when suspense was only a promise. Probably, Day was chosen precisely because she was a singer, because she doesn't belong to the type of actresses and physical presences that Hitchcock was electing in those days for his films. The Que será será bit is not half as powerful as the Albert Hall sequence, and it looses even more because it happens right after it. Logically, the Albert Hall could have ended the film, but i think Hitch was wanting us to live the aftermath of that sequence a little bit.Anyway, The rest of the film builds competently the mood for the Albert Hall, if you are willing to avoid asking yourself to many questions about what doesn't fit in the story.

In less than 10 years after The Abyss, Titanic came and swept the Oscars and the box-office with ease. And then in the 00's, he made a few underwater documentaries, but still has yet to make a real film (which he will, in 2009 with Avatar).And The Abyss is freaking excellent, and it's got everything, acting for the realism lovers, a story for the film lovers and special effects for the action\/sci-fi lovers.It tells the story of a diving team that are forced by the marines to search for a missing nuclear submarine that was sunk by an extra-terrestrial alien species. Once the Navy SEALS reach down to the diving team, the leader of the SEALS starts to become more and more paranoid and schizophrenic and hatches a plan to steal a nuclear warhead and use it on the aliens while believing it to be the Russians. And also the head of the diving team also has to go on this mission while dealing with his ex-wife.James Cameron has always been known for giving his characters very human personalities and characteristics. And there's this one scene at the beginning when the whole diving team are all singing along to a song on the radio which shows off their goofiness and the human nature that we all have.Goddammit, you bitch! You never backed away from anything in your life! Now fight!-Bud Brigman Ed Harris who plays as the central character Virgil Bud Brigman, is at his best. Bud is basically, as i said before, a very human and vulnerable character, and although he frequently makes jokes and taunts his soon-to-be ex-wife, Lindsey (Mary Mastrantonio). But deep inside, he's very troubled and still loves his wife which is evident when he throws his wedding ring into the toilet and then goes through the trouble to get it back. Also, after the film's 2nd hour, he tries to resuscitate his wife in the one of the best scenes of the movie, you can totally see Harris' acting skill in there. And Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is excellent as Bud's wife and displays the right emotions at the right time, like when she and Bud start to re-connect towards the end and when he about thousands of feet below her.It went for the warhead, and they think it's cute.-Hiram CoffeyAnother high-point performance is Michael Biehn as the insane Hiram Coffey. Everything Biehn does in here justifies the claim that he should've gotten an Oscar for this. As soon as Coffey enters the rig, you can tell that there's something about him that is sinister and when his hand starts shaking, you feel like that theory is proved correct. It is to this day, the most realistic portrayal of a delusional man suffering from pressure-induced paranoia, and I've never seen an actor perform like that in my life. And we all must be wondering why Biehn never got the recognition he deserved.And the other supporting actors are totally memorable and likable because of their humanity, and that's what James Cameron does best. And after seeing this movie you can remember all their names right off the bat Hippy, Catfish, One-Night and Jammer. And they each got their gimmicks, like Hippy with his pet white rat and Catfish with his fist that used to be called The Hammer. And like in Predator and Aliens, The Abyss makes you care about and wanna see an individual movie on each character to show you more of him\/her. But the world ain't perfect, so we may never get to see that happen.The special effects were great and totally ahead of its time, and the water tentacle completely blew me away and I wonder how they did that since modern film studios can't do that if their life depended on it. And I think that tentacle was probably the inspiration for the boss Morpha in that Legend of Zelda game. The aliens and the mother-ship were very well-done and Cameron would only get better with the special effects in Terminator 2.Also, Cameron's directing shows us a story about the survival of humanity and how we might be destroying ourselves. And that's what the aliens show Bud at the end when gets onto their ship. And they plan on sending a massive tidal wave to wipe everyone out. But after seeing Bud's message to wife, they realize that not all humans deserve to die, so they spare them.And as for the adrenaline rushes, you're gonna be relying on the thrills mostly. The part when the rig gets damaged and a few people drown is one of the best edited and one of the most suspense filled sequences ever. And when Brigman and Coffey face off in a brief fight scene, basically has James Cameron written all over it. And the sub chase is another one worth mentioning.The Abyss is just another one of the greats that James Cameron has to offer, and he is only gonna be making more in the future.

And like in Predator and Aliens, The Abyss makes you care about and wanna see an individual movie on each character to show you more of him\/her. But the world ain't perfect, so we may never get to see that happen.The special effects were great and totally ahead of its time, and the water tentacle completely blew me away and I wonder how they did that since modern film studios can't do that if their life depended on it. And I think that tentacle was probably the inspiration for the boss Morpha in that Legend of Zelda game. The aliens and the mother-ship were very well-done and Cameron would only get better with the special effects in Terminator 2.Also, Cameron's directing shows us a story about the survival of humanity and how we might be destroying ourselves. And that's what the aliens show Bud at the end when gets onto their ship. And they plan on sending a massive tidal wave to wipe everyone out. But after seeing Bud's message to wife, they realize that not all humans deserve to die, so they spare them.And as for the adrenaline rushes, you're gonna be relying on the thrills mostly. The part when the rig gets damaged and a few people drown is one of the best edited and one of the most suspense filled sequences ever. And when Brigman and Coffey face off in a brief fight scene, basically has James Cameron written all over it. And the sub chase is another one worth mentioning.The Abyss is just another one of the greats that James Cameron has to offer, and he is only gonna be making more in the future.

In fact, it IS my favorite film, so it come as no surprise to you that I rate it as excellent. There is almost not a single thing I would like to be different.INLAND EMPIRE, Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Twin Peaks- Fire Walk With Me and Blue Velvet are also all in my top 20 movies overall, but why it is the best? You could argue it has the very best acting. Naomi Watts would have absolutely deserved an Oscar (e. g. not many actresses can start crying when filmed, most use tricks), even more than Laura Dern would have deserved one for her fabulous EMPIRE role. This performance alone has elevated Watts as one of my all-time favorite actresses. It is also great to see how cold and understated Theroux handles his role, or how bizarre some side actors behave - all contributing to the truly unique mood.This is another thing. The mood is very strong, brooding, emotional, surrealistic, thought changing and elevating. Los Angeles has become an actress in this film, seriously. The cinematography is well thought-out, just right almost the whole time, and the soundtrack is very moody and original.Another thing that makes it the best Lynch film for me is the thought-provocing, non-linear, Moebius strip resembling, multi-layered script. Lynch wrote he had the key ideas to finishing the story in a meditation session, so an expanded consciousness has to do with its greatness. The dialogues are very believable and at times quite strange - even if e. g. the scene where the old couple laughs in the car is even of more artistic value in my opinion. It can get you thinking about what just happens in our lives.Then, the last thing that makes it the best of his movies for me, is the cut and thus, the pace. It begins dark, in a mid tempo, then mostly slows down a bit with some fast interruptions to keep the tension high, then the last fifth reminds me of a tornado, really.You should know by now, that I absolutely recommend this film to all viewers which are old enough.Now we come to some interpretations About the specific meaning, there has been talked in depth. But here about some more abstract ones First, this is sort of a meta-film (but not quite like Fellini's 8 1\/2 or his later EMPIRE) all having acting and directing as part of the story, and ultimately showing that all movies are illusions, created dream world(s). The absolutely beautiful Club Silencio-scene can be even expanded in its meaning to life and freedom in general.Then, it is also a movie about how you create a better world in your fantasy if you made - and often make! - a lot of bad decisions in your life.Additionally, it shows just how hard earning money in Hollywood actually is for young new actresses, even if they are talented. Jenifer Syme was not tough enough for it, Mulholland Drive was dedicated to her. Another motive is the Marilyn Monroe-one, more concrete a sexual very alluring and active person lives with multiple affairs at once, making other people jealous and possibly self-destructive, and at the same time, getting better film roles.Finally, it is a film about identity. Not to go in depth here, it is shown in a specific case that we sometimes want to have the identity of a more successful person we love, possibly in a compulsive obsession. Also, after a tragic shock, we often like to escape our own lives, identities.You see here that Mulholland Drive has many layers, both concrete and abstract, and that is the most beautiful thing about it.If David Lynch should ever read this, he can send me a message whether he wants to read one or two scripts by me or not.

After examining a dart from an assassination attempt on Amidala, Obi Wan Kenobi is led to the planet Kamino where they reveal that they have been preparing a clone army for the republic.The plot is much better in this film. They do away with a lot of politics and instead deal with the clone army and assassination attempts on Queen Amidala. Much easier to understand what is going on.Characters are great as always. Obi Wan gets to do a lot in this film and really gets to show why he is such a great jedi. Yoda also gets to display his own awesomeness in a great lightsaber duel. Also Mace Windu gets to show why many refer to him as the most powerful jedi by using his special purple lightsaber for the first time in this film. Queen Amidala is super hot in this film and well played once again by Natalie P ortman.Anakin Skywalker is played by Hayden Christensian in this film. Much better portrayal of Anakin in this film as opposed to the first film. While Hayden is not perfect, he does an above average job of playing Anakin and is great at looking angry at several different parts as well as showing how Anakin has issues with being arrogant. The love scenes with Amidala were nothing special and sometimes odd. But overall I would give Hayden a B+ as Anakin Skywalker in this film.The battle scene at the end is much better in this film. You get to see the jedi in an epic battle against the Confederate Droid army. This is a million times better than the Gungan against Droid army battle from The Phantom Menace.The villains I really liked in this film. Count Dooku is much different than Darth Maul as a sith. Rather than just an excellent fighter, Dooku is a well spoken villain. He converses well with people, even his enemies and is really a great tactician and recruiter of different systems to his cause.

The other four are people, people who hurt and have feelings and friends and parents they have problems with as well as a domineering principal they cannot relate to. These common bonds are doors, opening to show them the truth not just about each other but about teenagers in general and the true difficulties they all face.As mentioned before, of all of John Hughes' films, this is the most serious as well as endearing towards its characters. Hughes wisely doesn't talk down to them but puts them all on an equal plane, which forces them to look past the outside caricatures and see the person inside. The acting then brings this out fully, with Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall giving perhaps the best performances of their careers all in this one movie. The performance that sticks out most to me, though, is Judd Nelson as the criminal-mind John Bender. He is the most outrageous, so he breaks the ice between them and really starts the ball rolling.

Not just a classic teen film but also one of the best of the decade, The Breakfast Club still applies today to teenagers who feel out-of-place or misled in their lives.

Thompson wrote by way of epigraph in his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man. On the other end of Hunter Thompson's drug cocktails and alcoholic debauchery, but faced with the same inscrutable dilemma of how one should live his life, lies Nikos Kazantzakis. In the heartbreaking autobiography he wrote just before his death (he finished only a first draft, the book was published by his daughter), Kazantzakis sums up the restless spiritual agony of a lifetime to turn flesh into spirit and leave behind nothing but a pile of bones for death to take.Why all this? Because this is not a Scorsese movie. This a Kazantzakis movie. Or more aptly, Scorsese understands Kazantzakis on a level beyond a simple adaptation. Never before have I seen a director translate with such emotional clarity and capture with such faithfulness the work of another author. Maybe not the tone or feeling, how could after all a Catholic Italian-American who grew up in Manhattan hope to see the world through the eyes of an Orthodox Cretan of the early 20th century, but certainly the spirit of it, which is all that matters in the end. No doubt old Marty, an altar boy and aspiring priest before he even picked up a camera and went to work for Roger Corman, connects with the material on just the right level.Executed with the technical precision one would expect from the venerable patriarch of modern American cinema and taking its cue from a long tradition of religious art, be it the Hieronymous Bosch painting The Ghent Christ Carrying the Cross that inspired the famous extremely slow-motion shot (120fps) of Willem Dafoe carrying his own cross, Messina's painting The Crucifixion or the simplicity of Pasolini's GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEWS, THE LAST TEMPTATION succeeds exactly because it eschews the conventions of the religious epic as it was established through the Hollywood works of directors like Cecil B. DeMille and Nicholas Ray. Scorsese and Schrader crafted instead an intimate character study of a man torn by doubt.The sermon on the mountain has a small crowd of 20 people, which enables a personable Jesus to mingle in and talk to them directly, while the scenes at the temple, filmed with the largest amount of extras in the entire film, have a sweaty, claustrophobic quality to them, exactly what it would have felt to be crammed in close quarters in the heat of the noon with 100 people. Scorsese's intention was to give a distinct visual look to the movie that would set it apart from anything else that had come before and he was quite successful at that. Take for example Pontius Pilate's interrogation hall, usually depicted as a lavish palace replete with Roman elegance and rows of armed guards, here becomes an austere vaulted room lit from a skylight - a nondescript place that could be anything and nothing in particular yet somehow feels right, like the library set Welles built for CITIZEN KANE.At the end of the day though, technical bravado and great acting aside, the movie is all about Kazantzakis' original material. Although condensed to a manageable length for the script, the movie preserves all the basic themes, fears, obsessions that permeate not only The Last Temptation but most of the Greek author's work. A man terrified to discover that his vocation is not to live life but write about it, to feel at home not in the company of others but in their absence. But in the same time a man torn by great guilt for not being the son his father wanted. It's hard to give an approximation of the pride Cretans feel for their particular homeland, their feisty temparement, or the unique philosophy of the people that was shaped by centuries of Saracen invasions and Ottoman occupation. Suffice to say that to this day there are towns high in the Cretan mountains the police is afraid to set foot in and you can see most of the road signs leading to them shot full of holes by AK47s (which Cretans use these days to protect their large crops of marijuana plants, not hesitating to open fire at police helicopters scouting the fields for them!). Seen in that light, the shy, introverted Kazantzakis that was fit to become neither respectable figher or politician was an affront to his father.Those that said that the book is more about Kazantzakis himself and his existential angst than Jesus are not entirely incorrect. Modeled after his author and with regards to his own personal philosophy, Kazantzakis' Jesus is a man torn between two natures, what he is and what he must become, the struggle to walk that path and follow his call to the end and the price he must pay for it. At the end of the day, protagonist, author and film had to suffer the same fate. Scorsese's film was banned in many countries and was the subject of much controversy for its allegedly blasphemous subject matter. Kazantzakis was buried on the wall surrounding the city of Heraklion, because the Orthodox Church ruled out his being buried in a cemetery. His epitaph reads I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free. ","genre":null},{"date":"17 April 2009","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Hunter S.

No doubt old Marty, an altar boy and aspiring priest before he even picked up a camera and went to work for Roger Corman, connects with the material on just the right level.Executed with the technical precision one would expect from the venerable patriarch of modern American cinema and taking its cue from a long tradition of religious art, be it the Hieronymous Bosch painting The Ghent Christ Carrying the Cross that inspired the famous extremely slow-motion shot (120fps) of Willem Dafoe carrying his own cross, Messina's painting The Crucifixion or the simplicity of Pasolini's GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEWS, THE LAST TEMPTATION succeeds exactly because it eschews the conventions of the religious epic as it was established through the Hollywood works of directors like Cecil B. DeMille and Nicholas Ray. Scorsese and Schrader crafted instead an intimate character study of a man torn by doubt.The sermon on the mountain has a small crowd of 20 people, which enables a personable Jesus to mingle in and talk to them directly, while the scenes at the temple, filmed with the largest amount of extras in the entire film, have a sweaty, claustrophobic quality to them, exactly what it would have felt to be crammed in close quarters in the heat of the noon with 100 people. Scorsese's intention was to give a distinct visual look to the movie that would set it apart from anything else that had come before and he was quite successful at that. Take for example Pontius Pilate's interrogation hall, usually depicted as a lavish palace replete with Roman elegance and rows of armed guards, here becomes an austere vaulted room lit from a skylight - a nondescript place that could be anything and nothing in particular yet somehow feels right, like the library set Welles built for CITIZEN KANE.At the end of the day though, technical bravado and great acting aside, the movie is all about Kazantzakis' original material. Although condensed to a manageable length for the script, the movie preserves all the basic themes, fears, obsessions that permeate not only The Last Temptation but most of the Greek author's work. A man terrified to discover that his vocation is not to live life but write about it, to feel at home not in the company of others but in their absence. But in the same time a man torn by great guilt for not being the son his father wanted. It's hard to give an approximation of the pride Cretans feel for their particular homeland, their feisty temparement, or the unique philosophy of the people that was shaped by centuries of Saracen invasions and Ottoman occupation. Suffice to say that to this day there are towns high in the Cretan mountains the police is afraid to set foot in and you can see most of the road signs leading to them shot full of holes by AK47s (which Cretans use these days to protect their large crops of marijuana plants, not hesitating to open fire at police helicopters scouting the fields for them!). Seen in that light, the shy, introverted Kazantzakis that was fit to become neither respectable figher or politician was an affront to his father.Those that said that the book is more about Kazantzakis himself and his existential angst than Jesus are not entirely incorrect. Modeled after his author and with regards to his own personal philosophy, Kazantzakis' Jesus is a man torn between two natures, what he is and what he must become, the struggle to walk that path and follow his call to the end and the price he must pay for it. At the end of the day, protagonist, author and film had to suffer the same fate. Scorsese's film was banned in many countries and was the subject of much controversy for its allegedly blasphemous subject matter.

Thompson wrote by way of epigraph in his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man. On the other end of Hunter Thompson's drug cocktails and alcoholic debauchery, but faced with the same inscrutable dilemma of how one should live his life, lies Nikos Kazantzakis. In the heartbreaking autobiography he wrote just before his death (he finished only a first draft, the book was published by his daughter), Kazantzakis sums up the restless spiritual agony of a lifetime to turn flesh into spirit and leave behind nothing but a pile of bones for death to take.Why all this? Because this is not a Scorsese movie. This a Kazantzakis movie. Or more aptly, Scorsese understands Kazantzakis on a level beyond a simple adaptation. Never before have I seen a director translate with such emotional clarity and capture with such faithfulness the work of another author.

At least this time they're not breaking and entering like they were in the last movie, but have stationed them on a stake-out at a location that they are sure is going to be the next hit for the dreaded Wilson Heights Gang who, if nothing else, should definitely find someone else to come up with a threatening name so they'll sound more like a group of hardcore criminals and less like a gated community. But in other news, Harris is in charge of his own precinct now, Tackleberry's got a son, and some old characters like Mrs. Feldman and Fackler are back. I have to admit that I am still confused by feelings of reminiscence for Mahoney, not the least reason for which is that, believe it or not, this is the first genuinely stupid entry in the entire series. Yeah, they're slapstick comedies, but my god, how many decades have people been splitting their sides watching slapstick comedies? You could argue that the slapstick was the first real narrative story-telling that came along in film, and the Police Academies are no different, they just haven't stood up to the test of time so well.Oh, and they're also hampered by stupid-ass sequels like this one and the next one. And hopefully not part 8 which, at this point, remains theoretical.So what's going on this time? We have another small group of mind-bogglingly stupid bad guys, which is not a bad thing in itself, but apparently someone took my words too seriously when I originally reviewed Police Academy 5 and said that the movies are essentially kid's movies, because in this installment we get a cartoonish villain that is a bizarre combination of the Wizard of Oz and Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget. I guess I should be more careful what I say when I review movies.On the other hand, the first time I ever reviewed Police Academy 5 was about 22 minutes ago, so there is some legitimacy to the theory that it couldn't have affected the thought patterns of screenwriters Neal Israel and Pat Proft, who wrote Police Academy 6 back in the late 80's. But you never know. But get this, here's the supervillain's scheme &#x96; he plans to use his henchmen to raise the crime rate in a certain strategic location in order to drive down property values, then he'll buy up all the property himself, see that the crime rate goes back down and the property values up, and then live like a king off the interest or whatever for the rest of his life. Actually, when you think about it, that's not the dumbest plot pattern. In fact, compared to how moronic the rest of the movie is, it's not that bad. At least they didn't have a villain who tried to outdo even the most outlandish 007 villains and like, you know, hold the sun for ransom or something.Again, most of the original cast is back, but I still miss Mahoney and Zed, and the screenwriters (yeah, it took more than one to come up with this thing) unfortunately have no idea what to do with the characters that we've come to know and love laughing at. Everyone is undercover and their ridiculous assignments are supposed to generate automatic laughs from us, but worst of all, some of the scenes are such disassociated skits from the plot that the story as a whole falls apart. For example. in one attempt to get into a public place and question the public about the whereabouts of the criminals and whatnot, Jones, Calahan and Hooks go into a bar, where Jones puts on a show for all the barflies doing a brilliant impression of Jimi Hendrix to the delight of the crowd and then they leave without having learned or even trying to learn anything. But at least it's in keeping with the rest of the movie, which is the first tremendous step down into the depths of idiocy in the entire series. If you thought any of the previous movies were stupid, MAN you're gonna love this one! But I do have to say that, like part 5, there are some moments in this one that I distinctly remember loving to death when I was about ten years old, like the scene where the huge bad guy who looks like a lumberjack comes outside with an ice-cream cone with like eight scoops of ice cream stacked up on it and goes, Oh BOY! but then takes one lick, pushing it off where it lands with an audible splat on the pavement and he goes, Crapola!Okay, so it's not funny in writing. Sue me. But show me a ten year old kid who doesn't laugh at that and I'll show you a kid with some developmental problems that far exceed any of the time-wasting nonsense in this movie. By the way, as I mentioned in my review of part 5, make sure to watch the little reminiscent documentary that you'll find on the DVD, it might be funnier than anything in the whole movie! Check this out, besides glorifying the movie like it's some overlooked Oscar winner, director Peter Bonerz (my god, can you imagine having THAT name in junior high school?) lists off the numerous references and homaaaaaages that can be found within its pristine contents, including everything from Orson Welles to Hitchcock himself!Sadly, your brain has to be securely in the off position in order to enjoy the movie, but it may add to the comedy just to know that some effort was put in to put those references in there!!

With some great laughs scattered in along the way along with great acting talents this movie is a real treat. I first watched this movie last year for the first time (I just turned 15) and I suddenly realised how BAD some comedy films can be now-a-days. This film is the prime example of how a comedy aspect that, at one point was so original, is now tarnished by some of the movies that are produced now a days. Some of these movies are jokes now a days with basically the same story line and characters (ALTHOUGH REMAINED!), and all has a link back to sex!!!! American Pie is the first movie ever to do this sort of broad comedy and pulls it off very well and is a great film, although some films have copied the idea of this one and has dressed it up and makes it become quite a sick and offensive theme now-a-days. 10 years after this movie was made .. it's a classic and always will be. I love all of the first 3 movies with the original cast and was quite disappointed though i must say with one element in the third movie, which is that some characters do not return. I loved the characters Ozz, Vicky, Jessica and Heather and I thought that they all deserved back in the third and, especially Vicky as she and Kevin had a relationship in the 1st one and an awkward meeting in the 2nd and I thought that it would really pay-off seeing all of the main characters back together for one last time. But this didn't happen and, apart from this, all of the first 3 films are gems in my opinion. American Pie\/American Pie 2\/American Pie 3 The Wedding FANTASTIC TRILOGY!! GIVE 'EM A TRY!!

Some of these movies are jokes now a days with basically the same story line and characters (ALTHOUGH REMAINED!), and all has a link back to sex!!!! American Pie is the first movie ever to do this sort of broad comedy and pulls it off very well and is a great film, although some films have copied the idea of this one and has dressed it up and makes it become quite a sick and offensive theme now-a-days. 10 years after this movie was made .. it's a classic and always will be. I love all of the first 3 movies with the original cast and was quite disappointed though i must say with one element in the third movie, which is that some characters do not return. I loved the characters Ozz, Vicky, Jessica and Heather and I thought that they all deserved back in the third and, especially Vicky as she and Kevin had a relationship in the 1st one and an awkward meeting in the 2nd and I thought that it would really pay-off seeing all of the main characters back together for one last time. But this didn't happen and, apart from this, all of the first 3 films are gems in my opinion. American Pie\/American Pie 2\/American Pie 3 The Wedding FANTASTIC TRILOGY!! GIVE 'EM A TRY!!

With some great laughs scattered in along the way along with great acting talents this movie is a real treat.

Fargo, however, is my favorite Minnesota film. It's a typical Coen Brothers film and by far their best! Yeah, they make fun of our politeness and our Scandinavian-German accents. As kids we are taught at home and in school, as well as on the job to always say Please and Thank You, hold open doors for others, wait your turn, don't speak loudly or yell and we rarely use the word Yes, for us it's Ya. Some people were embarrassed by this but most of us are proud of our politeness and our Nordic roots. It's known as Minnesota Nice. So, as for Fargo, most of us loved it. None of us talk like the Officer who says, I'm gonna have ta ask ya ta git outta da curr. That said, most of the characters are spot on. Roger Deakins shows the bleakness of a prairie winter, but also its beauty. Carter Burwell's score has a tinge of Scandinavian folk to it. The Coens make fun of us but we don't mind because they've created a masterpiece in Fargo. The cast is superb Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch as Norm & Marge Gunderson are the heart of the film. Steve Buscemi as Carl Showalter, Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard are a fine trio of bad guys. Kristin Rudrud as Jean Lundegaard, Harve Presnell as Wade Gustafson and Bruce Bohne as Marge's partner Lou are terrific. My favorite character of the cast has a small part but plays it brilliantly and is in my favorite scene. He is Bain Boehlke and he plays Mr. Mohra who is the guy shoveling his driveway and who is describing Carl Showalter as a funny looking guy. I love that scene it really makes me laugh. In spite of its gore, the screenplay of Fargo is incredibly fascinating and very entertaining from beginning to end. Bravo Joel and Ethan!
