For me Rushmore is not just a great movie, it has something that few movies possess, something few works of art possess. It has originality. Ironically, the film borrows heavily from a number of films including Good Will Hunting, The Godfather, Serpico, and Apocalypse Now (remind me if I have missed one or two) but this doesn't take away from the fact that Rushmore stands alone. I also think that whether or not someone likes the movie is a judge of character. I'm not saying that if you don't like the movie this means that you're a bad person; it just means that you probably stand on the polar opposite from me on every significant issue in life. I realize that there's a bit of hyperbole in that statement but this is what Rushmore does to people.The film is positively laugh-out-loud funny in many places and it has something that makes the humor even more special. At the very core there is a sweetness that only very few films can pull off without being saccharine or maudlin. I think that this sweetness is also evident in the soundtrack (someone gave me the CD as a gift) which has a song called Kite flying society; what could be sweeter than that? Rushmore is so completely unlike any other movie about teenagers that it can't even be put into this category. I don't know if I speak for anyone else but more than anything else the movie makes me wish that I could go back to that age and be a little more like Max Fischer, something I think the director had in mind with the closing song in the film with the chorus, I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger. I remember hearing a reporter ask a celebrity if there is anything good about growing older. Without a breath of irony or sarcasm the 50 something star answered, Absolutely nothing.

Jaws 2 was a production whose rushed schedule showed clearly in every frame, but at least it made a noble effort to be good and still capture not only the same thrills, but the same charm as the original. So it wasn't dismal when it failed. However, with the revival of the wildly over-hyped and unnecessary 3D format of movies came the third installment, Jaws III also known as Jaws 3D. A little time has passed since the second movie. Martin Brody's (Roy Scheider from the first two movies) sons have grown up and one of them (a young Dennis Quaid) is a maintenance manager at Sea World. During his brother's (John Putch) visit, a great white shark busts through the underwater gates and begins to snack on people who venture into the park's waters. Eventually, the shark is captured, which leads to a jaw-dropping discovery the shark is a baby. So ignoring the fact that in reality sharks do *not* care for their offspring, the cardboard cut-out characters declare that its 35-foot-long mother must also be on the loose on opening day, of all times.Gone are the thrills and gone are the great characters. Looking back on the original Jaws and having the chance to see it in a theater for the first time (and meeting its screenwriter, the knowledgeable Carl Gottlieb) I am only further reminded of how strongly that movie succeeded because of three sharply-written, characteristic-packed characters who we believe in as human beings. They were essentially cutouts (a police chief, a mad hunter, a biologist) expanded into personalities we could relate to, people we liked, so that we rooted for the humans and condemned the sharks. Well, the characters here are more cutouts, but they remain so. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong do what they can, but they have nothing to expand their characters upon. Their motives and scenarios are flat, their passion nonexistent. The same applies for the supporting cast, with nobody standing out.For the record, I have only seen the two-dimensional format of this picture. Reportedly the movie is no longer available for 3D viewing because it was so cheaply done and looking at the film, I can see why. Because even if the optical hocus pocus were handled well, it would not excuse the incredibly cheap visual effects. Oftentimes when the shark attacks, it uses the same gimmick. First of all, the tracking point-of-view shot which was so terrifying in the original movie and so redundant in the sequels. The camera zooms in on the victim, in a close-up so extreme that we can hardly see anything, the screen goes red, and then out of plume of over-lit blood we see a digital image meant to be a severed head or leg float toward the screen. If it jumped out at you, it would only increase the stultifying reality of how fake it is. Sometimes the movie even throws in cheap gimmicks for a 3D shot for no reason at all, such as a ludicrous shot where the camera zooms in upon a masthead-like sculpture protruding over the entrance to an exhibit. Does the object have any plot relevance or does it even look particularly good? No. So why include this track-in shot? So the filmmakers could make a thing stand out for no particular reason.There are a great many horrid effects shots in the movie. Bad underwater sculpture and set design, including a submersible that was all too obviously a toy tricked into the shot. Effects like this had been done better twenty years before. As for the shark, the filmmakers make the dumb decision of using live shark footage for most of the scenes. As with the second movie, we see a lot of the shark this time around and by showing so much live shark footage and so few animatronics (which aren't too good this time around) the comparison is only more jarring. Sometimes the shark is also a digital effect, including an infamous shot where it rams through an aquarium glass, also not-so-convincing. And then there is a cheap rubber model used for the baby shark, which looks like something taken out of a TV movie.Actually, the whole movie seems like something taken out of a TV movie. It was directed by Joe Alves, the production designer for the previous two movies and unfortunately his directing talents are far below his ability to create models, animatronics, and sets. With many logical errors (such as a shark out-swimming a motorboat), lackluster character development, horrid special effects, and a distinct lack of joy, Jaws III results in being a very forgettable production. I guess that's the best I can say about it. That although it bored me as I watched it, I found no difficulty in forgetting the experience the following morning.

Don't get me wrong I love me a good vampire film but these vampires aren't very interesting at all. What is interesting is the heist and hostage plot at the beginning of the film that suddenly derails into a merely okay vampire film.I think there are moments in the first half of the film that match some of the great Tarantino moments. I love the black humor in the relationship between Seth and Richie. They are genuinely very interesting characters who are kind of repulsive but you can't help but be interested in them. The first twenty minutes of the film are brilliantly constructed. The liquor store scene is thrilling, suspenseful, and yet very funny at the same time. But what is even more interesting is the time spent at the motel. I love the scene where Richie interacts with the hostage as we know something terrible is about to happen to her but in typical Tarantino fashion he invites her to indulge on the TV with him. The Keitel plot line is seamlessly translated into this. I genuinely like his character and the interactions between him and the Gecko brothers are brilliantly played out. Keitel has a conversation with Clooney's Gecko about religion and faith at the wheel of a hideous RV which is fascinating and deep but is played through Tarantino wit. I was hooked. There is genuinely a very interesting take on religious themes with the Jacob character. Putting a religious man in Tarantino's world is just really bizarre and really fun and yet the dialogue doesn't make fun of the weight of this character. There's a tragic quality to him. Keitel gives a great performance.And as our characters reach the Mexican border things get less interesting. Vampires come from literally out of nowhere. Wow and I found myself saying just as this thing was getting good. Of course I knew the film was about vampires going in but I was hoping that it would continue through this lens. These vampires pop up out of nowhere and waste no time rampaging through everything totally putting whatever character development that was established to rest through gore. I like vampires I do but these vampires aren't interesting or scary. They aren't charismatic or sexy and they don't even talk. The make up design for them is cartoonish. It just isn't interesting at all. I've seen this done thousands of times before and it just is dumb because I don't see anything resembling a point happening here. And forget Tarantino's dialogue because once these vampires show up the only type of lines you'll be hearing are Stake him!, I've been bite, Bloodsuckers and that sort of thing. The thing that frustrated me most was seeing Keitels character in vampire make-up because he looks absolutely ridiculous. In a way that symbolized what I felt about the film. It could have been great if it stuck with the first part of the story but that RV made a wrong turn into stupidity.

Don't get me wrong I love me a good vampire film but these vampires aren't very interesting at all. What is interesting is the heist and hostage plot at the beginning of the film that suddenly derails into a merely okay vampire film.I think there are moments in the first half of the film that match some of the great Tarantino moments. I love the black humor in the relationship between Seth and Richie. They are genuinely very interesting characters who are kind of repulsive but you can't help but be interested in them. The first twenty minutes of the film are brilliantly constructed. The liquor store scene is thrilling, suspenseful, and yet very funny at the same time. But what is even more interesting is the time spent at the motel. I love the scene where Richie interacts with the hostage as we know something terrible is about to happen to her but in typical Tarantino fashion he invites her to indulge on the TV with him. The Keitel plot line is seamlessly translated into this. I genuinely like his character and the interactions between him and the Gecko brothers are brilliantly played out. Keitel has a conversation with Clooney's Gecko about religion and faith at the wheel of a hideous RV which is fascinating and deep but is played through Tarantino wit. I was hooked. There is genuinely a very interesting take on religious themes with the Jacob character. Putting a religious man in Tarantino's world is just really bizarre and really fun and yet the dialogue doesn't make fun of the weight of this character. There's a tragic quality to him. Keitel gives a great performance.And as our characters reach the Mexican border things get less interesting. Vampires come from literally out of nowhere. Wow and I found myself saying just as this thing was getting good. Of course I knew the film was about vampires going in but I was hoping that it would continue through this lens. These vampires pop up out of nowhere and waste no time rampaging through everything totally putting whatever character development that was established to rest through gore. I like vampires I do but these vampires aren't interesting or scary. They aren't charismatic or sexy and they don't even talk. The make up design for them is cartoonish. It just isn't interesting at all. I've seen this done thousands of times before and it just is dumb because I don't see anything resembling a point happening here. And forget Tarantino's dialogue because once these vampires show up the only type of lines you'll be hearing are Stake him!, I've been bite, Bloodsuckers and that sort of thing.

Law's childhood experiences are shown in flashback at length then disappear without much relevance to the story, as are the brief mentions of Fiennes Jewishness or his letter rebuking Law among other things. On the other hand some things are hammered in, such as (the impossibly perfect) Rachel Weicz's high intelligence. We need to be told it again and again because we never see it.

I guess there is a point to this, in saying that love makes someone act out of character but it is not well enough developed to be convincing.

I'm guessing the script was trying to make some point here but I just did not get it.Nazis v commies can hardly have been an easy sell. It is hard to deal with the clash of two such unpleasant totalitarian ideologies as these without the movie-goer thinking I hope they both lose! Obviously the film makers tried to inject as much humanity as possible and probably veers to much into Mills and Boon territory at times (He was a shepherd boy sniper and she was the intelligent courageous woman he loved!).

The main reason being that now, as an adult, I don't even view this as a horror film whatsoever. It played so much like a Broadway play (which it once was) with each line delivered a bit louder with perfect enunciation. Some of the characters were more relaxed, but McCormick and Kelly were very wooden and melodramatic. Since this film, I've lived through the teen fright night horror films we used to rent for fun in high school with Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, and the like. I even let my husband talk me into watching the first Scream movie which traumatized me so much that I gave up the horror genre altogether. Also, I've seen countless thrillers, mysteries, and suspense films. I'm sure I'm desensitized by modern Hollywood now, but The Bad Seed seems campy and utterly unbelievable now. The ending, thanks to the Hays code, is mild. So mild, in fact, I was watching it and wondering what in the world I'd been afraid of all of these years. However, I think it would creep any child out now or way back when. Therefore, facing my fear confirmed I was leery of only a distorted childhood memory.

From the slums of South Boston, Will is a diamond in the ruff, as he possesses natural intellectual capabilities far beyond what is typically achieved from any formal education. Despite his extraordinary intellect, Will is haunted by a long history of self inflicted legal problems. After unintentionally exposing his raw talent for mathematics, Will is approached by Fields Medal winning Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) who offers to resolve Will's pending legal issues in exchange for two things his assistance in solving mind-bending mathematical equations and his agreeing to speak with a therapist. With the unwavering determination of therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will is forced to uncover the secrets from his haunting past, confront his current misguided motivations and pressing relationship issues with lover Skylar (Minnie Driver), and evaluate the possibilities for his future. Good Will Hunting is a film that really drives home the idea that people who pursue an endeavor and lack the passion needed for fulfilling their venture, inevitably fail to generate success regardless of their talent. With the rallying support of those closest to him, Will remains uninterested in the countless opportunities he is presented through professional connections of Professor Lambeau, to do little more than use his highly evolved gift of intellect. Will's commitment to friends and his constant strive for self preservation are the only passions that drive his daily existence. He views his photographic memory and ability to solve the most complex of mathematical equations a burden, and uses his ingenuity only for personal gain or getting himself out of a sticky situation. Will's lack of interest in mathematics and defiant attitude towards the use of his incredible mind baffles and frustrates Professor Lambeau, as is boldly illustrated with the following remark to Will Sometimes I wish I had never met you. Because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing there was someone like you out there. Lambeau drops to his knees just prior to this line, and is looking up at Will who is standing in front of the Professor's door. The camera angle suggests that perhaps for the very first time, Lambeau feels inferior to someone who possesses no academic credentials or scholarly achievements. This is a significant and telling moment in the film since Lambeau proudly measures his success by the outstanding awards he has received over the course of his career. Lambeau spends his days living and breathing his love for mathematics. He has earned a Fields Medal and is highly regarded for his work. The Professor's self proclaimed success is, in his eyes, evident from the many awards he has received for his triumphs in mathematics. Similarly, therapist Sean Maguire considers himself a success in his own right. He draws upon his relationship with his wife and pursuing a career that he truly enjoys as being the factors that have made him a success. The noteworthy achievements for each of these men stem not from their intellect or unique talent alone; the passion they have for their work has led to their success. The very powerful message of what it means to be successful, and what it takes to get there, is carried from scene-to-scene throughout the entire film. Will Hunting is forced to expose his internal demons long enough to sift through years of baggage and determine what ignites his passion. Perhaps the most telling evidence that an insightful internal breakthrough is about to occur happens during the fourth therapy session with Sean, after Will had refused to speak to the therapist for the second week in a row. Very light music is the only audible sound at the beginning of the scene which then slowly fades into Sean whistling softly followed by a sudden silence. This brief moment of silence catches the attention of the audience directly before Will decides to finally speak. This dead track is strategically placed in this scene to draw attention to the fact that a change in relationship has occurred between the two characters. It also symbolizes an end to the fear of personal exploration that has prevented Will from facing his life head on, and finally puts to rest his days of cowering behind excerpts from an encyclopedia. Like so many people in the world today, Will Hunting spent twenty years of his life content with simply going through the motions of day-to-day life. Regardless of his incredible talent, there was no self proclaimed success because his talents were not his passion. Simply put, the foundation necessary for achieving success was nonexistent. Passion is not difficult to come by, but one must be willing to embrace their inner most desires and perhaps set aside their talents to proclaim to the world that their journey through life has been a success. Good Will Hunting brilliantly brings to light the dark side of success and the limitations of talent.

I personally really prefer a western that is being more straight-forward and gritty but simple fact remains that the sort of westerns like this movie, were still far more popular at the time and still had a big audience for it. The more typical John Wayne Americana type of westerns, in which guns form the solution to every problem and in which the hero always saves the day.The story of this movie really isn't that solid or interesting enough to carry the entire movie and make its 2 hours of running time good and entertaining to watch, throughout. In essence it's a story about reasoning versus violence, in which James Stewart tries to resolve everything with doing things by the book and law, while the Wayne character of course prefers to shoot first and ask questions later, so to speak. They try to convince each other that their way is the best and only one to follow, while in the mean time they are also fighting over a girl. I must say, the story sounds quite good actually the way I'm making it sound out now but in the movie it just never gets edgy enough and there never ever is a real clash between the two very different main characters, since neither Wayne nor Stewart are the bad guys of this movie.It besides is a slowly told movie, that takes its time to get to the point. As a result the movie is being filled with some overlong sequences, that in the long run hardly add anything to the overall end result. It all started out interesting enough with its non-linear story-telling at the beginning but this just seems a gimmick to make the story feel more original, while it in fact actually doesn't add much to the actual story.John Wayne never really have been known as a great actor and I also don't feel that this movie features his best ever performance. He's so wooden and purely and only relying on his charisma, while playing his role. Thank goodness things really get spiced up by Lee Marvin who plays a great villain.

The more typical John Wayne Americana type of westerns, in which guns form the solution to every problem and in which the hero always saves the day.The story of this movie really isn't that solid or interesting enough to carry the entire movie and make its 2 hours of running time good and entertaining to watch, throughout. In essence it's a story about reasoning versus violence, in which James Stewart tries to resolve everything with doing things by the book and law, while the Wayne character of course prefers to shoot first and ask questions later, so to speak. They try to convince each other that their way is the best and only one to follow, while in the mean time they are also fighting over a girl. I must say, the story sounds quite good actually the way I'm making it sound out now but in the movie it just never gets edgy enough and there never ever is a real clash between the two very different main characters, since neither Wayne nor Stewart are the bad guys of this movie.It besides is a slowly told movie, that takes its time to get to the point. As a result the movie is being filled with some overlong sequences, that in the long run hardly add anything to the overall end result. It all started out interesting enough with its non-linear story-telling at the beginning but this just seems a gimmick to make the story feel more original, while it in fact actually doesn't add much to the actual story.John Wayne never really have been known as a great actor and I also don't feel that this movie features his best ever performance. He's so wooden and purely and only relying on his charisma, while playing his role. Thank goodness things really get spiced up by Lee Marvin who plays a great villain. And when Lee Van Cleef is one of your henchmen, you know he's a very bad guy, you better not mess around with. Lee Marvin really seemed to be having lots of fun playing the hardened villain, of which the movie truly benefits.Of course it's not being an horrible movie by any means but I just feel that it's one that doesn't really stand out in any way and perhaps isn't really worthy of its reputation. But maybe you just have to be a true fan of the genre to fully appreciate this movie. 7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"30 April 2011","score":"","review":" This movie is laugh-out-loud funny, romantic in an anti-romance sort of way (I don't know what that means either) and has something to say about why men love sports.

ADMITTING THE BADDue to the lack of complexity and depth to the story, this film, ultimately, by the end of the movie, DOES FAIL to uplift intellectually, and to open one's mind to new and original ideas. It also FAILS to challenge deeply held sterile social beliefs, or to provide any new insights into the nature of reality, or to entertain the imagination with never-before thought of possibilities, or to take the viewer deep down into the depths of mystery! ... The story, unfortunately, is fairly hum-drum by science-fiction standards, and I was irritated by the employment of the central plot-device, in a science-fiction movie, no less, of yet ANOTHER testosterone-driven, bullying, ego-maniacal, dangerous, power-and-greed driven, unreflective male protagonist who screws things up for everyone around him.Surely, between the stars, there is more happening than what is happening here on Earth, and what can be seen in any mundane drama set in any dysfunctional, patriarchal, family-values household! And, also, I have to agree with so many other reviewers, who couldn't stand all the sex and nudity in space. Sex, nudity, dumb male-violence, testosterone - this is not what I want to see in a science fiction (or any other movie) - I want to be mentally-challenged and to see that which I have never imagined, and to be AMAZED!

THE GOODSPECIAL EFFECTS - This movie has EXCELLENT special effects, and the feel of the movie - the decor, the ship, the moon, the blue dwarf star (from which the title Supernova is derived) are beautiful, astral-coloured, far out, and evoke a highly desirable escape-to-the-stars-and-to-freedom visual and psychic experience, that no mundane drama would even attempt - and that is the beauty, and soul's delights, that science fiction offers!

That interaction was sublimely beautiful! And for that reason, by reason of that so well-developed, and complex yet innocent relationship; a poetic-interplay of exceptionally well-performed theatre that explores EXISTENTIAL FREEDOM and LOVE LOST, and despite all of the movie's failures to deliver much depth of meaning, I still had to give this movie 8\/10 ...(sob!).I also liked the mystery of the nine-dimensional matter device, and I think the mystery and unpredictability of such beyond-imagination, and yet still-scientific language, and such simple magical devices, is a good idea, since it means so much has to take place in the imagination - and the imagination is a whole nest of inter-dimensional portals in itself! Though such devices may resemble each other superficially, there is no way to know what their properties are - and that is why they are always so mysterious, so long as their secrets are not fully known or defined, nor properly understood.

I hear there are some foreigners who are actually gullible enough to believe Fargo is a true story!Hollywood is not the Department of Historical Documentaries, and it's not the Ministry of Patriotic Propaganda, which I suppose is the way movies are actually made in some countries. Sorry, but Americans do not go to movies like this for patriotic inspiration; they go to be entertained. And the Hollywood studios don't make them out of patriotic duty, they make them to make money, and mainly for American audiences. I, for one, was entertained. And I think most non-xenophobic viewers would be, too.I was skeptical at the beginning, afraid it would be another action movie with cartoonish characters and a shallow, improbable plot. But the movie did a good job of setting things up, especially with the captain explaining to his No. 1 why he was not ready for command, and the duties command entailed. The acting, all around was very good, the directing was fine, the script was well above average in creating and holding tension over a sustained period. My heart was beating hard and fast through much of the movie, so it worked.Yes, I have seen the full version of Das Boot, along with the entire commentary track, which is one of the finest movies ever made. It was a composite of actual historical events. The fictional Hunt for Red October was based loosely on rumors of some possible secret events described in the non-fiction history, Blind Man's Bluff. U-571 makes no claims to being based on any historical events. IT IS FICTION! To enjoy most Hollywood movies you must be willing to suspend disbelief. If you can't, go watch a National Geographic or BBC documentary (I have seen some BBC documentaries that had less historical accuracy than this movie, namely the Rome series).(Spoiler)That said, at the end of the movie, the producers pay tribute to those historical events some posters claim the movie maligns-- This movie is dedicated to the bravery of Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials from U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic-- May 9, 1941 -- Enigma machine and coding documents captured by from U-110 by HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia of the Third Escort Group, Royal Navy.-- October 30, 1942 -- Short weather cipher captured from U-559 by HMS Petard of the Royal Navy -- June 4, 1944 -- Enigma machine and coding documents captured from U- 505 by U.S. Navy Task Force 22.3.It's generally a good idea to actually watch the entire movie before writing a review. And when watching a movie like this with an historical setting, it's a good idea to go online and read about the actual history of the period. If a movie like this can inspire viewers to learn more about history, that's a good thing. But a fictional movie can sometimes breathe life into dry historical accounts, which I think U-571 does, and better than many movies made during World War II, which were, indeed, made in part to provide patriotic inspiration.I hope viewers will follow up by watching the episode about submarine warfare in the BBC's excellent 1973 documentary series, The World at War. It is a good place to start, but I feel it doesn't fully explain why the German U-boats ultimately proved so vulnerable. Some other notes. I talked to a submariner, and he said that every member of the crew was cross trained on every other member's duty stations, even the cook. This is hinted at in U-571. Yes, the Allies had an Enigma machine from the beginning of the war. It was smuggled out, piece by piece by Polish cryptographers. The Allies still needed the daily code settings, and the new four-rotor version introduced in 1942 for U-boat traffic. To decipher daily settings, they used an early digital computer at Bletchley Park called Colossus, part of the Ultra project, supervised by Alan Turing. (The ABC computer was the first fully functional digital computer.)Ultra was one of the technological devices that helped the Allies win the war, along with RADAR and the analog computer Norden bomb sight, which was kept secret long after the war, and so is little mentioned in films. While the Germans had Enigma machines, the Americans invented SIGSALY, encrypted PCM AD and DA spread spectrum companding voice transceivers. (You may have something similar in your pocket.) The Germans and Japanese hadn't a clue how to decipher the transmissions. It was called the Green Hornet because it sounding like buzzing to an undecoded listener. Bet you didn't know that (it was secret). I think all American fiction movies and TV shows should be banned from export because foreigners, especially children, often think they are real. This won't happen because so many foreigners insist on watching American shows, even when they say they are junk. Oh, and thank you, Britain, for for sending us millions of troops, planes, weapons and food to save America from being bombed and invaded by Nazi Germany.
