Sometimes it becomes a matter of merely facing the issue-- whatever it is-- but more often it becomes a matter of figuring out what happened in the first place, which can be a bit harder, especially if a good number of years have passed having relegated that source of darkness in the soul to the subconscious.  And though getting in touch with oneself is often a conundrum of monumental proportions, it's a necessary step in order to allow, perhaps, that better person inside to emerge.  It's just such a situation that is explored in `The Kid,' a heartwarming film directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Bruce Willis as a successful but cynical businessman who has a lot to offer, if only he would give himself a chance; which is just what he gets through the magic of the cinema.\tComing upon his fortieth birthday, Russ Duritz (Willis) has built a successful career as an image consultant, but he's also built a wall around himself that keeps everybody out.  He's perceived as a rather hard, shallow person, and he's reached the point where he doesn't even know who he really is himself anymore.  Not that he thinks about it too often.  He's lived so long behind that hard, external facade that gets the job done that he doesn't seem to care.  But it's taken it's toll.  He rejects his apparently loving and caring father, for example, but doesn't understand why, nor does he ever stop to even consider why it is so; it's gone on for so long it's just the way it is.  End of story and move along.\tThen out of the blue one night, an eight-year-old kid named Rusty (Spencer Breslin) shows up at his house.  Rusty is about to turn nine, doesn't know where he belongs and proceeds to turn Russ's world upside down.  Because Rusty knows things he can't possibly know.  Things that soon force Russ to take a step back and consider his life from a different perspective; things that open that channel that allows him to get in touch with himself at last, through Rusty-- a mere kid and a total stranger.  And as the story unfolds Russ discovers that Rusty is indeed a kid, but a total stranger?  Maybe not.  There's just something about Rusty that is too familiar, and the kid simply knows too much.\tTurteltaub has taken a sensitive situation to which many will be able to relate, and examined it through the medium of fantasy\/comedy\/drama to deliver an affecting, touching resolution to a universal matter of the human heart.  In the same spirit of films like `It's A Wonderful Life,' `Mr. Destiny' and the more recent `The Family Man,' he has used poetic license to peel away layers of cynicism and repressed feelings to get to the heart of the humanity that lives within us all, and he has done it successfully and to great effect.  In a world of fast-food and instant gratification, the story of Russ and Rusty is not unique; and it just may be that a film like this can become the impetus for resolution and communication between estranged parties in some cases.  Which, of course, would make this film more than mere entertainment, and thereby demonstrate the true power of the medium.\tAs he proved with such films as `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable,' there is much more to Bruce Willis than the action-figures he has created so well in so many other films (John McClane in `Die Hard,' for example).  Here he shows that he can tread that fine line between comedy and drama and make it work very effectively, which is no small feat.  He convincingly sells the hard-guy Russ at the beginning of the film, then just as convincingly sells the gradual transition and acceptance of a man who has for too long lived with a deception that has served to fool even himself.  It's a solid, strong performance that makes Russ believable and allows the viewer to embrace the characters and the fantasy that is being played out, which ultimately is what makes the movie work.\tBreslin, meanwhile, gives a natural performance that makes Rusty an endearing and credible character.  He's all boy and all kid, and because he's so real it is easy to empathize with him, which in turn opens that inner door to Russ, as well.  And he really clicks with Willis (who as an actor is very generous with Breslin, giving him his own space and moments), and their scenes become alternately hilarious and extremely moving. \tThe supporting cast includes Emily Mortimer (Amy), Lily Tomlin (Janet), Chi McBride (Kenny), Jean Smart (Deirdre) and Dana Ivy (Dr. Alexander).  In today's world (or anytime, for that matter), it's a treat to run across a film like `The Kid,' because it's not only entertaining, but a reaffirmation of the good that resides within us all, hidden away in many cases as it may be.  Well crafted and acted, this is a positive, feel-good film that celebrates the best side of the human spirit and puts a smile on the face of humanity.  And that's the magic of the movies.

This has a tendency to influence what I think, or even how I watch a movie.  I made the mistake of reading a few reviews of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion before I watched it.  As I watched Woody Allen's latest opus, a tribute to the quick-witted &#145;screwball' comedies of the late 1930's and early 1940's, I found myself mentally arguing with the reviewers.  The very issues they had with this movie were some of it's greatest features. The plotline for Scorpion is simple.  Allen portrays an &#145;old school' insurance company detective with a fantastic record for solving his cases. Helen Hunt is a `streamlining expert' brought in to bring the insurance company in-step with the `modern world' of the 1940's.  Allen and Hunt's characters are like water and oil.  The two are hypnotized (with a Jade Scorpion used to induce the trance, hence the title) in a stage show, and later the hypnotist calls on Allen to steal the very jewels his company insures; Allen has no knowledge he has done this.  The fun ensues as Allen attempts to find the person responsible for the thefts.  While this is an over simplification of  the actual story, the actual story is perhaps too simple and predictable as well, but this is not the reason people go to Woody Allen movies. It is the well written dialog that fits each person delivering the lines;  the meticulous attention to detail of a period movie that works like a time machine transporting the audience on a trip to sixty years in the past;  the unpredictable humor that fills each predictable twist.  These are things that makes this movie work.One review criticized the casting of Allen in the lead role.  Allen, now 66, `was not believable in a romantic lead', and the critic went on to suggest that another actor should have been used.  This thought was swimming through my mind throughout the two hours of the movie.  Allen was perfect for the role.  His character, C.W. Biggs, is an aging insurance investigator, with few redeeming characteristics.  He is not supposed to be handsome or attractive.  Yes, the Wood-Man is getting old, but it works for the movie. There are some unflattering shots where we see his Godfather-like jowls. This is not the same thirty-something guy from Bananas or Sleeper; he is a sixty-something old man.  We need to accept this.  It is apparent that the filmmaker has accepted this for himself, and tailored the film to work with this in mind.  Helen Hunt's Betty Ann Fitzgerald can't stand C.W. in any way, and it is only after Volton (David Ogden Stires) hypnotizes her in a magic show does she not show that she loathes him.  Sexy and rich socialite Laura Kensington, portrayed by the beautiful 26 year-old Charlize Theron, is attracted to Biggs because he the antithesis of her past conquests something new and different.  Sure, he could have cast someone else, perhaps Jason Alexander, into his Biggs role.  While it would have certainly made an entertaining movie, there would have been something lost.  Woody needs to be in Woody Allen movies.  It just works.Another critic panned the casting of Elizabeth (Saved by the Bell, Showgirls) Berkley with such actors as Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Wally Shawn, et al.  True enough, Berkley's acting talents do not match up with the names I mentioned; but the casting of Berkley for the minor role of office secretary &#145;Jill' is perfect nonetheless.  Allen's attention to detail cannot be overlooked.  I first noticed in his 1987 film, Radio Days, just how detail oriented he can be.  As a musician, and something of an aficionado of vintage musical instruments, I always look for anachronisms in period movies when a band is featured.  I can usually tell the year a wind instrument was made just by looking at it.  Not only were all of the instruments true to the time portrayed, the label on the mute (a Humes and Berg &#145;Stonelined') used by a trombone was correct for the period.  One off the shelf in a music store today looks identical, except for small differences in the label.  I was amazed that this level of detail was made.  I am convinced this level of detail was made in the casting as well.  This movie is not only set in New York in 1940, but also as a Hollywood movie made in 1940; clichés common to movie making of the time abounded.  I believe the casting of Berkley in her role is another one of these details.  A movie made in that time would have featured headliners from the stable of lead actors from a movie studio, or perhaps one loaned from another.  These would be people in the roles Allen, Hunt and Aykroyd had.  The role of the office secretary would not have been filled by a star, but by one of the studio's contract players sent to the production by central casting.  There were many young, gorgeous actresses with questionable acting talent that were picked up by a studio in hopes of her developing into the flavor-of-the-week, or maybe for just a ride on the casting couch.  Elizabeth Berkley filled this role flawlessly.  She hit her marks, said her lines, and that's about it.  I think it is just what the writer \/ director wanted.The ensemble cast all delivered credible performances.  Like a film of the time, the only performances that stand out are those of the leads; it is Woody Allen and Helen Hunt's movie, as it should be.  (William Powell and Myrna Loy stand out in front of the cast of 1934's The Thin Man, who remembers Nat Pendleton or Minna Gombel?)  Dan Aykroyd plays an adulterant Insurance Company C.E.O. in much the same way as his  dramatic performances in Driving Miss Daisy or My Girl understated and credible.  He allows the writing to do the comedy for him, without having to work at it.  Charlize Theron's (Cider House Rules, The Astronaut's Wife) roll is smaller than her on-screen presence.  She makes for a perfect 1940's screen vixen.  David Ogden Stires always gives a good performance, and was able to shake the shadow of M*A*S*H's Maj. Winchester for a dead-perfect evil magician. Wallace Shawn in a Woody Allen movie is like having ice cream on a slice of cherry pie; always a welcome presence.  You may also see a familiar face or two but can never place the name; John Schuck, a veteran movie and television actor (Sgt. Charlie Enright on TV's McMillon and Wife) is one of them.  It is apparent that the writing was crafted for the star players, and terrific casting took care of the rest.Movies can be many things.  Some can inspire, some can be extremely poignant.  Others can just simply entertain.  The Curse of the Jade Scorpion falls under the entertaining types.  A perfect diversion as a weekend matinee, or as a follow-up to a nice dinner out, Scorpion does not make use of low-brow humor and stays true to the 1940's flair the movie, itself, portrays.With romantic interests like Helen Hunt and Charlize Theron, Woody Allen gives all men hope as we get older.

This has a tendency to influence what I think, or even how I watch a movie.  I made the mistake of reading a few reviews of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion before I watched it.  As I watched Woody Allen's latest opus, a tribute to the quick-witted &#145;screwball' comedies of the late 1930's and early 1940's, I found myself mentally arguing with the reviewers.  The very issues they had with this movie were some of it's greatest features. The plotline for Scorpion is simple.  Allen portrays an &#145;old school' insurance company detective with a fantastic record for solving his cases. Helen Hunt is a `streamlining expert' brought in to bring the insurance company in-step with the `modern world' of the 1940's.  Allen and Hunt's characters are like water and oil.  The two are hypnotized (with a Jade Scorpion used to induce the trance, hence the title) in a stage show, and later the hypnotist calls on Allen to steal the very jewels his company insures; Allen has no knowledge he has done this.  The fun ensues as Allen attempts to find the person responsible for the thefts.  While this is an over simplification of  the actual story, the actual story is perhaps too simple and predictable as well, but this is not the reason people go to Woody Allen movies. It is the well written dialog that fits each person delivering the lines;  the meticulous attention to detail of a period movie that works like a time machine transporting the audience on a trip to sixty years in the past;  the unpredictable humor that fills each predictable twist.  These are things that makes this movie work.One review criticized the casting of Allen in the lead role.  Allen, now 66, `was not believable in a romantic lead', and the critic went on to suggest that another actor should have been used.  This thought was swimming through my mind throughout the two hours of the movie.  Allen was perfect for the role.  His character, C.W. Biggs, is an aging insurance investigator, with few redeeming characteristics.  He is not supposed to be handsome or attractive.  Yes, the Wood-Man is getting old, but it works for the movie. There are some unflattering shots where we see his Godfather-like jowls. This is not the same thirty-something guy from Bananas or Sleeper; he is a sixty-something old man.  We need to accept this.  It is apparent that the filmmaker has accepted this for himself, and tailored the film to work with this in mind.  Helen Hunt's Betty Ann Fitzgerald can't stand C.W. in any way, and it is only after Volton (David Ogden Stires) hypnotizes her in a magic show does she not show that she loathes him.  Sexy and rich socialite Laura Kensington, portrayed by the beautiful 26 year-old Charlize Theron, is attracted to Biggs because he the antithesis of her past conquests something new and different.  Sure, he could have cast someone else, perhaps Jason Alexander, into his Biggs role.  While it would have certainly made an entertaining movie, there would have been something lost.  Woody needs to be in Woody Allen movies.  It just works.Another critic panned the casting of Elizabeth (Saved by the Bell, Showgirls) Berkley with such actors as Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Wally Shawn, et al.  True enough, Berkley's acting talents do not match up with the names I mentioned; but the casting of Berkley for the minor role of office secretary &#145;Jill' is perfect nonetheless.  Allen's attention to detail cannot be overlooked.  I first noticed in his 1987 film, Radio Days, just how detail oriented he can be.  As a musician, and something of an aficionado of vintage musical instruments, I always look for anachronisms in period movies when a band is featured.  I can usually tell the year a wind instrument was made just by looking at it.  Not only were all of the instruments true to the time portrayed, the label on the mute (a Humes and Berg &#145;Stonelined') used by a trombone was correct for the period.

It would seem that the explosion of mindless teenie horror clones has taken a turn to something a bit more creative.  The story is simple and the characters are believable.  This film is NOT about 6 upper class white kids and an obligatory rich black friend (thrown in for ethnic equality purposes)running around trying to escape a psychopathic serial killer in a rich suburb of some picturesque little town. Rather, this film is simple and to the point.  Two college students stumble upon a monster created out of pure evil from some dark place in time... and spend the duration of the film trying to figure out what this thing is and why it wants to kill them.  I thought this film seemed very believable. The characters behave in much the same way you might in a similar (although unlikely) situation.  I had the feeling that there was a good deal of footage cut from the film as is evidenced by a lack of closure and some unanswered questions regarding character development.  My advice is to check this one out.  It looks like a sleeper hit to me.  And trust me, this Creeper is a bad mamma jamma.

I just got an updated cable system with all of these channels and movies and music.  So I was surfing and I came upon Slam.  I had no idea what it was.  I had never heard of the movie before, but I was familiar with Saul Williams and his work.  I had seen him on a documentary a few years ago. I thought the film was brilliant in the sense that it took a familiar topic and refreshed it. Slam was intense and real.  It was preachy without being trite, redundant, cliche, or just plain corny.  The actors were totally believable.  I bought it.  I bought it all, hook, line, and sinker.  And in the end, that's all I can ask of a film, to take me somewhere I want to go, but haven't been before.  This film was not afraid to tell the truth.  And again, more importantly it was not afraid to also tell us that there are no easy solutions or easy roads out.

The criticism of Pitt, Roberts and Gandolfini is especially perplexing, as they were all in top form.So why all the complaints? I don't get it. Yes, it was 10-15 minutes too long.

Plus Sally Field and John Malkovich are two of my favourite actors.And it was a good one.  Not once throughout the course of the film did I find myself glancing at the clock in boredom.  It's a remarkable movie from start to finish, although I must admit - the end scene somewhat confuses me.The movie in short, a woman (Sally Field) is widowed and will be forced to sell her farm unless she can pay off the debts her husband left.  The movie is set in 1935, and the woman takes the advice of a Negro traveller (played by Danny Glover) and sows acres of cotton.  She also takes in a blind man (John Malkovich) as a border to make a few extra dollars.  The events which follow are extremely well written, and excellently played by the chosen cast. Sally Field is the perfect choice for the role that she plays, as are Danny Glover and John Malkovich, who is ever so believable as a blind man.I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to others.  If you enjoy heart-warming, touching stories, you'll definitely enjoy this one.
