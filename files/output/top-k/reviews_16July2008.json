And while I do agree that it is in the top five in the horror genre, its not exactly a perfect film. It has its superb moments and its lackluster moments, in my opinion.As far as the good points go, Jack Nicholson is one of the obvious ones. Nicholson is a very talented actor and his role in this film is a display of his brilliance. He has the ability to turn almost every role he plays into a one-man show (for example, his iconic role as The Joker in 1989's Batman). He makes his character, also ironically named Jack, dimensional. He's menacing, conflicted, witty, and eventually psychotic. Danny Lloyd, also playing a character of the same name, also does a great job with his role as the little boy who sees all. The film in itself, based on the infamous Stephen King's novel, has a disturbing atmosphere to it. A few of the famous scenes (Redrum, the twins in the hallway, Here's Johnny!) definitely leave an impression on the viewer.As far as the negative goes, one big problem I had with the film was the casting of Shelley Duvall. She is, at least in my opinion, a horrible actress. Or shall I say over-actress. But, to her credit, I'm not sure if it was her acting or if her character was actually written to be shrill and stupid. Either way, she was distractingly bad and unintentionally funny in most of her scenes. Also, the running length does go a little long. It clocks in it at over 2 1\/2 hours. I can watch a film that long if the story keeps moving and developing. There are a handful of certain scenes that feel too drawn out and prolonged, dragging the pace of the film unnecessarily. I understand King's novel was very lengthy, but the film could've been just as effective if cut down about 30 or 40 minutes.That being said, this film is still breath-taking and much better than some of these 'slasher' flicks that have come out in the last decade or so.

That being said, believe it or not, I don't think I've ever seen all of Platoon which is usually considered the ultimate 'Nam movie. It's definitely on my list of films to see and soon. However if Platoon is the ultimate 'Nam movie than Born On The Fourth of July could be considered the ultimate follow up to the world the Vietnam vets returned to. The film literally goes from before the battlefield, to the brutality of the battlefield and Vietnam situations to the aftermath facing all vets when they return and in particular one very patriotic and determined man who loses everything in Vietnam. The film is not only brilliantly written and directed thanks in big part to a very close personal and creative relationship with Ron Kovic (who's story this is) but an absolutely mind blowing performance by it's lead star. So many moments in this film will make you feel emotion and anger and patriotism in a way that few films have ever done and probably only Oliver Stone could do with such incredible gusto.If you have ever wondered or doubted where Tom Cruise's Hollywood legend status came from just sit down and watch Born On The Fourth of July. He was absolutely robbed of an Academy Award playing this bold and moving and completely incredible performance as wounded veteran Ron Kovic. His character goes through such huge changes emotionally, physically and just in life. He starts as an eager High School graduate to a leader on the battlefield to this emotionally wrecked veteran to a man who speaks for his beliefs and Tom Cruise nails the role and you can just see the intense work and drive he put into this role. Definitely one of his best!! This film is truly all about Kovic and everyone else is a supporting cast member but it's a strong cast. Raymond J. Barry as his loving but devastated father, does a good job, Caroline Kava is really brilliant as Kovic's religiously fanatic mother, and Frank Whaley gives a moving performance as Kovic's boyhood friend who also returns from 'Nam mentally sick.I believe right now, if I could political for just a moment that Vietnam films are very pertinent right now to our current war situations around the world. That being a very unpopular war but this is a really moving film about a man who believed in what he was doing and slowly became aware of what he was facing when he returns home.

Also, since Richard Lester's Superman III was less than spectacular, people have back lashed against Lester's humor. I do believe Donner would have made a better Superman II. This movie is not perfect by any means, but that does not take away its charm and appeal. Superman II wastes no time springing into action, with an exciting opening with terrorists threatening to destroy Paris with a Hydrogen bomb. Superman of course saves the day by throwing the bomb into space, but the explosion destroys the Phantom Zone, freeing the three Kryptonian villains from the first film. Superman does not find out until it is too late; he has already given up his powers to be with Lois Lane when he discovers that Zod has captured the President of the United States! Superman must decide between love and responsibility. The scheming Lex Luthor shows up to take advantage of the situation, but he's really only in this film for comic relief.Terence Stamp is the best villain in the Superman series. His General Zod is so over the top he's hilarious, but he manages to be very threatening at the same time. He is probably more comedic than Donner would have wanted but I think his character works here just fine. What really makes this movie work is the love story with Lois and Superman. Superman's decision to give up his powers is very touching in this version, whereas the Donner version portrays it as a big mistake, almost selfish. I actually prefer Donner's version of the scene but Lester's is still good. And when Superman realizes he can no longer be with Lois Lane, he handles it like a man, not like a pansy (*cough Tobey Maguire cough*).For a while Superman II was popularly known as the best Superman movie, but Superman I seems to have gained favor with the public and the critics. There are legitimate reasons to like II better, mainly for the fact that it does not take an hour to really get going. Nevertheless I think Superman II has not aged as well as Superman. The Salkinds had a tighter control over the budget and a tighter schedule, so I think many special effects were rushed. The musical score suffered greatly too. Rather than rehire John Williams to write a new score, they hired a composer to just adapt the first film's score with a smaller orchestra. The music sounds like it was performed by a high school band. Gene Hackman refused to return to film any of his scenes again, so a body double and voice over actor were cast to fill in for him. His scenes are short but they stick out like a sore thumb. Marlon Brando is also missed, especially during the recap of Zod's trial.Richard Lester's humor is more intrusive than it should be, and it would only get worse in Superman III. Donner limited the humor to Clark Kent and Lex Luthor, whereas Lester injected humor with every no name supporting character possible, like the bellhop and the police. Superman II also has one of the same flaws as the first movie absurd powers. This time Superman can pull a cellophane S out of his chest, create holograms of himself, and give people amnesia by kissing them. Zod also has telekinesis.Still, Superman II is a lot of fun, largely due to the stellar cast. Their genuine performances really elevate what could have been a forgettable, cheesy 80's flick into something special. The Superman series influence can be felt today, especially in the Spider-Man movies.

And when Superman realizes he can no longer be with Lois Lane, he handles it like a man, not like a pansy (*cough Tobey Maguire cough*).For a while Superman II was popularly known as the best Superman movie, but Superman I seems to have gained favor with the public and the critics. There are legitimate reasons to like II better, mainly for the fact that it does not take an hour to really get going. Nevertheless I think Superman II has not aged as well as Superman. The Salkinds had a tighter control over the budget and a tighter schedule, so I think many special effects were rushed. The musical score suffered greatly too. Rather than rehire John Williams to write a new score, they hired a composer to just adapt the first film's score with a smaller orchestra. The music sounds like it was performed by a high school band. Gene Hackman refused to return to film any of his scenes again, so a body double and voice over actor were cast to fill in for him. His scenes are short but they stick out like a sore thumb. Marlon Brando is also missed, especially during the recap of Zod's trial.Richard Lester's humor is more intrusive than it should be, and it would only get worse in Superman III. Donner limited the humor to Clark Kent and Lex Luthor, whereas Lester injected humor with every no name supporting character possible, like the bellhop and the police. Superman II also has one of the same flaws as the first movie absurd powers.

Also, since Richard Lester's Superman III was less than spectacular, people have back lashed against Lester's humor. I do believe Donner would have made a better Superman II. This movie is not perfect by any means, but that does not take away its charm and appeal. Superman II wastes no time springing into action, with an exciting opening with terrorists threatening to destroy Paris with a Hydrogen bomb. Superman of course saves the day by throwing the bomb into space, but the explosion destroys the Phantom Zone, freeing the three Kryptonian villains from the first film. Superman does not find out until it is too late; he has already given up his powers to be with Lois Lane when he discovers that Zod has captured the President of the United States! Superman must decide between love and responsibility. The scheming Lex Luthor shows up to take advantage of the situation, but he's really only in this film for comic relief.Terence Stamp is the best villain in the Superman series. His General Zod is so over the top he's hilarious, but he manages to be very threatening at the same time. He is probably more comedic than Donner would have wanted but I think his character works here just fine. What really makes this movie work is the love story with Lois and Superman.

This film is not a hidden gem; the reason it hasn't matured with a good reputation is simple; for a thriller, there's just not enough excitement. Bruce Robinson's film is very well made; it has a good cast and they all perform well, but that really counts for nothing when the story is not interesting enough to keep the audience interested for the overlong two hour running time. Our central character is John Berlin; a police detective on the trail of a serial killer. The severed hand of a young girl has turned up in a parking lot and the detective soon starts to believe that the murder may be connected to an unsolved case that happened in the town some years previously. His investigation leads him to a blind institute where he meets and is attracted to a young blind girl named Helena. His suspicions about the new murder being connected to the old are not well received by his fellow cops; although he soon fears that Helena may be in danger.Director Bruce Robinson is best known as the writer and director of the seminal classic Withnail & I, but apparently his writing skills don't lend themselves to the crime genre very well. Jennifer Eight suffers from far too many drawn out and boring scenes where nothing really much happens, and even the film's most exciting moments aren't exactly exciting. The major problem is the fact that the film tries to blend two big story lines and doesn't have the capacity to do so. The romance between the police officer and the blind girl takes up far too much time and is both boring and plotted out in an unlikely manner. This leaves the murder plot almost a spare wheel in it's own film, and the way that the plot takes another turn midway through only helps to distract more, meaning that by the end we don't really care who the murderer is. The film's saving grace is the acting. I've never been a fan of Andy Garcia but he's solid in the lead role and gets good back-up from the always reliable Lance Henriksen. Uma Thurman doesn't really get to do much other than play the token 'victim' blind girl, and John Malkovich steals the show once he gets on screen. Overall, this film really is a big disappointment and doesn't really deserve digging up any time soon.

Packed with state-of-the-art action and non-stop special effects pay-off, TRUE LIES is also surprisingly strong with never-too-little bits of humor. Every frame of this, surely the best Schwarzenegger film since TERMINATOR 2, is packed with moments showing James Cameron's capabilities as a top-flight action director. In his previous efforts, Cameron used special effects wonderfully, but only treated them as machines to work out his imaginations with. TRUE LIES is no exception, and the special effects here, mostly during the slam-bang climax, are superb, but he never lets his stars and story undermined by effects.Big guy Ah-nuld gives an underrated performance (perhaps his best) as Harry Tasker, a secret agent unknown to his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis, brilliant here) and rebellious daughter (Eliza Dushku), who joined by his wisecracking partner (Tom Arnold) are sent on a mission to pursue a deadly international terrorist (Art Malik) who may be responsible for a bunch of stolen nuclear weapons. In the mean time, Harry also discovers that, due to his absences as a family man, his wife is already getting involved with another man. Thinking she may be cheating him, Harry keeps his watchful eye on her, but still makes sure he keeps his identity and career as a secret agent undetected.The film has its share of neat and exciting action scenes, including a neat chase scene where Arny chases a motorcycle-bound baddie while making sure his horse (literally) doesn't go tired on him. Then there's the explosive conclusion, a fight atop a large Harrier-type jet which is a triumph of stunt-work and outstanding visual effects. But when the action sets backstage for comedy, the film is more than saved. Arny and an enjoyable Jamie Lee Curtis look great, together or apart, especially when it comes to a comedic approach. Cameron has already proves his talents as an action director in many other films, but in TRUE LIES, he also reveals his capability to provide strong and offbeat bits of humor, and he rarely loses his stride.

Indeed, it is noticeably darker in tone and humour than the two Nazi-themed adventures on either side, and the premise of the Shankara Stones is admittedly far less glorious than the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. Nevertheless, the film is to be enjoyed purely for its success as a blockbuster popcorn picture, and few movies can match 'The Temple of Doom' for its adrenaline-charged action and unashamedly-campy sense of fun. Following the phenomenal success of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981),' director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas collaborated once more to bring the second chapter of Harrison Ford's rugged, whip-cracking archaeologist's globe-trotting adventures. Set in 1935, the film is actually a prequel to the original, and takes place almost exclusively in the dark, unchartered depths of India, where primitive holy rituals are still worryingly prevalent, despite the current British occupation.Unlike its two successors, which resurrected popular characters from the first film, 'The Temple of Doom' features only Harrison Ford reprising his role. Young Asian-American Ke Huy Quan is introduced as Indy's pint-sized but very useful sidekick, Short Round, an orphan picked up on the streets of Shanghai. Kate Capshaw, as the prequel's answer to Karen Allen, is severely lacking, though she's quite tolerable in the moments when she's not screaming her lungs out; director Steven Spielberg, who would later marry Capshaw, was evidently blissfully unaware of how annoying her voice could become after even a brief period of time. Nevertheless, Indy's love-hate relationship with Willie Scott provides some key moments of humour, particularly when the pair are in their respective rooms trying simultaneously to justify both their love and hate towards one another. The film's primary villain is an bald, intimidating thug named Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), a sadistic Thuggee high priest with a sinister grin. By collecting the five lost Shankara Stones and offering human sacrifices, he hopes to honour the great deity, Kali.Detractors of the series' most recent instalment, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008),' have gone to great lengths to decry the sheer absurdity of some of the action sequences. These critics have apparently overlooked the fact that 'The Temple of Doom' contains its own share of ridiculous moments, but, as it is all presented to us with such campish enthusiasm, we are quite willing to accept the story's occasional outlandish quirks. Inflatable rafts falling from light aircraft, warm monkey brains for dessert, bizarre sacrificial rituals involving the removal of a man's heart - it all adds to the pulp feel of the 1930s adventure serials on which Indiana Jones is based. The visuals effects - designed by Dennis Muren, Michael J. McAlister, Lorne Peterson and George Gibbs - still hold up exceedingly well after more than twenty years, and secured the film's only Oscar, from just two nominations. The initial critical response was mixed, and remains so today, but many have come to appreciate Spielberg's film for being such a rollicking good time.

Indeed, it is noticeably darker in tone and humour than the two Nazi-themed adventures on either side, and the premise of the Shankara Stones is admittedly far less glorious than the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. Nevertheless, the film is to be enjoyed purely for its success as a blockbuster popcorn picture, and few movies can match 'The Temple of Doom' for its adrenaline-charged action and unashamedly-campy sense of fun. Following the phenomenal success of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981),' director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas collaborated once more to bring the second chapter of Harrison Ford's rugged, whip-cracking archaeologist's globe-trotting adventures. Set in 1935, the film is actually a prequel to the original, and takes place almost exclusively in the dark, unchartered depths of India, where primitive holy rituals are still worryingly prevalent, despite the current British occupation.Unlike its two successors, which resurrected popular characters from the first film, 'The Temple of Doom' features only Harrison Ford reprising his role. Young Asian-American Ke Huy Quan is introduced as Indy's pint-sized but very useful sidekick, Short Round, an orphan picked up on the streets of Shanghai. Kate Capshaw, as the prequel's answer to Karen Allen, is severely lacking, though she's quite tolerable in the moments when she's not screaming her lungs out; director Steven Spielberg, who would later marry Capshaw, was evidently blissfully unaware of how annoying her voice could become after even a brief period of time. Nevertheless, Indy's love-hate relationship with Willie Scott provides some key moments of humour, particularly when the pair are in their respective rooms trying simultaneously to justify both their love and hate towards one another. The film's primary villain is an bald, intimidating thug named Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), a sadistic Thuggee high priest with a sinister grin.

Some movies are better than the novels their based on and others although they stray quite far afield are comparably good.There was no necessity to junk the original here though, and what's much more important, the result is FAR, FAR less interesting than the original, even considering just the story itself and not so much language, etc.Though this is I think quite a good movie, with strong acting, it's also a thoroughly conventional story. OK it's still somewhat unusual (though hardly unique) for the feminist heroine to have done considerable time as a prostitute (calling her a whore is entirely within the sense of the novel but seems contrary to the ultimately squeaky clean feminist spirit of the movie) but she was after all an orphaned little girls escaping clerical rape and pedophilia in the movie version, had few options, and didn't know what she was getting into (that last does mirror the book). But otherwise it's a thoroughly conventional tale that hardly strains our sympathies for Moll or makes us wonder how she kept or ever rediscovered her heart and soul &#150; as the book most certainly does do.You see my problem is that not only could a movie have closely followed the plot and events of the novel (chopping some side stories of course), but it would have been a FAR, FAR more interesting film if had. Defoe's (he also wrote Robinson Crusoe) famous subtitle may give you some flavor The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders, &c. Who Was Born in Newgate, and During a Life of Continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, Besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, Five Times a Wife (Whereof Once to her Own Brother) Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at Last Grew Rich, Liv'd Honest, and Died a Penitent. The novel's Moll wasn't just a whore, but determined to become a damn good and successful one. She threw herself into her work unreservedly &#150; unlike in the movie. She was an enthusiastic thief, with her own rationale and justification. She married five times, often with a gold diggers purpose. She ended up in colonial Virginia in its early days, when fortunes could and were being made by all kinds of clever people (though almost always by men), and made hers from a beginning there as an indentured servant (as a judicial punishment), that is, a quasi slave for a period of a few years.The Moll of the novel was a true female adventurer. Like most males who have been through and seen so much, and who had risen based on her cold calculations about people and by using people and their weaknesses, we wonder if she can ever really feel again, but she can and does, when she gets some security. The real Moll Flanders is a fascinating female figure, and to write so sympathetically (though not without some deprecating and ironic asides from time to time) was truly revolutionary in the early 18th century. History of literature aside, she remains a fascinating character &#150; much more so than this movie's rather Disney feminist heroine, who never wants to do any of the bad things she does and stops doing them as soon as she possibly can, consistent with her love commitment, etc., etc.Interestingly when a movie was done of Tom Jones, who was in some ways a rather similar if a bit less sympathy challenging male character living in more or less the same time period, the movie stuck much more closely to the original story - and that film was done some thirty-five years earlier. Those two characters, Moll Flanders and Tom Jones were perhaps the two most notorious sexual rakes of the highly popular early English novel. Too bad the even more interesting female rake is so toned down for full or facile feminist hagiography purposes, I suppose &#150; that is to say, for full enthusiastic acceptance by the widest possible contemporary female and other audience.I only hope someone will do a movie that is or could be entitled The Real Moll Flanders.

The 12 characters are not caricatures their complex motivations and thought processes are skilfully played out in an very dramatic--and yet highly plausible--plot, and this is certainly no mean feat. Analyzing this film can provide hours of fascination.The formidable cast gives virtuoso performances, particularly from Peter Fonda, Lee Cobb, and E.J. Marshall. The exchanges that take place in this small room--giving the feel more of a stage play than a movie--will stay with the viewer for many years. This film clearly deserves its current (July 2008) rank of 11 on IMDb's Top 250 List. The later remake does not do it justice--this is undoubtedly the version to watch.

So after about 2 years of first seeing the film my brother purchased the DVD Schindler's List, the first day he had it and watched it. From the start you see a seemingly greedy and uncaring business man who cares only for money, he is also a member of the Nazi Party, the infamous political party ruling Germany at that time led by none other than Adolf Hitler. Nazi Ideolgy stressed the greatness of the German people and race, they hated peoples such as Jews, Slavs, Roma and homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, the mentally or physically disabled, communists, liberals, and social democrats along with other ethnicities. So from the the moment you know Schindler is a Nazi the general reaction is that he is an unlikeable characters and and through common perception of Nazi-ism, a cruel man. But his character shows not much of the sort, in the scene where he is dancing, laughing and drinking with friends you see him to be a joyous and fun man. throughout the film Oskar Schindlers character steadily changes from the greedy, uncaring Nazi businessman to the selfless humanitarian who, in fact, lost everything to save his Jewish workers ( now known as Schindlers Jews ).Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler very well indeed and his acting in this film is testament to his overall success as an actor and is, in my opinion, his best film by far. I like how the character Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes, is used to personify Nazi idealism, Nazi Cruelty, Bruttality and a complete lack of respect for human life and humanity itself with scenes such as the ones where he wakes up in the morning, picks up his sniper rifle and hunts down Jews as if they are animals, as if its a sport and when he just point-blank shoots Jewish men without remorse or mercy.On the whole, Schindler's List is a Powerful and emotional film which is testament to Steven Spielberg's Directing skill and is a must see.
