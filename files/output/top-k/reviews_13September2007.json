Their first film came months after the show broadcast its final episode.Star Trek Generations does not begin in the 24th century. Original show stars Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Checkov (Walter Koenig) attend the maiden voyage of the new USS Enterprise B. Unfortunately, the undermanned ship picks up a distress call from two ships caught in some kind of energy ribbon that will soon crush them. With no other ship in range, they manage to save 47 passengers, but at a very steep price. The electrifying opener is the movie's highlight and sets up the two most important story lines.Seventy-eight years later, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the Enterprise D are sent to investigate the attack of a Federation Space Station orbiting the Amagossa Star. Here, the crew meets a scientist named Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), seen earlier as a survivor of the energy ribbon's carnage. Upon repeated insistence, Soran is allowed to return to the station, and then becomes hostile.I saw the movie before I saw the show, and after seeing First Contact. I enjoyed it then, and now, after seeing episodes the show, I believe it does an acceptable job of transferring the characters from television to screen. Star Trek The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Kahn introduced the original crew to theater, but neither did well at using all of its characters. Generations does.There are also new challenges, such as the new emotion chip installed in Data (Brent Spiner). While the effect is amusing the first time he drinks a beverage and hates it, the humor begins to become lame. The chip hampers the investigation when Data starts laughing at jokes he heard years ago, then feels fear and remorse.The Star Trek films have a rich history of great villains. First there is Ricardo Montalban's Khan, Christopher Lloyd's Kruge, then Christopher Plummer's General Chang. McDowell takes the standard left by films II, III and VI and lives up to it. Soran's singular obsession has so consumed him that he does not care how many people he murders in blind pursuit of his goal. Soran is quieter than the others, but his peerless scientific knowledge makes him the deadliest foe yet.Sadly, the script is filled with mistakes. Soran must manipulate the ribbon to achieve his goal, yet he seemed to be succeeding when he was beamed off the doomed ship at the beginning. Its speed is another problem. It covers the incredible distance between Amagossa and Veridian in a scant few days, yet it takes several minutes to pass through Veridian III's atmosphere during the climax. According to the simulation, it should not enter the atmosphere, until its course changes. Clock errors also hurt the illusion. The Enterprise B's hull integrity reads 82 percent. Twenty seconds later, it is down to 40, yet the ship lasts for several more minutes. Captain Harriman (Alan Ruck, looking fifteen years older than he did in Ferris Bueller's Day Off) volunteers go to the deflector control then Captain Kirk halts him. What does he do? He stops to think for several seconds while the ship is being ripped to pieces. Later on comes the annoying clich√© where one person tries to pull another from danger, their hands cannot reach, the second slips away, and the first can magically reach him now.This film should have won a Visual Effects Oscar.

I happened to fall upon it about 5 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. Since then I have seen it many times and it is now one of my favourite movies.It's 1955, and a Butler, a Maid, and 6 guests, are invited to Hill House where they quickly get involved in 6 murders! We are introduced to Wadsworth (Tim Curry) the butler who arrives first and Yvette (Colleen Camp) the French maid. Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) arrives next followed by Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mr. Green (Michael Mckean), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), and Ms. Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren). At the mansion they are all introduced to Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving) who they discover has been blackmailing them all. In order to keep things quiet Mr. Boddy gives each guest a lethal weapon; the lethal weapons are of course, the revolver (to Professor Plum), the lead pipe (to Mr. Green), the rope (to Mrs White), the knife (to Mrs Peacock), the Candle Stick (to Ms. Scarlet.), and the Wrench (to Colonel Mustard). He states that if they expose him to the police they will also be exposed and humiliated. When Mr. Boddy suddenly dies after being shot the group suddenly finds themselves tangled up in a web of lies, murder and hilarity as they try to find out who did it. . Clue has everything a good movie needs. It has all kinds of comedy, from slapstick to just plain funny statements. It has an intriguing mystery, with many twists and turns along the way. Tim Curry is amazing as always, Christopher Lloyd gives a solid performance as Professor Plum who lost his licence for doing the thing that male doctors aren't allowed to do with their female patients. Martin Mull, who some may recognize from Sabrina the Teenage Witch, also gives a solid performance. The acting in fact is solid all around; everyone in the cast gives a great performance.At the end of the movie they show three alternate endings each one more insane and hilarious then the other; even though some endings may not make sense or may even seem impossible it is still great because it is so insane and funny.Fans of the board game will definitely like the movie. The movie certainly has the feel of the game and the house even looks like the board. They of course did not forget the secret passageways. They do come up and later have a very big impact on the plot. Fans of Tim Curry will no doubt enjoy the movie because Tim Curry is, well Tim Curry! When all the murders have been committed he states, Alright, I know who did it, and then immediately does a whole recap of the entire movie starting from when Colonel Mustard first arrives, all the way to the point where he reveals who the murderer is. This clearly is the best scene in the whole movie because Tim Curry shows just how brilliant he is, he explains what happened, how it happened, all in about 5 breaths and while acting it all out. This scene alone will make anyone who isn't a Tim Curry fan into a Tim Curry fan; this scene illustrates perfectly why he is so respected.So this weekend, go out and rent Clue because with extremely solid performances and a great story and intriguing mystery, Clue rates at 9\/10 and is clearly an 80's classic.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"13 September 2007","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Before watching this on DVD just now, I had not seen director\/screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore's internationally renowned hit movie - at least the 123-minute version - since its initial 1990 release in the U.S., but I remember having mixed feelings that ran the gamut between being moved by its genuine poignancy and being resentful about what I felt at the time was its shameless heartstring tugging. Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.The plot begins with Salvatore ensconced in middle age as a successful film director based in Rome. Unexpectedly, he makes plans to return to his hometown in Sicily for the first time in almost thirty years. The reason is two-fold the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist who first introduced Salvatore to films, and the demolition of the Cinema Paradiso theater where they showed films to the enthusiastic denizens every Saturday night. This triggers memories of Salvatore's childhood at the old theater with Alfredo and then his adolescence and young adulthood when he falls in love with a beautiful local girl named Elena. In true Romeo and Juliet fashion, he is separated from his one true love by her disapproving father, a wealthy banker, and I have to admit this is the part of the film I still find a bit predictable with Tornatore's Baroque sense of romanticism in high gear. The scenes that really have enduring impact are those between the young, energetic Salvatore, nicknamed Toto, and the surly but lovable Alfredo. Tornatore captures the magical bond between the two, including a tragic episode that forces them to reverse their roles in the projection room.Interestingly, the 174-minute version presented on the second disc of the 2006 two-DVD set fills in the blanks about Elena's fate. The older Salvatore is reunited with Elena and finds out the truth behind their separation. While I enjoyed and appreciated the longer director's cut, I feel overall the additional scenes don't add as much dimension to the story as the nearly three-hour running time warrants. I think my preference for the heartwarming Alfredo-Toto scenes gravitate me more toward the 123-minute version presented on the first disc. The central performances are memorable with the obvious standouts being Phillipe Noiret (Il Postino) as Alfredo and cherubic Salvatore Cascio as Toto. Looking like a Neapolitan Josh Hartnett, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) takes over as Toto and brings youthful, hormonally-driven fervor to the role, and Agnese Nano brings the requisite dreamy quality to Elena.As the older Salvatore, Jacques Perrin (Z, The Young Girls of Rochefort) bears so little resemblance to his younger counterparts that his performance feels somewhat removed. In the longer version, his performance resonates more, especially as he shares the screen with Brigitte Fossey (Forbidden Games) as the older Elena. The famous screening room ending is in both versions - the showing of Alfredo's gift to Salvatore, a reel of film clips highlighting kissing scenes excised by the local priest - though I find just as touching the theater demolition scene with the now-aged villagers looking on in a most resigned manner. Blasco Giurato's cinematography is stunning throughout, and enough cannot be said of Ennio Morricone's memorable music score, one of cinema's most beautiful in evoking the movies aura of romantic nostalgia.Beyond the director's cut of the movie, the 2006 Limited Collector's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, Exploring a Timeless Classic. Of more anecdotal interest are a four-minute short on how Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood has embraced the film with an annual outdoor showing encouraging more than a few romances; two theatrical trailers - the original and the director's cut released in 2002; and most inconsequentially, a Food Network show with Napa chef Michael Chiarello with recipes inspired by the movie.

It is a rough, intense, brutal, and very hard to watch film that is so effective and so shocking, I have to recommend it. It is not only disturbing due to what happens to these two girls, but also how hard it is on the country that it takes place in. I can't say the film is prejudice because these kinds of things can happen. It's an extremely realistic depiction of two girls, who are best friends, who are accused of smuggling drugs into Thailand and put in a Thai woman's prison. Meanwhile, back in the states, a lawyer(Bill Pullman) tries to get them out. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale do a wonderful job as the two girls. I was especially surprised with Kate Beckinsale, in one of her earliest roles, because she plays in really meek and innocent, which isn't the way I'm used to seeing her. I was able to really sympathize with Claire Danes since she had a much more normal reaction, while Kate Beckinsale was in denial a lot of the time and was a little oblivious to the situation at first. None the less, they both do wonderfully. The film's structure is interesting. It starts out pretty innocently, kind of like a type of vacation movie crossed with two girls who cause some trouble. But then it switches gears and turns really nasty about 45 minutes in. It never lets up until the heart wrenching ending. The score in the film is sort of an intense kind of Oriental type of melody mixed with a sort of industrial beat. You hear it a lot early on, but it's especially effective in the last act when it's used. It just moves you. This film is quite a tearjerker. I can't ruin the ending, but I'll say that it's a difficult to take. It's not the kind of ending that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, because it can't really end any differently, but it's a very anti-Hollywood type of ending, meaning it doesn't end as happy as one would like. This is the kind of film that just draws you in. Right from the start, the narration just draws you in and keeps you interested. In the middle of the film, you'll want to stop watching but you can't because you've gotten so far in, but you get the feeling that it won't have a happy ending. After that, when you feel the girls still have a chance, you want to keep watching just to see the ending. When the ending occurs, you'll feel affected.

Based on the wry 1963 Charles Webb novel, the film itself holds a special affection among its original audience even now, the aging Vietnam War-era population who championed anarchy and the people who revise their personal histories, so they can think they were members of the now-fashionable counter-cultural movement. At the same time, it has a timeless quality for new generations simply because it's a consistently witty, observant piece of cinema targeted to anyone who has experienced that sense of post-academic confusion when the responsibilities of real life inevitably intrude.This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to Angels in America and Closer, Mike Nichols seems to have come into film-making fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the protagonist's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end. Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper-middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui.As Benjamin figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is shrewdly observed and downright hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne, Esmeralda and Aunt Clara from Bewitched, make indelible marks here); and the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, and Elaine's fianc√©e appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also a few forgivable geographic gaffes - most of the campus scenes are not filmed at Berkeley as portrayed in the film but at USC, and Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine.The 2007 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD contains two separate commentary tracks, both insightful but for different reasons - the first is an anecdotal remembrance with Hoffman and Ross quite engaged with details of the filming (Hoffman apparently had quite a crush on Ross and still does), and the second has Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh discussing all aspects of the production from casting to camera set-ups within specific scenes. The main featurette is the new 25-minute Students of 'The Graduate', which amounts to an extended appreciation of the film from Henry; producer Lawrence Turman; two film scholars; various directors (Harold Ramis, Marc Forster, Valerie Faris & Jonathan Dayton, David O. Russell); and film critics (Newsweek's David Ansen, Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman). The second new short, The Seduction, is a nine-minute retrospective look at the famous scene where Mrs. Robinson nonchalantly pounces on Benjamin. The participants from the first featurette are involved here as well, and it provides a good dissection of not only the scene but the sexual mores prevalent at the time of filming.There are two holdovers from the 1999 DVD release. The first is the 22-minute 'The Graduate' at 25 produced in 1992 for the laserdisc release. It has the advantage of participation from Hoffman and Ross but otherwise echoes the information presented in the newer retrospective featurette. The second is a 22-minute interview with Hoffman done in quick takes. He lends invaluable and often amusing insight into his selection for the role and the film-making experience. He also talks about the proposed sequel which one can assume eventually turned into 2005's execrable Rumor Has It.... Beyond the original theatrical trailer, the DVD contains a print of the film that makes it look as good as it did in its original release. There is a bonus soundtrack sampler CD with four of the distinctive Simon and Garfunkel songs featured in the movie - The Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair\/Canticle, April Come She Will, and of course, Mrs. Robinson. Lastly, there is a helpful six-page booklet that fills in the rest of the blanks on the production. This is a great package for a classic film.

The second new short, The Seduction, is a nine-minute retrospective look at the famous scene where Mrs. Robinson nonchalantly pounces on Benjamin. The participants from the first featurette are involved here as well, and it provides a good dissection of not only the scene but the sexual mores prevalent at the time of filming.There are two holdovers from the 1999 DVD release. The first is the 22-minute 'The Graduate' at 25 produced in 1992 for the laserdisc release. It has the advantage of participation from Hoffman and Ross but otherwise echoes the information presented in the newer retrospective featurette. The second is a 22-minute interview with Hoffman done in quick takes. He lends invaluable and often amusing insight into his selection for the role and the film-making experience. He also talks about the proposed sequel which one can assume eventually turned into 2005's execrable Rumor Has It.... Beyond the original theatrical trailer, the DVD contains a print of the film that makes it look as good as it did in its original release. There is a bonus soundtrack sampler CD with four of the distinctive Simon and Garfunkel songs featured in the movie - The Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair\/Canticle, April Come She Will, and of course, Mrs. Robinson. Lastly, there is a helpful six-page booklet that fills in the rest of the blanks on the production. This is a great package for a classic film.

One of the main reasons is that they were not planned until the first film became so successful. This success prompts movie studios to make a needless sequel in the hope that the name alone will draw big bags of currency. These sequels are often bad because the originals did not leave any space for another movie. Speed 2 Cruise Control is a sequel in name only. It cost nearly four times as much as Speed although its earnings were significantly lower. No link exists in setting and plot, and the premises are completely different.Sandra Bullock reprises her role as the lovable Annie Porter, this time with Jason Patric playing her boyfriend. The dialogue explains that she broke up with Keanu Reeves' character from the first film for a number of reasons, but the real reason is that Reeves did not want to make a sequel. A bald Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer have cameos, but aside from that and a few humorous references to Speed there is no connection.Annie and her boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) decide to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the luxurious Seabourn Legend and have the bad luck to be on the same vessel with John Geiger (Willem Defoe). Geiger spent years designing the computer systems on the ships and can take control from his laptop. He is bitter because his exposure to the computers gave him severe copper poisoning and the company fired him when they found out. He now takes several prescriptions and carries a jar of leeches to suck the copper from his blood. Apparently nobody learned from George Washington's death.After murdering the Seabourn Legend's captain, Geiger sets off a series of smoke bombs, conveniently hidden in his golf clubs, and gives the first mate (Temuera Morrison) fifteen minutes to evacuate. This proves to not be enough time, but Geiger restarts the engine anyway, and sets it on a collision course with a colossal oil tanker.Willem Defoe, The Man with the Golden Laugh, comes through with a rock solid performance once again. He is funny, charming, and extremely weird. Take for example when he vents towards the ship's captain. He sates, That's what really infuriates me, you don't even know what I'm talking about! in a voice of anguish that does not sound normal. Nothing about Geiger is normal. I felt sorry for him, but not enough to justify his actions. After seeing this and Spider-Man, my dad wondered out loud if Defoe could go into public places without getting funny looks.The action onboard the ship is the film's best in concepts, execution and intensity. Director Jan de Bont establishes many of the ship's sets so the layout seems familiar when the action starts. It is in the final half hour that the operation falls apart and loses its recommendation. It involves a nutty boat chase and a crash scene that is supposed to be amazing but is undermined by fake effects and jokes that seem inspired by Abbott and Costello.Another turn off may be the absurdity of the stunts, such as the sequence with the seaplane or the bit where Shaw floats mere feet away from one of the liner's propellers and eventually stops them with a cable. Speed 2 embraces its goofiness with pleasure, but overkill proves to be its undoing. It is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made, but it too often crosses the line into farce.

A dumb thing about this movie is that there is no mention of Laurie's son John (played by Josh Hartnett in H20)! Where are the new answers promised? The links to the previous entries? Probably in Akkad's bank account.Screenplay-wise, this has to be the thinnest of all the Halloween films. The lead characters are so beyond underdeveloped it's a screen writing crime.

First off, sharks cannot stand out of the water for two resons. 1-They're bodies are too bulky and huge and can't be able to balance themselves on their tales. 2-If they do manage to balance themselves, how will they be able to breathe? it's gills were flaring, but i didn't see any water on them!! also, the shark roars. this mistake was also made in jaws 3, but jaws 3 was actually better than this...thing. also, what i said earlier about the shark platform visible in some scenes? the other 3 jaws films succeeded in keeping the platform and machines invisible (except in jaws 3, but you can barely see it because its so dark underwater, and it's for an extremely short time). also, there's no jump scene. in the other 3, there were 3 corpses popping up here and there (ben gardner from J1, the boat driver from J2, and overman from J3). in JTR, there is no gross-scary-corpse part so that just takes away all the suspense. another thing JTR failed, was originality. If you think this film has an original story, see the 1977 Jaws rip-off Orca. On the film's poster it says Orca is the ONLY creature who seeks revenge other than man (i can't believe the creators of JTR missed that) and that the plot of JTR is strangely similar to ORCA, about a sea creature filled with rage and kills people for revenge. another bad thing about JTR is it's location. i'm not saying it shouldn't been set in the bahamas, the bahamas are beautiful, wonderful place. but great whites (as said in the film) can't survive in the water surrounding the bahamas. also, the wtaers in the bahamas are very clear blue. in the scene where they try to attach a transmitter to the shark, we see that the shark sticks out like a sore thumb in the ocean. when it dives underwater, and they lose sight of it, i just laughed. they're on a boat, in the middle of the most crystal clear ocean in the world. i don't know about you, but if a huge clunky, rubber, 27 foot long mechanical shark was in the water surrounding me, i'd notice it from a mile away. how the guys on the boat lose sight of it so easily and instantly, i have absolutely no idea. this brings me to m next point. the death\/attack scenes. this film has the lowest death\/attack count in the whole series.

J3 had the highest if you count the 5 or 6 people killed by the shark plus the 7 or 8 people injured when the shark tore apart the dock. in JTR, there are only 3 attacks (two deaths, one injury). Sean's death was pretty awful. Aside from being graphic, when my sister saw that scene with me, she cried because she loved his adorable character from J1 and J2. also, the fact that this guy is getting torn apart by a giant shark while carolers from a distant away are singing hark the herald angels sing, is pretty damn disturbing. the woman's death on the banana boat finally came just when the film had gotten really boring, so YAY!!!!! lol. when jake was attacked, i stood there with my mouth open, with a WTF expression on my face. i got over the fact that his character was attcked, but then at the very end, he turns out alive after getting his ass bitten off (literally). now THAT was dumb.now, as i'm saying this, i wonder, Why did the creators of 'Cruel Jaws' decide to rip off scenes from the other 3 films in the series and 2 other shark movies, but not JTR?. well, let me answer my own question. that would mean featuring scenes from a BAD movie, and the creators of CJ did their best to make their movie good3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 September 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" well, everyone knows Jaws the Revenge sucks.

I myself, am a die hard Jaws fan and i'm admitting it. JTR sucks. but what we're forgetting is, did JTR really deserve all the Razzies it was nominated for? in my opinion, no, it didn't. the only nominations\/wins it should've received should've been 'WORST SPECIAL EFFECTS' (which it won) and 'WORST EDITOR'. the editor of this movie obviously did a poor job. the little 1\/2 a second clips featuring the mechanics and hydraulics that operate the shark, SHOULD HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THE FILM COMPLETELY!!! this film has been on the bottom 100 for quite a while now, and i respect that. i think the really dumb thing about the film is it's climax. it is the most confusing scene i've ever seen in a film. First off, sharks cannot stand out of the water for two resons. 1-They're bodies are too bulky and huge and can't be able to balance themselves on their tales. 2-If they do manage to balance themselves, how will they be able to breathe? it's gills were flaring, but i didn't see any water on them!! also, the shark roars. this mistake was also made in jaws 3, but jaws 3 was actually better than this...thing. also, what i said earlier about the shark platform visible in some scenes? the other 3 jaws films succeeded in keeping the platform and machines invisible (except in jaws 3, but you can barely see it because its so dark underwater, and it's for an extremely short time). also, there's no jump scene. in the other 3, there were 3 corpses popping up here and there (ben gardner from J1, the boat driver from J2, and overman from J3). in JTR, there is no gross-scary-corpse part so that just takes away all the suspense. another thing JTR failed, was originality. If you think this film has an original story, see the 1977 Jaws rip-off Orca. On the film's poster it says Orca is the ONLY creature who seeks revenge other than man (i can't believe the creators of JTR missed that) and that the plot of JTR is strangely similar to ORCA, about a sea creature filled with rage and kills people for revenge. another bad thing about JTR is it's location. i'm not saying it shouldn't been set in the bahamas, the bahamas are beautiful, wonderful place. but great whites (as said in the film) can't survive in the water surrounding the bahamas. also, the wtaers in the bahamas are very clear blue. in the scene where they try to attach a transmitter to the shark, we see that the shark sticks out like a sore thumb in the ocean. when it dives underwater, and they lose sight of it, i just laughed. they're on a boat, in the middle of the most crystal clear ocean in the world. i don't know about you, but if a huge clunky, rubber, 27 foot long mechanical shark was in the water surrounding me, i'd notice it from a mile away. how the guys on the boat lose sight of it so easily and instantly, i have absolutely no idea. this brings me to m next point. the death\/attack scenes. this film has the lowest death\/attack count in the whole series. J1 hd about 5 deaths i think. J2 had i think 7. J3 had the highest if you count the 5 or 6 people killed by the shark plus the 7 or 8 people injured when the shark tore apart the dock. in JTR, there are only 3 attacks (two deaths, one injury). Sean's death was pretty awful. Aside from being graphic, when my sister saw that scene with me, she cried because she loved his adorable character from J1 and J2. also, the fact that this guy is getting torn apart by a giant shark while carolers from a distant away are singing hark the herald angels sing, is pretty damn disturbing. the woman's death on the banana boat finally came just when the film had gotten really boring, so YAY!!!!! lol. when jake was attacked, i stood there with my mouth open, with a WTF expression on my face. i got over the fact that his character was attcked, but then at the very end, he turns out alive after getting his ass bitten off (literally). now THAT was dumb.now, as i'm saying this, i wonder, Why did the creators of 'Cruel Jaws' decide to rip off scenes from the other 3 films in the series and 2 other shark movies, but not JTR?. well, let me answer my own question. that would mean featuring scenes from a BAD movie, and the creators of CJ did their best to make their movie good3\/10 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"13 September 2007","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Doctor Zhivago is a fascinating touchstone of what made 1960s cinema uniquely great, without ever being great itself. It is unique, though.Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) pursues a happy life as a physician and poet in Czarist Moscow, until fate, war, and revolution drive him from home and family to a woman who turns out to be the love of his life, Lara (Julie Christie). But will those same forces contrive to tear them apart?Directed by David Lean in such grand style as to invite unfair comparisons to his previous masterpiece, Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago is about as sumptuous as film-making gets. Whether its the hooded mink on Geraldine Chaplin's Tonya as she gets off a train or the baroque velvet finery of a fancy restaurant where Lara finds herself courted by the consummate political insider Kamarovsky (Rod Steiger), one is continually bombarded with the fact no expense was spared bringing this vision of the Boris Pasternak novel to the screen.The story covers a lot of ground in more than three hours, and though it does drag at times, Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt nourish their production with much of the same visual and verbal eloquence that nourished Lawrence. Maurice Jarre's eerie score, centered by the haunting Lara's Theme, works at times like musical heroin, jolting you back into the movie just as your attention starts to drift. Cinematographer Freddie Young uses windows and mirrors as a constant visual reference, as if to underscore the movie's concern with the shallowness of appearances, but at least through the first two hours, what grabs you about Zhivago is its great sense of depth.But sense of depth doesn't exactly equal depth itself, especially when you get to the final hour, and the romance that is supposed to be the fulcrum of the film. Sharif on a DVD commentary suggests Zhivago is a woman's movie the way Lawrence is more for men. It's a sage thought, as one notices the rational side is pushed aside, along with Zhivago's wife and family, in favor of an all-or-nothing romance with Lara. Neither Bolt nor Christie do much to justify this gambit, however, and we are left with more images of windows for Sharif to stare out of, looking poetic.As Sharif himself plays Zhivago as a gentle, uncomplicated soul, there is ample room for the supporting players to outshine the leads. Steiger sinks his teeth in the film's meatiest part, a cagey, brutal man whose passion for Lara is at least as interesting as that of Zhivago's, his lips forming a cruel scowl but his eyes suggesting a secret hurt.Don't fool yourself into thinking this was rape, he tells Lara after one brutal encounter. That would flatter us both. Ouch!Chaplin is also very good as the other woman in Zhivago's mess of a life, winning your affection with her unguarded smile and uncomplicated love for Yuri, which he is just good enough to know he doesn't deserve. Klaus Kinski pops up winningly at one point as a forced laborer, sneering as only he can. There is great cast work by the smallest players.If you want a film that bears witness to the cruelty of the Communist Revolution, and being caught up in social forces beyond one's control, Doctor Zhivago is all that and more. As a romantic saga it feels hollow at its center, and stretched out too far for all but the most patient of viewers. Yet what do I know? I'm just a guy.

Gangsters are being depicted as total losers, watching cartoons and not even being able to pay the rent. Ghost Dog is a lonely hit-man that is professional and methodical and lives by a Samurai code ever since he was saved by one of the gangsters, to be his retainer. For some reason the gangsters want to kill him after a job he did (first he was ordered to kill a gangster but now they're angry about the killing...it didn't make sense to me). From then on, he decides to get rid of the gangsters, however he can't kill his former savior because of the loyalty demanded by the samurai code. This may seem like an interesting story with plenty of conflict but it was rather boring. There was a total lack of suspense. The film just showed him at work like it was your ordinary boring day at the office. The ending didn't immediately make sense but the clash between conflicting codes eplains a bit.What is likable is how Ghost Dog connects with the little girl and the ice cream vendor (who doesn't know a word of English), but these are not the main elements of the film. The quotes used from the samurai code seem at times to be inserted merely for their coolness factor rather than always adding something, but there are occasions where they fit very well. I would have liked the film more if the gangsters had been more real and more frightening. Also Ghost Dog should have been a little bit less invincible. Heavyweight Forest Whitaker walks around shooting guns like it's a day at the park.Overall this is an overrated, formulaic Indie film. Not too terrible but not great.
