It was as dull as laundry day and filled with self important yet completely vapid people who cannot get along with anyone because they are all so concerned with themselves. They whine and moan and complain so much that after a while you'll feel like killing them all. It was made by Jennifer Jason Leigh, which to me is quite telling. This woman is regarded by many in Hollywood to be a great actress, which does in part explain why American movies are so awful. She is a dullard. Her name in the cast list of any movie is like a warning that a dull movie lies in store - and she MADE this one. I got the impression from the film that she thinks that it represents how people truly are and what real life is - but if for some reason she happens to be reading this, let me say emphatically to her that it does NOT. Of course it does paint a picture of her tragic little world of NY to LA movie types - but that is her problem, and there is a real life beyond Hollywood's artificial one (it's telling how these adults take Ecstacy, a kiddie drug that provides users with artificial emotions to go with their artificial lives). I do not want to be a part of that world and do not want to attend their parties, therefore I am sorry that I watched this. It might be a good wakeup call to anyone who dreams of movie stardom though. These people are so full of themselves because they are so empty of everything else. Actually I have to amend that statement - they are full of something else, though the twain may be hard to discern.This film, the type of people in it, and Jennifer Jason Leigh - they all deserve each other.

They're just two perfectly photogenic people who happen to be cast in the same less than satisfying romantic mystery--she has the camera in love with her (probably the director as well) and he's still an attractive--if older--leading man. That's it.And neither of them can disguise the fact that they're stuck in a glamorous but lightweight Hitchcock film that has the slimmest of plots--an innocent man is thought to be the one committing the current crimes among the rich on the Riviera--a man with a past history as a thief. And it's played more for comedy than mystery. And that's it, in a nutshell.Hitchcock seems more concerned that GRACE KELLY is gowned in all of the latest fashions that will look good in Technicolor and that CARY GRANT will look impressive enough as her co-star to make everyone forget the age difference. He rounded up some real pros for a supporting cast, including JOHN WILLIAMS as an urbane detective and JESSIE ROYCE LANDIS as Kelly's mother (she was Grant's mother in NORTH BY NORTHWEST).But it's fluff--sumptuously mounted fluff and nothing more. Women will sigh over Grace Kelly's many costumes (even Lana Turner would be envious), and men will wish they had a chance to tour the Riviera with Grace as a guide.The suspense is a mere piffle with only one really suspenseful moment on a rooftop with Grant exposing the real culprit--and the one-liners meant to titillate are almost puerile by comparison with the witticisms in other Hitchcock films of this nature. The accent is more on comedy than thrills and the result is one of the weakest Hitchcock films from this period.Sorry. The heavy accent on glittering Hollywood glamor is not enough to sustain interest in a basically dull and obvious script, although it's easy to see why the color cinematography of lovely Riviera backgrounds brought the film an Oscar for Robert Burk. Hitchcock should have drawn a better performance from Grace Kelly instead of concentrating on her Oscar-nominated wardrobe.

Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I didn't have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way mainstream Hollywood would have taken up a Christian series and produced a big-budget movie. So it was done independently... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show. It just didn't FEEL like a movie; it didn't have that movie experience to it, if anybody knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of that, and the low-budget, poor special effects were another detraction for me.On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was woefully miscast as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of an accent. So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil-neck who looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent. So that lost a few stars for me right there. A movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to.The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (can't remember which one) - were real seat-squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, was really out of place for some of the scenes, like in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom.In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't do it for me.
