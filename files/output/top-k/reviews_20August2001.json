I am normally a huge fan of all fantasy\/Sci-fi\/action\/adventure movies, and I honestly thought that this one would be no exception.

However, this could be because of the fact that What Women Want stars Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, whereas Dungeons and Dragons stars less well known celebrities (except for Jeremy Irons and possibly Thora Birch).I didn't particularly like some of the supposedly funny lines, and I thought that the dwarf in the movie was a completely unecessary character. I understand the fact that this film is based on the card game, and therefore maybe it was thought that the dwarf was required to complete the game-based characters (though I have no idea if this is the case as I have never played the game, nor know anything about it)I think that if the dwarf was, in fact, thought to be a necessary character, then maybe a more developed part should have been made for him, as it seemed to me that the dwarf was just added to the film for decoration purposes. He only said something like three lines in the entire movie anyway.I will not continue to go on about the various parts of the movie that annoyed me, and I do agree that the movie seemed to revolve around a basis similar to that of Star Wars Episode 1 Phantom Menace, in the respect that a young female ruler is struggling to improve the qualities of her Empire.However, I will say that I liked the set decoration in Dungeons and Dragons, which did display some vivid imagination. Finally, I would like to say that I believe all films contain good in them, no matter what they are. Therefore, I think Dungeons and Dragons would appeal more to people who enjoy the game and to those who like simple humor and sorcery.

It is nonstop comedy that is part road movie, part caper, love story, and heavy heavy heavy satire. The movie makes fun of film, the industry, the View Askew universe, and even itself.Of all of Kevin Smith's movies, this one is written the tightest. From the opening scene to the final scene (stick around after the credits), no moment is dwelled on too long, and there are no excesses. The reason that there are no excesses? The rules are broken very early and really set up the film to be goofball adventure.There are nods to all the past films, appearances by different characters, crossovers, but they all seem genuine. Not like a Jerry Zucker haha, but they actually make sense within the context of the story and the quips and jabs are part of the plot. The pacing reminds me of old Marx brothers movies. Well, that's the craft of the script. It's a relatively simple plot but the execution is pretty flawless with a healthy dose of genitalia, gay, and sex jokes.Both Jay (Jason Mewes) and Bob (Kevin Smith) play off each other and everyone else well enough to keep the movement going. Like Bond or Superman (or any other franchise), after four films playing the same character, you pretty much know how to do it and what works for a character (unless you're George Lucas). There are plenty of cameos, which I think says something about the way Kevin Smith works and how others respect him.An interesting bit is how big this movie is (or seems with a $15M budget). Complete with digital effects (bullets like in Saving Private Ryan, Charlie's Angels and animals) and explosions and eye-candy, it has the best look of any View Askew film, even lighting! But they also just help serve the story and frolick. From a technical side, it's sort of View Askew grows up. Lots more production value, stunts, visuals, even a decent score from Powerpuffs and Clerks the Animated Series composer James Venable.In the words of Chaka, this movie makes House Party seem like House Party 2. It is a party. A party for fans of Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and even Mallrats. With one good laugh, seeing old friends, one good time after another, and tons of references for film lovers abound. And even the most precious moment the origin of Jay and Silent Bob, in case you ever wondered.It should be noted that in some ways, Kevin Smith is very much a Shakespeare of the stoner gen. Within tawdry jokes and adult gags that appeal to the basest viewer, there often is an intelligent, poignant message. In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the message is clear Kevin Smith loves his fans and this movie is his gift to them.  It is a unique ability to create characters that others consider friends.

Lots more production value, stunts, visuals, even a decent score from Powerpuffs and Clerks the Animated Series composer James Venable.In the words of Chaka, this movie makes House Party seem like House Party 2. It is a party. A party for fans of Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and even Mallrats. With one good laugh, seeing old friends, one good time after another, and tons of references for film lovers abound. And even the most precious moment the origin of Jay and Silent Bob, in case you ever wondered.It should be noted that in some ways, Kevin Smith is very much a Shakespeare of the stoner gen. Within tawdry jokes and adult gags that appeal to the basest viewer, there often is an intelligent, poignant message. In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the message is clear Kevin Smith loves his fans and this movie is his gift to them.  It is a unique ability to create characters that others consider friends. Smith knows this, appreciates and rewards.

I remember it being a nice, even cute, film that was very enjoyable to spend an evening watching. And it was even more enjoyable the second time. Now I'm buying it. One of the big reasons this film stuck with me is the well-written script and its characters therein. They're very real, mainly because, well, they have problems. I like seeing that I'm not the only one with insecurities, fears, depression, etc. And I especially relate to the character played by Hope Davis. In another Lawrence Kasdan-directed film, French Kiss, I identify with Meg Ryan's character. She's inhibited, afraid of flying (that's me!!), and generally afraid to be brave. That's one of the reasons I enjoy watching THAT film as well, because of the fact that I relate to its central character. Something like that is very therapeutic to me. And that's appropriate, after all, because the film Mumford is about therapy. Watching it is a very therapeutic experience. It depicts real-life characters with real problems, and they get help. But the film also gets humor and enjoyment out of its eccentric characters, having fun with it and being able to step back, look at it, and even laugh. A very nice film. One of my favorite scenes is between Loren Dean and Hope Davis on the baseball field, while they're stretching, and Mumford explains about having two conflicting thoughts in your head, and how that can tear bits of your brain tissue apart. To this, Hope replies Well, then my whole life's been one big rip. What a profound scene for her. I wish I could see more films like this, meaning I wish they made more. It's profound, moving, relatable, funny, and simply a nice film.

Its different from the first since its more psychological, sort of like The Shining. People believed that a sequel couldn't be good if made, and i can understand that. I don't want to see Regan get possessed again, thats stupid...as far as i know, with common sense, Pazuzu (NOT SATAN) wouldn't repossess Regan when it was already defeated, maybe want revenge, but not fall for it again, it lost already. BUT what is strange is thats what people wanted, another possession like the first...that is doomed to fail....it's the same basis but a sequel with means Not As Good As First, right?. Who wants to see the same movie again except a little different, you do want to see what has happened to Regan in the future though, and thats what I think the writer thought. With an Oscar Cast, how could this go wrong?. When this movie premiered, it was laughed at, pulled from theaters and bombed! this confuses me a lot. It had an impressive story, that made a little more sense actually than the first movie. This movie had more ideas in it than the first movie, and went together so nicely. Even If People Didn't Like This Movie, look at it, it had a complex story, meant to confuse a little (To make you think just like the first), and people are dumb enough to put this as 1 of the worst movies ever..think of the worst movie you saw...one with no reason for being made, easily written script, no ideas, nothing, one that annoyed you.....and people actually put this there? thats crazy...I think this was one of the best movies ever made, just like the original....Picture The Godfather as a 1 star movie...how would you react? Whats your or one of your favorite movies?...picture seeing it the 1st time..not knowing a rating it was given, then for curiosity finding reviews for it and having people say it was one of the worst movies ever....it would make you mad right? insult your intelligence?...well this is one of my favorite movies, I loved it, I showed my friend, he liked Exorcist a lot and thought The Heretic was better (his fav. movie)....he could get shot for that. This movie is surrounded by mystery, whats with the people that hated this movie....I don't know, maybe too good for them, too complex, can you believe one of the reasons people didn't like it is because there was a machine in it that seemed dumb because they didn't know how it could work,hmmmm was a time machine invented? i guess that means Back to the Future was 1 of the worst movies ever....at least(from what I heard), Martin Scorcese(director of Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull & Taxi Driver) thought it was great, he is also my fav. director. Critics aren't correct allot, Check this movie out if u liked the first and\/or like complex movies that can make you think......

I'll start on the positive side of things. It was very entertaining and seemed to actually have a bit of intelligence behind it, a rare (but welcome) combination in modern Hollywood. The makeup and special effects were absolutely stunning. The apes looked and moved like apes, yet effectively had the human characteristic of being able to distinguish the characters through face recognition. It made a great combination. This great imagery was backed up by impressive looking sets. Watching the two connect together, it was hard to believe these were human actors in ape costumes acting on a studio set, you get the full impression of a real world. The cast were good enough, Mark was convincing as a lost and puzzled human, the rest of the humans were appropriately primitive-like, Carter portrayed the human-sympathising Ari well and.. well Tim Roth as Thade.. he stole the show every time he appeared, his portrayl of the character echoed frustration and anger and his voice was more than appropriate. The film also had a well suited soundtrack, provided by music magic man, Danny Elfman.

The part near the end with the chimp arriving in his pod was so coincidental that it just seemed completely unbelievable. The apes were scared of water, for some bizarre reason they couldn't swim, even though they are physically superior to humans. The apes are unable to cross water because they can't swim, so why can't they build a boat? I'm sure there were other plot issues too, but those are the only ones that I can remember.

I actually felt quite gutted the moment where we saw the statue's face, because the rest of the story (despite the plot problems mentioned) actually made sense. I've since heard lot's of interesting theories, but they've all had some sort of reason for not being correct. The most popular theory was that Thade repairs Leo's space pod and goes back through time to Earth and edits the world. First of all, Leo's pod is underwater and apparently the apes can't swim, so it is unaccessible to Thade. Also, even if Thade could get the pod, the apes don't have the technology to repair it. The pod was only big enough to fit Thade in, how could just one ape make such a difference? Finally, if apes did inhabit Earth instead of humans.. what would be the chance of the apes building a city exactly the same as Washington DC with a Thade memorial looking exactly the same as the Lincoln memorial? Pretty damn slim to say the least.Anyway, final verdict entertaining, but too many plot problems and an appalling ending.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"20 August 2001","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Does contain spoilers!I remember recently having an argument at work with my boss who vehemently argued that 1968's Planet of the Apes is head and shoulders above Tim Burton's version.  I had just come back from seeing Burton's and was quite impressed.  And even though I had never seen this one, I argued the other way.  I am not sure why I did this, perhaps it was just to play Devil's Advocate, maybe it was just cause I'm an ass at times or maybe I really thought that this version couldn't be better than the new one.  After all, Burton's post apocalyptic futuristic ape world was inhabited by apes that were intelligent enough to form societies and create laws but they were too stupid to realize that the world they live in is big enough for both humans and animals.  It went to great lengths ( or so I thought) to show man's, and conversely apes ignorance when it comes to the welfare of anything that is considered lower in intellect.  In short, I felt that Burton's Planet of the Apes touched on many issues that are important to me.  I couldn't really see how a film made 30 some years ago could top that.  Boy was I wrong!I rated 2001's POTA an 8.5 based mostly on it's theories and because of the action in the film (and because I have a soft spot for Michael Clarke Duncan).  If that is true, and I do feel that way, then 1968's POTA is easily worth a ten and that is what I am giving it.  Very few films make you feel something.  Let me re-phrase that.  A good film will entertain you, an even better one can enlighten you.  But only a very few precious films can keep you entertained and fill your head with a plethora of thought provoking ideas and what-ifs at the very same time.  Planet of the Apes is one of those films.  JFK, and all of it's pseudo-theories about the assassination of the president left me feeling exhausted and afraid of the world we live in.  Films like The Matrix (you're a disease, Mr. Anderson) and T-2 (it's in your nature to destroy yourselves) and Instinct (these are the takers) gave me similar premonitions.  You can add Planet of the Apes to that select breed of films that gave me a similar feeling.  This is a film that takes its time to tackle such weighty issues as evolution, human rights, animal rights, racism, religious ambiguity, military strong arms and many other issues.  The screenplay was skillfully adapted by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame from a book by Pierre Boulle.  And although I have not read the book, I have read that the film is different in quite a few ways.  For instance, the book and subsequently Burton's version, has the apes very technologically advanced.  But because of technological inferiority in 1968 the film took the apes and had them living in a primitively built city\/village.  They had buildings made of rock but not concrete.  The had guns but not automatic weapons.  And although Burton's version hasn't introduced them to guns, the apes are much stronger, much higher up on the evolutionary scale.  But in this POTA, there seems to be a missing link.  Certain apes have theories that apes really evolved from man and yet the humans in this world cannot speak.  They seem to understand some things, but they cannot comprehend what is being said to them all of the time, kind of like the way our animals are today.  This opens up a plethora possibilities.  Are these humans mutants, are they a cross between man and ape?  Have they been scientifically altered by some medical Nazi-like experiment and over time, generations have adapted to these experiments?  There are many weighty issues open for discussion.  Other reviewers bring up the possibility of a nuclear war and one of Taylor's observations was that there may have been a nuclear shower or meteor storm that devastated humans, just like the dinosaurs before them.  And doesn't that make Heston's speech at the beginning of Armageddon ( it happened once it'll happen again.. it's just a matter of time) all the more chilling?Contains major spoilers in the next few paragraphs.  Please, do not read if you plan on seeing the film soon for the first time!!!!  You have been warned!  2001's version of POTA was quite impressive because of technology first and the story second.  While it did think about things such as animal rights and such, it did not hold it as important as this version does.  This is a film that you could watch over and over again and still have it give you that sinking feeling in your stomach every time.  The ending alone is enough to open up discussion for months to come.  And I have a theory.  So bear with me.  If what he sees at the end of the film on the beach is really the whole thing sitting there, and not just the head ( meaning that the rest of it is buried some 200 feet in the sand, then this presents a whole slew of possibilites.  Dr Zaius has discovered the cave where he believes there is sufficient enough evidence that there were intelligent human occupants before apes.  The basis of his evidence is that on different levels of the earth, buried in the sand and clay there are artifacts to support his claim.  One one level he found reading glasses and deeper still, he finds false teeth and in another level, even deeper he found a babies doll that talks.  Proof that evolution granted man the ability to talk.  But when Taylor is left to find his destiny what he finds is the thing that may be buried so deep in the earth from thousands of years of stagnancy.  What if what he is seeing is really all in tact, just buried some 200 feet under the earth?  If they could dig that far down, what would they find?  Would they find dishes or the remains of houses?  Would they find subway tunnels, sewage pipes, bones of sewer rats, bones of CHUD like people?  The possibilities are endless.  This could turn the ape world upside down and it would create a division in those that are ardent followers of the ape religion and those that believe in evolution.  Doesn't this kind of sound similar to situations here in our time?End of spoilersPOTA is the one of the best Science Fiction films I have ever seen and this would easily crack my top 100 films ever made.  And that is after 2 viewings.  I want to go back and watch this film a few more times so I can really understand it.  It is a rare film that entertains and poses some very interesting and provocative questions.  And as I said earlier, there are very few films that can do something like that.  Films like American Pie or Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather are great because they entertain and make you laugh or cheer.  POTA is in a class with other films like T-2 and Aliens.  These are films that also entertain but they force you to examine who we are and where we have come from and where we could possibly go.  Is it possible that man will one day become so unbearable that some divine intervention will occur so that we are not the inferior species?  A film like this makes you think and wonder?

","genre":null},{"date":"20 August 2001","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Does contain spoilers!I remember recently having an argument at work with my boss who vehemently argued that 1968's Planet of the Apes is head and shoulders above Tim Burton's version.  I had just come back from seeing Burton's and was quite impressed.  And even though I had never seen this one, I argued the other way.  I am not sure why I did this, perhaps it was just to play Devil's Advocate, maybe it was just cause I'm an ass at times or maybe I really thought that this version couldn't be better than the new one.  After all, Burton's post apocalyptic futuristic ape world was inhabited by apes that were intelligent enough to form societies and create laws but they were too stupid to realize that the world they live in is big enough for both humans and animals.  It went to great lengths ( or so I thought) to show man's, and conversely apes ignorance when it comes to the welfare of anything that is considered lower in intellect.  In short, I felt that Burton's Planet of the Apes touched on many issues that are important to me.  I couldn't really see how a film made 30 some years ago could top that.  Boy was I wrong!I rated 2001's POTA an 8.5 based mostly on it's theories and because of the action in the film (and because I have a soft spot for Michael Clarke Duncan).  If that is true, and I do feel that way, then 1968's POTA is easily worth a ten and that is what I am giving it.  Very few films make you feel something.  Let me re-phrase that.  A good film will entertain you, an even better one can enlighten you.  But only a very few precious films can keep you entertained and fill your head with a plethora of thought provoking ideas and what-ifs at the very same time.  Planet of the Apes is one of those films.  JFK, and all of it's pseudo-theories about the assassination of the president left me feeling exhausted and afraid of the world we live in.  Films like The Matrix (you're a disease, Mr. Anderson) and T-2 (it's in your nature to destroy yourselves) and Instinct (these are the takers) gave me similar premonitions.  You can add Planet of the Apes to that select breed of films that gave me a similar feeling.  This is a film that takes its time to tackle such weighty issues as evolution, human rights, animal rights, racism, religious ambiguity, military strong arms and many other issues.  The screenplay was skillfully adapted by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame from a book by Pierre Boulle.  And although I have not read the book, I have read that the film is different in quite a few ways.  For instance, the book and subsequently Burton's version, has the apes very technologically advanced.  But because of technological inferiority in 1968 the film took the apes and had them living in a primitively built city\/village.  They had buildings made of rock but not concrete.  The had guns but not automatic weapons.  And although Burton's version hasn't introduced them to guns, the apes are much stronger, much higher up on the evolutionary scale.  But in this POTA, there seems to be a missing link.  Certain apes have theories that apes really evolved from man and yet the humans in this world cannot speak.  They seem to understand some things, but they cannot comprehend what is being said to them all of the time, kind of like the way our animals are today.  This opens up a plethora possibilities.  Are these humans mutants, are they a cross between man and ape?  Have they been scientifically altered by some medical Nazi-like experiment and over time, generations have adapted to these experiments?  There are many weighty issues open for discussion.  Other reviewers bring up the possibility of a nuclear war and one of Taylor's observations was that there may have been a nuclear shower or meteor storm that devastated humans, just like the dinosaurs before them.  And doesn't that make Heston's speech at the beginning of Armageddon ( it happened once it'll happen again.. it's just a matter of time) all the more chilling?Contains major spoilers in the next few paragraphs.  Please, do not read if you plan on seeing the film soon for the first time!!!!  You have been warned!  2001's version of POTA was quite impressive because of technology first and the story second.  While it did think about things such as animal rights and such, it did not hold it as important as this version does.  This is a film that you could watch over and over again and still have it give you that sinking feeling in your stomach every time.  The ending alone is enough to open up discussion for months to come.  And I have a theory.  So bear with me.  If what he sees at the end of the film on the beach is really the whole thing sitting there, and not just the head ( meaning that the rest of it is buried some 200 feet in the sand, then this presents a whole slew of possibilites.  Dr Zaius has discovered the cave where he believes there is sufficient enough evidence that there were intelligent human occupants before apes.  The basis of his evidence is that on different levels of the earth, buried in the sand and clay there are artifacts to support his claim.  One one level he found reading glasses and deeper still, he finds false teeth and in another level, even deeper he found a babies doll that talks.  Proof that evolution granted man the ability to talk.  But when Taylor is left to find his destiny what he finds is the thing that may be buried so deep in the earth from thousands of years of stagnancy.  What if what he is seeing is really all in tact, just buried some 200 feet under the earth?  If they could dig that far down, what would they find?  Would they find dishes or the remains of houses?  Would they find subway tunnels, sewage pipes, bones of sewer rats, bones of CHUD like people?  The possibilities are endless.  This could turn the ape world upside down and it would create a division in those that are ardent followers of the ape religion and those that believe in evolution.  Doesn't this kind of sound similar to situations here in our time?End of spoilersPOTA is the one of the best Science Fiction films I have ever seen and this would easily crack my top 100 films ever made.  And that is after 2 viewings.  I want to go back and watch this film a few more times so I can really understand it.  It is a rare film that entertains and poses some very interesting and provocative questions.  And as I said earlier, there are very few films that can do something like that.  Films like American Pie or Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather are great because they entertain and make you laugh or cheer.  POTA is in a class with other films like T-2 and Aliens.  These are films that also entertain but they force you to examine who we are and where we have come from and where we could possibly go.  Is it possible that man will one day become so unbearable that some divine intervention will occur so that we are not the inferior species?  A film like this makes you think and wonder?
