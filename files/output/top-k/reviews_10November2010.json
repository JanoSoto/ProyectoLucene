The problem with candy is not to convince people that it's good...but to free them from the guilt of eating it. We have seen so many times that the body of a film serves merely as an excuse for motivating a final blood-crazed slaughter by the hero of his enemies, and at the same time to relieve the audience's guilt of enjoying this mayhem. &#x96; KubrickSome films are slices of life, mine are slices of cake. - HitchcockA 1955 masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock, To Catch A Thief finds actor Cary Grant playing another Hitchcockian hero wrongly accused of a crime. Grant plays John Robie, a reformed thief who now lives on the French Riviera. When a series of thefts occur, local authorities begin to suspect John. In an attempt to clear his name, John sets out to catch the real thief himself.Like several of Hitchcock's lighter films, Thief's plot is a scrumptious fusion of thrills and romance. Here our love interest is the always divine Grace Kelly - she plays an opinionated socialite from Philadelphia - who teams up with Grant and slowly finds herself falling in love with him. The film's title thus has a double meaning, Grant playing a thief trying to catch a thief whilst Kelly tries to steal Grant's own heart. Hitch oft used suspense plots to investigate burgeoning romances. If To Catch A Thief's romance doesn't have the dark, psycho-sexual underpinnings of Hitchcock's more interesting films, it at least never pretends to offer anything more than light entertainment.Like North by Northwest, this is thus a giant travelogue, Hitchcock treating his 1950s audience to a colourful cinematic vacation. He invites them to forget about their black and white television sets, their annoying summer holidays - marred by ticket queues, sunburn and hefty luggage - and to instead sit back and soak up his scenic shots of the Riviera, his bubblegum plot and VistaVision postcard images interrupted only by some moments of light comedy and the occasional sprinkle of sexual innuendo laced witty dialogue. Throw in Hitchcock's aesthetic - clean lines, immaculate compositions, pop art modernism meets German Expresionism meets 1950s advertising - and you have a film that elevates tawdriness to High Art. Hitchcock's films often have a self-reflexive quality; they're about the perverse act of watching films. So on one hand, Thief plays to its audience's desires for escapism. It celebrates money, commodities, beauty, expensive homes, and rich, suave, sophisticated people who do devilishly debonair things and get away with it. On the other hand, the film critiques these very qualities. The film's wealthy characters find no real joy in their luxury, Robie argues that everyone's ultimately a thief, and Kelly's character, like we the audience (and her own character in Rear Window), ultimately gets her kicks by living vicariously through media personalities. For Kelly and Hitch, cinematic cake beats the real thing.The majority of Hitchcock's films are grounded in an Oedipal struggle which concludes with a reconciliation between Desire and the Law. At their best, this leads to creepy perversions and dark obsessions. At their worst, this leads to glossy crowd pleasers in which we're invited to soak up candy, outsmart everyone, steal jewels and make love to luminous movie stars. What these films ultimately do is sell consumption and post-war excess. Indeed, Hitchcock once described his audience as the moron masses, his films as cake, and admitted to collaborators like John Taylor and Peter Viertel that he despised those who watched his films. The truth, however, is probably somewhere in the middle. Glitzy travelogues like North by Northwest and To Catch A Thief, and even murder movies like Psycho, are supremely calculated, designed to push the most basic buttons. But its precisely his knowledge of an audience's desires which make Hitchcock's best films so creepy. Any puppet master can make a puppet jump, but not many can make a puppet watch itself watching itself. Incidentally, To Catch A Thief echoes a number of Hitchcock's war time, espionage pictures. For example, it is stated that Robie was a member of the French Resistance during the Occupation. It is also acknowledged that a number of his associates in the Resistance - national heroes even - have likewise turned to a life of crime. Of course Robie isn't French. He's American, and seems instead to resemble those Oregon (Robie says he is himself from Portland, Oregan) born American dissidents who supported the Mexican and Bolshevik Revolutions or fought against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Under its glitz the film asks us to not only consider the fates of such unscrupilous wartime heroes, but to question identities; false identities, personal identities, usurped identities and so forth. I never stole from anyone who would go hungry, Robie says, as his Nazi strangling maid works behind the back of an insurance man.8.9\/10 &#x96; Robert Burks would win an Oscar for Thief's VistaVision cinematography.

I haven't heard much about Tony Scott but I think with Tarantino directing it would have been a better movie. It lacks that goofy feel that pervades through Tarantino's movies. The love for movies and just plain fun that is so integral to a Tarantino movie is missing in True Romance. Still, True Romance is a good movie. Stylistically influenced by Terence Malick's 1973 film Badlands it also stands as a movie in its own right. Who knew Tarantino was such a sap and could right halfway decent romantic dialogue? The voice-over narration and the background score is where it heavily borrows from Badlands and of course the serial killers on the run. But Alabama and Clarence aren't serial killers on the run. They are just people wanting to start over and try to live a better life, a happier life. But Tarantino will not let them do it easily. There are gangsters, Hollywood movie producers, old friends, drugs, policeman and guys with wires. More often than not Tarantino's movies have a variety of different plot that collide and all hell breaks loose. We witness this again and have a Mexican standoff. I guess that is where the problem lies. Tony Scott just directed the movie and I guess he didn't care so much about the characters and the Mexican standoff became very predictable in the last half hour of the movie and the action scenes were a little too cheesy.The supporting cast features some of the biggest stars of today. Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini to name a few. Back then I guess they were just starting out. It is great fun to see a young James Gandolfini a couple of years before he played Tony Soprano doing what he does best. It's surprising how Michael Rappaport frequently plays the old friend of the lead character. He plays the same character in Beautiful Girls and some Schwarzenegger movie.

His voice always irritates me but he's done a decent job in the film. The female decent is quite good actually. She is very pretty and plays her role with aplomb. True Romance is about well a True Romance. How two people meet and realize they are perfect for each other.

Polanski knows how to tell a story as good as anyone. The perfect camera angles and the perfect shots are taken as we take a dive in two the mind of J.J. Gittes a private detective who reiterates that he makes a fair living. He is masterfully played by none other that Jack Nicholson who gives one of his best performance that can be ranked alongside his performances in 'The Shining' and 'Cuckoo's Nest' Nicholson gives a very controlled performance. There is no unnecessary shouting or going over the top. He begins to uncover a terrible plot over in L.A. that involves the water department,incest,adultery and Chinatown. Robert Towne wrote this script in the traditional noir way with voice-over and the like but Polanski eliminated all the voice-over so the audience would uncover the mystery as Gittes would and was that a good decision. The movie is an absorbing 2 hour experience as you get completely lost as the plot unravels and more of the mystery unfolds. It is tremendously quotable movie. It has a noir touch to it that is obvious from the overture but the touch is so light that the movie simply floats on this delightful little script. Recently the movie was named on a list of the seven films to see before you die. Well I generally disagree with such lists because it's the apples over oranges thing isn't it.

It leaves you feeling frightened, challenged and with so many questions that you can debate about it for hours on end. And that is what Art really should accomplish.

One of the most iconic lines in cinematic history can be found in Roman Polanski's 1974 masterpiece Chinatown.Chinatown is almost the perfect movie. The direction is outstanding. Polanski knows how to tell a story as good as anyone. The perfect camera angles and the perfect shots are taken as we take a dive in two the mind of J.J. Gittes a private detective who reiterates that he makes a fair living. He is masterfully played by none other that Jack Nicholson who gives one of his best performance that can be ranked alongside his performances in 'The Shining' and 'Cuckoo's Nest' Nicholson gives a very controlled performance. There is no unnecessary shouting or going over the top. He begins to uncover a terrible plot over in L.A. that involves the water department,incest,adultery and Chinatown. Robert Towne wrote this script in the traditional noir way with voice-over and the like but Polanski eliminated all the voice-over so the audience would uncover the mystery as Gittes would and was that a good decision. The movie is an absorbing 2 hour experience as you get completely lost as the plot unravels and more of the mystery unfolds. It is tremendously quotable movie. It has a noir touch to it that is obvious from the overture but the touch is so light that the movie simply floats on this delightful little script. Recently the movie was named on a list of the seven films to see before you die. Well I generally disagree with such lists because it's the apples over oranges thing isn't it. But Chinatown is a brilliant film. The ending is so powerful that it can knock most films out of the water with just that.

Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too! It seems a little silly to be writing a review of The Wizard of Oz. It's the movie that's been seen by more people than any other in history. Most of us have seen it 10 times by the time we're seven. But I'll put my two cents in anyway, from an adult's point of view.As a kid, I thought the munchkins were slightly creepy and the winged monkeys much more so, but I loved Dorothy and I loved the songs, and the entire movie was just so bright and colorful that I find it hard to believe that any kid could dislike it. Now, at the age of 25, I can still recognize the merit of it, without being influenced much by a lasting nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz is a lot like Alice in Wonderland (my all-time favorite children's novel), it treats children like they're smart and clever and capable of understanding and handling ideas that sometimes we adults forget they can get a handle on. The danger and excitement of The Wizard of Oz is a true adventure, be it a candy-coated one.I can also better appreciate now the staggering amount of work and creativity that went into bringing this novel to life. It's just remarkable, really. The choreography, the classic songs, the sets, the costumes, the special effects, they're all still impressive today. More so, really, because many of the tools used to make modern movie magic weren't available back then. And Judy Garland...really, what needs to be said about her that isn't blindingly and extraordinarily obvious?

The townsfolk are more or less in thrall to the Stone Mountain Coal Company. The company pays its workers in company-issued scrip, not cash, which can be redeemed only at company facilities like the store and the workers' housing. The workers themselves, laboring under dismal and dangerous conditions, must pay for everything a la carte, including their work tools.The miners don't care for the arrangement, nor for the scab laborers -- blacks and Italian immigrants -- that the company brings in.Enter the union man Chris Cooper, a Christ-like figure preaching brotherhood and non-violence. He has his hands full getting the townsfolk to work together with the alien black and the Guappos who use corn meal to make something called polenta instead of good old-fashioned corn bread. It gets especially difficult when the Stone Mountain Coal Company hires a couple of mean goons -- Kevin Tighe and Gordon Clappe -- to evict troublesome families from company housing, forcing most of them to live in tents. Sheriff David Strathairn is on the side of the workers and forbids any confrontations in the town.I don't want to get into the plot in too much detail. It's a bit complicated and it leads to a more or less accurately depicted, but nevertheless familiar, shoot out between a dozen or more company thugs and the men and women of the town, with casualties on both sides.It's practically an object lesson in Marxist theory. The people of Appalachia aren't like Southerners. They were yeomen farmers. No big cotton plantations. They didn't object to strong liquor. And when they drink, it's not even bourbon. When the despicable traitor to the cause pours himself a drink, it's a clear liquor. And it's not vodka or gin, it's shine. And the mountain folk weren't wedded to slavery either. That's why we have a West Virginia as well as a Virginia. During the Civil War the governors of one or two Southern states had to send troops into the mountains to quell rebellions against the Confederacy. The hillbillies didn't necessarily want to remain in the Union. They wanted to be left alone.Their allegiance seldom extended beyond the local community or Holler, sometimes not farther than the extended family. As a union organizer, this makes Chris Cooper's job of implementing Marxism that much more difficult. The general idea is to persuade people that their misery isn't their own fault, not due to bad luck or laziness, but to their limited conception of power. Power lies not in loyalty to one's family or small community or ethnic group or race. Marx called that false consciousness. To liberate themselves, exploited laborers must make the transition to class consciousness by realizing that we're all in this together and have to exercise collective power.The movie dramatizes this conflict pretty well. It's a bit slow at the beginning but the tension grows quickly after we get to know the principles and their situations.Haskel Wexler's photography adds to the appeal, and the production design is splendid. Note the widow hanging up her laundry. The wooden clothes pins are old, worn, and dark. And she's hanging up a patchwork quilt, a signature artifact in the Mountain South. Even the dialect is fairly accurate. The narrator uses the regional hit for it -- as in Hit was in 1920 that the massacre happened. You won't hear that extra h in Charleston.The movie uses an assortment of symbols too. In the opening scene, we watch two disgruntled miners tamp a stick of dynamite into the wall of a coal mine and wait at a distance as the fuse burns down. (Get it?) The villagers near the beginning are seen playing a slow, not particularly catchy folk tune on guitar and fiddle. Later, one of the imported black men, James Earl Jones, joins in with a bluesy harmonica. By the end an Italian is playing along with them on a mandolin. (They're all playing the same tune now.) And the approaching train bringing the army of company goons emits great billows of ominous black smoke. (Well, I don't have to draw anybody a picture.) Chris Cooper has a sensitive face and thoughtful demeanor. He's the kind of actor who can -- and has -- gone either way, towards goodness or evil. A marvelous performance from Kevin Tighe as the smiling, confident, slimy villain. The guy has a great big, unashamedly Irish face. He's one of those suave heavies, charming when he's not committing murder. If he were a British heavy he might be James Mason. The poorest -- or let's say least convincing performance -- is from Will Oldham as Danny, the boyish nascent preacher. One winces when listening to him. He doesn't have the accent down, and neither do most of the others. Highland speech is really distinct, still. Bread becomes braid, and a tomato is a mater. James Earl Jones always radiates good will and is both comfortable and comforting. We don't get to see much of the Italians.It's propaganda, of course. Sayles' loyalty is never in question. But it' well-done propaganda and possibly a necessary memento of how bad things can get when Mining Companies are left to their own devices, able to make their own rules about the workers' safety and welfare. Not that the other side is endorsed without reservation. At one point, some miners are saved by the intrusion of a strange group of armed and ragged hunters called Foothill People.

So begins a fast paced and high intensity car chase, the likes of which you'll hardly ever see done with such awesome fury. And that is what we are treated to in the opening of Mad Max. The opening scene alone makes this film worth the watch, but what goes on after this great action scene is plenty fun as well.Mad Max is set in the near future in the apocalyptic wasteland of Australia. It is centered around the ongoing war between the police and the gangs. Max Rockatansky is one of the most hard boiled of the cops, and fulfills his job as the interceptor, chasing after a gang of ruthless motorcycle bandits who murder, rape, pillage, and terrorize the innocent. When the gang murders Max's wife and baby son his true vengeful wrath is unleashed as he slips into a world of madness and cynicism. And this exciting character is portrayed by none other than Mel Gibson. This is of course the pre anti-semitic\/certifiably insane Gibson, so you can't hold it against the actor at this point. But it's not like that would matter anyways, because Mad Max is just an all around fun film regardless. It's got some of the coolest car chase scenes you'll ever see and so you can't help but be entertained.You have to consider some things to get past the odd imperfections of Mad Max. Mainly it's important to know that the budget of this film was a mere $300,000. Because of this we do see some simplified scenes and some fast paced editing and cutting, due to the budget running out towards the end of the filming. Mad Max is a fast paced film, but there are some parts that seem to be cut short at odd moments, and thrown together quickly. In a nutshell, there is some evidence of the filmmakers having to make do with what they had, but they certainly toughed it out to produce an overall more than just watchable film. Besides, you can't fault a movie for having money issues when the end result is still extremely fun. So these criticisms are hardly valid, and Mad Max is still a lot of fun to watch.You can't help but enjoy this film. There's not a whole lot to it, but it tells an exciting story set in an exhilarating dystopic world of fast cars and ruthless gangsters. Plus Max is one of the great anti-heroes of cinema, who is a highly recognized name in the sci-fi world.

At the core of it is the grizzled figure and low, rumbling voice of Clint Eastwood; here, doing what he usually does in scything his way through the film thwarting those in need of thwarting and dealing with everything that comes his way, despite some pretty serious health issues. He's working off of an ample enough screenplay which leans delicately towards no-nonsense, pulpy material just as much it does back the other way towards heart-felt and satisfying character study. It is a script from the pen of Brian Helgeland, working from a novel by Michael Connelly, and again is a finely crafted piece of work delicately balancing between two stables; ever tip-toeing over a proverbial line that Helgeland would come to master with the aforementioned Eastwood just a year later in 2003's Mystic River. Where it feels a little fabricated, it makes up for in energy and the craft you feel has been put into manoeuvring this tale in and around the disparate people it covers.The film begins at a blood ridden crime scene, something we observe from up on high thanks to an initial perspective amongst the police and press helicopters. We're granted access to it only when Eastwood's F.B.I. agent Terry McCaleb arrives at a house that has witnessed some unpleasantness. He's an elderly man, seemingly frail but apparently willing to put himself on the front-line of busy-body police procedure; large crowd contingencies and press interviews. McCaleb's dedication to his work is unnervingly highlighted when we witness him chase down an odd looking person wearing more than enough clothes so as to hide identity just off the crime scene; the ensuing running affecting his heart and immediate well-being when climbing and jumping appear to enter the equation. Gun in hand, in an alleyway and in the darkest of night; the heart rate slows when inactivity has taken over and the apprehension appears inevitable, despite the situation clearly more dangerous and nerve-wrecking than before.The winner is his health, the retiring to a boat house moored at a local marina offering sun; the chance to escape to the open sea and a far quieter existence as well as a neighbour in the form of Jeff Daniels' Jasper No one, nicknamed Buddy, whom occupies the adjacent boat and lives off of his father's money doing not much else bar fishing and soaking up sun rays. He's the kind of guy who charges a case of beer an hour for babysitting rates, whereas the overall casting of Daniels actually turns out to be a brave decision as things unravel. But that is later, much later. In the meantime, and in the truest of noir infused fashions, a somewhat exotic Hispanic woman in Graciella Rivers (De Jesus) visits our McCaleb despite his career predicament and offers him the chance to seek out why it was her sister was brutally murdered in a store. In a somewhat dreary manner, the film instills heart into proceedings by providing Graciella with some melancholic guitar string music during the moments of regression to hammer home personal meaning in what is a goofy but strangely affecting tactic.The case is rendered rather more complicated and rather more personal to McCaleb when it transpires he wields her dead sister's heart, following a transplant he had linked to McCaleb's own illness. Begrudginly, and against professional opinion, he accepts; using No one as a working partner in the process. Shortly thereafter, a scene in a local library during which he uses the Internet to look up info on the woman followed by the required taking of medical pills quite clearly highlights, at once, that he's back engaged in police work with the stakes of his own health is what's at stake. We're familiar with most of these characters in that McCaleb already grants us the guy who's out of retirement to do a final job; a hardened, odd looking suspect whom arrives later on has shadows from a blind cast across his face to further menace and of course, is foreign; the partner on the job who's of binary oppositional variety and the potential love interest whom occupies the background space in the form of Rivers. Then there is the police officers whom don't like our embittered lead and, as a consequence, don't know any better as we come to despise them &#x96; Mexican actor Paul Rodriguez does a good job in this respect, playing a detective acting as McCaleb's chief foil and the guy we love to hate.The film enjoys establishing McCaleb as the investigator from another planet, grossly superior to all his contemporaries in that spotting clues; putting things together and working things out appears to be second nature whereas for the rest of the law enforcers, it's as if trying to solve a crime is an alien language to them. Most of his dialogue sounds like small tidbits or key sentences lifted straight out of a Masters lecture on police procedure or homicide case solving; Eastwood himself pausing to take deep breaths in-between churning out the lines that come across as being written by an ex-professional whom used to work within this field showing off all the terminology he knows. But we play along with the text, and entrust that most of Eastwood's pauses are because of the health issues his character has rather than that the lines are too long and self-explanatory and that Clint cannot keep up with it all. The film is a fun causality driven thriller, much in the way of plot and investigation with many-a colourful archetype included along the way, with the whole thing played straight and executed well enough without too much in the way of gross levels of substance.

At the core of it is the grizzled figure and low, rumbling voice of Clint Eastwood; here, doing what he usually does in scything his way through the film thwarting those in need of thwarting and dealing with everything that comes his way, despite some pretty serious health issues. He's working off of an ample enough screenplay which leans delicately towards no-nonsense, pulpy material just as much it does back the other way towards heart-felt and satisfying character study. It is a script from the pen of Brian Helgeland, working from a novel by Michael Connelly, and again is a finely crafted piece of work delicately balancing between two stables; ever tip-toeing over a proverbial line that Helgeland would come to master with the aforementioned Eastwood just a year later in 2003's Mystic River.
