Praised by public and critics alike with a brace of awards as testament to its value, Elizabeth The Virgin Queen sports a fine cast, offers high end production value, and has little to fault for those who don't mind an infusion of creativity with their history. Good stuff for fans of the players and those interested in the history of the British monarchy.

It is an old fashioned movie with wonderful scenery of the Highlands of Scotland.  Of a life that is no more.  Robert Norman as Fraser the little boy is perfect for the part.  He is very curious and causes no end of trouble.  This movie takes place after World War I and is based on the novel Son of Adam by Sir Denis Forman.  It is a gentle movie and I highly recommend it to those people who want spend an hour and a half in a time that will not come back.  Rosemary Harris as Gamma, as always, is perfect.  ColinFirth as Edward the dreamer, inventor and father plays the part to perfection.  Both Irene Jacob and May Elizabeth Mastrantonio are beautiful and a pleasure to watch. Do see it.
