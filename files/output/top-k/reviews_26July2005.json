Joe Buck soon finds out that being a cowboy hustler in the Big Apple is not as easy as he had anticipated. He gets ripped off by a few people including a hygienically impaired small time con man named Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Ratso dreams of going to Florida where he feels that he will be respected and loved unlike his current condition in New York where he is treated like trash and has to steal whatever he can get just to get by. These two outcasts become friends and together struggle through the hardships that face them everyday.Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman deliver absolutely phenomenal performances. They were born to play these characters. They make you feel like your right beside them walking down the streets of New York. Director John Schlesinger uses amazing images to show Joe's past and what is going on inside Joe's head. The movie was originally rated X for some of its scenes involving Joe's 'work' as well as a drug party hosted by Hansel and Gretel.

Tin Cup tries to be this perfect balance.The build up in relations between Costner and Russo goes on for far too long. The situation is set He likes her but his rival\/ex-buddy is dating her, fine now move on to the actual bulk of the plot\/film. It doesn't, in fact it stays on the same level for a long time. We have to actually remind ourselves that Costner is still a golfer throughout his little interactions with the female lead. When we are treated to a bit of golf, the film takes one too many gears up into the 'out-of-the- question' region as we see him defy the laws of golf and, at the same time, make pretty much every other golfer watching feel as if he's only been playing five minutes as he throws the ball up in the air and smacks it down the middle with- wait for it- a baseball bat(!) How ridiculous is that?The sheer fantasy of Costner's character spoils this film on its own, let alone all the other glitchy, annoying things that occur. We're even led to believe that he can shoot an extraordinary low round by using only the 7-iron on the back nine of a demanding course, yes even on the green and whilst in greenside bunkers, he can still loft it out and one putt (with the back of the club face) to save par. These sort of annoying traits that he pulls off drag the film down further and just turn it into the category of 'farcical'. The film is flawed, surely he would have 'made it' if he's that good, but he didn't somehow.As soon as talk of entering the U.S. open starts, you just know how what's going to happen. The old story of 'here comes the underdog' who is probably the most skilled player ever to pick up a golf club yet still failed miserably in life.The film is farcical, highly-unbelievable and monotonous in it's attempt to build up character relations.

Part of that, of course, is owed to the extremely attractive actors portraying the MacManus brothers, but if that were the sum of the movie's parts, I would only watch the movie once a month, if that.The storyline is not 100% original, and I will admit that Duffy did seem to just point the camera in the general direction of the actors and hope that they did things right. For the most part he got lucky. Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flanery, Billy Connolly, and most especially Willem Dafoe are such talented actors that they are able to interpret their characters and carry their scenes, even if most of the supporting actors aren't quite up to par.Reedus and Flanery are endearing as Murphy and Conner; their scenes together - and they're only once apart - are at once hilarious and adorable. Connolly is granted minimal screen time, with only a few lines, but he manages to pull even that off. The shining star, of course, is Willem Dafoe as Paul Smecker, the conflicted FBI agent hot on the trail of the twins, unsure of whether he should help them out or bring them in. The fragmented scenes in which Smecker describes the crimes are interesting, a little like watching Sherlock Holmes in action.The bad points 1) David Della Rocco as Rocco (how original), package boy for the Yakavetta branch of the Mafia. Rocco has the MacManus brothers' quick tempers without their intelligence or their style. Smecker describes him as kind of an idiot, and I have to say that I agree. Della Rocco seems to just take the script and run with it without giving any kind of thought to his character. 2) Doc the bartender (Gerard Parkes) seems to have Turrett's as he randomly shouts curse words, and he disappears fifteen minutes into the movie, never to be seen or heard from again. The storyline about his bar being closed down completely fizzles out. 3) Again, the hit-and-miss directing. Duffy got lucky. Very, very lucky. Actors with just a little less talent would have made mincemeat of this movie. 4) The interviews during the credits. The movie does a commendable job of setting up an ethical dilemma. There was no need to belabor it; that ploy served the double purpose of infantilizing the audience and making the movie take itself too seriously. Yes, Duffy, we heard you.

I had expected much, much better. Things I didn't like.1. The long sequence depicting the Jews getting hauled out of the Ghetto, as Schindler watches from a hill-top on horse-back for seemingly at least a half hour (in movie running-time). Totally took the movie off course, and steered it away from the story of Schindler and his factory, and turned it into a historical account of the Holocaust (with nothing to do with Schindler). This tries to do too much at once, and is one of the reasons the movie is too long. The movie should stick to being a movie about Schindler's Jews.2. The Germans shooting bullets upwards through the ceiling in to the rooms above, shortly after their fellow Nazi soldiers had run upstairs to root out the Jews. Made no sense. Classic Spielberg goof up.3. Schindler kissing Helen. This came out of nowhere. Why did he walk downstairs in Goeth's villa? Oh, right, to get the wine. Then he just randomly decides to have a long conversation with her? The conversation was long, as is implied to be actually longer than was shown, as we see a cut in the scene at one point, and when we return, Helen is in the middle of a story she is telling to Schindler. This whole scene made no sense, and it is supposed to be some kind of turning point for Schindler (now he's sympathetic to the Jews). Just after talking to Helen? 4. Goeth's instant transformation into Mr. Nice Guy after Schindler talks to him, and tells him that real power is forgiving people or whatever. Totally unrealistic and too fast a transformation. It makes you think that either Goeth is an idiot or Spielberg is an idiot. I think it's a bit of both.I'm not sure why it has such a high rating. Perhaps because of the emotional feelings it can induce, and because it tells a story about a horrific historical event. It is a great story, Spielberg just didn't do a great job telling it.

Perhaps because of the emotional feelings it can induce, and because it tells a story about a horrific historical event. It is a great story, Spielberg just didn't do a great job telling it. Roberto Benigni's, la Vita e Bella is just superb. Focuses very squarely on one story, and doesn't deviate.I give the movie a 6\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"26 July 2005","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a superb film.

Those who have lost loved ones may find the messages in this film very touching. It's essentially a film about eventually letting go of past pains and heartache; never giving up, being hopeful that new love will find you; holding onto courage to move on, to live for now, yet never forgetting past important people and respecting them, giving them honour and behaving how they would want you to behave. The message that really spoke to my soul whilst viewing this film was that there is a time for sorrow, and a time to be sad, but that at the end of all that, there is a time to be joyful.There is hope, and that is what we crucially need to live our lives progressively.Interesting plot which is very different and far superior to the usually comedy romance story, as it is based on a well written novel. All performances were well acted, especially wise old Paul Newman's father figure character to Kevin Costner, who makes him see sense when Costenr is quite stubborn in his way about not wanting to move on, and date Robin Wright Penn's character. The beautiful score and songs of the film really do it justice and set the mood perfectly! Hence why i have the soundtrack on CD as well as the DVD of this film.Perhaps the most touching scene in the film is where Kevin Costner's character finally moves on. He writes a message to his deceased wife to finally attain closure. The words of that letter are most touching and so sincerely meant.Finally, this film has helped me to progressively move on in life after break ups with ex's and it gives me hope and renews my faith in new love.

That is why it starts with 'Dick Laurent is dead' although he is not dead yet; he knows he will die because he's already lived the story. He changes all sorts of things, starting with himself. Instead of an older sexually inadequate murderer, he is a young, virile and innocent man. But reality haunts him (like in MD), in the form of the Mystery Man - Evil - who tells him that when you're sentenced to death, you cannot escape (reality). You have to accept that Evil can take the form of an actual man (like Bob in Twin Peaks).

Moore brought a different interpretation to the role, one which owed something to parts he had played in two adventure series on television, Simon Templar in The Saint and Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders. Whereas Connery's tough, gritty Bond allowed something of the hard man below the surface to show through, Moore played the character much more as a suave, sophisticated English gentleman. (Connery's Bond, like the actor himself, was definitely Scottish).The villain of Live and Let Die is Kananga, the leader of the small Caribbean island of San Monique. (Shouldn't that be Sainte Monique?) For a Bond villain, Kananga's ambitions are surprisingly limited, with no scheme for world domination. He has, however, close links to the New York underworld, and has hatched a plot to flood the American market with heroin. Kananga is deeply superstitious, and employs the services of Solitaire, a beautiful young woman with the power to foretell the future through the use of tarot cards. As with a number of the other films, much of the plot of this one revolves around Bond's ability to win over the villain's female accomplice.The Bond films, of course, are all dependent upon a stylised formula involving adventure (especially chase sequences), exotic locations, beautiful women, evil villains, memorable music and a generous (but preferably not too generous) helping of humour. When all the elements of the formula come together, the result can be a highly enjoyable piece of entertainment. Live and Let Die has, by and large, got most of the elements right. Its main asset is the lovely Jane Seymour, one of the most beautiful as well as one of the most talented of the Bond Girls, as Solitaire. She was one of the youngest of the Bond Girls, being only 22 a the time the film was made (Honor Blackman and Maud Adams, for example, were both in their late thirties when they starred in a Bond film), but despite her lack of experience turns in a very good performance. Her Solitaire is not a strong action heroine like Pussy Galore or Anya Amasova, but a passive figure, melancholy and fatalistic, troubled by her psychic powers but at the same time frightened of losing them. As such she has rather more depth than the average Bond heroine.Roger Moore is also good in this film; in 1973 he was still clearly youthful enough to be convincing in the role and makes the most of it. As the villainous Kananga Yaphet Kotto is adequate, but he does rather suffer the fate of being outshone by the two secondary villains, his henchman Tee Hee (the man with the metal arm and claw for a hand ) and Baron Samedi with his demonic peals of laughter. (Curt Jurgens suffered a similar fate in The Spy who Loved Me, where Richard Kiel's Jaws turned out to be more memorable than his own Stromberg). There are some exciting chase sequences, particularly the one in the old bus across San Monique, and the waterborne one through the Louisiana bayous. I didn't much care for the character of J W Pepper, a rather stupid redneck Louisiana sheriff with a thick Deep South accent who was obviously intended as the film's main comic relief. (He makes another appearance in The Man with the Golden Gun). Nevertheless, there was some successful use of sardonic humour, such as the scene where a man, watching a traditional New Orleans jazz funereal, asks Whose funeral is it? and is told Yours immediately before being stabbed to death. The music was also good, especially Paul McCartney's brilliant theme song. My overall view is that this is, together with For Your Eyes Only, the best of the Roger Moore Bond films. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 July 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Although I have always regarded Sean Connery as the best of the actors to play Bond, I have never (unlike some Connery diehards) regarded the casting of Roger Moore as his successor as a mistake.

When all the elements of the formula come together, the result can be a highly enjoyable piece of entertainment. Live and Let Die has, by and large, got most of the elements right. Its main asset is the lovely Jane Seymour, one of the most beautiful as well as one of the most talented of the Bond Girls, as Solitaire. She was one of the youngest of the Bond Girls, being only 22 a the time the film was made (Honor Blackman and Maud Adams, for example, were both in their late thirties when they starred in a Bond film), but despite her lack of experience turns in a very good performance. Her Solitaire is not a strong action heroine like Pussy Galore or Anya Amasova, but a passive figure, melancholy and fatalistic, troubled by her psychic powers but at the same time frightened of losing them. As such she has rather more depth than the average Bond heroine.Roger Moore is also good in this film; in 1973 he was still clearly youthful enough to be convincing in the role and makes the most of it. As the villainous Kananga Yaphet Kotto is adequate, but he does rather suffer the fate of being outshone by the two secondary villains, his henchman Tee Hee (the man with the metal arm and claw for a hand ) and Baron Samedi with his demonic peals of laughter. (Curt Jurgens suffered a similar fate in The Spy who Loved Me, where Richard Kiel's Jaws turned out to be more memorable than his own Stromberg). There are some exciting chase sequences, particularly the one in the old bus across San Monique, and the waterborne one through the Louisiana bayous. I didn't much care for the character of J W Pepper, a rather stupid redneck Louisiana sheriff with a thick Deep South accent who was obviously intended as the film's main comic relief. (He makes another appearance in The Man with the Golden Gun). Nevertheless, there was some successful use of sardonic humour, such as the scene where a man, watching a traditional New Orleans jazz funereal, asks Whose funeral is it? and is told Yours immediately before being stabbed to death.

Moore brought a different interpretation to the role, one which owed something to parts he had played in two adventure series on television, Simon Templar in The Saint and Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders. Whereas Connery's tough, gritty Bond allowed something of the hard man below the surface to show through, Moore played the character much more as a suave, sophisticated English gentleman. (Connery's Bond, like the actor himself, was definitely Scottish).The villain of Live and Let Die is Kananga, the leader of the small Caribbean island of San Monique. (Shouldn't that be Sainte Monique?) For a Bond villain, Kananga's ambitions are surprisingly limited, with no scheme for world domination. He has, however, close links to the New York underworld, and has hatched a plot to flood the American market with heroin. Kananga is deeply superstitious, and employs the services of Solitaire, a beautiful young woman with the power to foretell the future through the use of tarot cards.

For some reason or another I thought I wouldn't like it all that much, despite the fact that it gets so many good comments from many reviewers. But when it was shown on television a couple of days ago, I decided to tape it and to finally watch it, so that once and for all I would know what this movie would be like.Homer Wells has grown up in an orphanage in a small and remote town where the only strangers that visit it, come to have an abortion, to give birth to an unwanted child or to adopt one. Homer was never adopted, but has become the favorite of orphanage director Dr. Larch, who has thought Homer everything he knew about medicine. Now Homer has become a skilled, but unlicensed physician who takes care of the other children and helps women giving birth. But he knows that there is more in life than the orphanage and he wants to see something of the outside world. When Wally and Candy visit the orphanage for an abortion, Homer leaves, much against Dr. Larch's will, with them to work on Wally's family apple farm. But soon after their arrival Wally has got to go back to the war in Asia (it's 1943), leaving Homer and Candy alone together. With a lot of problems on the farm and the loneliness that's never far away, they soon grow closer together...With a story like this one, this could easily have become a syrupy TV-movie, but Lasse Hallström has avoided that trap perfectly. Not that I expected otherwise. I've seen his What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Chocolat before and I liked both movies, but even the best director can sometimes chose a completely wrong way of telling a story. But he hasn't, with his choice to make this movie emotional, but not extremely sentimental, he is able to keep a large audience interested. And even though the movie conveys a message about pro-abortion (which is fine by me, but which could cost him a lot of viewers), he never forces it down your throat. I guess that the fact that they have made doctor Larch pro-abortion and Homer Wells pro-life gives both sides a reason to like this movie.Next to the good story, this movie also has some very fine acting to offer. Tobey Maguire was very well casted as Homer Wells and his performance makes that not all attention is drawn towards him, but allows you to see the other people in the story as well. Charlize Theron also did well and made her role as the main character in a difficult romance look a lot better than what you might expect. Michael Caine's performance was OK as well, but it's Erykah Badu and Heavy D who surprised me the most. Both aren't exactly known as actors, but what they did in this movie was more than OK.Overall this is a good movie that could have gone wrong in many departments. It's probably only thanks to Hallström that it didn't happen. I liked the story as well as the acting, even though it isn't as perfect as some people say. Still, it's more than just worth a watch and that's why I give this movie arating in between 7\/10 and 7.5\/10.

Later works of her are more an indictment of the suffocation of life in Austria, a common element in Austrian post-war culture as the country has never come to grips with its troubling past.In the movie less emphasis is paid to the relationship with the mother and so the source of Erika's behavior remains largely unexplained here. Erika's father dies and mother and daughter show no emotion at all. In the beginning there is a short fight between mother and daughter about control the mother has on her life.

Huppert is apt for this role and some years earlier did another movie where Jelinek did part of the writing (Malina).The glass-breaking scene has a double meaning. Not only does Erica want to punish Walter for his attention to and interest in another student, she also sees a reflection in that girl's mother of her own mother; in a way she wants to help her preventing having the same life as her with no personal choices of her own.By entering into the relationship with Walter, a classic male\/female struggle starts. Although women in Western societies are nowadays more equal than ever before, Jelinek wants to say that women and men are still strictly attached to certain role models that are almost all power-driven (among which sexual role models). Her sexual desires, although extreme and communicated in the most awkward of possible ways, can not be realized in a relationship. The relationship turns into a sexual battleground, in order to be loved and not lose Walter she has to give in to him, so he eventually vindicates and her total disintegration as a woman starts.

With this movie he has made a film about the American Civil War, a time period that has been used more often in movies, but because I know that Ang Lee always tries to do something original with his movies, I decided to give it a try.Ride with the Devil is situated in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Jake Roedel and Jack Bull Chiles are friends and they decide to join a militia called the Bushwhackers, after Jack Bull's dad is killed by Union soldiers. Jake Roedel is the son of German immigrants who normally chose the side of the Unionists and that's why he isn't really accepted by the other members of the group. Daniel Holt has a similar problem. He's black, but no slave. His friend George Clyde had bought him and offered him his freedom. That's why Holt decided not to flee to the North, but to stay in the South and to fight together with his friend at the side of the rebels. They sometimes get involved in some skirmish and then have to flee into hiding places, offered to them by the locals. One of those locals is Sue Lee, a young widow who brings them food. She and Jack Bull become lovers, but when Jack Bull becomes deadly wounded, Jake escorts her south to a safe farm, leaving the Bushwackers behind. Some of his 'friends' who never liked him all that much anyway, now not only seek for revenge on the Federals, but also on Jake...The fact that this movie looked historically accurate and didn't tell the story from the perspective of some regular soldiers, but from the irregular, rebellious side, was something that I really appreciated in this movie. Normally you only get to see the battlefields, but this movie offered me an idea of how the other fighting parties lived and acted and how the normal man and woman was confronted with the war. The story, which has been well-written, has spent a lot of time on all the aspects of life, so not only on the fighting and that's very good. What I also appreciated was the acting.

Some of his 'friends' who never liked him all that much anyway, now not only seek for revenge on the Federals, but also on Jake...The fact that this movie looked historically accurate and didn't tell the story from the perspective of some regular soldiers, but from the irregular, rebellious side, was something that I really appreciated in this movie. Normally you only get to see the battlefields, but this movie offered me an idea of how the other fighting parties lived and acted and how the normal man and woman was confronted with the war. The story, which has been well-written, has spent a lot of time on all the aspects of life, so not only on the fighting and that's very good. What I also appreciated was the acting. With Tobey Maguire as the only big name and Jewel in a leading role, I had some doubts about what the acting would be like. But I admit that it all looked a lot better than what I feared. Especially Jewel proved to be capable of playing a leading role. I guess I should have known better. Ang Lee isn't the least of directors and I'm convinced that the man can spot real talent, even in people who aren't very famous for their acting.All in all this is an enjoyable movie that shows a different aspect from the Civil War. It may sometimes be a bit slow, but overall this is an enjoyable movie that is able to keep you interested for over two hours. I really appreciated this movie and that's why I give it a 7.5\/10.

All of these beg the modern question... who did the director steal his best ideas from? Well that's just it. Although Suspects does owe a debt of gratitude to many films, Casablanca being one example, it was made a long time before the recent crop of films created by directors nicking their best ideas of other people.This is no Tarantino-esquire film because it was made before he hit the full heights of his popularity. It has no Shyamalan style twist because old M. Night probably got the idea from Suspects. In short, this was the film that provided the catalyst for an awful lot of what we now regard as standard in our noirish, modern films.For anyone who has yet to see this movie any talk of the plot would spoil the surprise, not just the one at the end but the genuine thrill of seeing every actor involved create an ensemble piece of such exquisite pace, tension and thrill. Whether it's Benicio Del Toro's bizarre Fenster, Kevin Pollack's bitter-sweet Hockney or even Stephen Baldwin's characteristic McManus, this film has a bunch of actors doing perhaps their best work to date, even beyond the five in the line up.There are a few minor quibbles. Continuity provides a problem in places as does the explanations for some characters' motives. The film jumps around different time-lines fairly unpredictably and you can be forgiven for wondering whether the whole thing is just a big shaggy dog story. On the other hand, as twisty turny thrillers go this one can't be beat.If you have yet to do so buy, not see or rent but buy, this film, watch it all the way through with no one (as they'll be hopping up and down on their seat desperately trying to explain the clever bits and pieces that Singer and co have strewn throughout) and enjoy one of the best examples of modern film making. You must be warned though, when I saw it for the first time I had to start it again right from the beginning just to get to grips with the ending!

The symbolism that was so cool in the first movie was totally lost here. In the first movie, Eric was jolted by memories every time he touched an object or seen through other's eyes, this was the best effect I've seen in a movie. Also, he and the bird do not have as close of a relationship as they did in the first film. It really gets one into the character. In City of Angels, however this effect is lost. I was excited to hear that Iggy Pop was on board as he was suppose to be the first movie's Funboy, and he might have the best role in this film, although that isn't saying much. The acting is terrible and the dialog is even worse. There is no depth to the story and there is no emotion. The first one makes you feel the love, feel the pain, and in the sequel you feel the pain of watching such a bad movie.They bring back Sarah from the first movie in the most horrible way. She's not the same actor nor does she even appear to be the same person. Her past and story isn't developed in this film at all. This raises the question of what happened with officer Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), but there is not a true link between this one and the first one.The entire story from beginning to the end is unbelievable, they bring back a gang of people to be killed but they are introduced very poorly. If you want a good sequel to the crow movie, Savation is just a tad better, but not by much. But it is hard to match a movie which carries the heart and soul of Brandon Lee. A better movie than the first Crow I have yet to see.

Al Pacino's performance is outstanding. Marlon Brando is such a believable godfather that I think mafiosos throughout history would feel intimidated if they ever had to go to a meeting with Don Corleone.James Caan also provides a smashing performance as the hot-headed Sonny. His ferocity and high spirited attitude adds so much to the film. I've always wondered if Robert Duvall's natural speaking voice is that of Tom Hagan or of another one of his characters like the preacher or Gus.This is one of the few films that I will never, ever grow tired of watching. Dramatically and cinematically speaking, it is one of the few films that I admire and wish that other Hollywood directors and producers would try to emulate as far as style, story development and acting goes, especially in Hollywood's dark time of remakes and lackluster script writing.
