I've seen the two firsts, and I must say that the best of all is Osmosis Jones. It combines two story lines the story of Frank Detorri (Bill Murray), a disgusting man with a disgusting life too. And the other story line is where the animation takes part and recreates all the inside of Frank's body. This last one is the main part of the film, where we find our white blood cell cop Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock), followed by his partner Drix (David Hyde Pierce), a cold tablet, in order to prevent the body from the attack of the evil and powerful virus Thrax (Lawrence Fishburne). At first glance, the plot seems cheesy and typical, but the movie is an incredible combination of brilliant animation, incredible CGI, fantastic characters and dialogues and very funny gags. I never expected a cartoon movie from the Farrelly brothers. I mean, they have changed a lot their style from There's something.... You still find some scatological elements, but all the action in Frank's body is really good and surprising. For example, the neurones are represented as telephone operators, the stomach is like an airport, the bladder is like a harbor, you find turrets shooting snots inside the nose and so on.The two main characters Ozzy and Drix are quite similar to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the Lethal Weapon series. You know, two cops, one quite mad and risky, the other cold and more serious... Also you can find cameos from The Matrix and Titanic, but I would like to mention the appearance of KIDNEY ROCK in the film. Of course, we're talking about KID ROCK, the famous US rock star, considered by himself and lots of fans like the PIMP of the nation. In Europe, it's not very popular, but I consider myself fan of his work, and I really enjoyed his appearance in Osmosis Jones, followed by his small pal Joe C., who sadly died a few months ago.So, go to the cinema right now and watch the movie1. If you like animation movies full of action 2. If you are interested in medicine 3. If you don't think that cartoons are only for kids (People who say this drives me mad, some of my buddies will know what I'm talkin' 'bout ^_^)WORTH LOOK!!!!! 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Osmosis Jones is a very funny, entertaining and clever film brought by the Farrelly brothers, creators of comedies like Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary and Me, Myself & Irene.
