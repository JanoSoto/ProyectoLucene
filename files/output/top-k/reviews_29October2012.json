Now I haven't seen the extended bootleg edition so i have not seen all there is to see, therefore this is based solely on the theatrical version. Let's also not forget Jason Lee, the usual comedy man who takes a bit of a turn as a disgruntled lead singer who is ironically the one getting overshadowed by the guitarist.This movie is a new personal favorite of mine, and I definitely plan on buying the extended version when I get the chance.

Among them Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter. Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar- winning Best Sound. Seasoned KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, calls Titanic a romantic masterpiece. The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, &#x85; even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren't available. TitanicReviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!

It is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies an adventure about a young boy named Elliott and his new alien friend E.T. trying to get E.T. back to his planet. It is a heartwarming journey full of memorable scenes and incredible lighting and photography. This quirky family classic is a favorite of mine and is a part of my childhood. E.T. has some of the most amazing music I have ever heard in film. Turn on Your Heartlight by Neil Diamond is the main theme of this movie, and a good one at that. The storyline and character development are extremely well done. By the end of the film, you have an emotional attachment to the majority of the characters. The scene where Elliott and E.T. are riding bikes and then suddenly start to float into the air over a silhouette of the moon is fantastic photography at its finest.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is as good today as it was when it was released 30 years ago. Also, this film has a star-studded cast, including Dee Wallace as Mary, Peter Coyote as Keys, and an adorable Drew Barrymore as Gertie. Follow along as Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, finds a lost alien that he names E.T. Can Elliott help E.T. find his way home? You'll just have to watch to find out. My favorite character is E.T. because E.T. is just the most adorable thing ever. He's just so cute and so funny. Also, my favorite scene is when Elliott. realizes that his plant is coming back to life and he's, like, Oh, my gosh, E.T. could be alive again. And so he goes over to the coffin, opens it, and he's, like, Oh, E.T. and E.T. goes, Home phone, phone home and he just starts yelling home and phone. It's absolutely hilarious. Elliott has to go running and get a blanket and wrap it around his head so no one will know E.T. is alive. He's so happy after that. So, I love that scene. The cinematography and special effects in this film are absolutely amazing. I am so impressed with how they made E.T. look so cute and so real. Also, the music adds such great effect to this movie. I think it is great; they did a great job. I think that this film is for people of all ages because it's such a great film and it's a classic. I think everyone is going to enjoy this. It's very entertaining. Also, I think that this film is rated six out of five stars because it's absolutely amazing, entertaining and enjoyable. I love it.

It's such a touching and magical moment. The message in this movie is Elliott and E.T. are so connected that they do not have any barriers. My favorite character in this movie is E.T. because he's so magical, loving and caring. I give this movie five out of five stars. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I give this age range 3 and up because some little kids might always say, E.T. phone home.

After drug lord Franz Sanchez maims Felix Leiter and kills Leiter's wife shortly after their wedding, James Bond sets out on a personal quest for revenge at any cost; even if it means going rogue from MI6.This is maybe the darker, more realistic pre-Craig Bond. However, unlike Craig's, this one manages to keep the feeling of a Bond movie. There is still that flair of fantasy going around, easily noted in the opening scenes, but they try to keep it from going too far; after Moore's more light-hearted approach to the franchise, it's quite nice to see it going serious again.Timothy Dalton is fantastic here. After a rather forgettable first attempt in TLD, he manages find the balance only Sean Connery had. He is charming and charismatic, his eyes always having that playful spark on them. Yet, he is also ruthless when he needs to be and manages to remember us what is Bond; his cold-blood as he tries to get closer to Sanchez, as he sets a man on fire and watches as another has his head exploded... This is no ordinary man on a revenge quest this is a professional killer who knows what he is doing and will do anything to get it done. His stunts are believably well-done too.Also unlike the newer Bonds, the girls also shine in here. Talisa Soto is beautiful as Lupe and in most other movies would have robbed the spotlight, but Carey Lowell gives her a run for her money. Her Pam is one of the best Bond girls I've seen and her final scenes with Dalton's Bond are beautifully romantic, something from a classic romance. Other important roles in the cast are Desmond Llewelyn, who gets an increased screen time as Q, and Robert Davi who plays villain Sanchez, one of the most ruthless Bond villain but who doesn't really shine in here. It's also fun to note a young Benicio del Toro in one of his first roles.Licence to Kill is one of the better 007 movies, and quite a nice change of pace from Moore's fantastic outings. It's a shame it went into hiatus and we didn't get to see Dalton play this role more times, which is even more sad because of the Roger Moore wannabe that replaced him.

After the death of his mother, a young boy (Edward Furlong) and his father (Anthony Edwards) move to the city of the first film. Once there he learns about the infamous Indian burial ground and his friend tries it out with his dog and when it works more people end up going there. PET SEMATARY II is a pretty stupid film from the word go and it just keeps getting dumber and dumber as it goes along. I think time has been somewhat friendly to the film because when you look back on it you realize that it's not nearly as bad as most of the horror films from this era (I know that's not a ringing endorsement). One of the biggest problems is that the film's pacing is just way too slow and at 100-minutes the film certainly drags in a lot of spots. I'm going to guess that most people watching this is going to know what happens when you bury something at the location so why the film drags everything out is beyond me. Once the horror elements do start we get some pretty silly stuff dealing with countless people being taken to the burial ground and after a while you really start to have many logical issues but that's a-whole-nother story. The performances from Furlong and Edwards are good enough but it's Clancy Brown who easily steals the film as a psycho sheriff. The gore level is fairly mild, although there's a memorable dog attack as well as a memorable scene involving a dirt bike. Mary Lambert does what she can with the story but it's clearly just meant as a way to cash in on the success of the first.

By far one of the greatest Thriller movie of all time.It's about a young boy who has the ability to see and communicate with Dead People.

Thrill-seekers who want a good ghost story are after A-bump-a-minute scenarios which, thankfully, this film does not have, instead garnering a slow but natural and steady pace which involves wonderful hints and twists throughout and a wonderful, touching and ultimately, creepy conclusion.I have never been a great fan of Aidan Quinn or Kate Beckinsale, though their chemistry here makes the film very watchable, and Quinn is acceptable as a hapless if not quite lovable hero. Beckinsale is also on generally good, charming form and, to be fair to both actors, there are several points in the script where the dialogue is so shallow and blunt, that Laurence Olivier and Gielgud himself (who appears and is wonderful as the local doctor) would have struggled to bring any more life to them without making the words seem silly and unrealistic.The show-stealer, as per usual in almost everything he is in, is undoubtedly Anthony Andrews, as the understatedly creepy yet charmingly alluring elder brother. Andrews is a very-much underrated actor as it is, but his performance and changes in attitude towards Quinn as the guest in their sprawling home, very much makes the film and most of the tension therein.Anna Massey too is wonderful as the housekeeper\/nanny and creates a very sorry character with whom one instantly feels sympathy, playing out her pivotal role right until the very end with her usual grace and unabashed talent.To one who knows the ins and outs of modern twists and turns in movies and stories such as these, the ending is not altogether unpredictable, but the well-disguised yet compelling hints throughout make it all much more exciting, and the scenes of ghostly appearance are, for a change, nicely inserted without too much musical decoration or unnecessary special effects, making the whole thing very watchable.

However, this was one of the better slasher-sequels I've seen. It certainly wasn't scary but it had a few jumpy scenes and I thought the opening scene with Alice was cleverly done. It was the spookiest part of the film for sure because you wouldn't be certain exactly how dangerous Jason could be. After that, the film does slow down tremendously to the point it actually got boring for a while. However, two quick kills get us drawn back to the film and away from unnecessary scenes and dialogue. The scene where the two people are having sex and Jason comes in was awesome as he suddenly comes in and kills them off. The awesome thing about this scene comes from when Ginny decides to check out her friends and why everything is quiet. She opens the blanket and Jason just jumps out like a BOSS! Then we see the two being brutally killed and this was by far the greatest Friday the 13th moment to date.

But if you call it A New Hope that's fine. I've loved this and the other two original films since I was 6 years old, and I always will. Ever since I saw those yellow words blast on the screen with John Williams music playing in the background, I was addicted. Don't worry, I'm not going to talk about the stupid changes that Lucas made to this film. Story A young farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who longs for adventure. Having been raised by his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, he's always wondered who his father was, and has longed for a life beyond his home planet Tatooine, but his Uncle Owen won't allow it. One day, he and his friend Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) join forces with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a wookie Chewbacca and two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to save Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of Darth Vader and the evil Empire. After they save Leia, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance who use the blueprints of the Empire's new battle station called the Death Star, and with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca, Luke destroys the Death Star and all is well... for now.All the actors deliver 100% Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker perfectly embodies the heroic young boy who longs for adventure and would do anything to help his friends. Harrison Ford owns the role of Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is great as Leia, and Alec Guinness was perfect in the role of Obi Wan Kenobi. As for Han and Leia, I love how the two are always arguing, and makes for really entertaining dialogue. The character of Darth Vader (physically portrayed by David Prowse, and voiced by James Earl Jones) is probably the best on screen villain of all time. The first time he comes through the fog on that ship in the beginning of the movie gives the audience the impression that he is the most menacing and evil figure in the galaxy.What makes this a great film besides the story and the acting? The special effects still blow my mind, even today and John Williams' score is terrific. But the main reason why people love this film and the other two so much is that the characters and the story are the main focus and not the spectacle. Unfortunately that's the way it was in the prequel trilogy (even though I thought Revenge of the Sith actually ended the saga on a better note). The story is shared through the experiences of Luke Skywalker, a wide-eyed innocent who has yet to explore the unknown. Star Wars and the other two movies as a whole is a coming of age story of Luke growing into becoming a Jedi Knight like his father before him. Plus, Luke, Leia and Han are the most normal people in the entire trilogy, and their interactions with each other seem real.Fans can say what they want about George Lucas, but I give him a lot of credit for giving us this great saga which has inspired so many people all over the world, and will continue to be an inspiration for future generations. If you're one of the few people on the planet that hasn't seen Star Wars, do yourself a favor and watch it. It's awesome!

They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away!My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them. My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and fun. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie.Andre is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change. This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of- five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot.

Everybody on earth wants to be outside to see it. Regina (played by Catherine Mary Stewart) also wants to see the spectacular light show but she has been persuaded by her boyfriend, Larry (Michael Bowen) to stay with him in a theater projection room for a night of sex. Meanwhile, Regina's younger teenage sister, Samantha (Kelli Maroney) is spending the night in a lawn storage shed because she just had a fight with their stepmother Doris (Sharon Farrell). Little do either of them suspect that staying in rooms made of steel is the only thing that will save them from becoming red calcium dust or turning into zombie-like creatures. Additionally, not far from where they are is a secret lab where scientists have sealed themselves up pending the comet's passing. Unfortunately, they forgot to close the ventilation ducts and as a result they are deteriorating into zombie-like creatures as well. To counter this condition they desperately need the blood of survivors and they don't care what happens to the people they get it from. At any rate, rather than reveal the entire plot I will just say that this film is both fun and entertaining. Even though the plot is a little thin (like many of the movies made during this period) it was well directed (Thom E.

As a matter of fact, Mary Woronov, who played the part of one of the scientists named Audrey, was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Sure, it lacks the suspense of the first and Michael Myers was shown a bit too much, not to mention the poorly lit hospital which was pretty scary, yet very confusing at the same time, but that doesn't matter for they seem to be outweighed by it's redeeming factors.The acting is great thanks to an ensemble cast, the direction from Rick Rosenthal is decent, the pacing is well-paced, the death scenes, much like the original, are unforgettable and the music from Alan Horvath is at the same depth as the original's music for being quite atmospheric which fits the tone of the movie perfectly.I can understand why lots of people, including Halloween fans, hated this sequel especially the critics, but I thought this is a decent sequel to a great classic. It may be flawed, but it might be worth-watching if you give it a chance.

In other words, Michael Myers is absent from this outing. And it is in this regard that I would positively assert praise for Tommy Lee Wallace's effort, as the third installment in the franchise is certainly the most original and indeed, the most innovative entry.Santa Mira is home to the Irish-American business tycoon Conal Cochran, who owns the Silver Shamrock Novelties company. Their count-down to Halloween advertisements (Played to a catchy London Bridge is Falling Down tune) have kids all over American buying one of the three Silver Shamrock Halloween masks on offer. A witch, a skull, or a pumpkin (Not a great selection, it has to be said). A murder\/suicide in a hospital emergency room a few miles away in which the murder victim arrives gripping a Silver Shamrock Halloween mask (My personal favourite one, by the way - the pumpkin) screaming that They are gonna kill us all! leaves Dr. Dan Challis with many questions which subsequently sees him heading to Santa Mira to the Silver Shamrock factory to get to the bottom of the mystery. But while their, he uncovers a sinister (and quite frankly, baffling) plot to kill as many children as possible on Halloween night.Problems exist right away in the script. I mean, it's never made clear just what Cochran's reasons behind his plot to kill hundreds, if not thousands of children on Halloween night are. He mentions some bogus story about a Celtic tradition. It was as though the scriptwriters were rushed when they were putting it together and they basically just said, well screw it... no one is gonna care!. Another fault - and possibly the most incredible one - has to be the incredulous plot element in which the Silver Shamrock company managed to take a chunk of Stone Henge and ship it across the Atlantic and then take it across America to California. This is only briefly mentioned of course - in fact, almost whispered. Just as well... the cringe factor would have been mighty. Even seeing the rocks in the lab almost ruins the film. Surely their could have been a better way of doing this without involving Stone Henge? Maybe a man-made poison or detonator that was placed inside the masks.Tom Atkins is Dr. Challis in a solid performance, while Stacey Nelkin is decent enough as Ellie. Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy is quite menacing as Cochran in a brilliant performance. It was good to see as well that for once an Irish actor was actually used to play an Irish character, so we didn't end up with some cretin attempting an Irish accent but instead coming out with an exaggerated and thoroughly inbred mutated accent that wouldn't be found anywhere on this planet.Possibly the most memorable aspect of Halloween III Season of the Witch is the music. The Silver Shamrock jingle played in the theme of London Bridge is Falling Down is very catchy and inexplicably unsettling. The ending is nihilistic and abrupt, and consequently this is the only film in the franchise in which evil is not defeated.
