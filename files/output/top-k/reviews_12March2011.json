[{"date":"12 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Tod Browning's Dracula(1931) is another visually arresting Universal monster picture with very little story and character depth. Like Frankenstein(1931) the lighting and the settings of Dracula(1931) create a great tone and mood but the story, the characters and the performances don't live up to the quality of the images. Again, I can certainly understand why Dracula(1931) was a commercially successful film in the early days of sound films but commercial success does not equate to quality. The countless cutaways to Dracula's creepy eyes and the image of a the huge stationary bat flapping it's wings in the window became quite comical after a while as it became quite obvious that the filmmakers had zero trust in the audiences ability to infer anything about the story and needed to be told over and over again the the monster was scary and that he liked to watch people from windows. The scariest of scary movies tap into real human fears and emotions and a film like Dracula(1931) is so other-worldly and unrealistic that it seems impossible to me that audiences could be genuinely scared or frightened by this film.
