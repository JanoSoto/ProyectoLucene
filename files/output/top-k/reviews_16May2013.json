For fifty uninterrupted years, this was widely considered the greatest movie of all time which is mighty praise indeed for any film. There are many articles and opinion pieces in various media by people smarter or better informed than I (including this very site, I imagine) extolling the virtues of this movie but personally, I believe they are discussing the film's legacy rather than its value as entertainment which is understandable, given the film's age. But can any film, even one with such standing as this, ever really live up to the overwhelming hype of being the world's greatest movie? The film opens amid the crumbling, isolated estate of Xanadu - the vast home of reclusive media tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) who lays dying on his death-bed. Dropping a snow globe and uttering the word rosebud, Kane dies and sparks a media frenzy over the meaning of his final word. Journalist Jerry Thompson (William Adland) takes up the story, speaking in turn with those who knew Kane in an effort to solve the riddle his former wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) who's scraping a living as a lounge singer, the manager of Kane's media empire Mr Bernstein (Everett Sloane) and Kane's one-time best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten). He even gains access to the unpublished memoirs of banker and Kane's former financial guardian Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris) but Thompson continues to draw blanks, pouring over the details of Kane's life which is told in flashback.In the nine and a bit years I've been writing about films on this website, I have yet to come across a film that I couldn't find some fault with even if I was nitpicking in some cases. Not so now - Citizen Kane is as flawless a film as I've witnessed. Story-telling is both gripping and innovative, covering everything from the loss of innocence, the struggle for redemption and the corrupting twin evils of money and power. Performances are also of an exceptional standard led by the incomparable Welles, who also co-wrote and directed this masterpiece. And what direction it is - this movie is full of genuinely brilliant moments and scenes, shot with real awareness of the look Welles wanted. It feels less like a movie and more like a moving tapestry, painted by artists more skilled than maybe even they realised. Welles' experience in radio also gives the film's sound a real boost and while his time on stage also allows the film to be daring and bold with its lighting. Even the title card allows no room for compromise - it's bold, stark and fills the screen from top to bottom, not unlike Kane himself.That Citizen Kane is one of the more important films in history is, for me, beyond question. But is it truly the greatest? That will depend on the viewer's perspective but for me, this felt like something of an awakening. I cannot remember a film that made me open my eyes to the medium in a way I never had before, the realisation that film could be used for something greater than mere explosions, war propaganda and hokey westerns. Even today, Citizen Kane remains the ultimate movie-going experience - other than the endless references to it in The Simpsons, I had no prior exposure to this film and yet it gripped me from the off. It is a simply epic picture - maybe not in terms of scale with thousands of extras or a world-threatening plot but in terms of a man's life, his place in history and what we leave behind when we're gone. At the end, I was stood like Kane in his own opera house and wildly applauding what I'd witnessed which was nothing short of history being made. What a film, what an experience.

Check it out if you want.)I have a long history of love for this particular film, and it continues to this day. As a Christian, the story of Moses was one of those stories that is oft told in Sunday School and the likes, and deservedly so. It is one of the biggest examples of epic in the entire Bible.The Prince of Egypt is an animated Dramatic Musical that was first released in 1998, starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and others, and is probably the most epic family movie I've seen. It kick- started my interest in Ancient Egyptian culture and history in my youth, and is to this date the best Bible Epic i've ever seen...and it's animated.The interesting thing about POE that sets it apart from other animated movies is that it doesn't bother with the dreaded 'Disney Comic Relief Characters' that are in every other animated movie, especially after The Lion King, including non-Disney movies. The issue with these characters is that they don't add much to the story, and are really just there as distractions for the kids, as to keep them entertained through the more adult story (see Hunchback of Notre Dame). Prince of Egypt doesn't do that at all, and the closest it gets to that trope are the two High Priests, Hotep and Hoy, played by Steve Martin and Martin Short, but they come across more as creepy than funny, despite their more cartoonish design, compared to the rest of the movie.But that's not to say the movie isn't funny. It has plenty of funny moments, such as the beginning with the brotherly quarrels between Rameses and Moses. These comedic moments are limited though, and the movie feels more like a musical along the lines of Les Mis, to give a recent example, than any Disney movie clone.The music is the strongest part of the movie, and the reason I think that the film will do well on a Broadway stage. The film has one of the best openings ever, in my opinion, with the seven minute 'Deliver Us' instantly saying to the audience 'This ain't a kid's movie' with the implied deaths of thousands of children. Other songs, such as 'All I ever Wanted', 'Playing with the Big Boys', and 'The Plagues', and of course, 'When You Believe,' a song that was covered by Celene Dion and Whitney Houston for the soundtrack and became a worldwide hit. The lyrics mix perfectly with the Hans Zimmer score, creating one of the most memorable soundtracks ever written.And the story is also amazing. Most everyone in a predominantly Christian or Jewish culture, whether they follow the religion(s) or not, are familiar with the Moses story, but the way the film presents it, as a tale of two brothers who are forced to be enemies by a higher power, is a very unique interpretation of the story. The fact that it's called 'The Prince of Egypt' speaks volumes about the tone of the story. At first glance, nobody would guess 'Moses' from the title, unless they knew about the film beforehand. The reason I believe it is titled that is because Moses, being raised in an Egyptian palace his entire life, would have a massive connection to the land and people, despite his heritage. Moses would've been conflicted with himself and the love for the country he was raised in, and the culture he belongs to, and the movie presents that conflict almost perfectly.Visually speaking, the film is GORGEOUS. Every single frame is made perfectly. The throne room of the Pharoh, with the statue of Seti right next to Seti's real profile is great framing. The entire movie feels huge, every picture is scaled perfectly, and the final fifteen minutes, with the parting of the Red Sea, is one of the most epic moments in animated cinema. Watching the movie just for the visuals in itself is an enjoyable experience, even to this day, and this film is fourteen years old now.So yeah, this is probably my favorite animated movie, at least right now.

I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow.

If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out.

And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations.

I am quite interested in Law (I almost began the Law degree at my town college and am still a little frustrated not to have done it), so I like many courtroom movies like The Lincoln lawyer, A time to kill, A few good men, The firm, Murder in the first... Those not interested in this subgenre will not probably enjoy the one I am reviewing... Ghosts of Mississippi may sound like a horror movie, that is why I think it is not the most apropiated tittle. The story is mainly about a district attorney from Mississippi who allies with the widow of a black civil rights leader who was murdered about thirty years ago while his murderer was living free. The end will be predictable if we know the real case well but even in this case, it is worth to discover this movie with its good acting, cast, scenography and so on. This is not the movie in the subgenre, but really, it is better than some other I have seen. The director is Rob Reiner, who directed very good movies like A few good men, Misery and The bucket list as well as other worse like The magic of Belle Isle and When Harry met Sally. In this case, he did a very good job taking into account the script is very tied to the reality. The pace is excellent for a movie of this kind and it has many moving moments and dialogues. I think the duration of the film is the proper one, too. The cast is starred by Alec Baldwin with his powerful voice and believable interpretation of the district attorney convinced of making justice. Although not my favorite, he is noticeable actor with an incredible career, but I think he should work in more varied movies. Anyway, his work in this and others is very intense. Baldwin, in concret, and the performances in general represent a strong point in the movie James Woods (I liked him in The specialist) is not as present in the movie, but his performance is one of the best I have seen him do. He plays the part of the murderer when he was younger and old a masterful performance. Whoopi Goldberg plays a very powerful and dramatic and relevant role as the widow. The rest of the cast is OK Willian H. Macy, Craig T. Nelson... The scenography is simple but realistic and aproppiate as it has to be.

No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films.The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well.Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"16 May 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best?

A Clockwork Orange is such a powerful and thought-provoking film. Not only there are unique and stylish sets \/ costumes for futuristic Britain, which are always a delight to see, but we also follow the mesmerizing journey of the ultraviolent delinquent Alex DeLarge (brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm McDowell) who seeks for an unconventional treatment as a way to reduce his sentence in jail and get reintroduced to society as a righteous individual. I found very interesting how this reform program is supposed to make Alex a better person and control his violent impulses, but it just takes his free will away, making him completely unresponsive even though he still needs them. You start feeling disgusted and despised by this character, but by the end of the film you feel sorry for how much he suffered, as well as having been manipulated and humiliated.

Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.The movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... The less said about Superman IV the better.Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.The effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.There are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really?

It's not necessarily about letting the so-called 'good' triumph over 'evil.' Sometimes, the main question is is it even necessary? Perhaps, sometimes we are no different from the villains.Without spoiling anything, Apocalypse Now is a story about our human psyche and how it can easily become corrupted by the tragedy of violence. Whether our spirits can become pure again is a question to ponder. And how these points are born from the story being told shows that Apocalypse Now is more than just about war, but about our war with our own humanity. Whether it means to do the right thing or to find some sort of redemption from the wrongdoings of our past, we are all searching for something just like Willard traveling down the Nung River.As we keep searching, will it take us to our breaking point? Will it kill us or will we rise above it and reach that destination we have been searching our whole lives for? These are only a few of the questions that this film has brought to my attention and I assume many who watch this film will pick up something different from it, as the story is wide open to many different interpretations.With its heavy hallucinogenic atmosphere, Apocalypse Now seems to evoke a very spiritual feel. It's cinematography shows the beauty of nature being contrasted with the ugliness of man-made destruction. The scenes where it's tranquil and slow really immerse you into the movie and as the movie becomes more despondent in its tone, the use of chiaroscuro becomes more evident. I cannot find the right words to do justice as to how much this film is a beautiful piece of art, not only in its story and its characters, but also in its visual aesthetics.To sum things up to the point, 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that differs from many straight-forward Hollywood movies, in that one can develop many conclusions, due to its very subtle nature in its story. It may sound like a simple story at first, but upon multiple viewings, you will find there are many layers beneath the surface. Apocalypse Now is more than just about Captain Willard trying to accomplish his assigned mission, but also about him questioning what HIS real mission really is underneath it all. It will make you, the viewer question that just as much as I question what my own objective in life is and whether it is even attainable. Philosophical ramblings aside, 'Apocalypse Now' is a stone cold classic and it is one of the best movies of all time.

It's said that during movie-making, they (Kubrick & Clarke) decide that there is no way humans can know what higher intelligent beings look like, if they actually exist somewhere in the universe, which they do. If you show them as something like a half-human, or a monster, the movie fails. But then, how do you indirectly depict them? Their answer is a rectangular shape. Think about it. A smooth rectangle is the simplest shape that cannot be created by nature. If you encounter a rectangle somewhere in the universe, you know there is intelligence there.(11) How easy it is to spoil a masterpieceOn arrival at Jupiter, Bowman sees a monolith, is then driven into a journey that cannot be properly described.Why not create an understandable interesting story of encounter? We are in sci-fi, you are free to create any story. Kubrick refuses to do so. He sticks to science over sci-fi. Unable to present a story between Bowman and the monolith that's scientifically plausible, he decides to present to the viewer a journey that, nobody, not even himself can properly describe.This saves the movie from losing the whole sense of reality he has been building up for 2 hours. Sense of reality, in universe, that's what this movie is about.

And beyond that is the unreachable, due to the limit of the speed of light.In this limitless universe, the intelligent beings, who are millions or billions of years ahead of humans, where are they? Are they our God?In an interview, Kubrick said that his movie, 2001 a space odyssey, is about the story of human beings leaving Earth in search of God.In 5 billion years, our Solar System will die. When the Sun dies, it will expand and swallow our Earth, eliminating all traces of life, for good.
