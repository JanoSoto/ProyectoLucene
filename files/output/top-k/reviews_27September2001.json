Set in the north of England in the 1970's it is the story of an mixed race Asian family living in a mainly white community.  However the film doesn't really tackle the conflict between the races but rather the conflict within the family itself - both the clash of the cultures between the white mother and Asian father, and the children resisting the traditional culture of their father.The film rises easily above TV sitcom\/drama to be of film standard in every sense.  The director captures the size of the house and the community well.  The acting is good - especially Om Puri as the father.  The film builds the picture of an eastern family mixing with the western culture well - with comedy scenes used as well as more dramatic scenes used to show this.If you enjoy this style of domestic humour, you'll love this (especially the scenes where the family are all together - check out the youngest who is a very British indeed and reminds me of Kenny from South Park!).  But don't be fooled into thinking that this is a crude toilet-humour style comedy (like the marketing suggests) it is much more than that. Also if you have a father who wanted his children to be raised a specific way (not necessarily Asian) then you'll get much of the drama between father and children.My only problem with this is that the characters sometimes seem to be caricatures, and the plotting is sometimes a bit ropey with so many things to fit in.Is it realistic of the experience of british Muslims at the time?

The concept, that women can be as deft players of the field as men, is certainly not new to most.  It may be new to A level films, and it probably is new to director\/producer Mark Brown, the creator of HOW TO BE A PLAYER.  But it is not a concept new to almost any B level direct-to-video thriller, anything on Cinemax after 11pm, or to any newspaper.  Women have almost always been better players (see Anna Nicole Smith, Leona Helmsley, that maid that married the Johnson & Johnson fortune, and almost all of the guests on either Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, or Ricki Lake).  But, this movie does have an easy going pace and sound track that combine to make it as smooth as a ride in Shante's convertible Jaguar.  What makes the film stay slightly above average is the presence of the three lead thespians.  First of all, let it be said that Anthony Anderson does in fact walk away with this film.  He simply owns every second that he is on screen (including the out takes at the end).  His natural and easy manner combined with impeccable comic timing simply makes him the de facto owner of the material, the screen, and the film as a whole.  Next, Morris Chestnut, whether given a lot or a little (like here) to do simply comes off as likable.  And in the main role, few actresses - good looking or not - could carry off the part that Vivica A. Fox plays.  The film would not be believable were it not for this particular actresses commanding presence and astonishing good looks.  She, like her character, is someone who has worked her looks and her intelligence to get exactly what she wants out of life, and she is not afraid to show it.  So, if you go in not expecting too much, you will come out pleasantly surprised.  A 7 out of 10.
