One point most movie critics and I agree on with this movie, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is unlike any other Steven Spielberg because he has not directed a film this awful in a very long time.I was shocked to see such a wonderful concept and premise wasted with a story I saw just a few years ago with the release of Bicentennial Man. Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards and William Hurt give their best effort in their respective roles; however, nobody could save the movie from the disastrous script the cast was given by the writers.I have always maintained that bigger is not always better. In the movie that Spielberg inherited following the death of Stanley Kubrick, this statement seems to be true. There has been a tremendous amount of hype surrounding A.I. Artificial Intelligence because it was supposed to be directed by Kubrick. A.I. Artificial Intelligence have taught me two very important lessons never believe the hype of a film and always go with your instincts when deciding whether the movie was good or bad.Spielberg has a knack for turning movies into magic when directing films, so it came as a shock to me when I realized A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a film without emotion, structure and intelligence. It took me 20 minutes to tell myself this was a disappointment because all of the excitement and joy drained the life out of the movie leaving Spielberg to rely on the special effects to save the rest of A.I. Artificial Intelligence.Osment follows his breakthrough role in The Sixth Sense as David, an eleven-year old android who takes an emotional journey to see if the love he gives his family is returned. Under the direction of Professor Hobby, played by Hurt, David is part of an experiment to create android children for families to love. Robards and O'Connor play parents who take David. Osment will become a huge superstar in Hollywood, but with his role as David, he won't accomplish this achievement.Hurt, Robards and O'Connor were among the only bright spots in A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Their roles were the light I was looking for in the dark world of this movie. These three actors were responsible for bringing integrity, honesty and genuine emotion. It is refreshing to see actors bring characteristics like this to a role because it truly shows the range of talent they possess; however, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was the wrong decision for them to make as well intentioned the movie planned to be.The biggest problem I had with A.I. Artificial Intelligence was the urgency to care about David or any of the other characters in the film. For example, Gigolo Joe, played by Law, had no reason to be placed in a film like this because he didn't fit in with the storyline.Furthermore, there was no pizzazz or flash that stood out and made a statement that this is the film to see. One thing I have noticed with awful films was the endings were always better than the previous 120 minutes.A.I. Artificial Intelligence never seemed to get on track with one major theme. For example, it jumped from storyline to storyline without clear and complete explanation. I reached my tolerance limit early on in the movie, so when the movie was over; I was relieved and couldn't wait to get home.Despite my hatred for A.I. Artificial Intelligence, I must give Spielberg credit for bringing some enjoyment to the film. For example, Hurt's role as Professor Hobby stood out because he was the only actor that seemed to be genuine to the role, roles as mother and father put Robards and O'Connor on my favorites list, promising premise surrounding the film as well as the start and finish of the film were the only aspects of the movie that stood out from the rest of the movie.A.I. Artificial Intelligence contains heart and spirit and I can understand how people may enjoy this movie; however, Spielberg failed to capitalize on the golden opportunity handed to him by Kubrick.A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a shallow and empty movie, which was made several years ago with Robin Williams. With their heart and spirit misplaced, my only advice regarding is to watch A.I.

Monkeybone is the perfect example for movie studios to re-examine standards for stamping their approval on films with no story, character development and extremely bad writing.Monkeybone revolves around the life of Stu Miley, a cartoonist who has created a comic strip featuring Monkeybone, who has become a nusence for Stu. With a beautiful girlfriend at his side and a successful comic strip becoming a national television show, fate steps in to take it away from him. Monkeybone escapes from the underworld where death holds court.With places like 'The Coma Bar,' I was laughing because it was ironic because I almost fell into a coma watching this movie. After Stu finds out Monkeybone escapes and takes over his body on earth, he pleads his case to Death herself, Goldberg, to take Monkeybone back to the underworld.Monkeybone lost all its credibility and right to be called a comedy because there are nothing but scenes slapped together to fill time. I lost respect for this film when it became clear the cast and crew were relying on stupid comedy for its success. The best example of this occurred with the appearance of comedian Chris Kattan as a recently dead gymnast whose body is taken over by Stu.My thoughts were how could the director cast someone like this; but then I remembered it was a stupid movie to begin with.I have always enjoyed watching Fraser because he has built a body of work. Fraser is a tremendous asset to Hollywood, but nobody would know it from his role in Monkeybone. With outstanding roles in Gods and Monsters, Blast From The Past and The Mummy, Fraser has proven he is one of the most gifted and talented young actors whose roles rival other actors such as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; furthermore, fans would not know it with his role in Monkeybone. I have always stated that every actor is entitled to have an off movie because there have been so many good actors in bad films and they have come back stronger than ever.Fonda is one of the most talented actresses I have had the pleasure to watch on screen because she adds so much to each film she takes part in. From beauty and charm to screen presence, Fonda has created a repertoire of talents to utilize in comedies or dramas; however, she fails to convince me that her performance was great.Monkeybone is an insult to fans, actors and directors alike because it is one of the worst movies ever made and should have been left on the cutting room floor. My advice to every movie fan is stay away from this movie and keep your money or spend it on a film worthwhile.

Surprise was followed by joy as I learned that the 2002 version of Mr. Deeds contained an outstanding performance from an actor known only for his comedy, a story that has as much heart as jokes and a cast that works so well together it was difficult to tell where real life ended and the acting began. Comedy is the main course and romance was served as dessert on a menu that allowed the audience to take two hours and enjoy the feast provided by Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro as they delivered non-stop comedy.With every great comedy there is a comedian who reigns victorious as he leads the charge to entertain audiences with comedic wit and charm; Mr. Deeds is no exception since Sandler accomplishes this task within the first 10 minutes. With the box-office success Sandler brought to films such as Big Daddy, The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, I knew that Mr. Deeds would bring greater success. The most impressive aspect of the film was the presence of Sandler as he gave the BEST performance of his career.Along with his jokes, Sandler brought a surprise; versatility. Known exclusively for his comedic talents, Sandler brought much more including the ability to become a romantic lead and perform the role with conviction. Furthermore, Sandler was able to portray a character that everyone can sit back in awe.Behind every great romantic lead there is an outstanding actress, which makes the romantic aspect of the film, so much better. It was a brilliant move for the casting directors to get Ryder to play opposite Sandler because she is one of the main reasons Mr. Deeds works. She has always amazed audiences with her beauty, charm and immense talent, so when I found out she was attached to this film my face lit up because she gives 110 percent effort in each role.Gallagher, Turturro, Buscemi and Covert increased the comedic support to a film already high on laughter with their respective roles.Watching these actors brought a smile to my face because they were well-cast and each brought their brand of humor to the film and played very well off Sandler. With the addition of Buscemi and Covert, Mr. Deeds came alive as they come together to create the magic they brought to prior works with Sandler such as Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer. Their familiarity with each other shows as they feed off each other very well.I will admit that Mr. Deeds contains a plot that has become cliché and makes me yearn for better creativity and originality. However, it was put together well and got me interested from the start.Overall, the script contains a sweet story that will leave everyone smiling and applauding because it does not attempt to do more than make you laugh.

Other than the cliché plot, Shanghai Noon brings a lot of excellent comedy, dialogue, action, thrills and even a little romance. I was expecting Owen Wilson to be similar to Chris Tucker, but in Shanghai Noon Wilson proved himself to be much better than other Jackie Chan sidekicks I've seen him teamed with. I was glad I rented this movie so I would be able to recommend it to everyone.

Washington, Heche, Duvall and Liotta create electricity with each scene they are in.John Q. surrounds a father who has been pushed over the edge as he attempts to save the life of his son, Mike, after it is found that his heart has a defect. Though he has insurance that covers the surgery to give his son a new heart, John Q. takes the hospital hostage until the hospital administrator puts Mike's name on the list for a heart transplant.It always puts a smile on my face to watch a movie that has the courage to tackle the truth. The writers deserve most of the credit for bringing to light one of the most important issues facing America; the health care system. Through creating intense moments and powerful scenes, the writers were able to successfully capture my attention and make me feel as if I were in the movie.

Intended as a joke, a riposte to the neat, happy endings we are usually offered, it completely blew me away (a similar, though less effective, ending occurs in Joe Dante's 'Inner Space'). In 1989 virtually the same scene opened Back To The Future Part II. I was worried. As an ending the sudden shift in tone, the zaniness, works. It is unexpected and yet welcomed. As an opening scene it is a disaster. We end up with a follow up to a joke ending. Suddenly Doc Brown is shouting all the time, racing around and looking maniacal. He behaves not how he did throughout the first film but how he did for the first film's ending. Jennifer goes from being a cool customer ('How 'bout a ride Mister?') to the most annoying and offensively realized female character in a film since Willie Scott ('I wonder where we live, I bet it's a big house with lots of kids...'). Why does she have to spend most of the film asleep? Surely she could have been involved in the adventures? Her role could have been similar to Marty's in the first film. Humour could have been derived from her unwillingness to treat it all as another day at the office as Marty and Doc are now able to. Instead, to the film's detriment, she is treated like a prop and written as an idiot ('You should be able to convince her that it was all a dream'). Marty, who had already completed his character arc, suddenly has anger issues and an unsettling desire to be rich. It all feels very forced because that's exactly what it is. Biff Tannen was ideal in the first film as a supporting character. Now the entire plot rests on his shoulders. Watching the moment in the opening scene where he comes out to see the Delorean taking flight and disappearing, the sudden transformation he goes through from subservient lackey to sinister bad guy, makes you realize just how desperate the whole endeavour is. Lorraine McFly has to be one of the least independent female characters ever committed to celluloid. Apparently her appearance and personality is controlled by which type of man she is with ('You were the one who wanted me to get these things...'). On her wedding day we see that she is extremely uncomfortable with Biff which begs the question as to why is she going through with it. Is she so weak that she needs a man in order to know how to live her life? George is a wimp so she's an alcoholic, then George is a successful writer so she's healthy and happy, then Biff is evil and rich so she's a mess. What does this say about the filmmaker's view of women? A lot of the problems came from the decision to not pay Crispin Glover what he was asking to reprise his role as George McFly. I would love to know how much he wanted since the film loses much through his absence. Bob Gale looks extremely pleased with himself in the making of the Back To The Future trilogy documentary when he talks about his power as a screenwriter and how he was able to simply kill George McFly's character off, as if he'd done it in such a creative and subtle way that we'd hardly noticed. It's funny then that the whole thing seems so contrived and obvious and that it was necessary to use footage from the first film of Glover (without asking his permission) to fill in the gaps. Expertly done Bob. So confident is he of his writing prowess he fails to notice the one glaring error in his masterpiece. Doc is more than happy to tell Marty about problems his offspring will have thirty years from now but unwilling to tell him about a car accident he'll have the following day that will ruin his entire life, apparently to teach him a lesson. What a pal. It is all of these inconsistencies and miscalculations that make the second film such a disappointment. There are countless other problems, such as the terrible editing, the obvious, set-bound, artificiality of Biff's penthouse and the road by the Lyon's Estate billboard, Michael J. Fox and Thomas Wilson, both fine actors but neither of them exactly Alec Guiness, being forced to pull off multiple roles (And Fox's portrayal of a female corresponds with the depiction of female characters in the film), and the fact that Marty McFly is apparently some kind of silent, invisible entity throughout the last third of the film that only the audience can see and hear, but these things could have been forgiven if more thought had gone into the characters and the story.In the DVD documentary Robert Zemeckis states that the sequels were going to be made whether he was involved or not. The fact that he decided to be involved shows that he didn't want someone else to make them. He needn't have worried. Back To The Future Part II feels like it was made by completely different people anyway. There is a smug laziness to the film, as if everyone knew the film was going to make money so why bother doing one's best. It is interesting to note the drop off in U.S. ticket sales between Back To The Future Parts II and III, once again proving that audiences aren't as dumb as the studios think.

In 1989 virtually the same scene opened Back To The Future Part II. I was worried. As an ending the sudden shift in tone, the zaniness, works. It is unexpected and yet welcomed. As an opening scene it is a disaster. We end up with a follow up to a joke ending. Suddenly Doc Brown is shouting all the time, racing around and looking maniacal. He behaves not how he did throughout the first film but how he did for the first film's ending. Jennifer goes from being a cool customer ('How 'bout a ride Mister?') to the most annoying and offensively realized female character in a film since Willie Scott ('I wonder where we live, I bet it's a big house with lots of kids...'). Why does she have to spend most of the film asleep? Surely she could have been involved in the adventures? Her role could have been similar to Marty's in the first film. Humour could have been derived from her unwillingness to treat it all as another day at the office as Marty and Doc are now able to. Instead, to the film's detriment, she is treated like a prop and written as an idiot ('You should be able to convince her that it was all a dream'). Marty, who had already completed his character arc, suddenly has anger issues and an unsettling desire to be rich. It all feels very forced because that's exactly what it is. Biff Tannen was ideal in the first film as a supporting character. Now the entire plot rests on his shoulders. Watching the moment in the opening scene where he comes out to see the Delorean taking flight and disappearing, the sudden transformation he goes through from subservient lackey to sinister bad guy, makes you realize just how desperate the whole endeavour is. Lorraine McFly has to be one of the least independent female characters ever committed to celluloid. Apparently her appearance and personality is controlled by which type of man she is with ('You were the one who wanted me to get these things...'). On her wedding day we see that she is extremely uncomfortable with Biff which begs the question as to why is she going through with it. Is she so weak that she needs a man in order to know how to live her life? George is a wimp so she's an alcoholic, then George is a successful writer so she's healthy and happy, then Biff is evil and rich so she's a mess.

Also, it seemed that Jeff Daniels' character Tim O'Hara was an older version of Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly as they both played second fiddle to Christopher Lloyd. I found this film to be lacking in some areas such as laughter. Since this film is based on a television show, I'm sure that the director wanted to make the film as if it were an original. I thought that everything in this film was predictable; from its landing and the doctor who is after Uncle Martin to the traditional happy ending.With this being said, it was entertaining and enjoyable for younger audiences, but not for people around my age. I guess since this is meant for children it is not supposed to be such a thinking movie, but come on I would have appreciated it more if it gave the older audience something more to chew on as we sat through the film.

The tables are turned when Fairbanks steals Caffrey's ring given to him by his girlfriend. The rest of the film circles around getting the ring back.  From this moment on, I knew I was going to be watching one funny film.Joining Lawrence and DeVito is John Leguizamo as Kevin's partner in crime, Burger, Carmen Ejogo as Kevin's girlfriend Amber and Bernie Mac as Kevin's uncle. The addition of these actors is evidence that What's The Worst That Can Happen? is a sure hit with all ages.Lawrence wears two hats in What's The Worst That Can Happen? as producer and star and he has success in both capacities. Furthermore, he was a true asset as an actor in What's The Worst That Can Happen? because he brought a unique brand of humor. His style is one to be proud of because he truly makes the comedy enjoyable and the humor so funny you'll be laughing so hard it will hurt. I appreciate his comedic ability and acting talent.DeVito adds credibility to one truly fun comedy. I couldn't have asked for a better actor to portray Max Fairbanks. There is not a lot to say about DeVito because his lengthy and steady body of work speaks for him. With so many great films under his belt, I knew I was going to be watching a true master at work. In addition to credibility, DeVito has presence and humor in that made me smile from ear to ear and start to finish. He is solid comedic genius that brings a great amount of comedy and presence that will leave everyone smiling.Leguizamo has a true niche for comedy as he proves in What's The Worst That Can Happen? I wasn't sure how to gage Leguizamo because I have only seen one other film with him, so I was surprised to learn he was one of funniest and talented actors in the movie. The chemistry between Lawrence and Leguizamo was perfect because they seemed to work so well together. Leguizamo was a great compliment to Lawrence and his brand of humor. I enjoyed every minute they shared the screen because I knew I was going to laugh.Ejogo was a true pleasure to watch because she brought excitement and charisma to the movie. I relished each scene she was in because I got the opportunity to see a true natural at work. Mac was a true surprise because I didn't expect him to turn in a good performance. Ejogo joins a handful of actresses that includes Monica Potter, Kate Beckinsale and James King, who are on my list of nominees for the prestigious honor of being called best newcomers of the year. The true geniuses behind What's The Worst That Can Happen? were the writers because they created something special. The writing in this movie is very enjoyable and good because it compliments Lawrence's comedy and DeVito's humor. The games set up by the writers were incredible fun to watch since each scene skillfully crafted.Also, the audience received a bonus when the writer added action and suspense. Though What's The Worst That Can Happen? succeeds mostly with comedy, it also entertains with action and suspense.I knew with scenes like Kevin's taunts to Max over his cell-phone while he was in a senate sub-committee, What's The Worst That Can Happen? will entertain every single person who buys a ticket for this movie. I could not ask for anything more from the writers of What's The Worst That Could Happen because watching this story play out is a thing of beauty.One solid guarantee I can make to potential viewers of this movie What's The Worst That Could Happen will leave you laughing until it hurts. Lawrence and DeVito are a lethal comedic team that fills the screen with laughter, suspense and action. What's The Worst That Can Happen? is one of the most entertaining films I've seen.

The addition of these actors is evidence that What's The Worst That Can Happen? is a sure hit with all ages.Lawrence wears two hats in What's The Worst That Can Happen? as producer and star and he has success in both capacities. Furthermore, he was a true asset as an actor in What's The Worst That Can Happen? because he brought a unique brand of humor. His style is one to be proud of because he truly makes the comedy enjoyable and the humor so funny you'll be laughing so hard it will hurt. I appreciate his comedic ability and acting talent.DeVito adds credibility to one truly fun comedy. I couldn't have asked for a better actor to portray Max Fairbanks. There is not a lot to say about DeVito because his lengthy and steady body of work speaks for him. With so many great films under his belt, I knew I was going to be watching a true master at work. In addition to credibility, DeVito has presence and humor in that made me smile from ear to ear and start to finish. He is solid comedic genius that brings a great amount of comedy and presence that will leave everyone smiling.Leguizamo has a true niche for comedy as he proves in What's The Worst That Can Happen? I wasn't sure how to gage Leguizamo because I have only seen one other film with him, so I was surprised to learn he was one of funniest and talented actors in the movie. The chemistry between Lawrence and Leguizamo was perfect because they seemed to work so well together. Leguizamo was a great compliment to Lawrence and his brand of humor. I enjoyed every minute they shared the screen because I knew I was going to laugh.Ejogo was a true pleasure to watch because she brought excitement and charisma to the movie. I relished each scene she was in because I got the opportunity to see a true natural at work. Mac was a true surprise because I didn't expect him to turn in a good performance. Ejogo joins a handful of actresses that includes Monica Potter, Kate Beckinsale and James King, who are on my list of nominees for the prestigious honor of being called best newcomers of the year. The true geniuses behind What's The Worst That Can Happen? were the writers because they created something special. The writing in this movie is very enjoyable and good because it compliments Lawrence's comedy and DeVito's humor. The games set up by the writers were incredible fun to watch since each scene skillfully crafted.Also, the audience received a bonus when the writer added action and suspense. Though What's The Worst That Can Happen? succeeds mostly with comedy, it also entertains with action and suspense.I knew with scenes like Kevin's taunts to Max over his cell-phone while he was in a senate sub-committee, What's The Worst That Can Happen? will entertain every single person who buys a ticket for this movie. I could not ask for anything more from the writers of What's The Worst That Could Happen because watching this story play out is a thing of beauty.One solid guarantee I can make to potential viewers of this movie What's The Worst That Could Happen will leave you laughing until it hurts. Lawrence and DeVito are a lethal comedic team that fills the screen with laughter, suspense and action. What's The Worst That Can Happen? is one of the most entertaining films I've seen. The bottom line is this film is harmless fun that will delight and entertain you for two hours. I hope everyone gets the chance to see how great these two talents come together and create one of the funniest movies this year.

This is one of the best spoof films to come to the screen because it pokes fun at all the teen horror films that has been made in recent years.However, I do see after watching the movie why critics were up in arms over the 'R' rating that it was given. There were a few scenes in the movie that could have been left on the cutting room floor because it had nothing to do with the plot of the movie.The best part of the whole movie was the acting performances of every cast member because they made everything so funny. I really enjoyed how they spoofed the other movies such as the Scream series, I Know..... and The Sixth Sense with so much ease. Keenan Ivory Wayans did a great job directing this movie. My only criticism of Scary Movie is the lackluster storyline throughout it. The story seemed to be one-dimensional with comedy as its only draw.

This was a learning experience I will not soon forget.I couldn't ask for better actors than Gabriel Byrne and Patricia Arquette to portray their respective roles as priest and stigmatic. I previously saw Byrne in End Of Days as Satan and I knew he was a very talented actor because he has presence. You know when Byrne is on the screen because he is just that good. Arquette's natural beauty and raw talent is what attracted me to her in Stigmata. Her performance should of won her an Oscar or emmy award because it was so unique. I don't think I would have liked it if another actress played Frankie Paige. The role just suited Arquette so well.This deserves the attention of anyone who likes movies because of the performances and plot depth. This is an all-around good movie.
