[{"date":"11 March 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.The story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.The day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital actor as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the duck and cover instructional in school every year of his short life.If joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. Voiced by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.Along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.Technically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).9 stars out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 March 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece.

Then disaster strikes in the form of an earthquake causes her to miscarry and her injuries are such that she will never be able to have a child. They are sad but stick together through it, and they eventually put their lives back together again. They decide they still want a child so they adopt. When they get to the adoption agency, a kind adoption lady presents them with a baby girl and they fall in love with the child and decide to adopt her. You see the adoption process and how happy they are. It is cute to see them learn how to take care of a baby. Their financial situation changes when the child is about 2, and before the adoption is final, the adoption head honchos threaten to take her away, because now they are poor. A stirring speech by Grant (and the faith of the kind adoption lady) convinces said honchos that Grant and Dunne are still good parents and that their child will never starve. They are allowed to keep the child, who we next see as sweet a little girl as anyone could wish for. Now as I said, up to this point, everything has been fine, some downs, but they've worked out their problems and are a happy, functioning family unit. As a whole the movie up to this point has been as cute and sweet as their little girl.Then BAM, the next minute the kid is dead (no warning to the audience that the kid is sick, just BAM dead of something or other). They are too grief stricken to help each other, and instead tear themselves and each other a part. It's only been THREE DAYS since the little darling's death, and they are splitting up because they just can't handle the grief (this explains why Dunne is packing to leave Grant throughout the current time scenes in the film). Dunne wrote to the kind adoption lady telling her their tragedy as soon as the girl died, and before Dunne has a chance to leave Grant for good, the adoption lady informs the couple (who have yet to make up and are just as miserable as ever - remember it has only been three days since their little girl died) that the agency just got in a sweet little boy (two years old, golden curls, the sort of kid they thought they wanted to adopt before they saw their baby girl), and would they be interested in seeing him? Now suddenly, everything is a-okay, and they have plans to turn their daughter's room in to the perfect room for a little boy. Nothing, has been resolved in their marriage. Before they found out about the boy they were in the middle of deeply grieving for their daughter, in fact they were so grief stricken I thought for sure they were going to turn the little girl's room in to a shrine or something. Then they hear about this little boy, and it's like their little girl never existed. In short, the ending is unnecessarily tragic in the little girls death alone, more so when her death splits Dunne and Grant apart, and ruined both by the fact that the couples problems are not fixed at the end of the movie, just papered over, and the treatment of a loss of a child as something a kin to the loss of a goldfish. Oh you lost your child? that's sad, but not a real problem. Just never you mind that and buck-up mom and dad, here's another. It is as though the movie is almost a warning to parents, enjoy them now because the little ones you love maybe taken from you at any moment, except, just kidding, that does not really matter because you can always have another and poof your grief will be gone. Basically, if you stop the movie at the Christmas when the girl is six, it is not bad, it's a cute film, though not worth its rave reviews. The last twenty minutes or so ruin it, turning a tolerable film in to something that I just can't take.

In fact, I was sure I'd hate it. OK-here goes-BOY WAS I WRONG! This movie is really really different, obviously very well made and now that I've seen it I can understand why it's ranked so high on the IMDb top movies of all time.Not to say I thought it was perfect. I did, as expected, have a problem with all the violence but that I expected and doesn't take away from the well written intelligent script, much in the same way as the Kill Bill movies which I felt the same way about. In fact, Fight Club reminded me of Kill Bill, not because the stories had any similarity whatsoever but because of the fact that their both violent, both (for lack of a better term) completely out there!, yet both very gritty and extremely intelligent. So yeah I liked Fight Club. I've read dozens of reviews on here and many mention plot and how it's one of the best movies ever made etc-so I wont even go there. What I will say is that Norton and Pitt are wonderfully matched on screen and I cannot imagine these two roles being played by anyone else. Were there ANY Oscar nominations for this movie? I don't seem to remember any which is a shame. Pitt's best role to date and maybe Norton's as well. I will say I can see where this maybe liked more by men then women. Most females I know have not and do not want to see this while most of the guys I know have seen it or plan to at some point. This movie should have been promoted in a different way because to many people think it's about nothing more then boxing and men beating each other up and that turns a lot of people off. AnywayI admired Fight Club, I thought it was bizarre and frightening in a way and can see similarities to many movies from Clockwork Orange to Lord of the Flies. My one complaint is something that I haven't seen brought up a lot.SPOILER ALERT I had a bit of a problem with the ending. I mean, as odd as this movie was, it wasn't over the top to the point where you roll your eyes or anything. But at the end when Norton shoots Tyler and it seems he has gotten rid of him and everything is gonna be OK... I was a bit baffled because if there was anything this movie wasn't, till that point, it was feel good, and that was my thought about the ending. I mean Norton's character had multiple personality disorder and all of a sudden he was over it like that? When Tyler had been such a big part of him for so long. Now it is possible I misinterpreted the ending(I've been on the message boards and everyone seems to have a different theory about what the ending really meant.) But that really did bother me since that is a pretty serious thing and it seemed a little unrealistic the way it was done but hey this is a movie.Anyway, I still don't know if I'd rank this in the top 35 movies of all time but I have no problem understanding how this could be someone's favorite movie, it was very well done and is probably the type of movie any film school student should study(though I could also see how this wouldn't be for everyone). I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10. And I'll say it again, Pitt and Norton-both should have been nominated, great performances.

AnywayI admired Fight Club, I thought it was bizarre and frightening in a way and can see similarities to many movies from Clockwork Orange to Lord of the Flies. My one complaint is something that I haven't seen brought up a lot.SPOILER ALERT I had a bit of a problem with the ending. I mean, as odd as this movie was, it wasn't over the top to the point where you roll your eyes or anything. But at the end when Norton shoots Tyler and it seems he has gotten rid of him and everything is gonna be OK... I was a bit baffled because if there was anything this movie wasn't, till that point, it was feel good, and that was my thought about the ending. I mean Norton's character had multiple personality disorder and all of a sudden he was over it like that? When Tyler had been such a big part of him for so long. Now it is possible I misinterpreted the ending(I've been on the message boards and everyone seems to have a different theory about what the ending really meant.) But that really did bother me since that is a pretty serious thing and it seemed a little unrealistic the way it was done but hey this is a movie.Anyway, I still don't know if I'd rank this in the top 35 movies of all time but I have no problem understanding how this could be someone's favorite movie, it was very well done and is probably the type of movie any film school student should study(though I could also see how this wouldn't be for everyone). I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10. And I'll say it again, Pitt and Norton-both should have been nominated, great performances.

Angie Dickinson, in short played the misunderstood hottie, personally I didn't think she added much but it let the viewers see the star (Wayne) had it really going on.

You have the classic great in Wayne, Martin and Brennan. You toss in an attractive female.

Firstly, it's easy to detect the Streisand haters among these critics....your hatred is truly sophomoric, and doesn't serve in your recounting an objective critique of the film.As for this film itself, I think that Nick Nolte was absolutely the best element in it, as well as Kate Nelligan. I had never been a Nick Nolte fan, and was very surprised by his layered characterization. He did more with just a certain look, no words, than most actors can hope to accomplish reciting non-stop for two hours straight. In the simple shot of his looking at his daughter blow out her birthday candles and smiling when she's done, right after we are treated with a flashback of his horrid past, was enough to make me break. You could see him hiding some long-held, buried pain behind his genuine smile and love for his daughter. It was, for me, a very subtle, yet powerfully moving moment.I think Streisand did a fine job directing this film, and was definitely robbed of a best director nomination. Several of the academy members who presented Oscars that evening, including Billy Crystal, Liza Minnelli, Shirley MacLaine, and Jessica Tandy (who REALLY made a point in a beautifully sarcastic delivery to mention how ridiculous it was that the film was nominated, but not the director. This almost NEVER happens, and it certainly happened that evening because there are so many academy members who despise Streisand.) Minnelli and MacLaine made a point of saying, before they read nominations for the particular award they were giving, that they would love to be directed by Streisand some day....more digs at the Academy. ANYWAY, beyond the snub, I thought the film overall was very poignant.Where it falls short, however, are in the following areas. First, Streisand and\/or the screenwriter (LaGraveness) shouldn't have focused really any time developing a love story between Streisand and Nolte. This was completely unnecessary. For this reason alone, I might not have even voted the film as one of the best of the year....I don't remember what else came out that year. My contention is that, if you're going to honor a film with the Oscar, you should also honor the director, since this film had Streisand's vision all over it. In fact, LaGraveness I believe was also a bit disgruntled with the many rewrites that Streisand made of his screenplay. More time should have been devoted to the horrific background story of Nolte's family, and of his sister. I understand that her character was actually schizophrenic for many years, probably triggered by her rape at 13, but that was not portrayed at all in the movie. Also, I thought Jason Gould did a fine job in his little part. However, I think it was disingenuous to even include that whole storyline in the movie. He was introduced in a slice of voice-over offered by Streisand's character when she talks to Nolte during a transitional scene when she invites Nick Nolte inside her apartment after he walks her home from Eddie's (George Carlin) party. She asks why don't you come inside. I'd like you to meet my son. I know the plausibility we're supposed to accept is that, her son is a bit difficult and he's in football, and Nolte's character is a football coach who might be able to coach him privately....but I just didn't buy this whole plot line. It was an opportunity for Streisand to give her son a part in her film...that's it. He did all right in the part....I just didn't think this element was necessary. More showcasing for Streisand.What else....the love story. I know that Tom Wingo (Nolte) is not her patient, so, romance between a doctor and his\/her patient isn't an issue. And, it is plausible that she is pained as well, since her husband is having an affair, we later learn, with another woman. However, it would have been far more realistic and plausible if no romance came up, and no opening up on Streisand's part occurred at all. Or perhaps we might have been offered only a glimpse of her also troubled life, even though it's shielded behind the veneer of her being a successful psychiatrist. But to have her character let loose in a full-blown romance with Nolte's character was a plot line that took so much time away from what I really wanted to see, which was more of the background of the Wingo family, and particularly more of the sister herself....the raison d'etre of the film itself.Part I Ends.

I'm not a huge fan of De Palma movies save Scarface simply because of its almost cartoonish, spoof style, but this particular film is serious through and through. There are very few De Palma'isms, camera trickery, logical jumps in psychological development, etc. The film is restrained, well-structured and the way it sets up its primary conflict is much like the gait of creeping blackness across the sky before rain. In a word, the story is very believable, as it should be, since it is true.It details the story of a platoon which, under surprise attack, loses one of its members. Casualties of War treats this as a set-up to its much darker intentions - namely the revenge that is exacted and the psychological dynamics that lead to it being carried out.And, as much as I like Sean Penn as an actor, it was Michael J.

That can be fatal - I am of those who found Charlie Sheen's performance in Platoon somewhat jarring with the otherwise excellent cast. Michael J.

He shows range and sensitivity to the subject matter presented - and I think he does an admirable job.The subject matter is tough. This film, like other great Vietnam War films, tackles a whole spectrum of themes, ideas, psychologies and questions. Casualties of War asks us about the existence of moral boundaries in entirely amoral (NOT immoral) situations, the dynamics of group mentality versus individual mentality, the complexity of politics and the bureaucratic structure that supports it, the threat of complete dehumanization and madness. It summarizes many of the lessons that should have been drawn from our involvement in the Vietnam War in scenes so quick and effective that one could get goosebumps. And it usually doesn't offer easy answers. The revenge committed by the soldiers in and of itself is horrid, but we can at the same time understand how hard it is for Michael J. Fox's character to isolate himself from the context of the war to make that judgement. Especially after losing one of his fellow soldiers in a shoot-out, in a village where all the seemingly friendly villagers were aware of VC presence and impending attack. Suddenly, it becomes clear how the a lot of soldiers viewed the Vietnamese - as one entity because it was so difficult to distinguish between allies and foes.The film insists that despite the circumstances it *is* important to do so, to make moral judgement calls despite the insanity of the context. That is what I really liked about it. I did, however, find a few problems with the film - minor really, but problems nonetheless. I do think that De Palma characterizes the platoon minus Michael J. Fox as a bunch of animals, instead of people who became animals because, as Joseph Conrad suggested, they were seduced by the heart of an immense darkness. Essentially it boils down to a problem with psychological transitions, but De Palma does his best and while it sometimes doesn't work, most of the time it does splendidly.*Possible Spoiler* I also think that the end of the film is a minor cheat - the resolution simply does not work for me as well as I'd like it to. There are so many people who were crippled by the horrors of the Vietnam War and so many who struggled to keep on top of them - the final scene is almost too little to end or resolve what comes before it.

Suddenly, it becomes clear how the a lot of soldiers viewed the Vietnamese - as one entity because it was so difficult to distinguish between allies and foes.The film insists that despite the circumstances it *is* important to do so, to make moral judgement calls despite the insanity of the context. That is what I really liked about it. I did, however, find a few problems with the film - minor really, but problems nonetheless. I do think that De Palma characterizes the platoon minus Michael J. Fox as a bunch of animals, instead of people who became animals because, as Joseph Conrad suggested, they were seduced by the heart of an immense darkness. Essentially it boils down to a problem with psychological transitions, but De Palma does his best and while it sometimes doesn't work, most of the time it does splendidly.*Possible Spoiler* I also think that the end of the film is a minor cheat - the resolution simply does not work for me as well as I'd like it to. There are so many people who were crippled by the horrors of the Vietnam War and so many who struggled to keep on top of them - the final scene is almost too little to end or resolve what comes before it. It feels like it didn't happen - but if it did, then I'm wrong and I'm prepared to live with that. The movie, while I don't think it's of Apocalypse Now caliber, is a very good movie nonetheless.

Out of everyone in Hollywood today, there must be few who are living the dream as much as Quentin Tarantino. With a life drenched in cinema, Tarantino is the king of cool cinema. Creating films which are full of pop culture references, always featuring an awe inspiring soundtrack and with magnificent characters, Tarantino has seemingly not put a foot wrong since 1992's perfect Reservoir Dogs. With both Dogs and the more successful Pulp Fiction (1994) under his belt, 1997's Jackie Brown was another rung on the Tarantino ladder as he created a film containing humour, some memorable lines and an amazing career reemergence by Pam Grier.Jackie Brown (Grier) is a flight attendant for one of the down-market airlines. Secretly running money into the country for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson), things suddenly seem to go wrong for her when she is arrested by Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) of the police. Now with the help of bail organiser Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie Brown is out for herself.It's an acceptable fact in modern cinema that if Quentin Tarantino is involved with a film, it's going to be stylish. Whether he's written the film, directed it, or simply put his name to it, the film is going to be stylish. Jackie Brown is without a doubt, no exception.From Pam Grier's first appearance, through to her final scene, the film flows with a soundtrack to orgasm over. With a distinctive soul feel, it's hard not to be dragged into the adventures of Jackie Brown.The casting also adds to the persona of the film. Samuel L Jackson as gun merchant Ordell is perhaps not as good as in Pulp Fiction but he's not far off. Robert De Niro as well, looking remarkably old and worn is brilliant as the stoned bank robber friend of Ordell who is just out of jail. Then, add to the list Keaton, Forster, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker and the amazing Grier, and you are looking at an outstanding lineup.Tarantino also has an amazing knack for unique camera angles and sound techniques. In Reservoir Dogs he had Michael Madsen's Mr Blonde walk between two locations whilst music was only audible in one of the two. Copying the technique in Jackie Brown one scene is amazing where the story rotates between cars, all playing different songs. The way it is done is nothing short than genius. Then with camera angles he again replicates an idea from Dogs by having a camera filming from an open car trunk. Looking up at characters from the tight angle, the scene always looks strangely intriguing, almost like your secretly observing on a private conversation. Tarantino introduces us to his views on picture and sound quality, and you begin to realise just how clever the man truly is.Everyone knows what they like to see in cinema. Whether it's a comedy starring a rubber faced comedian, or a serious drama starring an old English thespian, choice is all around. Personally though, whatever the mood, the one thing you can always rely on is that few films will be as stylish as a Quentin Tarantino feature. Jackie Brown might not be quite as amazing as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction but it is still one of the best films you will ever see.

Many, for I'd assume it'd be hard-pressed for anyone not to at one point in their life gone through a period of dejection, rejection, and evolve until finally the inner self comes out shining.And what a character evolution this is. Charlotte Vale, played expertly and with fantastic repression hiding an enormous passion and will to live by the great Bette Davis as a woman who's life has been all but destroyed by her domineering, selfish mother (Gladys Cooper) until she meets kind Dr. Jasquith, a psychiatrist (Claude Rains) who makes her take the first steps to recovery. A physical transformation ensues from dowdy to chic, and on a cruise -- temporarily posing as Ms. Beauchamp -- she meets Jerry Durrance (elegant, smoldering Paul Henreid with sad eyes that virtually talk) with whom she begins a tentative acquaintance with that turns to love. Once home and deciding on an independent life away from her mother she takes on a younger version of herself, Tina, played poignantly by Janis Wilson, whom Charlotte learns is none other than Jerry's daughter. Nevertheless, Charlotte tutors Tina back to mental health, and even while she rejects the marriage of a certain convenience to Elliot Livingston (John Loder) since she cannot forget Jerry, she decides to remain independent despite of the hinted possibility of not fulfilling her affair with him at the end. The last scene, with Henreid and Davis gazing into each other's eyes as he lights up a cigarette for the both of them, and Davis' last line, Don't let's ask for the moon -- we have the stars, is cinematic romance at its finest.Irving Rapper, one of Hollywood's gay directors, could not have made a gayer film than this and my view is not controversial Hollywood did not allow overt films about homosexuality back then, unless the man was a fop and a much secondary character meant to be the butt of fag jokes. Writers and directors alike decided to somehow incorporate a gay element without making it clear off the bat and devised stories that were strongly symbolic in nature. And while Olivia Higgins Prouty's novel was not intended to be interpreted as such, her quoting of Walt Whitman's Now voyager, sail forth to seek and find is interesting when Whitman himself was homosexual. Plus, the added element of Charlotte Vale's damaged persona by her mother who forced her into total repression -- something very close to many gay men and women -- and her ultimate transformation into a complete person due to her inner strength has also been a recurring gay theme.But despite this view, the fact remains that NOW VOYAGER is a consummate woman's picture, a superior weepie that hasn't aged due to its themes of mental cruelty within family members and one person's quiet courage to take on the world and resume her own sense of identity despite years of baggage. Another version of parental abuse would re-surface as the Mexican drama LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE but aside from the mother-daughter relationship, the stories are completely different even in tone and cultural values.Bette Davis received another Oscar nod for her role here as did Gladys Cooper, but the entire cast lends good support, from Ilka Chase and Bonita Granville as Charlotte's cousins down to Mary Wickes in a small yet funny role as a nurse tending to a bed-ridden Cooper and being a small agent in allowing Davis' Vale to go on with her life.

I'm not sure what I'm about to write yet but it may be worth taking it with a pinch of salt, since I'm unable to get over just how much I love this movie.Even if it doesn't resonate with you, All About Lily... is still clearly a film of a high artistic standard. Iwai has succeeded in creating a beautiful atmosphere but one of extreme coldness and sterility. The poster shot of the bright green rice fields, which practically leap off the screen at you, are stunning to look at but evoke such loneliness. It's no wonder Debussy was used on the soundtrack; few other composers can create such beautiful music that sounds so distant, like you can't touch it. The shots of one of the characters playing his pieces on the piano are made to look almost ethereal. Such music and images, coupled with the use of a digital camera which does bizarre things with light (sometimes the camera will be in a room and it looks like the sun is right outside the window), give the film a hypnotic, surreal quality. This is also added to by the fractured narrative which at times seems to be trying to deliberately make you believe the wrong thing.The acting is unbelievably naturalistic and at times very brave, especially by 13yr old actor Hayato Ichihara (Yuichi) who's deadpan expressiveness reminds me of Montgomery Clift. Oshinari's (Hoshino) is probably the stand-out performance though. He has more to work with, but even so, it's incredible. So intense and human.The naturalism coupled with Iwai's interest in seemingly trivial, everyday moments means the film conveys an incredible amount of information even when very little appears to be happening on screen. The clue to a character's motivation can be picked up just by watching what they're doing in the background. Rarely do you see a movie treat the audience so intelligently. Nothing is signposted. Nothing is explained. It's just SHOWN to you and your mind is forced to make sense of it.Finally, I have never seen a movie treat my generation so sensitively and truthfully.

Similar to Hou Jianqi's _Postmen in the Mountain_ and a number of the films mentioned above, _Not One Less_ depicts the natural beauty of rural China next to the abject poverty in which quite a number of farmer families live. The film begins simply enough with the mayor tugging along the pretty, slim Wei Minzhi who has been hired by the village to teach in the place of an older teacher who must leave town in order to look after his sick mother. Minzhi does not bring much to the table, however, because she is only able to sing one song in praise of Mao and her teaching ability seems to be limited to copying information on the board and then ordering her students to copy what she has written. Also, did I mention the fact that Minzhi is thirteen years old? Minzhi was hired because she was the only one willing to work in the little bumpkin village. Of course because of her age she is not only taken advantage of by her students, but the mayor as well who tries to swindle his way out of paying the young woman fifty yuan, around maybe twenty dollars for a month's work. However, when Minzhi is offered an extra ten yuan by the old teacher if she is able to keep all of her students during the month, Minzhi becomes determined to keep all of her students in place. However, one soon joins a school specializing in sports and another leaves for the city to support his sick mother.Like Yang Zhang's film _Quitting_, all of the actors, all non-professional, play themselves. Filming is still highly censored in China, so Zhang Yimou had to veneer the true messages of the film.

With that in mind, 1987's The Untouchables is one of the greatest gangster movies - period. Brian De Palma, coming down off of the landmark gangster classic Scarface (1983), continued the trend with this carefully woven tale (screenplay complements of David Mamet) about Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, perfectly cast) and his band of incorruptible federal agents. Ness is as naive as they come - bright-eyed and ready to take gangsterism down the old way - but being that this is Prohibition-era Chicago, the police are on the take, and no one can be trusted for fear of retribution from Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Ness finds his most trusted and loyal partner in a beat officer, Jimmy Malone (Oscar-Winner Sean Connery), who so carefully spells the law out out for him, He Capone sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue! The Untouchables certainly do seem to overstep their boundaries in bringing Capone down, using a number of well-planned and law-bending tactics. The cinematography is beautiful, helping to capture the gangster-era in all its glory, and the Ennio Morricone score really gets you pumping for the action. De Palma is at his greatest in directorial excellence in staging stellar, heart-pumping action sequences (with the Morricone score blasting away too), which come to include the Canadian liquor bust, the train-station shootout, and the ending rooftop chase between Ness and Capone's #1 hit-man Frank Nitti (Billy Drago). Beware though, since this is De Palma territory here, we should be on the lookout for some scenes of pretty stylized bloody violence and the blood + guts action that characterized the times.

The musical numbers are outstanding (especially Garrett's and Sinatra's frantic duet My Place which, if this weren't a musical-comedy, would send men running to the hills at the sight of an aggressive man-hungry cab driver) and all women dance admirably, but the only one who one remembers is Miller in the museum sequence, twirling like a Tasmanian devil and looking fabulous while doing so. Not a great actress, she could move like not many dancers-turned-actresses could, and it's a pity she decided to basically retire from movies so early and only came back for her small role in MULLHOLLAND DR.
