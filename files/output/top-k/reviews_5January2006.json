[{"date":"5 January 2006","score":"","review":" Shrek is the best movie to watch. You can't miss the must-see movie. Dream Works has done a great job in animation of green ogre, swamp and every other thing!!! Shrek voiced by Mike Myers and Donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy go to rescue princess from the highest tower surrounded by the evil dragon. Shrek is doing so because he wants his swamp back which is now been filled with fairy tale creatures. Watch King Farqua as the villain who sends the Shrek and Donkey on their mission. The real fun in this movie is the irony made by ogre and donkey who have exceptionally comic minds. I think Shrek is far better than than the Shrek 2 even it has hit the all time box office.
