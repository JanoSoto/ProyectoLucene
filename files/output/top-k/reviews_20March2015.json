Don't get me wrong, the movie has its flaws, I'll get to those later, but it also has a couple of pretty amazing acting performances, and quite a few others that are very good. These would not be Kevin Costner's however. Kevin Costner plays 1990's Kevin Costner, which was probably part of this film's undoing with the critics in the first place they were getting sick of him, and assumed the movie going public was too. An outstanding acting performance is turned in by Will Patton as the antagonist General Bethlehem, a sadistic warlord who rules his troops with an iron fist while regaling himself in the pretenses of having culture due to his love of literature and music. Another pretty amazing performance is Giovani Ribisi as one of Bethlehem's minions who is mentally challenged and unstable and makes every effort to ingratiate himself to his superiors, who seem all to willing to ignore him until they can take advantage of his eagerness. There are also very good performances by Laranz Tate, as Ford Lincoln Mercury, the would be protégé of Costner's title character, Olivia Williams as Costner's love interest, and Daniel Von Bargen, as the sheriff of the small town caught in the middle of the struggle between Costner's Postman and Patton's Bethlehem. It's a shame that the critics tend to like to focus on the negative, and in doing so all but dismiss the incredible acting done by these actors, among many others in the film. The film does get a little heavy handed near the end, and the final scene unveiling the statue of Costner as The Postman probably sealed the film's fate with the critics. It can be a little slow in parts, but that normally doesn't last too long, and there are a couple of different parables about modern life and human nature intertwining that are interesting and add to the enjoyment of the movie beyond the excellent acting of the supporting cast.This film could be a study in how American critics in general, and movie critics in particular fail to do their jobs in directing audiences to movies that are worth their time and money. Compare this movie to say, Mel Gibson's The Patriot, and it is superior in every way, yet due to it's initially poor critical response, still is rated far lower, and yet is a far better movie by almost any standard.If you enjoy great acting, complex parables and are willing to endure a few slow spots and a bit of over-the-top sentimentality and ego stroking in the last 10 minutes, this would be a rewarding film for you to watch, regardless of what the critics or a few of your clueless friends might tell you. Also, if you're a Tom Petty fan, you will get to see one of his very few live action acting performances, and while not great, is not bad either.

It starts at the more surreal, dark atmosphere which sometimes materialized in the show, especially in the last episode, and plunges headlong down a rabbit hole of sex, murder, mysteries, federal agents, parallel universes, psychological torment, otherworldly spirits, supernatural phenomena, incest, more cups of coffee (Im not even kidding, there's a scene where a stressed out looking Harry Dean Stanton makes a 'cup of good morning America'), and above all, Laura Palmer. The beautiful, mysterious homecoming queen we only saw as a corpse in the series comes to wild, screaming life in this film, and what a performance from the gifted Sheryl Lee. She perfectly captures the menace, hurt, confusion, hope, torment and wild desperation of Laura, in a towering, stunning performance. Ray Wise is equally magnificent as Leland Palmer. Angelo Badalamenti switches up the tone as well, letting the beautiful Laura theme and the classic Twin Peaks tones only play in limited, selective fashion. His theme for the film is a powerfully dark, otherworldly melody which lulls you right into the film's deep velvet grasp and haunts you in ways you can't describe. The angel of the Roadhouse, Julee Cruise, gets another tune to croon as well, and it might just be my favourite of the bunch. Laura tearfully looks on as Cruise intones 'Questions In A World Of Blue', a transfixing lament that seems to be meant for her alone. Lynch is a true master of the subtle touch, and you'd have to read many an online forum as well as watch the film and the show several times to pick up on all the hidden implications and shrouded ideas that aren't readily presented to you in a traditional narrative. That inaccessibility and refusal to play by the rules by serving things straight up is difficult for many people to get their heads around. To me though it's such a fascinating way to tell a story. He doesn't necessarily leave everything open to interpretation, he just hides the answers in a bewitching blanket of surreality, subtlety and dream logic, challenging the viewer to think using the unconscious mind and intuition to feel your way through the story, as opposed to tallying up facts and plot turns to analytically arrive at your cinematic destination. Perhaps this is why he meticulously oversees many of the DVD releases for his films, leaving out scene selections and unnecessary bells and whistles. The story matters most to him, in singular, unbroken form, a segment of his soul encapsulated on film in one cohesive effort, like a dream caught unawares by the lens. Fire Walk With Me was unfairly bashed, booed and downright critically clobbered for its stark and outright changes from the shows lighter tones, as well as its leaving out of some of the more popular characters that fans loved. Although this is jarring, I feel like Lynch has distilled all the elements in the show that mattered the most to him, and woven a gorgeous, seductive tapestry of pure Twin Peaks 'feel' and spectacle, as a loving gift to the fans who truly get it and are open to the wilder ideas explored briefly in the show. The film expands greatly on the ominous Black Lodge, and it's dwelling spirits, including the strange Tremonds, the one armed Mike, and the little red suited Man From Another Place. The killer demon Bob is very prevalent in this film, and if you thought he was scary in the show, well.. His scenes in this are downright soul shatteringly. Moira Kelly makes a softer, doe eyed version of Donna Hayward, which I quite liked. Miguel Ferrer returns as the cynical wise-ass Albert, Lynch as the hard of hearing FBI boss Gordon Cole, as well as Heather Graham, Grace Zabriskie, Eric DaRe, Madchen Amick, Peggy Lipton, etc. Newcomers to the Twin Peaks mythology are great as well, including Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland as more FBI agents investigating the case of Teresa Banks in Deer Meadow, Jurgen Prochnow as a trapped soul in the spirit world, and a confused looking David Bowie as an agent who has been mired in the time bending fog of the spirit world long enough to render him brain fried. It's a love letter to the fans, really, but one that doesn't compromise an inch and is every ounce a Lynch picture, capturing the director at his most creative adventurous. He strives to plumb the depths of human behaviour and the forces beyond our perceptions which govern and influence from other planes. Seeing these tricky themes explored so rawly in a film based upon a TV show that had heavy roots soap opera and an often lighthearted tone only garnished with the disturbing elements in the film can be hard to swallow, which is no doubt the reason for the sour reception upon release. The film has stood the test of time and aged wonderfully though, seen by many grateful, loving fans as a dark dream straight from the heart, and a perfect film. If one is willing to accept the changes in tone and ambiguous, challenging nature of Lynch's storytelling (which I love!) then Fire Walk With Me is a sumptuous, gorgeous looking, vital piece of the Twin Peaks world, and in my mind Lynch's masterpiece.

Although this is jarring, I feel like Lynch has distilled all the elements in the show that mattered the most to him, and woven a gorgeous, seductive tapestry of pure Twin Peaks 'feel' and spectacle, as a loving gift to the fans who truly get it and are open to the wilder ideas explored briefly in the show. The film expands greatly on the ominous Black Lodge, and it's dwelling spirits, including the strange Tremonds, the one armed Mike, and the little red suited Man From Another Place. The killer demon Bob is very prevalent in this film, and if you thought he was scary in the show, well.. His scenes in this are downright soul shatteringly. Moira Kelly makes a softer, doe eyed version of Donna Hayward, which I quite liked. Miguel Ferrer returns as the cynical wise-ass Albert, Lynch as the hard of hearing FBI boss Gordon Cole, as well as Heather Graham, Grace Zabriskie, Eric DaRe, Madchen Amick, Peggy Lipton, etc. Newcomers to the Twin Peaks mythology are great as well, including Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland as more FBI agents investigating the case of Teresa Banks in Deer Meadow, Jurgen Prochnow as a trapped soul in the spirit world, and a confused looking David Bowie as an agent who has been mired in the time bending fog of the spirit world long enough to render him brain fried. It's a love letter to the fans, really, but one that doesn't compromise an inch and is every ounce a Lynch picture, capturing the director at his most creative adventurous. He strives to plumb the depths of human behaviour and the forces beyond our perceptions which govern and influence from other planes. Seeing these tricky themes explored so rawly in a film based upon a TV show that had heavy roots soap opera and an often lighthearted tone only garnished with the disturbing elements in the film can be hard to swallow, which is no doubt the reason for the sour reception upon release. The film has stood the test of time and aged wonderfully though, seen by many grateful, loving fans as a dark dream straight from the heart, and a perfect film. If one is willing to accept the changes in tone and ambiguous, challenging nature of Lynch's storytelling (which I love!) then Fire Walk With Me is a sumptuous, gorgeous looking, vital piece of the Twin Peaks world, and in my mind Lynch's masterpiece.

There's nothing to be said for this movie that hasn't been commented on countless times before. The movie is an abomination (but not unwatchable) and it's been torn apart by just about everyone. Kevin Smith has a pretty entertaining commentary track for the movie available in his Fatman on Batman podcast, if anyone's interested. This movie is probably the most hated film on the Internet, if not tied with George Lucas' Star Wars prequels. It was the movie that put the final nail in the coffin of the first generation Batman movies that began with Tim Burton in 1989. The movie opens with an introduction to what can be argued as the film's main villain, Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Freeze has plans to&#x85;ugh&#x85;freeze Gotham and hold it ransom for the money he needs to continue research on a cure for his cryogenically frozen wife. Meanwhile, Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) arrives with a plot to manipulate Freeze, Batman, and Robin into doing her bidding in an attempt to&#x85;I'm not really sure&#x85; something about saving plants. As Batman and Robin argue over who has the hots for Poison Ivy more, Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying from MacGregor's Syndrome and his niece arrives at Wayne Manor to steal him away from his menial life as a rich man's servant. Then a bunch of mind-numbing cartoon stuff happens, Alicia Silverstone ruins Batgirl, and Arnold Schwarzenegger runs us through a gamut of horrible ice puns.BATMAN & ROBIN is so bad that members of the cast and crew have since come out to apologize for its existence. I'm not sure I believe Schumacher's apology was sincere though. He still maintains it was all studio interference. This movie is a slap in the face to Batman fans. It eliminates essentially everything people want to see in a Batman film and disgraces the source material with its handling of the characters. You realize the screenwriter for this movie was Akiva Goldsman? The man won an Academy Award for his writing on A BEAUTIFUL MIND. He wrote this. Just some fun food for thought. My main problem with this movie (of many) is its handing of the character of Mr. Freeze. Freeze had the potential to create an incredibly interesting movie. He's a complicated character with a tragic motivation and one of the few villains that can inspire sympathy from an audience because his intentions are somewhat pure. Yes, the Mr. Freeze in BATMAN & ROBIN is still doing what he's doing in hopes of finding a cure for his wife but that whole part feels shoved aside in favor of cold jokes and an embarrassing moment where he's forcing his henchmen to sing along with a Rankin\/Bass Christmas tune. Mr. Freeze is wasted and that is the biggest mistake in BATMAN & ROBIN. And don't get me started on Bane. Wow. Mr. Freeze is just wasted but Bane is warped from his comic origins as a criminal mastermind to a mindless hulk that speaks like Frankenstein.There is just so much wrong with this movie that it's hard to put it all into words, especially in a limited space. Let's try and blast through some. Nipples on the batsuit (and Robin suit) make a return. Alicia Silverstone is horribly, horribly miscast as Barbara Wilson\/Batgirl. The writing and dialogue in this film is often painful to watch\/listen to. The lapses in logic in this film are innumerable. The entire movie is a backwards step to the campiness of the 1960's TV series which, I'm going to argue, would not be a bad thing if they committed to it in full. Drop the serious elements (i.e. Alfred's illness) and better, smarter humor. Satirize the original 60's show. I loved that show and, while it wouldn't be my first choice for a Batman film, I'd be curious to watch a good campy modern Batman movie. The operative word there is good. Where was I?

Frank Roddam who directed documentaries before this film came out was the perfect choice. The film has a social realist\/documentary style yet it still looks stylistic to an extent.

Then there is Phillip Davies, Lesley Ash, Mark Wingett, Toyah Wilcox, Ray Winstone and even singer Sting. The cast is huge and diverse. That alone warrants a watch. 3. The soundtrack. As I said the album is fantastic and It is great that the majority of songs are in the film. It adds the rock edge to the film. And there are some nice additions of songs like Be my Baby etc. Even there is a use of My Generation in a digetic fashion which doesn't make sense as the film is set in 1964 it doesn't take me out of the film.

Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.

Its narrative and hidden motif's I'll get to in a second, but what I want to say upfront is this. I enjoyed the Heart of Darkness like attitude in it, but I also think this movie is grossly overrated considering Tarkovsky's earlier works. I want to say upfront immediately it is not because of the movies quiet, linear storytelling. I really enjoyed The Mirror (1975), and that was so ambiguous had you no knowledge of its autobiographical moments you wouldn't nearly enjoy it as much. It's not my least favourite Tarkovsky picture, but it certainly is an acquired taste and even its meanings remain shrouded today. Is it about the Gulags? The eventual Chernobyl disaster? Even some have made comparisons to The Wizard of Oz (1939). What I can say with assurance, is that Stalker feels somewhat more connected to nature than any other fiction movie out there.An expedition takes place led by a man known only as the 'Stalker' (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky), who has the ability to navigate the Zone, a site that has a specific area that has the supposed ability to fulfil desire. His task is to escort two clients into the area, one is a writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) seeking motivation, and the other a professor (Nikolai Grinko) seeking scientific discovery. The trio travels through these areas filled with ruins of modern society, whilst arguing with each other about the practicality of the Zone, and the arguable aura around it.The infamous history behind this film is that Tarkovsky and Cinematographer Georgy Rerberg, had already spent a year filming all the outdoor scenes only to return to Moscow and find all the footage unusable due to a defect in film stock. Tarkovsky of course was despondent and wanted to abandon it, and soon Russian film boards were about to write it off until Tarkovsky hired Cinematographer Aleksandr Knyazhinsky, and began work again after making a deal with the company. The finished narrative was drastically different compared to the original vision. Its Sepia tones hauntingly fit its urban settings well, the density of time actually feels present and the colours of the natural world look astounding. I found the talks of philosophy nowhere near as deep as Solaris (1972), even with that movies large quantities of techno-babble I enjoyed them. I'll also admit that the payoff and my expectations on the discoveries made felt underwhelming. Tarkovsky was approached about the nature of the movie and how the audience may react to it, to which he uttered this quote I somewhat adore the man for saying I am only interested in the views of two people one is called Bresson and one called Bergman.The film is crafted with particularly well executed long takes, and its sounds never betray the atmosphere the creators desired. The acting is strong and the dialogue is somewhat delivered well, given such an opaque narrative. There are moments where the fourth wall is broken both directly and ambiguously, and the film leaves many pleasant questions for you to decipher as Tarkovsky (I guess) intended. I suppose the final piece of trivia to mention is that several people involved in the film production including Tarkovsky, had met tragic deaths which has been debated that it was due to the fact this movie was filmed near a half-functioning hydroelectric station (Tarkovsky, his wife and actor Anatoli Solonitsyn all sadly died of the same cancer).Final Verdict I believe it comes off as a little pretentious, but on repeated viewings I warmed up to it a little more. I stand by what I've said in this review, in no way did I hate it, but I would advise you to seek out the other directors work before seeing Stalker.

There were critical scenes when Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean, did not stand up for what she believed in, nay, devoted her life to. This I found literally incredible, as law officers and family members of those murdered questioned, derided, isolated and rebuked Sister Helen. What I found so strange was that she had no answer to their hatred and hostility, and responded in a secular, if kind, way.I am not even a Christian, but in this film, Prejean could have made a powerful statement for the unconditional compassion as offered and described by Jesus Christ. Instead, she sat, staring. While I do believe it is true that real spirituality is in acts and not in words, there were critical junctures in the film where this position needed to be verbalized. It wasn't.I don't know what the reason was, for the somewhat remarkable departure from the norm, by casting nuns that do not wear habits, but it seems evident that the writer wanted to allay convention. Nuns without habits I can imagine I'm sure it's done. Nuns without a strong awareness of and ability to defend the words and precepts of Jesus Christ, I can not.It also seems evident that the writer and director wanted to create a marked divide between the sanctimonious, condemnative character of Chaplain Farley (played by Scott Wilson) and the honest caring of Sister Prejean, but the secularism was brought to such an extreme that it sometimes seemed that Prejean did not know what, exactly, she did believe.Another lesser sin of this film is that the subject of innocence or guilt is hardly ever mentioned. I was consistently wondering why no one was trying to take a harder look at the case.In summary, it was not necessary for the film to devolve into preachiness, but the case for revenge and hatred was given much more air time than the case for compassion and humanity. For the film to achieve a higher level of believability, those two latter qualities needed to be couched in the rebellious and visionary words and actions of Jesus Christ.

Although it took 1 hour to get me interested on what was happening on screen. Afterwards the film is a bit intense but kind of plain.It's a Wonderful Life is like a fable. Teaching a moral through the life of George Baily a small town folk who is going to kill himself on the Christmas eve, while an angel Clarence tries to make him understand how valuable a human life is.The acting performance isn't one of the greatest. But good enough for a classic. I'd say the same thing for all the technical stuffs, but I don't know much history about how these things were back in the 1940's. From a cultural point of view It's a Wonderful Life is an very good film, but only a very good film.Final verdict 8.4 out of 10. Do I recommend it Yes.

This is the concept of pleasing your parents and pleasing yourself with life's big choices, like marriage and career. So far, Jade is struggling with both. At 22, she is an aspiring actress, with a few jobs under her belt, but she can't move to her own place. Her parents forbid it before marriage. Naturally, there is little privacy at home, especially with a curious younger sister, Pearl. Further, her parents are forever arranging dates with her and their choices leave her cool. One of these matchmade gents even tells Jade of his unhappiness at such manipulation, too. Therefore, when Jade meets a nice Caucasian fellow outside a club, Mark, she lets herself experience a one night stand but sneaks out before morning. Yet, he's all she thinks about and, lo and behold, they meet again. Realizing her parents will probably reject him as a husband, as they have already disowned older brother Winston for his bad choices, how can Jade not break it off with Mark? Can Mom and Dad really endure another whammy at their hopes and dreams? This well made film is not really a happy experience, although there is some humor. Even so, it is an enlightening, thoughtful movie with plenty to ponder. Most children have a hard time meeting their parents expectations but for the Chinese, honoring parents is even more important than most. For transplanted Asians in the West, where freedom of choice is all around, this sometimes brings sad results. Oh, as the main character, is wonderful but so are the supporting actors around her. Then, too, the Canadian scenery, costumes, and other amenities are first rate. One must concede, however, that the story, with its careful direction, is the most important, gripping aspect to the movie. No, you won't get a double happy high by finding this flick but your understanding of parent-child relationships will undeniably make a difference in your life and the lives of your loved ones.
