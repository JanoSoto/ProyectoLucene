It is the type of film that is so heavily ingrained within popular culture that every reference, parody, and outright copy is almost a culture unto itself. It is because of this that even if you have not had the pleasure of viewing Francis Ford Coppola's master work, you feel like you have. It is also because of this that a surprising number of people never get around to watching 'The Godfather'. Afraid that they'll be entering a world of endless Mafia cliché and hackneyed dialogue, they steer clear of this gem of a film. A few days ago I was one of those people. Now - after picking up the box set for the meagre sum of fifteen pounds &#x96; I would count myself as one of the lucky portion of the population who has seen 'The Godfather'.For the uninformed the story of 'The Godfather' is, on the surface, simple gangster fare. The film, set in the late forties, follows the trials and tribulations of the Corleone family &#x96; one of five mobs in New York &#x96; as they try to stay on top as the supreme power in the city. What actually comes is a complex tale which carries weighty themes such as the corruption of innocence, the loss of the American Dream, and the cyclical nature of a life in crime.What struck me most about 'The Godfather' was how sedate it was when compared with other pieces of cinema. A few nights before, I watched 'City of God', a film about child gangs in Rio De Janeiro. This film, although slick and well presented, ultimately didn't leave much room for reflection on what is a very heavy and ugly subject; It left me feeling cold. It tried to point out the horrific state that Brazilian slums were in, but was so desperate to look good that it almost missed its own point.In stark contrast, 'The Godfather' is nothing if not thoughtful. Every scene, although well directed, never tries to point out its own style in any kind of pronounced manner. This could be more to do with older directorial styles but it still stands out. In a time when films revolving around gangs are nothing but frenetic gun-toting festivals of violence, blood, guts, and vague subtexts, it is refreshing to see a film that presents its concepts and central themes in a way that allows the viewer to actually digest them. Any on-screen violence that does happen is necessary to move the plot forward and is exactly the way cinema violence should be &#x96; blunt, seemingly real, and uncomfortable to watch. It is as though the film has sat you down and said This violence here. You see that? Pretty nasty huh? You don't want to see it again, do you? No? Good. Now listen to what we have to say about the flawed nature of the American Dream. It actively makes you despise the brutality of a life in crime by making it feel relentlessly vicious.This is illustrated in one scene involving family member Michael in a café. His task is to kill the two men opposite him. A train can be heard outside. As the noise of the train becomes louder and louder we see Michaels hand in his pocket, desperately toying with the gun. His face is tense and sweating profusely. The train grows louder and louder still, its cacophony overwhelming to the viewer, and you can feel the tension that must be welling up inside of Michael until he eventually pulls the trigger in what turns out to be a fairly botched assassination. Not only does this type of abhorrence to violence help make you acutely aware of the horrid nature of the 'family business' but it also drives Michaels story along as he becomes more desensitised to this type of brutality whilst he climbs the ranks of his business before becoming the patriarchal figure that he had, at one time, no desire to be. By the end of the film, a killing is nothing in the eyes of what was once an honest American citizen with unfortunate family ties.I mentioned in the opening paragraph that 'The Godfather' is a film that is referenced so much that it is easy to pass it by whilst still somehow feeling like you've watched it. Although you still kind of get that feeling on viewing, it feels more like a welcoming friend than a cliché ridden hammy mess. From the iconic music to the infamous line We'll make him an offer he can't refuse, from the horses head in the bed to badda bing badda boom. No matter how many parodies of 'The Godfather' you may have seen - and there are a lot of them &#x96; these moments that we all know of never detract from a full viewing. When everything is in context and being performed by an astonishingly good cast you forget about every other crappy gangster film you've ever seen and just get sucked straight in.In conclusion, watch this film. No matter who you are or what films you usually like, watch this one. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's worth just experiencing such a beautifully made film. If you can pick up the Coppola restoration then it's even better to look at. Do it now. Watch it!

This would make George's upcoming accident, by jumping to his death off Niagara Falls, look more believable.As things turn out Pat's attempt to murder George-by throwing him off the falls-backfires with Pat not George ending up as fish-bate! It's when Rose is brought into the Niagara Fall County Morgue to identify her husband's-who in fact is her boyfriend Pat-body that she realized he actually survived her and Pat's attempt to murder him! Not only did George survive but he's now mad as hell in what his two-timing wife Rose had planned for him and is out for revenge! In him being declared legally dead George has the advantage to do what he want's in getting even with Rose by no one ever suspecting him, in the fact that he's dead, of murdering her. But there's only one catch! George was seen by Polly Cutler when he was breaking into her motel room looking for cash, to get him across to the USA side of the falls, who can vouch to the police that he's actually alive!Both the sexy Miss Monroe and the majestic Niagara Falls-with the movie filmed in glorious Technicolor- makes you forget just how mundane the film's screenplay really is. In fact what should have been the highlight of the movie in Pat's attempt to throw George off the falls, with him instead of George getting crushed to death, was completely cut out! This made it a bit confusing, until you figured out that it happened off screen, in realizing if Roses' plan to off her husband actually succeeded!***SPOILERS*** The movie's exciting ending did in fact, like Rose & Pat planned, have George go under the waves or rocks of the falls but it was by then too late for both his wife and her lover to benefit from it.
