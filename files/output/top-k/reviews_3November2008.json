It is a indie film (meaning it is not low budget but it is not sold in stores or not noticed or heard about much) but it is a wonderful and funny movie to watch. It has very good music and a very good story line. The artwork on the cover tells it all, the main cast members all black and white with a really red apple lol. I really suggest everyone to rent or buy this movie. Great Cast members Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek, Batman begins) Barry Watson (7th Heaven) Marrisa Coughlan (Freddy Got Fingered) and Helen Mirren (The Queen, National Treasure 2) ","genre":null},{"date":"3 November 2008","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Teaching Mrs. Tingle is a wonderful film... by far my most favorite comedy\/drama film.
