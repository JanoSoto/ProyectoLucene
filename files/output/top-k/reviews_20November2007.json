After a sort of prelude that foreshadows the hearty volume of blood and gore in the movie, the story starts off with Paquita, a young lady who works at the general store for her father and grandmother. She starts to become romantically entangled with Lionel, an introverted young gentleman who lives with and under the control of his elderly mother. When Lionel and Paquita go on a date to the zoo, Lionel's mother follows in secret with the intention of spying on them. She gets bitten by a vicious Sumatran Rat Monkey and Lionel takes her home. Over the next day the bite causes her to become sick, delirious, and start to literally fall apart. After eating part of her own ear and most of Paquita's dog, a nurse comes to take Lionel's mother to the hospital but it is too late and she dies. But then she comes back as a zombie and kills the nurse, who also becomes zombified. Lionel now finds it upon himself to lock the zombies in his basement and struggle to keep anyone from finding out, even Paquita. This is further complicated by new zombies that he has to keep hidden, his conflicting emotions over Paquita and his zombified mother, and the meddlings of his sleazy uncle.This is one of the famous Peter Jackson's earliest films. I have heard people remark on how far he's come since then with Lord of the Rings, which implies that Dead Alive is an inferior and poorly made movie. On the contrary, I find Dead Alive to be much more entertaining and a better use of my DVD money. It has a thoroughly interesting and surprisingly complex plot, and every single one of the characters is quite likable. It also has a strangely intelligent way of producing hilarious humor from violence, gore, and death, most of which won't be enjoyed by anyone who gets turned off by that sort of thing. It's a highly quotable film as well, full of lines such as What, no pudding?, That's my mother you're pissing on..., and of course, I kick ass for the Lord!! I've seen quite a few zombie movies, but Dead Alive is the only one I can think of that has unique and humorous zombies that are part of the film's entertainment instead of merely undead people who want to eat the living. Films such as Sean of the Dead are quite humorous as movies, but the zombies themselves are typical walking undead instead of the source of much of the comedy. Some of the zombies in Dead Alive are funny, such as a zombie with a garden gnome shoved into his neck where his head used to be, and some are downright grotesque even amongst the blood and guts that fills the last third of the movie. There is also a zombie baby toddler thing running around that is humorously annoying yet holds a sinister undertone and is often the source of many of the film's funniest moments.Dead Alive has some insane gore and blood content, but most of the brutality is stylized or so completely over the top that it doesn't come across as horrifically violent as it would have been had it been presented in a realistic fashion. It's often cited as the bloodiest film ever made based on the massive quantities of fake blood used in its production, and based on the infamous lawnmower scene alone I would agree. Despite its initial image as a shallow film that is little more than an exceptionally bloody zombie movie, Dead Alive is a hilarious and witty masterpiece that also has the most creative and amusing zombie permutations I've ever seen.

First of all the plot gave an opportunity, for a skilled director to explore the depths of each character's feelings and thoughts. A complexity of emotions in loosing a close, loved person offers a palette of different colors, that should paint the picture of the turmoil it causes within a man or a woman affected.This picture offers nothing in that, or any other matter. The characters are stone cold and emotionless, impossible to relate to, and that's not only the case with mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), that's supposed to be without emotions, dealing with the pain in her own way, by shutting everyone out, but with the rest of principal characters too, including the most affected one of them, the son, Conrad Jarett (Timothy Hutton). He sweats, he cries, he behaves irrationally, and for the most of the movie acts like he is kicking drug addiction, and not suffering a loss of a brother. However Donald Sutherland is the weakest link in this movie and his character Calvin Jarett, the sympathetic but strangely alienated father, also gives a wooden performance that blends in the whole lack of appeal that this movie suffers of, fading to gray from start to finish. He cares but he doesn't!? A good Jewish doctor (Judd Hirsch) only adds to the misery of this film with his totally undeveloped character that miraculously heals troubled Conrad with several half baked scenes (he actually filmed all his scenes in 8 days), that seem more like he doesn't care about his troubles, than that he actually does.All in all, this is a completely ordinary movie, without a stand out emotion or a heart beat and the reasons of it's acclaim, are unknown to me.
