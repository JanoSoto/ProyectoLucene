Batman closely follows the early Bob Kane comics in it's style and personality, while borrowing a few features of the more recent Batman graphic novels by Frank Miller and Alan Moore.  The script by Sam Hamm and Warren Skarren is a very tightly knit one, featuring a slew of great lines, some amazing scenes, and, quite thankfully, the absence of Robin.

Kubrick, for all his touted genius, didn't come close to capturing the book on film. It hardly seems to have much to do with Nabokov at all, instead being off the subject and its own unique creature. Although some films can (and should) be viewed as divorced from their source material, I find it difficult to regard this production without comparing it to Nabokov's creation. I wonder why Kubrick interpreted it this way. Putting aside the possible controversy a faithful adaptation may have caused, Kubrick chose to emphasize the satirical elements and update it to 1960s culture. Of course, Lolita is aged a few years to make the relationship less shocking. As played by Sue Lyon (who looks much older), she comes off as a typical '60s teeny-bopper heroine. Kubrick seems to want to parody other movies of this period and the activities of that society and set. The music here is atrocious, especially the annoying love theme, which resembles swinging go-go music of the era.The story wanders all over the place, hardly devoting enough time to central relationship between Humbert Humbert and Lolita. The plot is slight and unfocused, preferring to diverge off into subplots that distract from the main story and themes. When the occasional scene does follow the book (many occur in a strange, seemingly random-chosen fashion), it appears almost jarringly out of place with the rest of the action. By incorporating too many elements of diffuse black humor, the comic and poignant obsession angle is considerably diluted. The film is also hampered by poor performances by all the major players save Peter Sellers. James Mason is especially weak as Humbert, Shelley Winters is unequivocally annoying, and Sue Lyon is a completely uninteresting disappointment. Sellers' character of Quilty is allowed to dominate the movie so much, I questioned whether this was supposed to be his story. The Quilty character, which was essentially a minor through pervasive presence in the novel, is brought to the forefront here, and Sellers improvises wildly to create a particularly overshadowing creep. As a movie on its own, perhaps the Kubrick version works on some level, but it fails as an adaptation of Nabokov's novel.

It stars John Cusack, one of this generation's most interesting actors, as Lloyd Dobler, a kick boxing grad who decides to call up the cutest girl in school just because it feels like the right thing to do.  The girl, Diane Court (played by Ione Skye), is not only beautiful, but smart enough to be valedictorian.  They both happen to be outsiders for different reasons, and as they get together, their relationship blossoming, they find they have nothing in common except love.  Sometimes, that's all you need. As the movie continues, we meet Diane's father, who will do anything for his daughter (a fact that comes back to haunt him), and finds himself in competition with Lloyd for his daughter's attention.  The screenwriter \/director, Cameron Crowe, handles this competition and his characters with a deft, realistic touch. The title of the movie, 'Say Anything', refers to the relationship that Diane has with her father, in that she can 'say anything' to him, but the title is ironic, because it is what he doesn't tell her that turns the plot in a surprising direction. Crowe would go on to make 'Singles' and 'Jerry Maguire', but it is here that we first see his insight into characterization.  The performance that keeps you watching the screen throughout the movie is Cusack's, because his mind keeps working; you get the sense that Lloyd has a lot more to say, but is far too interested in Diane to focus on anything else.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"4 September 1998","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  It is a rare movie that allows its teenage characters to be human beings, and not just a collection of frat-boy cliches and ditzy blonde stereotypes. In the last twenty years, there have only been a handful 'Real Genius', 'Some Kind Of Wonderful', 'Running On Empty', 'Scream', and this movie, 'Say Anything'. It stars John Cusack, one of this generation's most interesting actors, as Lloyd Dobler, a kick boxing grad who decides to call up the cutest girl in school just because it feels like the right thing to do.  The girl, Diane Court (played by Ione Skye), is not only beautiful, but smart enough to be valedictorian.  They both happen to be outsiders for different reasons, and as they get together, their relationship blossoming, they find they have nothing in common except love.  Sometimes, that's all you need. As the movie continues, we meet Diane's father, who will do anything for his daughter (a fact that comes back to haunt him), and finds himself in competition with Lloyd for his daughter's attention.  The screenwriter \/director, Cameron Crowe, handles this competition and his characters with a deft, realistic touch. The title of the movie, 'Say Anything', refers to the relationship that Diane has with her father, in that she can 'say anything' to him, but the title is ironic, because it is what he doesn't tell her that turns the plot in a surprising direction. Crowe would go on to make 'Singles' and 'Jerry Maguire', but it is here that we first see his insight into characterization.  The performance that keeps you watching the screen throughout the movie is Cusack's, because his mind keeps working; you get the sense that Lloyd has a lot more to say, but is far too interested in Diane to focus on anything else. 'Say Anything' makes a good date movie because both sides are represented fairly, and while the resolution is a romantic one, the viewer gets the impression that it's the logical choice, too.

I think i had every right to be. Instead of a subtle quintessential English theme it had turned into a bizarre version of the original. Mrs Peel and Steed as psychologically disturbed was a surprising idea but Fiennes & Thurman were not up to the job,taking the thing far too seriously. The moments with the teddybears was hilarious, and the double-entrendre by Connery that In Ghana you can get a good ten inches overnight. was played quite deadpan and I started to warm to it.The rest of the cast was underused, Eddie Izzard said nothing and just screamed. Fiona Shaw wasn't given much to work with as Father but did quite well. Jim Broadbent was very good as mother. Eilen Atkins was hilarious as Alice - when an evil henchman of Connery's Sir August DeWinter flee's from her machine gun fire she emits with comic timing cheeky little b*****d .Apart from these little comic gems spread sparingly through the film. The plot was sparse and borrowed from some old avengers episodes. The repartee between Thurman and Fiennes was very stiled and seems as though tried to put over some 'dramatic' pauses or something, it didn't have the same feel as Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg had. The Laurie Johnson theme was give a little blast at the end when it should of been spruced up and been put on at the beginning instead of tame chords. The locations were good but the 80s Lloyds bank building in london was odd. The special effects were quite good on the whole, Eddie Izzard playing about with a squadron of CGI killer bees was the one of the most memorable alongside Big Ben exploding.On the whole the feel of the original was there you just had to dig through the impaired script and the poor performance of Thurman and Fiennes. Not bad but it could of been alot better, you'll either love it or hate it.
