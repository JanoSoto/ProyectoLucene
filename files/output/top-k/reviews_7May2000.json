It was refreshing to see Matthew Broderick get back to doing some good work for a change.  I'm referring to the lousy job he did in 'Godzilla'; in my eyes he desperately needed to revalidate himself, which he managed to do in 'Election' in an exceptional form (speaking of form has he been working out? those upper body muscles really looked good on him too!). Reese Witherspoon was terrific, I loved hating her! Though I don't consider myself to be an expert in the field of screenplay and cinematography and the likes, I thought the various scenes where images were frozen gave a special dimension to the movie; especially the scene during the counting of the vote, that was absolutely my favorite. The movie in itself, of course, is about more than just high school politics.  It's about real life, in all its dimensions of good and bad, innocence versus deviousness, justice and injustice.  That's what makes this movie so refreshing.  For once the official critics (see External Reviews) were right an overwhelming majority seems to agree that this is one great movie.

Case in point, this movie took me back to one of those standard Hollywood films produced during the 1940's and 1950's with all of the cliches that made it just too predictable. However, having said all that I did find the movie to be enormously entertaining where the US Navy special commandos are successful in stealing the Nazi code machine and sinking a destroyer in the process. Watch for Matthew McConaughey as Lt.Tyler on his first command along with Harvey Keitel as his veteran chief petty officer for solid performances. The films depiction of being depth charged might even be on the same level as Das Boot. But that is where the comparison ends..In summary, the film is an action-packed piece of WWII wartime drama that holds you in your seat for every torpedo and depth charge. Not as bad as some of the previous comments have suggested.
