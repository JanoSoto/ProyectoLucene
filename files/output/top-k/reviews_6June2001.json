Stellar reviews, good word-of-mouth, and my own anticipation since seeing the first trailer all led to a high degree of wanting it to be really, really *Memento*-good. While I've got *Memento* on my tongue, I can segue by saying that that movie lived up to the hype, while *Shrek* didn't quite make it all the way.I was very, very worried at the beginning. During the opening credits, they employ more gross humor than I've seen in some entire movies. Burping, farting, bug-eating, implied excrement, whatever they could think of. I was afraid. Where was the wit? The clever fracturing of fairy tales?The clever fracturing of fairy tales, I discovered, was not as prominent as I had thought and wished. Save for a few scenes at the beginning and the end, and one or the two in the middle, there isn't really that much of it. And most of what there was, I'd already seen in the trailers. The Gingerbread Man, however, should get his own movie. And I really love the Merry Men scene. I expected more of that kind of fun, but there wasn't.Where does the other humor come from? References to the butt, farting, jokes about how short cough, cough Lord Farquaad is, some nice Disneyland bits...and the fact that Eddie Murphy is speaking. He talks. A lot. But I like Eddie Murphy. The way he speaks, it's as if he believes that everything that comes out of his mouth is comic gold. Some of it's pretty funny. Some of it's just odd, but it's said amusingly. Some of it's just...hm, okay, he said what was in the script. But there are other really good elements of humor that I won't mention here because one good element of humor is the element of surprise.Mike Myers is excellent as well. I could hardly tell it was him. He uses a Canadian\/Scottish hybrid accent that works very well. I read an article about how he actually begged to re-record his lines in this new accent because he didn't think he'd captured his character right the first time. It set the movie back three months and increased the budget by $4 million. Katzenberg thought it was worth it, and I think so too. Chris Farley was actually slated to play Shrek, and had actually recorded some lines before he died, but hearing Mike Myers' portrayal of him, I can't imagine Chris Farley doing it. I don't think he could have given him the genuine emotion that Shrek has now.Cameron Diaz. Hm. For the first fifteen minutes Princess Fiona talked, all I could see was Cameron Diaz speaking her lines in the recording room. I couldn't see the *character* saying the lines for some reason. I guess her voice was right for the character, but it took a while to get used to it.John Lithgow's great, but that goes without saying.The animation, as expected, is spectacular. It's just so amazing to see these 3-d characters walk around in their 3-d environment.So, overall...I think the movie could have been a *lot* better. Oh, I forgot to mention the music. I didn't recognize more than half the songs, but I suppose many of you will. Geez, sheesh, I sound like I hated the movie. I really didn't. My problem is I came in with really high expectations that weren't met. There's a lot of great stuff, and it's a very enjoyable movie (Enjoyability is always a plus for me). It does get my blessing and recommendation, but I just warn that you don't get caught up in all the hype. One review I just read ended with, but it's no *Toy Story 2*. It isn't, but I think it could have been. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  *Shrek* had a high bar to reach.

I don't know why, maybe their corporate logo had something to do with it.  Maybe their approach to being cute (a kid fishing from the moon) rather than majestic (like Disney, Fox, the WB or Universal) did it.  Turkeys like The Haunting didn't help, either.  Hell, that same movie cost over $90 million to make a house that wasn't scary, only to lose to Artisan's Blair Witch Project, which cost under a million (and it wasn't scary, either...still happy I paid for The Iron Giant).  After seeing The Road to El Dorado, I guess my opinion about Dreamworks swayed a little.  Maybe the music by Elton John and Tim Rice, doing music together for the first time since The Lion King in 1994 helped. Anyway, I did like Shrek.  It's not trying to be a formulaic prince and princess fall in love and get married movie.  As the trailers state the prince isn't charming, the beauty isn't sleeping, and the hero is an ogre. The various jabs at many fairy tales and nursery rhymes are very funny.  And some stories, if they're not actually 'fairy tales'.  There were so many, it's tough to keep count.  Look for spoofs of Snow White, Peter Pan, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the Gingerbread Man, Robin Hood, etc.  And it still has enough time to parody The Matrix.  It also teaches a moral about prejudice.  We all feel for Shrek, when he tells Donkey *slight spoiler* that no one thinks well of him because he's an ogre, which everyone tends to think are big, stupid ugly monsters.  I guess not all ogres are evil beasts...  I suppose some mild profanity and a scene were we see Donkey leak out a fire gave this movie it's PG rating.  Also, there seems to be a new 'surefire laughs' gross-out gag.  In the mid-'90s, it was lighting farts on fire.  Today, (2001) it's putting out fires with one's urine.  I wonder what other body function we can use on fires in the future...um...yuck.  Try not to think about that.  So, go see Shrek.  In the meantime, 'I have to save my ass.'
