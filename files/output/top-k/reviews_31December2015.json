","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"31 December 2015","score":"","review":" Robert Altman is one of the rare American directors who have succeeded in keeping loyal to their own style and vision while also being able to carry on for quite a long time. Altman began directing in television in the 1950's, had his cinematic breakthroughs in the 1970's, and kept working hard until his death in 2006. He always kept a healthy distance to Hollywood, but it seems that he -- like so many others -- had a twofold relationship with the dream factory. The influence of classical Hollywood, which the director adored, is apparent in Altman's cinema, but at the same time he expresses great frustration and even loathe towards Hollywood. Both of these attitudes emerge powerfully in his witty, insightful, and lightweight satire of Hollywood, The Player (1992) which is filled with references to film history. The story focuses on a Hollywood studio executive, Griffin Mill (played by Tim Robbins) who starts to investigate an abandoned screenwriter sending death threats his way. After murdering the writer more or less unintentionally, Mill falls in love with the writer's girlfriend, but his new life is once again threatened by the police investigating the murder case. In the meantime, Mill's studio is producing a new film whose director wants something else than standard Hollywood entertainment, but the studio has different plans. The line between reality and unreality, fiction and non-fiction begins to blur as Mill's life starts bearing a resemblance to all those film-noir movies whose posters hang on the studio's walls. This is the core of the story to which Altman anchors all the multiple story elements that he enjoys developing. Inter-textual references, satirical jokes, and celebrity appearances might at times feel too much, though they all serve a purpose. The abundance of the film is fragmentary, but this episodic nature of the film does not need to be seen as a flaw, since Altman skillfully keeps it all together. To my mind, the beginning of the film nicely introduces Altman's stylistic program and summarizes this ability of his to keep many threads together. The film begins with a long tracking shot, recording the life inside a Hollywood studio from casual dialogue about movies to awkward pitching producers have to listen to, which seems like a direct reference to Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958) and its famous opening. Like this opening shot, the narrative of The Player is overall very self-aware; that is, the spectator is invited into taking the representation to account. One is often paying attention to the way things are structured rather than the things themselves. This might be at times alienating -- and intentionally so -- but Altman also strongly focalizes his narrative to the subjective point of view of his protagonist, enhancing the absurdity of the milieu and its surrounding events. All of these narrative elements serve Altman's purposes of criticizing Hollywood. His criticism, though stark and poignant, is hardly hostile, however. Overall, The Player is a veritably lightweight film in the sense that it doesn't have the emotional heaviness of 3 Women (1977) nor the structural complexity of Nashville (1975). The film does have its depth, but it is less striking -- for better and worse. All in all, The Player is a very enjoyable film, but it might be a slight letdown for people familiar with the director's earlier work. Nonetheless, a viewer who loves Altman's films will most likely cherish this one as well, perhaps in a fashion similar to Altman's relationship with Hollywood.

He had to let the Tramp go. Thus The Great Dictator marks a watershed in a filmography already brimming with turning points. I'd say this is where late Chaplin truly begins, Modern Times being a kind of transitory film. And as I've stated, this is not only a superficial transformation but a deeper development also in what he perceives as cinematic, funny and tragic. Surely Chaplin's films have always had that sinuously sad and dark undersong, commingled with the more apparently comical, as he was himself quick to point out,1 yet it finds its maturity in this later period.Seeing The Great Dictator after World War II and its aftermath is like reading James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) after almost a hundred years of literary criticism and analysis. It's so pregnant with cultural meaning(s) assigned to it that it's quite impossible to watch it not through the prism of history. But I think it's important to remember that this was filmed in the late 1930s, and as Chaplin would famously muse, he had no idea of the full extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime against the jews and others.The film, then, stands in the anteroom to either history or fiction.

I think that the film is reasonably historically accurate, with one of the bigger inaccuracies being that Merrick's first name was Joseph rather than John. For some odd reason that has never been explained, Treves always referred to him as John even though Merrick's name was recorded as Joseph and he referred to himself as such. The script by David Lynch, Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren is wonderful and the same is true of Lynch's direction. The black-and-white cinematography of Freddie Francis, otherwise best known as a horror film director, is beautiful and greatly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Much of the film's success, however, lies in the fantastic make-up of Christopher Tucker, which led directly to the establishment of a long overdue Academy Award for Best Makeup, albeit too late for this film to benefit from it.As the title character, John Hurt gives an absolutely brilliant performance. A sufferer from what is now believed to be either neurofibromatosis type I or Proteus syndrome, Merrick's severe deformities meant that he was exhibited in the freak show of the cruel Mr. Bytes, played very well and against type by Freddie Jones. It is not mentioned in the film but in reality he was in a workhouse for several years beforehand, which would have been a dreadful experience for anyone, let alone someone in his condition. Merrick is assumed to have limited mental capacities. However, he surprises everyone when it is revealed that he can not only read and write but is extremely intelligent. He is a kind, unfailingly polite and gentle soul who soon develops a passion for art and the theatre. Merrick's good manners and easy charm mean that he is able to win over most people who are initially frightened or even disgusted by his appearance. My favourite scene in the film is the one in which he has tea with Treves and his wife Ann, played in a great cameo by Hannah Gordon, and she is deeply moved by his sensitive nature and his photograph of his beloved and beautiful mother. It is impossible for me to imagine what kind of life he led or how he felt but the film depicts him as a very brave man who lived his life with a quiet dignity once he was given the opportunity to do so. When I saw Hurt speak in UCD in 2009, he said that the make-up was so claustrophobic that he could only work on alternating days and it is easy to see why. This may also be the reason that Merrick does not appear until 14 minutes into the film and does not speak for the first 40 minutes. Hurt was deservedly nominated for Best Actor for his performance - for the only time, incidentally - but he lost to Robert De Niro in Raging Bull.Although Merrick is the focus of the film, the protagonist is arguably the renowned surgeon Frederick Treves, who rescues him from Bytes' freak show and admits him to the London Hospital. Anthony Hopkins, who is credited first and has more screen time than Hurt, is excellent in the role. At first, he is interested in Merrick merely as a medical curiosity and exhibits him before other members of his profession as such. In that sense, it is little different from Bytes exhibiting him in his freak show. It just has more of a veneer of sophistication. Over time, particularly after realising the extent of his intelligence, Treves grows genuinely fond of him and he becomes the first true friend that he ever had. After Merrick becomes the darling of London society, however, Treves begins to wonder whether he is really any better than Bytes as his reputation and career have profited significantly from showing the Elephant Man off to people. In reality, this is a criticism that has been levelled against Treves and I agree with it to some extent. However, I also think that he did more good than harm and gave Merrick a better quality of life than he would ever have had otherwise, even if his motives were not entirely altruistic.As was his wont, John Gielgud gives a superb performance as Francis Carr-Gomm, the governor of the London Hospital who is initially opposed to Merrick's presence but eventually grows to care for him. The same is true of his fellow stalwart of the British stage and screen Wendy Hiller as the head nurse Mrs. Mothershead. I suppose that Anne Bancroft (whose husband Mel Brooks produced the film) is officially the female lead but she only has three scenes. In any event, she is excellent as the Victorian actress Madge Kendal. In real life, Mrs. Kendal was childhood friends with Kate and Ellen Terry, two other celebrated actresses of the day who just so happened to be Gielgud's grandmother and great-aunt. On a similar note, Frederick Treves' great-nephew of the same name makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the film as an alderman. Lesley Dunlop is very good as Merrick's loving nurse Nora and Michael Elphick is suitably vile as the night porter Jim who, in the most disturbing scene, leads a bunch of drunks and prostitutes into Merrick's hospital room to torment him. The film also features nice appearances in small roles from Helen Ryan (reprising her role as Princess Alexandra from the ITV serial Edward the Seventh), John Standing, W. Morgan Sheppard, Kenny Baker, David Ryall and a very young Dexter Fletcher.Overall, this is a brilliant film which reminds the audience of the importance of not judging a book by its cover.

I think that the film is reasonably historically accurate, with one of the bigger inaccuracies being that Merrick's first name was Joseph rather than John. For some odd reason that has never been explained, Treves always referred to him as John even though Merrick's name was recorded as Joseph and he referred to himself as such. The script by David Lynch, Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren is wonderful and the same is true of Lynch's direction. The black-and-white cinematography of Freddie Francis, otherwise best known as a horror film director, is beautiful and greatly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Much of the film's success, however, lies in the fantastic make-up of Christopher Tucker, which led directly to the establishment of a long overdue Academy Award for Best Makeup, albeit too late for this film to benefit from it.As the title character, John Hurt gives an absolutely brilliant performance. A sufferer from what is now believed to be either neurofibromatosis type I or Proteus syndrome, Merrick's severe deformities meant that he was exhibited in the freak show of the cruel Mr. Bytes, played very well and against type by Freddie Jones. It is not mentioned in the film but in reality he was in a workhouse for several years beforehand, which would have been a dreadful experience for anyone, let alone someone in his condition. Merrick is assumed to have limited mental capacities. However, he surprises everyone when it is revealed that he can not only read and write but is extremely intelligent.

That said, rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it pretty much followed the same pattern as the first movie except that it was even more slow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie by any means. But I don't believe it was on the same level as its predecessor and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.

Great adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Revolutionary for its time, the plot and direction still stand up today. The atmosphere, in particular the sense of dread, that Murnau creates is palpable, and he uses every trick of light and shade at his disposal in doing so.Being a silent movie, the performances are very theatrical. Max Schrek is brilliant as Nosferatu, contributing significantly to the eerie atmosphere.Not perfect - the pacing is a bit uneven, and the plot sometimes feels contrived.Still, an absolute classic.
