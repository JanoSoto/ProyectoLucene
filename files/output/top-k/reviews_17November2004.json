I knew though, once it became official that the New York film festival was premiering it, that the reconstructed version of Samuel Fuller's epic was going to be seen as no longer being truncated. When it was over, I felt as though, like with his other films I've seen (Pickup on South Street and Shock Corridor to a degree), that I'd seen something special- a work of art that's told with such straight-forward precision it elevates the B genre. There is something about war that is, like life usually, a contradiction. There are scenes and instances in Fuller's film where confusion occurs, and tragedy comes about as if it's springing out of nature. But what Fuller captures as well is the camaraderie, so to speak, of the platoon- the humor, the understanding of one another that strengthens when other soldiers come and go without much notice. And the strengths and humanity of the sergeant (here portrayed in a performance that could possibly be better or at least on part with what was in The Dirty Dozen) comes through clearest of all. The Big Red One, at its extended length, is one of Fuller's triumphs as a storyteller; infusing his own experiences in the first battalion (the cigar that re-appears with one character signify who he made as his kind of alter-ego) as well as others he fought with, stories he heard, etc. While it is a film that lends itself partly to the ideals of the old-fashioned WW2 films, it's very modern in its personal take on the situations, battle sequences\/outcomes, and the dynamics of the characters. To put it another way, what Oliver Stone was to Vietnam, Samuel Fuller was to WW2, to an extent. Though his version of, for instance, the invasion of Omaha beach, doesn't have the grainy, documentary feel of Saving Private Ryan, the realism and suspense and chaos it all there. Fuller's experience as a journalist - his sense of detail and pacing in the scenes - is what gives that sequence involving Marvin and his men, among others, such truth. Along with the Israeli cinematographer Adam Greenburg, who would go on to lens the first two Terminator films, The Big Red One brings forth numerously unforgettable images. The climax, in and of itself, in which the quote I mentioned is put to the test for Mark Hammil's Pvt. Griff, is extraordinary. The shots, the faces, and usage of light, and the acting by him and the others, brought to me some of the strangest emotional reaction (not as in crying, but empathizing) I ever felt in a war film. In that respect the film, in scenes like that, and in the little moments with the four horsemen and their episodes, are on the level (if not superior) to the emotional connectedness that Spielberg or Stone achieved.The script is a feat as a story of the stead-fast progression of the soldiers from North Africa to Germany. However without the cast it might have faltered. Marvin pulls off a rounded character by the end and is successful in his own right, but the four privates are the show. Most of the time if not all through, Ward and Di Cicco (not very well known actors to me before viewing this film) are very dependable for some comic and sensible interludes. Carradine's Zab (Fuller's re-incarnation) is in a performance of insight, amusement, and is a crucial piece to the film. It is Hammil then that comes away as most rewarding. His character is given a brilliant arc as the sharpshooter, and in the cremation scene, he proves he is far more valuable and compelling an actor most would give him credit for. My advice to people who think he can only play Skywalker and the occasional voice-over work is that this film is a must-view.I can say, in wrapping up this review, that there was not much at all to nit-pick or complain about with this film, long length and all. There may or may not have been truth to the English-speaking Germans, but that didn't matter to me. When some of the dialog was not entirely clear as well, that was not a problem. Almost every frame (in particular a few key long shots on the beaches and some close-ups of faces and eyes in the third act) are like carefully molded sculptures\/paintings of the condition of war. Bottom line, I can't tell whether or not the film has bettered from the additions, but I do know for certain I would not want to sit through a truncated version when these forty or so minutes fit in so well.

Leonardo DiCaprio in particular is a very talented, engaging young actor, and it's not his fault that an extremely ambitious epic movie like this was simply too heavy for him to carry. But unfortunately, that's the case. I can't say that he was too young for the part--- but the character of Jack was definitely too young for the movie.

Instead, I liked it on an overall scale. I've seen a lot worse like 'Jack Frost' (not the Michael Keaton version but the film about a killer's spirit trapped in a snowman and goes on a killing spree! I found that film so stupid, I turned it off after 20 minutes!) But then again, I saw the unrated directors cut and saw probably more gore and blood than the PG original version gives out. Okay, here's the story. The year is 2010. Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) is lost at sea being the soul survivor of a plane crash (there were two other survivors but you'll have to find out about them yourself!). He is rescued by Montgomery (Val Kilmer) and taken to an 'island paradise' operated by Dr Moreau (Marlon Brando). It is while Edward is on the island waiting for the communications system to be fixed (so he can call for help) that he finds out what the doctor's secret project is. This mainly all happens in the first 20 minutes but I wont tell you the rest!Okay, first of all, I can see why this film has been beaten and bruised by so many people (especially the critics). There are several flaws in each film. In between conversations there are several pauses and although this is meant to put in suspense, it just makes the film drag. Also, the truth over the doctor's project is revealed in the first 30 minutes so it seems that the next 1 hour 10 minutes are a bit of a drag. Oh and Marlon Brando in that gear&#133;. Sorry it doesn't work!!!!!. On an off note, I've got a feeling that the doctor and his little friend were the inspiration for the 'South Park' characters Doctor Maphesto and his little monkey friend. I could be wrong though!However, this film is NOT (repeat NOT) unwatchable. It's quite interesting. Although Marlon is the star billing (well not on IMDb.com but definitely on the DVD cover and film credits), David and Val stole the show hands down (Hey I found a Val film I like! Cool! I'm not counting 'Willow!' in that because that rocks anyway!) Seeing him play the insane role was cool and I have to admit he was sexy!As for David, his acting was amazing (as usual) I cant think of any other word to describe it! I cant work out his accent but from watching 'Naked', his accent in 'Dr Moreau' is Mancunian but its stiffer than that in 'Naked', like he was trying to be posh or he was bored or just had a stick up his bum! This is one of the great moral stories of all time. The original story must have got its idea of 'Playing God' from Mary Shelley's book 'Frankenstein. We have the doctor trying to play God and create the perfect species by injecting splicing animals with 'perfect' human genes. Similarily Frankenstein decides to create the perfect men with a high intelligence and beauty! However, in 'Dr Moreau', there is the modern fable that sometimes, from the way we act, we are not always men but resemble the beast. This is portrayed highly at the end of the film with the final narrative.Also, the title sequence is terrific!Overall, I give it a 7\/10- good but could be better!H xxxxxx ","genre":null},{"date":"17 November 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I've read a lot of critic reviews and a lot of reviews of the audience and I watched it, fearing the worst!

Sorry it doesn't work!!!!!. On an off note, I've got a feeling that the doctor and his little friend were the inspiration for the 'South Park' characters Doctor Maphesto and his little monkey friend.

I'm not counting 'Willow!' in that because that rocks anyway!) Seeing him play the insane role was cool and I have to admit he was sexy!As for David, his acting was amazing (as usual) I cant think of any other word to describe it! I cant work out his accent but from watching 'Naked', his accent in 'Dr Moreau' is Mancunian but its stiffer than that in 'Naked', like he was trying to be posh or he was bored or just had a stick up his bum! This is one of the great moral stories of all time. The original story must have got its idea of 'Playing God' from Mary Shelley's book 'Frankenstein. We have the doctor trying to play God and create the perfect species by injecting splicing animals with 'perfect' human genes.

Instead, I liked it on an overall scale. I've seen a lot worse like 'Jack Frost' (not the Michael Keaton version but the film about a killer's spirit trapped in a snowman and goes on a killing spree! I found that film so stupid, I turned it off after 20 minutes!) But then again, I saw the unrated directors cut and saw probably more gore and blood than the PG original version gives out. Okay, here's the story. The year is 2010. Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) is lost at sea being the soul survivor of a plane crash (there were two other survivors but you'll have to find out about them yourself!). He is rescued by Montgomery (Val Kilmer) and taken to an 'island paradise' operated by Dr Moreau (Marlon Brando). It is while Edward is on the island waiting for the communications system to be fixed (so he can call for help) that he finds out what the doctor's secret project is. This mainly all happens in the first 20 minutes but I wont tell you the rest!Okay, first of all, I can see why this film has been beaten and bruised by so many people (especially the critics).

I also write about this film as its pedigree is amazing. And finally I can't believe I've not heard of it, even in a Heavens Gate, this must have been professional suicide sort of capacity.The film is from 1980 and it is directed by William Friedkin (Exorcist & The French Connection). It stars one Al Pacino (no C.V. required). It is called Cruising. Basically it is the story of a gay serial killer and Al Pacino is the cop who must go undercover to try and find him.I was a bit drunk, a bit stoned and a bit bored when I was channel flicking one night in UK. I came across the start of this movie. The story starts in a club in New York that is very much like the Blue Parrot in the Police Academy movies, except there is nothing funny about this place. It is a proper underground S & M gay club where anything goes. A young Italian Stallion picks up a guy who is in the full leather get up. Cap and glasses obscuring his face and chains that clink whenever he walks. They go back to the stallions flat. Off screen sex occurs. The next shot is the young guy, naked, having his hands tied behind his back. He doesn't like this but is being talked into it by Chains. Next Chains draws a thin knife from his boots and starts playing with it. Young guy is frantic now and begs to be let out but Chains is now teasing him. Chains then stabs the young guy repeatedly in the back. This is graphically shot and you see the knife going in and the young guy screaming. This was a really, really intense scene. I was now hooked on the story and had to know where it ended.I am not gay and I am liberally minded. Having been to Thailand, Ibiza and Amsterdam I have had my arse felt a few times in dance clubs. I am not bothered by this as long as it stays each to their own, but I have no knowledge of the proper underground gay scene. The closest I get is working with a gay man at work, and enjoying watching Will & Grace. Like the brilliant 8 Mile this film was an introduction to a world I knew nothing about. The depiction of the activities in the Gay Club left nothing to the imagination. Never shown but implied were scenes of fisting and watersports. This, as well the very graphic violence meant this film was still quite close to the bone (no pun intended!) in 2003 so I could barely imagine what an impact this had in 1980's America.The police are now on the case, but more gay men start turning up brutally stabbed. A Harvard professor has already been murdered and a Hollywood stylist gets brutally stabbed in a cheap peep joint when he had been picking up a stars dress for an awards ceremony. These are respectable people who were not known to be involved in this extreme scene, so the political pressure gets turned up.In comes Al to the proceedings. He wants to be a detective but hasn't been given his chance yet. He is offered accelerated promotion to Detective branch if he agrees to go undercover as he is the same type of Italian Stallion that the perp seems to target. What comes next is a wonderful example of both acting and directing as young, naive, straight Al Pacino starts his undercover role. Reporting only to his chief (Paul Sorvino) and getting set up in a flat in a gay area of New York, it is riveting stuff to see Al Pacino learn from his mistakes when he visits the gay club. He learns that different coloured neckscarfes worn in either the left back pocket, or the right back pocket mean a different sexual taste! It is funny in a black comedy way watching him try to pick some one up to see if they are the killer, when it is quite clear he doesn't want to pick them up because he is not gay.Al has a girlfriend played by Karen Allen who only knows he is undercover but she doesn't know where or what he is doing. Al's character starts to go deepcover and begins to lose himself in the culture. He starts to empathise with the gay community and even gets hassled by prejudice cops. This is brilliantly handled by the director and the actor. A sympathetic approach to hardcore homosexuality in 1980? No wonder it disappeared.Meanwhile the killer is still on the loose. You see Chains picking people up in parks and by toilets or you see him visiting the bar. You can never see him properly. You can only hear the distinctive clink of his chains. This started to make me apprehensive whenever I heard the rattle of his chains. Now that's good direction!Al Pacino starts to lose himself as he goes deepcover but starts making progress on the case. I wont give away anymore in case someone watches it.I found this movie to be a really rewarding experience. It reminded me why I love movies in the first place. It is not an easy movie to watch and its subject matter is made to make you squirm, but this movie really got to me! To watch all the way through when all I was doing was channel flicking is a real test of a movies quality in my humble opinion.So there you go. Not a new movie but a bloody good one that most people may have missed. IMDb has not been too kind to it but hey, what do I know?

This is not only an eye-popping cinematic treat, but one of the greatest stories ever put on celluloid. The movie lasts nearly four hours--- it's longer than any other mainstream commercially successful film ever made. But the time goes by so quickly that you'll miss it when it's over.Of course, we all know that this movie is set in the days of the Civil War in the 1860s. It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a plantation owner's daughter who is very beautiful and who seemingly MUST have her own way at all times. She's willing to scheme and manipulate everyone in her path until she gets it. When the movie opens, the country is on the verge of civil war--- North against South--- but Scarlett barely notices, and doesn't care in the least. Her biggest obsession is that she's in love with dreamy\/poetic Ashley Wilkes, and she stays in love with him throughout 98 percent of the movie. The only problem is....Ashley doesn't have any particular interest in her at all. In fact, he spends most of the movie being married to gentle Melanie Hamilton--- a fact that frustrates Scarlett to no end. Ashley remains the one object of her desire that she is never to obtain.She would have been better off pining after Rhett Butler, a much more solid, rather dangerous man with a reputation as a no-good scoundrel. He is openly attracted to Scarlett, grows to love her (although he dare not let her know, or she'll use it against him), and it's obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley. Very late in the movie, he finally does marry Scarlett. But it's probably too late for them to be happy by then, ironically--- and they never really are happy together.The complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley, and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. But there are dozens, if not hundreds, of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie. The Civil War backdrop for one, the colorful supporting roles for another. A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish, one-dimensional manipulative shrew. But she's far more than that! This is a complex, multi-dimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives. Yes, she's selfish and manipulative. But she's also selfless the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family, and Melanie (keeping in mind that, other than her father, she doesn't even particularly like any of them) are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done, and she's fiercely courageous. Despite her hardness, she does also grow as a person. To her great credit, she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie, she does finally realize how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there.Some quick high points, and a few flaws the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard, and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular--- wise, funny, respected Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and wistful, decent-at-heart prostitute Belle Watling (Ona Munson) are standouts.The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droppingly beautiful.Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-lifes as poor white trash, and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.A few minor flaws, and I do mean minor 1) Most of the acting looks pretty modern, but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little old-style. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's method acting in the 1930s. 2) Some of the raw scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks, she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It *was* big-time Hollywood after all. 3) The second half of the movie is more talky and less action-oriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring, just less movement. I don't find it draggy, but some people do. Still a heck of a good story, and a great film, so enjoy the ride!

But she's also selfless the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family, and Melanie (keeping in mind that, other than her father, she doesn't even particularly like any of them) are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done, and she's fiercely courageous. Despite her hardness, she does also grow as a person. To her great credit, she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie, she does finally realize how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there.Some quick high points, and a few flaws the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard, and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular--- wise, funny, respected Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and wistful, decent-at-heart prostitute Belle Watling (Ona Munson) are standouts.The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droppingly beautiful.Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-lifes as poor white trash, and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.A few minor flaws, and I do mean minor 1) Most of the acting looks pretty modern, but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little old-style. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's method acting in the 1930s. 2) Some of the raw scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks, she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It *was* big-time Hollywood after all. 3) The second half of the movie is more talky and less action-oriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring, just less movement. I don't find it draggy, but some people do. Still a heck of a good story, and a great film, so enjoy the ride!

Swan has developed a macabre but harmless game called The Dead Pool, in which he drew up a list of local celebrities whom he believed would all die in nasty seemingly accidental ways. These include his harshest film critic Molly Fisher (Ronnie Claire-Edwards), drug addict rockstar Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey) and Inspector Callahan himself. The demented film buff proceeds to murder the people on the list one by one in horrific ways which correspond to Swan's movies. Callahan finds himself not only tracking down this crased psychotic, but also has to contend with various attempts on his life organised by a disgruntled crime boss whom Callahan put away and a new colleague, a Chinese American karate expert called Inspector Al Quan (Evan C Kim).THE DEAD POOL is Eastwood's fifth and final incarnation as Dirty Harry to date. The series always reworked the seemingly routine premise of Callahan's unorthodox approach to police work, his dislike of workplace politics and his relationships with work colleagues. However, these are essential characteristics to the series no matter how much our film critics moan about them. A bit like how much the same old smutty seaside postcard humour is valuable to the Carry On films. If the filmmakers abandoned them they would lose out at the box office. THE DEAD POOL in itself has all the characteristics of it's predecessors and the action is plentiful and Eastwood is superb as always in one of his most famous roles. One of the best set-pieces involves a car chase through the streets of San Francisco with Callahan and Quan being chased by no other than a radio control car, only this is more than a harmless kid's toy, it's a bomb! The film is also memorable for featuring future stars Liam Neeson (who is excellent as the arrogant filmmaker) and Jim Carrey as the ill-fated rockstar before he went into making those overblown comedies like DUMB AND DUMBER.

I don't believe I've ever experienced a film digging its own grave before the first image or title appeared on-screen... why, I ask you, would a movie that is labeled a thriller start the opening credits with a song that only young teenagers(and mostly girls) could possibly enjoy?

Well, believe it or not, it goes downhill from there... the pacing is horrendous. I don't think I watched for more than three minutes at a time during any point in the movie, before doing something more valuable with my time. The acting is really bad, only Helen Mirren gives a good performance. The characters are poorly written and clichéd.

The film really didn't have too many positive points... the attempts at humor are tame and inspire boredom rather than laughter.

Ripley's gift to the aliens actually takes away everything that makes the creatures such formidable killers, completely destroys the virus analogy and - and that's my main problem with something on the big screen - the resulting creature looks absolutely ridiculous. I always feel as if the screen writer was changed for the ending and that's imho the main problem with Alien 4 - different to its predecessors it is not of consistent design.

Why do they need to make remakes, has everything already been done than?

He walks away from a car crash like nothing has happened, bullets fly around in the air, but he doesn't get hit. However, when he shoots, he almost never misses. Very nice to see, but not really close to reality if you ask me.In fact Samuel L. Jackson is probably the only reason why I'll remember this movie in a few days time. I'm sure it will not be the story or the cinematography that make this movie unforgettable.
