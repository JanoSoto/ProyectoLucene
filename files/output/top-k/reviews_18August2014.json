First of all, its not just a dance film. It has several sub-plots that deal with issues of abandonment and rejection by a parent, abuse between two dance partners who used to be married, wanting to find a real family, and defining what family really means. It has Kris Kristofferson who can do no wrong in my book, and beautiful people who feel the joy of living through dancing. When I say beautiful people, I mean folks of all ages and sizes who love life and the dance.The central love story between Ruby and Rafael is very believable. Vanessa Williams (Ruby) is a goddess on the dance floor and off and Chayanne plays Rafael- a good dancer but not quite up to her caliber. The dance contest scenes are world-class. I won't spoil the ending for you, but the film really does draw out the suspense so you are not sure what will happen, but you hope that love will prevail in the end.When I came to see the reviews on this site, I expected to see a rating of at least 7. I think that if more people saw the film and reviewed it, the score would be much higher than 5.6. If you love professional dance, beautiful people of all ages, and a great love story, see this movie.

By the end of the year, the movie grossed over $263,920,180, making it the 9th highest-grossing film of the year. After seeing The Fifth Element, I was surprised to realize that the entire story and ideas came from an teenage boy. Who's that teenage boy you might ask? It came from the film's director and writer, Luc Besson. Besson came up with the story while he was in high school. As a movie, it is more than meet the eye.The story begins with a text, saying, Egypt, 1914. Aliens called Mondoshawans come to Earth to collect a weapon that can be use to defeat a Great Evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones. Each has its classification of elements. All four stones revolved around a fifth element, which is represented in the form of a human. Before leaving Earth, the aliens promise that they will return the four stones in time to stop the Great Evil. The movie then fast forwards to the 23rd century, in the year 2263, where New York City cab driver, Korben Dallas, (Bruce Willis), is an ordinary everyday man that sort of like the kind of guy Willis played in Die Hard, sort to think. Anyway, the Great Evil appears space in the form of a giant black ball of fire. Vito Cornelius, (Ian Holm), informs the president the background history of the Great Evil. As the Mandoshawans head to Earth, another race of aliens, the bad kind, the Mangalores, who work for Zorg, (Gary Oldman), decides to shoot down the Mandoshawans' ship. Even though the stones weren't on board, there is one thing that does survive. The hand of the fifth element. Scientists then create an beautiful alien named Leeloo, (Milla Jovovich). But Leeloo escapes and finds herself falling into Dallas' cab. After a rocky start, Dallas realizes that he must protect Leeloo from danger because she is the fifth element, as we learn later on in the movie.Now, you might think that The Fifth Element is a very bad science- fiction movie, right? Well, it isn't. In fact, I really enjoyed this movie because of the film's amazing and dazzling special effects. In fact, I like to point out that this the first science-fiction movie I've seen where the future is not at all depressing or screwed up in any way. I like this kind of future. I would definitely get lost in this kind of world. The way the colors are used in the movie and the way different shapes are used is something stunning. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie had time to stop for humor because there are a number of funny moments that are in this movie. Most of them come from Chris Tucker, who plays an radio DJ, who is very very eccentric. He really generates much of the movie's funny moments. At certain times, the gears do shift once in awhile. But, it did worked. The cinematography of the movie is very good and I also admired the costume design, which was done by Jean Paul Gaultier.However, even though I'm given a lot of credit to the technical aspects of the movie and to the story, the movie does run on a little too long. Clocking in at 2 hours and 7 minutes, the movie shouldn't been edited into a more tighter time space. I would definitely cut back on some of the opening scene of the movie because I felt it did go on for a little while. But that aside, I did have a good time watching this movie. I believed in the story that Besson had to offered although the most interesting thing about his story is that it isn't like Star Wars. When I mean is that in the Star Wars movies, there are a lot of ideas and pieces that are burrowed from other movies. In a way, those pictures are like puzzles. However, The Fifth Element isn't like Star Wars. There isn't anything burrowed from other movies in this film, but what we have is an original idea and story that comes from an man who grew up to become an very well-detailed virtuoso. There's a lot of money that was spend on the making of this movie, but Besson sure knows how to spend it. This is one ride that you would like to take again. ★★★ 3 stars.

Sometimes I think he's quite good, other times both his performances and his movie leave something to be desired. On the other hand, I adore Renee Zellweger. She can make even a bad movie worth watching - for me, anyway. So, Zellweger was in this. It was worth watching.It was a decent movie and sometimes quite funny. Carrey's character Charlie is an officer with the Rhode Island State Police - the best law enforcement agency in the country as we're told many times. But after a marriage breakup, Charlie's life begins to fall apart. He's left with his three black sons (his wife had an affair and then dumped both Charlie and the kids) and just tries to get through life. Then he meets Irene (Zellweger) - a fugitive from justice who Charlie has to return to New York State. You see where this is going - and then comes the twist, as Charlie suddenly develops a split personality, as the arrogant Hank makes his appearance. Irene and Charlie (and Hank of course) end up on the run from corrupt cops.It's a fun movie. It's no comedic masterpiece, and it's a little too long for this type of movie (almost 2 hours), but it's quite watchable. It's also very crude at times. Charlie's three sons have an obviously favourite word (let's say it starts with mother and includes two more syllables and it occurs over and over and over.)

For my money, it is easily Kubrick's best film.Kubrick's use of a non-linear narrative structure is experimental, and possibly the first time it appears in cinema. The film's structure and the narrator are linked. The consensus is that when a preview audience reacted unfavorably to the non-linear narrative, United Artist executives wanted Kubrick to change the script. Kubrick resisted. The studio then introduced the narrator. The narrator, clearly law enforcement, removes any confusion over when a particular scene is occurring. However, my view is there is too much reassurance with having law enforcement providing context. While every character who appears in the film is corrupted, the narrator is incorruptible. Hindsight is easy, but if the narrator had been Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) instead, The Killing would have been even better.The narrator notwithstanding, every cast member and character is very memorable. Each actor really seems to be living the desperation that engulfs their character. The principal figure is Johnny Clay, the ring-leader of a gang trying to rob a racetrack. Sterling Hayden's imposing physical stature and hard-boiled delivery make him a very convincing and compelling hoodlum. (In real life, Sterling routinely disparaged both his vocation and his skill. He was his own worst critic.) Timothy Carey, a popular character actor to film buffs, is an Army-trained sniper with clenched teeth who agrees to shoot a racehorse. Jay C.

She plots to have her lover (Vince Edwards as Val Cannon) steal the recovered loot from Johnny's gang. Marie Windsor's Sherry is a uniquely alluring and treacherous femme fatale. Meanwhile, Elisha Cook deserves a lot of credit for his brave portrayal of hapless George Peatty. It takes courage to play a role that invites unsophisticated viewers to believe you are a similar loser in real life.There are two scenes with animals that might be regarded today as cruel. The first is when a galloping racehorse is brought down by a jockey. (This stunt appears to have been done safely, but I know little about horses.) The other is when a parakeet is apparently in a cage that falls to the ground. Maybe they took the parakeet out of the cage for this shot. Still, 1956 audiences had a completely different perspective of how animals should be treated in films than many people share today.It is fun to find flaws even with great films.

As a result Shanghai was considered an international city in which the major powers at the time pretty much used as they saw fit. Anyway, it's during this time that a martial arts student by the name of Chen Zhen (Bruce Lee) returns to the dojo that meant so much to him. When he arrives he finds that his beloved master has died and is in the process of being buried. After a few days of intense bereavement Chen angrily demands to know how his master died. When told the official diagnosis was pneumonia Chen immediately rejects that explanation and suspects a more sinister cause. Not long afterward some members of a nearby Japanese dojo arrive and disrespectfully taunt those who are paying a final homage to their late master. This infuriates Chen who decides to take matters into his own hands and pay a visit to the rival dojo later that night. Now, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was one of the first martial arts films shown to American audiences and it made a huge impression at the time. Even so, while it is certainly good, I don't consider it to be the best martial arts film ever made. I say this because the dubbing on the film that I watched was extremely bad. Additionally, the first fight scene between Bruce Lee and Yi Feng (as the Japanese martial arts instructor named Yoshida) was rather pathetic. Along with that the film quality wasn't exactly top-notch either. On the plus side this movie features the best martial arts expert to have ever acted on screen bar none. Likewise, with the exception of the fight scene mentioned earlier, the rest of the combat scenes were quite excellent. I especially liked the fight between Chen and Petrov (Robert Baker). I also liked the addition of Nora Miao (as Yuen Le-erh). Be that as it may I thought this was a good movie and I rate it as slightly above average.

Even so, while it is certainly good, I don't consider it to be the best martial arts film ever made. I say this because the dubbing on the film that I watched was extremely bad. Additionally, the first fight scene between Bruce Lee and Yi Feng (as the Japanese martial arts instructor named Yoshida) was rather pathetic. Along with that the film quality wasn't exactly top-notch either. On the plus side this movie features the best martial arts expert to have ever acted on screen bar none. Likewise, with the exception of the fight scene mentioned earlier, the rest of the combat scenes were quite excellent. I especially liked the fight between Chen and Petrov (Robert Baker). I also liked the addition of Nora Miao (as Yuen Le-erh). Be that as it may I thought this was a good movie and I rate it as slightly above average.

(As of 2014 at least) He has had had a few minor hits since then but there has been something missing in most of his work between then and now.
