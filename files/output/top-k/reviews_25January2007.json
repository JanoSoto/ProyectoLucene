The story starts with teenager Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), a dedicated guitar player with a wonderful girlfriend (Claudia Wells). He however has a rather unusual family with his father (Crispin Glover) being a wimp, mother (Lea Thompson) an alcoholic, and brother and sister perhaps the most weird of the lot. We also find out that Marty has a rather unusual friend, Docter Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who has been working on a time travel mechanism for the past 30 years. We are not shown Doc Brown until about 15 minutes into the film, however he is referred to as a 'real nut case who is very dangerous' by his Principle Mr Strickland who simply hates Marty's guts. We are soon shown how the device works by the Doc and Marty accidentally transports himself back to 1955 when a group of terrorists arrive to ruin both their days. Marty finds his parents are of the same age and destroys the way they are supposed to meet and suddenly it is an uphill battle from there, but with the help of the Doc who is 30 years younger, they come up with a plan that could help get Marty home (probably should've mentioned the time machine runs off plutonium).This film is a lot of fun having both humour and lots of twists and turns throughout the entire film. Superb acting by Fox who was actually 22 years old playing a 17 yrs old teenager, however most of us wouldn't notice. Terrific acting by Lloyd, Glover and Thompson who had very unusual roles. Zemeckis's directing is top quality, especially the beginning with the many clocks which *hints* this is a movie on time travel. A very family movie for people of all tastes that will always be a classic in my books. 4.5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't usually comment on movies but on this movie I'll make an exception.

This was one of SChwarzenegger's rare performances as a villain and it was played brilliantly. This film was very low-budget however with the superb performances by Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton and the classy and stylish directing by James Cameron (A enormous career booster) this film becomes an instant classic. The film opens with a glimpse at the way the world has become in the year 2029 with all of Los Angeles being a nuclear mess run by the highly sophisticated machines known as terminators. The audience is the shifted back to 1984 where both the terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) have been sent back through time. The Terminator is a bad-ass with a 'serious attitude problem' who approaches a couple of punks, beats them up and takes their clothes. Reese however finds it less easy to acquire some decent clothing, being chased by a couple of suspicious cops through an alley-way. Reese soon steals a gun off a cop and gets his clothes from a department store (with the pants being stolen by a destitute drunk). The next day, the Terminator and Reese go their separate ways, the terminator stealing several automatic weapons and looking up every Sarah Connor in the phone book, ready to do whatever it takes to kill all of them, only one being significant. Meanwhile, Reese is perfecting his gun, ready to protect the 3rd Sarah J. Connor from this terminator. After the terminator has killed the first two Connors he goes to kill the 3rd who fortunately has gone out for the evening. Sarah later realizes she is being followed by Reese and ducks into the nearest nightclub, 'tech noir' trying to blend into the crowd. Unfortunately this isn't even enough to stop the terminator and she is spotted. Reese also spots the terminator, blows him out a glass window and the two make a run for it. Non-stop action here on. This is very impressive for such a small budget, especially with some of the very impressive visual effects. Like most sci-fi films of this genre, it alludes to other works and was successfully sued by author Harlan Ellison for chunks being taken from two of his episodes of The Outer Limits in the 1960's. That however doesn't diminish this masterpiece. A notable performance by Schwarzenegger. Biehn shouldn't be forgotten either for his role as Reese with his superb acting skills and most significant character to the plot. 5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This was a film set before Arnold Schwarzenegger hit the big time, however we can see from his performance in this that it was well deserved.

Who did a gang of thugs who rule the area beat to death. Kersey gets accused of the murder when the police arrive and he sits in the cell for a while. Although the chief of police realises who he is and decides to let Kersey bring justice to this untamed part of town that they can't seem to control. So Kersey takes up residence in his late friend's apartment, befriends those living there, starts seeing the public defence attorney and goes to work to finally rid this neighbour of their out-of-control mugs.Talk about over-the-top! The first two films were searing thrillers that realistically exploited its leering material with scathing pot shots or gritty intensity. Instead this addition (which would be director Michael Winner's final outing in the series) goes for an all-out action romp that's excessively cheesy and outrageously delirious. With that on mind. Most of the fun is to be had with this particular item of the franchise. The seriously dour nature of the earlier films don't really evolve within this one, because Winner favoured more of a tongue-in-cheek style of mayhem that basically parodies (don't know if it was intentional, though) what he done before. Suspenseful thrills are replaced by bigot action looking for nothing more than a large body count. This really does let loose in the film's cracking climax, where no one is safe from the colourfully cartoonish onslaught. What can one say? It's an urban jungle out there for some&#133; but Kersey sees it as a shooting parlour. And his well equipped (carrying a Wilbur Mangum and holding onto a rocket launcher) this time to take out the trash! Sadly though, Charles Bronson is looking terribly downtrodden in the role. He might be sleepwalking it, but what he brings to the table a resourceful character that you can't help but cheer on. Even though the feeble script doesn't emotionally pull you into his compassionate plight like the previous two. The contrived story is pretty much bare bones and very stereotypically (like the multi-race living in the apartment building who finally stand up for their rights as citizens) plotted. The police really do get a touch up in their incompetence of how they do things and their lack of actions. It really does leave a sour taste in your mouth, which I'm sure that's what it was aiming to do.While, the obligatory romance sub-plot is beyond forced and only there to give Kersey more motivation when needed. An adorable Deborah Raffin plays Bronson's love interested, but with her talent she's wasted in a throwaway part. Ed Lauter trumps in with a quality performance of the cutting, hard-nosed NY detective. Gavan O'Herlihy perfectly cooks up a storm in his nasty role as Fraker the gang leader. With features like his striking hairdo and cold-stare, he managed to reek of brute fear and be sufficient in leading the chaos. Making an appearance as one of the wild punks is a young Alex Winter (who'll be best known for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). The rest of the supporting cast are reasonable. Winner's direction is durably crafted and tautly laid out in its no-bars framework to shove it in your face. Again for such a lesser sequel, Winner makes it look reasonably up to par despite it being a flawed technical production. Although it is being set in NY, it was basically shot in London. Its stays on a few locations and at times they come across as purely sets. An impressive array of camera-work is on the ball by John Stainer. Attached to the music score was Jimmy Page again. Instead of the sickening riffs presented in number 2. It's oozing with a more sweepingly funky and overpoweringly scorching rhythm.

","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2007","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Paul Kersey has returned to New York to visit an old war buddy, but finds his mate lying dead in his rundown apartment. Who did a gang of thugs who rule the area beat to death. Kersey gets accused of the murder when the police arrive and he sits in the cell for a while. Although the chief of police realises who he is and decides to let Kersey bring justice to this untamed part of town that they can't seem to control. So Kersey takes up residence in his late friend's apartment, befriends those living there, starts seeing the public defence attorney and goes to work to finally rid this neighbour of their out-of-control mugs.Talk about over-the-top! The first two films were searing thrillers that realistically exploited its leering material with scathing pot shots or gritty intensity. Instead this addition (which would be director Michael Winner's final outing in the series) goes for an all-out action romp that's excessively cheesy and outrageously delirious. With that on mind. Most of the fun is to be had with this particular item of the franchise. The seriously dour nature of the earlier films don't really evolve within this one, because Winner favoured more of a tongue-in-cheek style of mayhem that basically parodies (don't know if it was intentional, though) what he done before. Suspenseful thrills are replaced by bigot action looking for nothing more than a large body count. This really does let loose in the film's cracking climax, where no one is safe from the colourfully cartoonish onslaught. What can one say? It's an urban jungle out there for some&#133; but Kersey sees it as a shooting parlour. And his well equipped (carrying a Wilbur Mangum and holding onto a rocket launcher) this time to take out the trash! Sadly though, Charles Bronson is looking terribly downtrodden in the role. He might be sleepwalking it, but what he brings to the table a resourceful character that you can't help but cheer on. Even though the feeble script doesn't emotionally pull you into his compassionate plight like the previous two. The contrived story is pretty much bare bones and very stereotypically (like the multi-race living in the apartment building who finally stand up for their rights as citizens) plotted. The police really do get a touch up in their incompetence of how they do things and their lack of actions. It really does leave a sour taste in your mouth, which I'm sure that's what it was aiming to do.While, the obligatory romance sub-plot is beyond forced and only there to give Kersey more motivation when needed. An adorable Deborah Raffin plays Bronson's love interested, but with her talent she's wasted in a throwaway part. Ed Lauter trumps in with a quality performance of the cutting, hard-nosed NY detective. Gavan O'Herlihy perfectly cooks up a storm in his nasty role as Fraker the gang leader. With features like his striking hairdo and cold-stare, he managed to reek of brute fear and be sufficient in leading the chaos. Making an appearance as one of the wild punks is a young Alex Winter (who'll be best known for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). The rest of the supporting cast are reasonable. Winner's direction is durably crafted and tautly laid out in its no-bars framework to shove it in your face. Again for such a lesser sequel, Winner makes it look reasonably up to par despite it being a flawed technical production. Although it is being set in NY, it was basically shot in London. Its stays on a few locations and at times they come across as purely sets. An impressive array of camera-work is on the ball by John Stainer. Attached to the music score was Jimmy Page again. Instead of the sickening riffs presented in number 2. It's oozing with a more sweepingly funky and overpoweringly scorching rhythm.

This terrible excuse for cinema makes Halloween 5 look like The Godfather, and believe me, Halloween 5 is BAD. How can anyone even consider making a Jaws movie where the shark actually targets the Brody family. I know movies can be a little far fetched, and I tend to be an open minded person, but there's a limit as to how far fetched a movie can be for me. I could understand Jaws 3 (Jaws 3D) being okay because it was the time of 3D movies. If it's a 3D movie, odds are it's not out to make history, and who cares if the plot sucks, the effects are enough to keep the crowd busy. But this movie didn't even have 3D. It had a crappy-looking shark that looks like a souped up pool toy and a plot that had more static than a kid walking across a carpet in socks in the winter time. I often say this movie is good for the elderly because some of the acting could stimulate even the most constipated old person. Michael Caine, as much as I respect him as an actor, was at his worst (probably because the movie sucked so he couldn't bring his best performance out in the first place). Mario Van Peebles...please...I've heard Asian people who've done better Jamaican accents than that. Lance Guest...not much to say...not his best performance (even though I've only seen him in Halloween II and this film). Lorraine Gary and Judith Barsi (God rest her soul) pulled it off. Judith was just as cute as could be, and I felt for her after the banana boat attack. Lorraine Gary seemed to be the only adult who actually gave a good performance. Despite this movie's haphazard and impromptu feeling, she knew what she had to do and she did it.
