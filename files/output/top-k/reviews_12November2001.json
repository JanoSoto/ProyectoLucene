I wanted to love this movie, but the most honorable characters in this movie are the boss who has to fire George, or Robin's husband, Peter (?), the proverbial materialist who is forced into sensitivity training by an unstable wife whose affections change like the wind. ...Hey, feel free to like this movie as much as you want. But if want to see a superb treatment of a related theme, just resist the temptation to see Domestic Disturbance. It wasn't much better. Instead, go see MY FIRST MISTER, with Albert Brooks and Leelee Sobieski. THAT is an Oscar-material movie. Life as a House is more of a shack, and the most redemptive remodeling is accomplished in the character of Sam. But the highlight comes at the end as the credits are about to role.

Most of them fail to function or misfire rather than work properly. The kids are Nick and Amy. Nick wants to be an inventor like his old man. Amy is an average teenage girl who loves boys and the mall. It can get noisy when Wayne works on his inventions so it irkes off neighbor Big Russ Thompson, played by good old Matt Frewer. He's got a wife and two kids. The kids include his eldest boy Little Russ Thompson who is somewhat shy and doesn't like sports, or fishing, which is unfortunate because the Thompsons are going fishing for the weekend. Big Russ wants so much for Little Russ to succeed in life, but he pushes him too hard. Other son Ron is the complete opposite of Russ.            One morning while Wayne went to give a presentation but ended up making a fool out of himself, careless Ron hit a baseball into the Szaliski's attic window, activating the shrink machine! When going upstairs to retrieve the ball, the kids were shrunk! Which was amazing because until now the machine just dissentigrated apples. Wayne thinks the machine is a bust, beats it up and scoops up the pieces- and the kids-into the trash and placed the bag in the backyard.The kids escape and realize what used to be the backyard is now a jungle!

But one thing has been distracting me since I finished the novel - the whole story is very reminiscent of Star Wars!  An orphan grows up with his aunt and uncle; he's transported to a strange world where he can develop supernatural skills inherited from his parents; makes life long friends; engages in a battle that partly avenges the death of his parents, but the source of evil lives to fight another day.  Harry is, of course, Luke; Hermione is Leia; Ron seems to encompass at turns Han Solo and C3P0; R2D2 is Harry's owl (but this is more obvious in the book); broomsticks are light sabers and Yoda is embodied by the entire faculty of Hogwarts.  That just leaves Voldemort to replace Vader, Dumbledore to step in for Obi-Wan Kenobi, and John Williams to write the score!  I'm just hoping that in future sequels we don't discover that Voldemort is really Harry's father!Well, maybe the Harry Potter Saga *does* start with re-branded Star Wars-esque mythology, but I cannot deny that I felt child-like pangs of excitement throughout the whole viewing experience.

He won for Forrest Gump and   Philadelphia and he deserved them for those. But since then, he's been spinning out   movies like Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan, Green Mile, etc.   where he's always nominated but never wins. I'll bet in his spare time,   Hanks builds shelves at his house, in hopes of one day filling them   with Oscars. Kevin Spacey does the same thing, I'll bet.    But anyway, Tom Hanks was good in this film as a child trapped in a   man's body. It starts when young Josh Baskin, (David Moscow), likes a   girl bigger than him. He wants to go on a fast ride at the amusement   park with her, but he's not BIG enough. So he trudges along until he   sees a machine called the Zoltar. He makes a wish on it, wishing he was   BIG. Next morning, he awakens, a grown man! Only problem, his mother   doesn't believe his story and takes him to be Josh's kidnapper. Josh   goes to convince his best friend, Billy, what happened. So they travel   to New York City and stay at the St. James Motel. The hotel is complete   with a bathroom in the hallway, a telephone right outside Josh's room,   and a bare room. But it's cozy and the price is right. Next morning,   Josh and Billy search for the  game. They must wait six weeks for a list of carnivals in the area, so   Josh must get a job. He loves computers and toys. So he becomes a data   processing man for McMillan Toys.    Josh visits the biggest and best toy store on earth the next day, FAO   Schwartz! He meets his boss, Mr. McMillan there and they play   Chopsticks on a huge keyboard. Fabulous key scene in the movie! Josh   is promoted to VP! This angers another executive, Paul, who's played by   John Heard. He know him as Peter McCallister from Home Alone 1 and 2.   Paul's girl friend, Susan, is much nicer. She takes a liking to Josh   and spends the night with him at his new townhouse apartment. It's huge   and is full of toys and a cool  trampoline!     Josh even comes up with a winning toy idea a robot that turns into a   bug. Paul takes Josh out for a game of ping pong. Josh catches Paul   cheating, and Paul denies it. I love that scene, it's so funny! Because   Paul is yelling obsinities at Josh while trying to grab the ball from   him. I laugh my head off every time I watch that!!    Josh adapts to adult life and soon forgets about being a kid.    Billy even questions their friendship but Josh knows what he must do.   He finds the Zoltar machine and wishes to be a kid again. So he bids a   farewell to Susan and trudges back home as a kid in adult clothes.    This movie was good. What it needs though is a back story. Like, more   about the Zoltar machine and why it really grants wishes. Is a magical   spirit trapped within the game? A spirit from the 12th century or   something? Maybe a witch. A back story might be good. Good movie from   start to finish! Tom Hanks and David Moscow were good as Josh. Jared   Rushton ( was also in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) is good  as Billy.

I wasn't expecting another Beauty, but something awfully close to it.  What I watched wasn't very close at all.  I still don't understand why it was compared to the 1999 Best Picture, other than maybe to get people like myself out to go see the film )All in all, though, I thought it was a rather delightful film.  Hayden Christenson was good, as was Kevin Kline.  The story was quite moving, yet sadly it was rather predictable.  I'm not going to give away any crucial plot details or anything, but you could just tell where the story was going to go.  But as I said, it's definetly worth seeing, especially when it's up against films like Shallow Hal.

Turns out, Kevin Smith and crew have done a good parody of a bunch of flicks -- and those flicks run from Blazing Saddles to Charlie's Angels to, as many have pointed out, Smith's own oeuvre.  The movie actually gets better as it progresses and many of the cameos are hilarious in and of themselves...but wasn't thrilled with the acting from Affleck, Damon, or Lee -- whose acting seem stilted and too self-conscious (maybe they didn't read the script ahead of time either) -- charges I can't level at Mewes or Smith.  I wasn't offended by the anti-gay parody\/slurs, though I do wonder what Kevin Smith was thinking as he wrote this stuff.  I mean, this material is getting a bit tired but it worked 90% of the time in this film. In summary  Lots better than expected and even better if you're familiar with Kevin Smith's other films, esp. Chasing Amy and Clerks.
