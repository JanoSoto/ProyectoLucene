Ever since his debut in 1980 with the highly successful Ordinary People, Redford has demonstrated a natural talent at directing actors, as well as a good eye when choosing collaborators for his projects; two important skills that have earned him awards and recognition through the years. In his fifth film as a director, 1998's The Horse Whisperer, Redford not only directs, but for the first time in his directorial career, he also plays one of the main characters in his movie. In The Horse Whisperer Redford is once again back in his element, as this is also the story of a troubled family, however, small problems arise that sadly diminish the power of the film.Loosely based on Nick Evans's novel of the same name, The Horse Whisperer is the story of Annie MacLean (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her daughter Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson), who travel to Montana looking for the famous horse healer Tom Booker (Robert Redford), in order to ask him to cure their horse Pilgrim. The problem is that on a cold winter day, Grace and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) were riding their horses when a terrible accident happened a truck hit them, instantly killing Judith, and tragically hurting Grace and Pilgrim. Both horribly injured, horse and rider are taken to the Horse Whisperer hoping to recover not only their health, but also the will to live. Not only Grace and Pilgrim will try to find peace in the West, but Annie too will discover a new way of seeing life under the care of the Horse Whisperer.Written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese, The Horse Whisperer looks at first sight as another typical movie about a person's recovery after a traumatic event (in this case Grace's losing a leg and her best friend), however, more than dealing with the physical and psychological healing of the horse and it's rider, the movie deals with the emotional problems of a group of souls. The screenplay is not exactly faithful to the source novel, although it keeps the main story lines intact and despite the changes done the essence of the story is still well translated to screen. Some may disagree with me, but I think that the way Roth and LaGravenese build up the plot was considerably superior to Evan's book, and the toning down of the melodrama (although it's still a passionate story of romance) was for the most part beneficial for the story.An excellent director of actors, Redford lets his cast to completely domain this character driven melodrama, creating a very natural and real portrait of human emotions. As in the book, Redford makes a nice analogy between the healing of horses and the healing of emotions (of course, with the advantage of a visual medium), although in a subtler, less melodramatic tone. This is very notorious in the way he lets his actors to use body language to express themselves, using silences, stares and face expressions as ways to communicate emotions. Still, even when the movie is certainly focused on the actors and their characters, Redford allows himself to give the film an extraordinary good look with Robert Richardson's brilliant cinematography, which captures the majestic landscapes of Montana in a very impressive and beautiful way.Being a character driven story, the performances of the cast are essential for the success of the film, and in this case one could say that overall the cast did a good job in the movie. As Annie, Kristin Scott Thomas truly transmit the confusion of her character, torn between her life and the one represented by Tom Booker. As Tom, Redford is excellent, very effective in his role and completely becoming a character who expresses more with silence than with words. A young Scarlett Johansson appears as Grace, delivering a remarkable performance considering her young age. It's not a surprise that she went on to become a major actress as she grew up. In small but important roles, we find Sam Neill, Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper as the main supporting cast of the movie, all giving an excellent performance despite their limited screen time.If a movie is really well directed, has good performances and a nice script, what could be wrong about it? The answer this time is sadly so simple that it hurts it's unnecessarily long. Pointing out this as a problem may sound like nitpicking, but it's long runtime truly damages the movie as it makes the film to drag a while, becoming tedious and boring at some point. I'm not saying that movies should not be long, what I'm saying is that in this particular case the long runtime feels unnecessary and out of place. I find the way Redford slowly develops his characters a notable feature of the movie, given that he allows us to really known them; however, I think that a better job of edition would have improved the final results a lot.Overall, The Horse Whisperer is a very good movie on its own right, and while not being exactly faithful to the source novel, it keeps the whole spirit of the book intact. While the long runtime truly damages an otherwise good film, it's still a very good recommendation to those looking for a character driven love story without exaggerated melodrama. It seems to me that once again, Redford has made a classy film. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2007","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" While of course he'll always be remembered for his remarkable work as an actor and as the mind behind the Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redford has also slowly build up a solid reputation as a very good director despite his somewhat limited output (only 6 films in 20 years).

This movie I do believe is effective because its somewhat limited use of the funniest character, Beetle Juice...this just makes his scenes even more funny and over the top. Not that it is bad when he is not in it, it still has some funny stuff such as the dinner scene and the waiting room scene. Still, when Beetle Juice is in it, the comedy ramps up a couple of notches.

Like so many other Japanese films before it, Tampopo may not entirely appeal to the western public, but it is by far the most accessible movie I've seen in years. It is hard to define this film as anything but a story of life through culinary perspective. Major aspects of our every day experience are looked at by introducing food into them, sometimes resulting in a very comical effect. From the first scene, to the last few moments, you will probably be amazed by sheer originality of this movie. Simply coming up with ideas they came up with takes a unique and incredibly approach. Something that has never been done before.In a sense, I can only compare Tampopo's approach at making us 'taste' what we see with a 2006 film Perfume which managed to describe olfactory experiences with as much success. But unlike Perfume, Tampopo also juggles around few other interesting movie genres just for the fun of it. If you watch carefully, you will begin to see western elements, gangster movie and even a police crime, all in one movie. They might not seem connected at first, but they will make sense in due time.Overall however the side stories are only there to keep us interested in the main event.

It has held up very well; it is still a good movie. All of the criticisms about it in comments have been well-founded. It is slow-paced and even-paced. That is both good and bad. There was a preview for 'Gone in 60 Seconds' on the video tape that showed a frantic-paced movie that probably did better at the box office but I will bet was not as well written or as well-acted (Angelina Jolie is in 'Gone...', need I say more about the acting quality?) Pace may get your adrenaline flowing while your sitting in your seat but it doesn't do anything for your brain cells. Mumford engages you intellectually.It is challenging to the viewer to believe that a billionaire computer mogul - skateboarder can practically own a town and move about as freely and anonymously as he does in this movie. Jason Lee is just the person to have that role, though. He portrays the eternal adolescent in a lot of movies (it would be difficult to watch him play an assassin or a pederast; he picks the roles that he can handle and as a reward, he now anchors a very successful sitcom).The pace and some credibility issues aside, this movie is a pleasure to watch. Everything about the movie shares a harmony with its subject which is basically psychology. I read somewhere that Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) on the Sopranos was recommended to psychiatrists-in-training as the model for a focused listener, which is what a shrink is. Mickey Mumford (Loren Dean) is right up there with her as an exemplary professional when it comes to listening. In contrast, Dr. Melfi is even a little too tense and rigid (in keeping with her character, to Lorraine Bracco's credit as a fine actress). Mumford is simultaneously relaxed and alert; really, I could watch him sit still forever and be endlessly fascinated by the blink of his eyes (there is a scene where he acknowledges the sexiness of his young patient Nessa with the faintest of smiles and a slow blink; an absolutely stunning expression with almost no movement in his body language). I think I developed quite a crush on Loren Dean just watching him sit across from his patients. Because the character Mumford is so brilliant, he can be forgiven his few lapses in professionalism. When we first see Mary McDowell come into his office, he has just told Martin Short to leave his office and never come back. He is calm about it but he insists that he doesn't want to see him in his office again and Mary McDowell is witness to that speech. As he brings her into the office, he comments about Martin Short, 'Jeez, what an asshole!' and Mary McDowell laughs delightedly as we watch her back while she heads towards the couch. When he discusses his patients' problems with Jason Lee, making Lee feel uncomfortable, you sense that he's sharing his patients' dilemmas sympathetically, not revealing their weaknesses. If others don't see it that way, it is not his concern; he relates to people on a plane that doesn't share space with legal, professional ethics.Which is all the more surprising when you find out later in the movie about his background story.Every character (with Lily being the only possible exception) has a psychological profile that fits the story's needs and rings true. The underlying message might be, 'Everyone has problems; even your shrink has problems!' The movie never veers from that message. The feel-good addendum to that is 'And by sharing and exploring your problems, you can have a better life.' That is true about every single character.The way that Loren Dean sits in a chair, the way he listens, the intense but relaxed attitude he has while absorbing all the details of his clients - is inspiring. He has feelings, you never lose track of that fact, evidenced by his choice to suddenly shout at a patient when he thinks the patient's self-deception is so egregious that someone SHOULD shout at him.Lawrence Kasdan made a wonderful little film; much much better than any of his others (Grand Canyon and The Big Chill aren't half as nice).

It has been years since the last viewing. It has held up very well; it is still a good movie. All of the criticisms about it in comments have been well-founded. It is slow-paced and even-paced. That is both good and bad. There was a preview for 'Gone in 60 Seconds' on the video tape that showed a frantic-paced movie that probably did better at the box office but I will bet was not as well written or as well-acted (Angelina Jolie is in 'Gone...', need I say more about the acting quality?) Pace may get your adrenaline flowing while your sitting in your seat but it doesn't do anything for your brain cells. Mumford engages you intellectually.It is challenging to the viewer to believe that a billionaire computer mogul - skateboarder can practically own a town and move about as freely and anonymously as he does in this movie. Jason Lee is just the person to have that role, though. He portrays the eternal adolescent in a lot of movies (it would be difficult to watch him play an assassin or a pederast; he picks the roles that he can handle and as a reward, he now anchors a very successful sitcom).The pace and some credibility issues aside, this movie is a pleasure to watch. Everything about the movie shares a harmony with its subject which is basically psychology. I read somewhere that Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) on the Sopranos was recommended to psychiatrists-in-training as the model for a focused listener, which is what a shrink is. Mickey Mumford (Loren Dean) is right up there with her as an exemplary professional when it comes to listening. In contrast, Dr. Melfi is even a little too tense and rigid (in keeping with her character, to Lorraine Bracco's credit as a fine actress). Mumford is simultaneously relaxed and alert; really, I could watch him sit still forever and be endlessly fascinated by the blink of his eyes (there is a scene where he acknowledges the sexiness of his young patient Nessa with the faintest of smiles and a slow blink; an absolutely stunning expression with almost no movement in his body language). I think I developed quite a crush on Loren Dean just watching him sit across from his patients. Because the character Mumford is so brilliant, he can be forgiven his few lapses in professionalism. When we first see Mary McDowell come into his office, he has just told Martin Short to leave his office and never come back. He is calm about it but he insists that he doesn't want to see him in his office again and Mary McDowell is witness to that speech. As he brings her into the office, he comments about Martin Short, 'Jeez, what an asshole!' and Mary McDowell laughs delightedly as we watch her back while she heads towards the couch. When he discusses his patients' problems with Jason Lee, making Lee feel uncomfortable, you sense that he's sharing his patients' dilemmas sympathetically, not revealing their weaknesses. If others don't see it that way, it is not his concern; he relates to people on a plane that doesn't share space with legal, professional ethics.Which is all the more surprising when you find out later in the movie about his background story.Every character (with Lily being the only possible exception) has a psychological profile that fits the story's needs and rings true.

I found it to be a very enjoyable light comedy with touches of romance that aren't too heavy to get in the way of the essentially fish out of water nature of the comedy.The plot is pretty basic but unusual -- a 1960s scientist (Walken) in the grip of nuclear paranoia builds a futuristic fallout shelter beneath his home equipped with supplies for the 30 years he calculates will be necessary to dispel the fallout. When an airplane crashes in his back yard, he mistakes it for a nuke attack and brings his wife (Sissy Spacek) and infant son Adam (Brendan Fraser) into the shelter where they wait out the decades while educating their son to the fullest. When he emerges from the shelter to seek supplies, Adam finds the world very different than he would expect, but he and his father believe that the people have been damaged by radiation. Nevertheless he has time to fall in love with a feisty 90s girl appropriately named Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and make a gay friend (Dave Foley).The situational comedy created by Adam's strange combination of naiveté and education create some true laugh-out-loud moments. The film is careful not to get too heavy in tone, even when navigating the troubled waters of romance and action\/chase scenes. It had that kind of balanced flavor, plus the loose sci-fi elements that made it interesting, which reminded me of the Back to the Future films.The performances are solid -- Spacek and Walken are suitably weird and yet believable as 60s era adults who have been caught in a state of arrested development for decades. Fraser really packs a lot of charm in his performance, as usual. I still don't really understand why this guy's career has seemed to fade away so much. Silverstone was never that great, but this is one of her more appealing performances. And Foley was really unusual in the film, I really enjoyed his work here which was funny and human.One of the only romantic comedies from the late 90s that I would want to see again.

His shipmates looked highly upon him, even though many had been forced to join the long voyage. He was sympathetic with the crew's plight and often times tried his best to protect them from the many vast punishments. When Christian is fully fed up with the majorly unfair antics of Bligh and his mission, he finally decides to take command the Bounty. Christian, once he is in command, never looks back and takes his followers back to paradise on an unknown and uncharted island to live the rest of his days.Captain Bligh is a military man to the bone who demands respect from all, and achieves it through his rough tactics, stern discipline and often times uncaring ways. He leads his ship with the Navy War Rules Book in one hand and a whip in the other. His actions can most certainly be deemed unfair, unjust and most of all harsh. Bligh feels that fear in one's Captain is the only way to lead and earn respect. In a way he almost seems to relish finding ways to push a man's buttons so he can then take out his Navy Rules War Book and give reason for punishment. His sole reason of mission first, duty second no matter the cost to ones health or life leads to the eventual infamous mutiny.Unlike the other 2 Bounty films whose Capt. Bligh's at times came across as too sympathetic; Charles Laughton's portrayal of Capt. Bligh came off more aggressive, uncaring and unlikeable. It was easy to hate him and cheer his eventual downfall.

Part of this evolution is the realization that not all is as it seems in the reality in which he lives in. If your any way philosophical or just like a good sci-fi you cannot go wrong with the matrix. There's a strong religious sub text apparent within the story and a lot of Neo's actions and decisions seem to mirror that of Christ. It can also be looked at as an allegory of modern day society and the control governments have over their citizens. Whatever way you look at the matrix it will make you think below the surface of the pretty visuals and the dynamic actions scenes. These range from martial arts face offs against agents to post apocalyptic worlds inhabited and controlled by strange machine like creatures. The Matrix has a visual style like no other and it deserves its spot in the top 250 films just for the story alone.Keenu Reeves was born for this role and delivers a very subtle but effective portrayal of of Neo while Hugo weaving seems like he was having fun playing the bad guy Agent Smith, Neo's nemesis. The score is high tempo filled with modern dance and electro tracks. They fit perfectly and come alive during the adrenaline filled fight scenes. This is one film you really shouldn't miss. I've seen it at least ten times and each time i discover something that i missed the first time.

Not so much because you are jaded, you are happy to cut a lot of slack for the hokey sci-fi stuff from the 50's and 60's, it's just that this transitional stuff leaves you wishing that they had waited a few years before cranking this out. To me the Donner cut vs the Lester release issue is irrelevant because Superman II was never about the script, the acting, or the editing. It was all about production design and effects. In those two areas it was a super-ambitious effort, which paid off with 1980 audiences and critics. While it's a shame that Donner's vision was not the one released to theaters, today's viewers should prefer the Lester release simply because its greater emphasis on parody elements make it a much better fit with the dated production design and effects. That said, there are some script issues that made no more sense in 1980 than they do today. The three Krypton outlaws (Terrance Stamp, Jack O'Halloran, and Sarah Douglas are still the film's most compelling element) have acquired some weird ability to levitate objects that I don't recall ever being part of the Superman's abilities. This is unnecessary and simply calls attention to screenwriter Mario Puzo's ignorance or indifference to tradition (insert disrespect here). He compounds this with a totally unconvincing Lois Lane-Superman romance more serious than the combined 60 years of comic book teasing on the subject. Finally, it is presumed that on Krypton no one had super-powers, yet within hours of acquiring these abilities the three outlaws appear baffled that everyone in the universe does not share their abilities.

Not so much because you are jaded, you are happy to cut a lot of slack for the hokey sci-fi stuff from the 50's and 60's, it's just that this transitional stuff leaves you wishing that they had waited a few years before cranking this out. To me the Donner cut vs the Lester release issue is irrelevant because Superman II was never about the script, the acting, or the editing. It was all about production design and effects. In those two areas it was a super-ambitious effort, which paid off with 1980 audiences and critics. While it's a shame that Donner's vision was not the one released to theaters, today's viewers should prefer the Lester release simply because its greater emphasis on parody elements make it a much better fit with the dated production design and effects. That said, there are some script issues that made no more sense in 1980 than they do today. The three Krypton outlaws (Terrance Stamp, Jack O'Halloran, and Sarah Douglas are still the film's most compelling element) have acquired some weird ability to levitate objects that I don't recall ever being part of the Superman's abilities. This is unnecessary and simply calls attention to screenwriter Mario Puzo's ignorance or indifference to tradition (insert disrespect here). He compounds this with a totally unconvincing Lois Lane-Superman romance more serious than the combined 60 years of comic book teasing on the subject. Finally, it is presumed that on Krypton no one had super-powers, yet within hours of acquiring these abilities the three outlaws appear baffled that everyone in the universe does not share their abilities. Acting-wise only the villains look to be having any fun with this thing, and it could use more of Ned Beatty. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Unlike some incredibly overlong and overrated films (such as THE LAST EMPEROR and THE English PATIENT), the people responsible for HIGH NOON managed to create a great work of art in only 85 minutes! Now I am not saying this is the best Western ever made--I can think of a select few that I actually think are a tiny bit better--but only by a hair's breadth. I do prefer my favorite short Western still is THE OX-BOW INCIDENT and the long but very satisfying BIG COUNTRY is an amazing and under-appreciated film that might also be better. However, what makes all three films so great is that they provide wonderful sociological lessons that are timeless and transcend the genre. The OX-BOW INCIDENT confronts mob mentality, THE BIG COUNTRY addresses what it's like to be a REAL man (not a cartoon cowboy) and HIGH NOON combines BOTH plots from these other two films. An exceptionally well-written film with great, great acting and insight into human frailty. About the only negative for me was the ever-present theme sung by Tex Ritter. After a while, it did get on my nerves just a bit!!! A great American film--not to be missed.
