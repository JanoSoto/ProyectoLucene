[{"date":"26 October 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore is my second favorite comedy of all time, and is extremely funny. Max Vischer, as a character and an idea, is incredible. A boy who is extremely active in every extra-curricular activity (other than serious sports) that a school could offer, including many that he himself founded. He loves attending Rushmore Academy, though he is flunking out of school. He is a genius, but socially tactless and extremely quirky.I am somewhat glad that not everyone can appreciate this style of humor. Wes Anderson's movies, to me, are magic. The style is ridiculous and bizarre, yet holds together themes and real, flaw-filled characters. His films are hilarious and warm.So, if you like smart-yet-crazy-funny movies (aka Chris Guest films, Napoleon Dynamite, etc.), this film is a must-see. If you saw Terminator 3 in the theater, this probably won't be your bag.This movie is amazing and magical.
