Midichlorians?  Jar Jar?  Immaculate Conception of Anakin?  Preposterous?While some people may find these things, as well as other minor things unacceptable in the Star Wars Universe, I beg to differ.Let me address some issues the best I can and tell TPM hatemongers why I think they ARE in fact acceptable in the Star Wars universe.1) Jar Jar Binks - Every Episode I review has something about Jar Jar in it, so here's my two sense(pun intended).  Basically, people found Jar Jar to be annoying, stupid, a terrible addition to the Star Wars saga, etc.  I agree that he's annoying and stupid, but not a terrible addition.Like I just said, I agree that he's annoying and stupid.  But he's supposed to be.  Haven't YOU met anyone like Jar Jar before?  I certainly have. The personality of Jar Jar resides in most kids that I know.  Kids can ALSO be annoying, stupid, clumsy, and get into trouble a lot.  They're just like Jar Jar.  But do we hate kids?  Nope.  We punish them for their actions sometimes, but we all get over it and love them for who they are.So so wonder kids can relate to him!  Out of all of my kid cousins that live locally, they all liked Jar Jar.  It's because they can relate.  Jar Jar was supposed to have a child-like innocence to him.  If you didn't catch that, watch the movie again.However, most people who are between the ages of 13 and 25 usually don't relate to him.  I don't relate to him either.  But yet, they like C-3P0. This has always puzzled me.  But I think I've come to a sensible conclusion.Let's think about this a bit.  3P0 is annoying too.  What about all those stupid statistics that he gave them, making the situations they were in much less hopeful.  This makes everyone unhappy and annoyed with him.  Or what about the time he wandered away from the group, and got shot?!  Chewy had to repair him and carry him around on his back for half of the movie!  Such an annoying inconvenience!  And he was always whining about something.  Now why don't people get annoyed by him?  It's simply because they grew up with him, and he's apart of what started it all.  He's nostalgic.  Most people who complain about Jar Jar are the people who saw the trilogy as a kid. Guess what?  When kids see 3P0, they see a cool robot.  However, later on they see a whiny, annoying inconvenience.  And yet, they still like him. Why?  It's because he's apart of their treasured childhood.  He's something they liked as a kid, and therefore they continue to like him, even though they realize the way he is.There's nothing wrong with this, it's just that these people don't realze that just as the kids of yesterday that grew up with 3P0 still like him despite his annoying antics, the kids of today that grow up liking Jar Jar will do the same thing for him.Lastly, Jar Jar served more of a purpose to this movie than 3P0 did to any of the movies.  All 3P0 did was alert the gang of the Stormtroopers' presence(which was only because Chewy was in the process of repairing him when this blurb spirted out), and get the Ewoks to side with the good guys. Other then these two things, he did nothing but get in the way.  Gee, doesn't this sound a lot like Jar Jar?Now, did Jar Jar not help the two separte societies on Naboo unite?  Of course he did.  Did he not become General of the Gungan army?  Of course he did.  So what if he's clumsy, annoying, and is always getting into trouble? These actions only help display why no one in the movie likes him, and why he was banished from Otoh Gunga(the underwater city).  I mean, why would a society banish someone because they were clumsy?  Because of all his stupid antics, I understood why.So what's the big deal?  Jar Jar is just like little kids.  Jar Jar is annoying like 3P0.  It's just that the kids of yesterday still like 3P0 today because they grew up with him.  He's nostalgic.  Without R2-D2, 3P0 is nothing.  However, Jar Jar was able to unite two societies without the help of a cool sidekick, and despite his clumsiness.  I'd say this, as well as the fact that he's just like little kids, makes him someone we should accept and respect.  Treat Jar Jar just as you would a kid, and things will take a turn for the better.  Treat Jar Jar as you would 3P0 and the same will happen.2) Midi-chlorians - What's the big deal?  They take away from the mysticism of the force?  I think not.  They only emphasize the mysticism.  They are sentient beings that reside within us.  WITHIN our cells.  Now this may sound scientific, and it may very well be.  But guess what?  The midi-chlorians create life.  Life cannot exist without them.  They are not the force.  They don't create the force.  We are only symbionts with them, lifeforms living together for mutual advantage.  They only tell us the will of the force.So what if they work together with the force?  The force is still the same mystical entity that we've all come to know and love.  It's just that now we know where life comes from - at least this is what the Jedi believe at this moment in time.  They have yet to explain why the midi-chlorians aren't mentioned in the original trilogy.  Perhaps because trying to explain their faith with science made it no longer a faith.  Maybe trying to define their religion with science is what aided in bringing about their ultimate demise. There faith could've in fact be weakened because of their scientific reasoning.  Who knows?  The next two episodes have yet to elaborate on this, and so we don't fully know the story behind the midi-chlorians.3)  The immaculate conception - Ok, a lot of people were bothered by this. While I will agree that this is somewhat of a poor explanation of why Anakin is so powerful with the force, I don't think that it's a bad idea.  We saw that when Anakin destroyed the Neimoidian ship, it looked like an accident. When in fact, this was the will of the force that he blew it up.  The force used him(I'll get back to this later).  So it could be that because he's the chosen one, things work out to his advantage because he obviously has to bring balance to the force eventually(by doing away with Emperor Palpatine in ROTJ).  So up until that time, he has to stay alive.  And since the force is seeking balance, it's going to keep its chosen one alive.  This means that most everything will work to his advantage.  So it could be that he'll realize this, developing a big ego trip that aids in his turn to the dark side.  This won't be the only reason he turns, but it could definitely have something to do with it.Also, people think that because the force used him, rather than him using the force, made it less dramatic.  I agree that it's less dramatic.  But it's also an important element of how Luke goes the other way and he uses the force.  It's something that his dad(Anakin) didn't have enough experience in.  His dad just assumed that the force would work to his advantage, therefore not concentrating enough on using the force.  Luke redeems what his father should have redeemed.  This only helps explain even better why Anakin turns to the dark side.  Plus, Anakin wouldn't know where the Neimoidians main reactor was to begin with.So I don't think him being immaculately concieved is a bad idea.  Many people in today's society, as well as societies long before us, believed that Jesus was immaculately conceived.  So if people can accept His conception as reality, why can't people accept Anakin's conception in a make-believe universe?4) The will of the force - Ok, people are asking, What the heck is up with this will of the force thing?  Let me tell you.Here's what I think.  I think that the will of the force is ultimately good. It's seeking balance, right?  Balance is good.  Therefore the will of the force is good.But then, there's the dark side.  So if there are two sides to the force, how can it have one will?  It's because it's like the yin and the yang. It's an entity that's seeking balance, therefore it has one will. So why does the force allow the dark side to take over?  Both sides are very powerful, but it's still seeking balance.  It's for the same reason why God allows bad things to happen to good people.  We don't quite know the answer, but Christians trust that it's God's will that it happened so that eventually things work out for the better in His eyes.  One cannot fully comprehend something that's beyond our comprehension, like God for instance. So the same goes for the force.  Don't try to fully comprehend something like this.  That's ludicrous.So basically, I think that in the time of TPM, the force IS balanced.  The good side and the dark side are both equally doing the same thing - coexisting.  But then, the sith emerge, Palpatine becomes emperor and creates his evil empire, and the Jedi are pretty much eliminated.  But then, by the end of ROTJ, Vader brings an end to the Emperor, turns back to the good side, and the empire is destroyed, bringing balance back to the force.5)  How you become a Jedi - So we see from The Phantom Menace that the way you become a Jedi is if you have a high midi-chlorian count.  People complain and complain about this, and yet it's totally plausible that this is really the only efficient way to have very young kids train to become Jedi.Let's play a little make-believe game.  Imagine a kid of let's say 5 years old going up to his\/her mom and asking, Mommy, can I go off to the Jedi temple on Coruscant and train to become a Jedi?  Do you really think that a parent would just let their kid leave the house at the age of 5 to train to become a Jedi Knight?  Do you really think that a 5 year old kid is going to be able to make an intellegent decision about the rest of his\/her life?  I don't think so.  But because of the midi-chlorians, Jedi can identify the kids as jedi-potentials, and the kids' parents wouldn't question it. They'll accept it as destiny.I know I know, George Lucas didn't have to write the story this way.  But we already know that even Luke was too old at his age in the trilogy to train as a Jedi.  So if HE was too old, then before TPM cam out, we can conclude that you still had to be pretty young to train.  So if you had to be younger than Luke was(Luke wasn't old at all), then we can feel safe to conclude that one even as young as around 16 or 17 can't make such an important decision about his\/her life intellegently.  So the midi-chlorians make sense.But then this indicates genetic superiority like the arian race.  No it doesn't.  Think about it.  What is genetics?  It deals with DNA.  The midi-chlorians create DNA(they create life), but are not the DNA itself. So yes, it's superiority, but not genetic superiority.  And the people of this galaxy far, far away accept this as inevitable.  Only the people who are born to become Jedi are perhaps the only ones who really see this as something they'd want to do with their lives.It has always seemed to me that becoming a Jedi was all about destiny.  If you take a look at all the movies, you can see that it was Luke's destiny that he was to become a Jedi.  And why would Yoda say There is another. It's because he already knew that Leia was a Jedi potential, or at least someone who has the potential to be strong enough with the force to be able to bring hope to the galaxy.  How can one know this if midi-chlorians don't exist?  It has been said that the force runs strong in the family of the Skywalkers.  It can only run strong if it was the will of the force for it to make it so.  And it all started with Anakin's immaculate conception by the midi-chlorians.6) The Plot - If anyone says that the plot was boring or stupid, they are only stupid themselves.  If one doesn't realize that Senator Palpatine was the main character of this movie, then TPM went completely over their heads. Darth Sidious, Darth Maul's master, is the same person as Palpatine. Senator Palpatine is really a Sith Lord.  What is going on is that Palpatine eventually becomes the Emperor and creates an evil Empire by rising up in political power.  He does so by deceit and manipulation.  And what a better way of doing this then by playing both the good side and the bad like pawns in a chess game, setting each piece where he wants in order to eventually be elected Chancellor, which in turn will enable him to backstab the Jedi and the Republic however he pleases.  He then will declare himself Emperor and develop the evil Empire that we see in full effect in the original trilogy.So why is this a dumb plot?  I think it's done well.  All along, it's Palpatine who's manipulating everything that's going on in the movie, and no one knows it.  And because of his manipulations, he becomes elected chancellor by the end of the movie.  In The Phantom Menace, the bad guy wins, and no one knows it.  I think that's awesome.  And this is a perfect set up for what's yet to come.Oh, and for that idiot who said the Trade Federation was the Phantom Menace, think again.  Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious is The Phantom Menace. Just look at all that he's done in the shadows.  He's the biggest menace of them all, with all his deceit and manipulation that went completely over peoples' heads.  And Lucasfilm has confirmed that he's The Phantom Menace anyways.  The title of this movie was named after the main character - Palpatine\/Sidious.7)  Darth Maul - People thought that it was just stupid that he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes.  I don't.  He's a throw away character. Sure, Lucas could've written it some other way so that Maul had more screen time.  But why is the way he wrote it a bad thing?  I look at Maul as I do Boba Fett - a cool, but insignificant character.  The fact that he got killed was only to stress the fact that the Sith work in pairs, and that because he's killed, Sidious will automatically search for another sith apprentice.  In Episode II, he'll have another one, and then he\/she will be killed as well.  So gee, can you guess who'll finally become Palpatine's apprentice?Sure, Lucas could've written it so that Maul lasts through Episode II, and had more screen time in Episode I, but it's not necessary.  It works just as well, if not better, the way Lucas has written it.  And in the end, it stresses that Sidious\/Palpatine really is the main villain.Conclusion -All in all, I think Lucas, and the people at Lucasfilm did a good job at making this beginning chapter of the Star Wars saga a good movie.  I mean, when one opens a six chapter book, and reads the first chapter, and then reads the end, it makes the first chapter look dull.  When people first saw the OT, they were thrown into this galactic battle of a rebellion against a massive evil Empire.  Everything is already established.  However, with Episode I, these things haven't happened yet, therefore it makes it less exciting.  But is any first chapter of a book more exciting than the climax(episodes IV-VI)?  I don't think so.  Episode I was only meant to set us up for the next two movies, and to introduce the characters.  Nothing more.As for the things like the special effects, the acting, etc., it's merely subjective.  In fact, the whole subject of whether or not TPM was a good Star Wars movie depends on the individual.  It's just that some things such as the things I listed above, are inexcusable.  The people who have a problem with the 7 things I listed above just have a serious problem.No, I'm not a Lucas or Star Wars gusher.  I merely think that in this case, Lucas did a good job with the introduction to the biggest Sci-fi saga of all time.

But then, by the end of ROTJ, Vader brings an end to the Emperor, turns back to the good side, and the empire is destroyed, bringing balance back to the force.5)  How you become a Jedi - So we see from The Phantom Menace that the way you become a Jedi is if you have a high midi-chlorian count.  People complain and complain about this, and yet it's totally plausible that this is really the only efficient way to have very young kids train to become Jedi.Let's play a little make-believe game.  Imagine a kid of let's say 5 years old going up to his\/her mom and asking, Mommy, can I go off to the Jedi temple on Coruscant and train to become a Jedi?  Do you really think that a parent would just let their kid leave the house at the age of 5 to train to become a Jedi Knight?  Do you really think that a 5 year old kid is going to be able to make an intellegent decision about the rest of his\/her life?  I don't think so.  But because of the midi-chlorians, Jedi can identify the kids as jedi-potentials, and the kids' parents wouldn't question it. They'll accept it as destiny.I know I know, George Lucas didn't have to write the story this way.  But we already know that even Luke was too old at his age in the trilogy to train as a Jedi.  So if HE was too old, then before TPM cam out, we can conclude that you still had to be pretty young to train.  So if you had to be younger than Luke was(Luke wasn't old at all), then we can feel safe to conclude that one even as young as around 16 or 17 can't make such an important decision about his\/her life intellegently.  So the midi-chlorians make sense.But then this indicates genetic superiority like the arian race.  No it doesn't.  Think about it.  What is genetics?  It deals with DNA.  The midi-chlorians create DNA(they create life), but are not the DNA itself. So yes, it's superiority, but not genetic superiority.  And the people of this galaxy far, far away accept this as inevitable.  Only the people who are born to become Jedi are perhaps the only ones who really see this as something they'd want to do with their lives.It has always seemed to me that becoming a Jedi was all about destiny.  If you take a look at all the movies, you can see that it was Luke's destiny that he was to become a Jedi.  And why would Yoda say There is another. It's because he already knew that Leia was a Jedi potential, or at least someone who has the potential to be strong enough with the force to be able to bring hope to the galaxy.  How can one know this if midi-chlorians don't exist?  It has been said that the force runs strong in the family of the Skywalkers.  It can only run strong if it was the will of the force for it to make it so.  And it all started with Anakin's immaculate conception by the midi-chlorians.6) The Plot - If anyone says that the plot was boring or stupid, they are only stupid themselves.  If one doesn't realize that Senator Palpatine was the main character of this movie, then TPM went completely over their heads. Darth Sidious, Darth Maul's master, is the same person as Palpatine. Senator Palpatine is really a Sith Lord.  What is going on is that Palpatine eventually becomes the Emperor and creates an evil Empire by rising up in political power.  He does so by deceit and manipulation.  And what a better way of doing this then by playing both the good side and the bad like pawns in a chess game, setting each piece where he wants in order to eventually be elected Chancellor, which in turn will enable him to backstab the Jedi and the Republic however he pleases.  He then will declare himself Emperor and develop the evil Empire that we see in full effect in the original trilogy.So why is this a dumb plot?  I think it's done well.  All along, it's Palpatine who's manipulating everything that's going on in the movie, and no one knows it.  And because of his manipulations, he becomes elected chancellor by the end of the movie.  In The Phantom Menace, the bad guy wins, and no one knows it.  I think that's awesome.  And this is a perfect set up for what's yet to come.Oh, and for that idiot who said the Trade Federation was the Phantom Menace, think again.  Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious is The Phantom Menace. Just look at all that he's done in the shadows.  He's the biggest menace of them all, with all his deceit and manipulation that went completely over peoples' heads.  And Lucasfilm has confirmed that he's The Phantom Menace anyways.  The title of this movie was named after the main character - Palpatine\/Sidious.7)  Darth Maul - People thought that it was just stupid that he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes.  I don't.  He's a throw away character. Sure, Lucas could've written it some other way so that Maul had more screen time.  But why is the way he wrote it a bad thing?  I look at Maul as I do Boba Fett - a cool, but insignificant character.  The fact that he got killed was only to stress the fact that the Sith work in pairs, and that because he's killed, Sidious will automatically search for another sith apprentice.  In Episode II, he'll have another one, and then he\/she will be killed as well.  So gee, can you guess who'll finally become Palpatine's apprentice?Sure, Lucas could've written it so that Maul lasts through Episode II, and had more screen time in Episode I, but it's not necessary.  It works just as well, if not better, the way Lucas has written it.  And in the end, it stresses that Sidious\/Palpatine really is the main villain.Conclusion -All in all, I think Lucas, and the people at Lucasfilm did a good job at making this beginning chapter of the Star Wars saga a good movie.  I mean, when one opens a six chapter book, and reads the first chapter, and then reads the end, it makes the first chapter look dull.  When people first saw the OT, they were thrown into this galactic battle of a rebellion against a massive evil Empire.  Everything is already established.  However, with Episode I, these things haven't happened yet, therefore it makes it less exciting.  But is any first chapter of a book more exciting than the climax(episodes IV-VI)?  I don't think so.  Episode I was only meant to set us up for the next two movies, and to introduce the characters.  Nothing more.As for the things like the special effects, the acting, etc., it's merely subjective.  In fact, the whole subject of whether or not TPM was a good Star Wars movie depends on the individual.  It's just that some things such as the things I listed above, are inexcusable.  The people who have a problem with the 7 things I listed above just have a serious problem.No, I'm not a Lucas or Star Wars gusher.  I merely think that in this case, Lucas did a good job with the introduction to the biggest Sci-fi saga of all time. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"18 February 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I'm not sure as to why The Phantom Menace has gotten so much negative feedback from people on this forum.  Midichlorians?  Jar Jar?  Immaculate Conception of Anakin?  Preposterous?While some people may find these things, as well as other minor things unacceptable in the Star Wars Universe, I beg to differ.Let me address some issues the best I can and tell TPM hatemongers why I think they ARE in fact acceptable in the Star Wars universe.1) Jar Jar Binks - Every Episode I review has something about Jar Jar in it, so here's my two sense(pun intended).  Basically, people found Jar Jar to be annoying, stupid, a terrible addition to the Star Wars saga, etc.  I agree that he's annoying and stupid, but not a terrible addition.Like I just said, I agree that he's annoying and stupid.  But he's supposed to be.  Haven't YOU met anyone like Jar Jar before?  I certainly have. The personality of Jar Jar resides in most kids that I know.  Kids can ALSO be annoying, stupid, clumsy, and get into trouble a lot.  They're just like Jar Jar.  But do we hate kids?  Nope.  We punish them for their actions sometimes, but we all get over it and love them for who they are.So so wonder kids can relate to him!  Out of all of my kid cousins that live locally, they all liked Jar Jar.  It's because they can relate.  Jar Jar was supposed to have a child-like innocence to him.  If you didn't catch that, watch the movie again.However, most people who are between the ages of 13 and 25 usually don't relate to him.  I don't relate to him either.  But yet, they like C-3P0. This has always puzzled me.  But I think I've come to a sensible conclusion.Let's think about this a bit.  3P0 is annoying too.  What about all those stupid statistics that he gave them, making the situations they were in much less hopeful.  This makes everyone unhappy and annoyed with him.  Or what about the time he wandered away from the group, and got shot?!  Chewy had to repair him and carry him around on his back for half of the movie!  Such an annoying inconvenience!  And he was always whining about something.  Now why don't people get annoyed by him?  It's simply because they grew up with him, and he's apart of what started it all.  He's nostalgic.  Most people who complain about Jar Jar are the people who saw the trilogy as a kid. Guess what?  When kids see 3P0, they see a cool robot.  However, later on they see a whiny, annoying inconvenience.  And yet, they still like him. Why?  It's because he's apart of their treasured childhood.  He's something they liked as a kid, and therefore they continue to like him, even though they realize the way he is.There's nothing wrong with this, it's just that these people don't realze that just as the kids of yesterday that grew up with 3P0 still like him despite his annoying antics, the kids of today that grow up liking Jar Jar will do the same thing for him.Lastly, Jar Jar served more of a purpose to this movie than 3P0 did to any of the movies.  All 3P0 did was alert the gang of the Stormtroopers' presence(which was only because Chewy was in the process of repairing him when this blurb spirted out), and get the Ewoks to side with the good guys. Other then these two things, he did nothing but get in the way.  Gee, doesn't this sound a lot like Jar Jar?Now, did Jar Jar not help the two separte societies on Naboo unite?  Of course he did.  Did he not become General of the Gungan army?  Of course he did.  So what if he's clumsy, annoying, and is always getting into trouble? These actions only help display why no one in the movie likes him, and why he was banished from Otoh Gunga(the underwater city).  I mean, why would a society banish someone because they were clumsy?  Because of all his stupid antics, I understood why.So what's the big deal?  Jar Jar is just like little kids.  Jar Jar is annoying like 3P0.  It's just that the kids of yesterday still like 3P0 today because they grew up with him.  He's nostalgic.  Without R2-D2, 3P0 is nothing.  However, Jar Jar was able to unite two societies without the help of a cool sidekick, and despite his clumsiness.  I'd say this, as well as the fact that he's just like little kids, makes him someone we should accept and respect.  Treat Jar Jar just as you would a kid, and things will take a turn for the better.  Treat Jar Jar as you would 3P0 and the same will happen.2) Midi-chlorians - What's the big deal?  They take away from the mysticism of the force?  I think not.  They only emphasize the mysticism.  They are sentient beings that reside within us.  WITHIN our cells.  Now this may sound scientific, and it may very well be.  But guess what?  The midi-chlorians create life.  Life cannot exist without them.  They are not the force.  They don't create the force.  We are only symbionts with them, lifeforms living together for mutual advantage.  They only tell us the will of the force.So what if they work together with the force?  The force is still the same mystical entity that we've all come to know and love.  It's just that now we know where life comes from - at least this is what the Jedi believe at this moment in time.  They have yet to explain why the midi-chlorians aren't mentioned in the original trilogy.  Perhaps because trying to explain their faith with science made it no longer a faith.  Maybe trying to define their religion with science is what aided in bringing about their ultimate demise. There faith could've in fact be weakened because of their scientific reasoning.  Who knows?  The next two episodes have yet to elaborate on this, and so we don't fully know the story behind the midi-chlorians.3)  The immaculate conception - Ok, a lot of people were bothered by this. While I will agree that this is somewhat of a poor explanation of why Anakin is so powerful with the force, I don't think that it's a bad idea.  We saw that when Anakin destroyed the Neimoidian ship, it looked like an accident. When in fact, this was the will of the force that he blew it up.  The force used him(I'll get back to this later).  So it could be that because he's the chosen one, things work out to his advantage because he obviously has to bring balance to the force eventually(by doing away with Emperor Palpatine in ROTJ).  So up until that time, he has to stay alive.  And since the force is seeking balance, it's going to keep its chosen one alive.  This means that most everything will work to his advantage.  So it could be that he'll realize this, developing a big ego trip that aids in his turn to the dark side.  This won't be the only reason he turns, but it could definitely have something to do with it.Also, people think that because the force used him, rather than him using the force, made it less dramatic.  I agree that it's less dramatic.  But it's also an important element of how Luke goes the other way and he uses the force.  It's something that his dad(Anakin) didn't have enough experience in.  His dad just assumed that the force would work to his advantage, therefore not concentrating enough on using the force.  Luke redeems what his father should have redeemed.  This only helps explain even better why Anakin turns to the dark side.  Plus, Anakin wouldn't know where the Neimoidians main reactor was to begin with.So I don't think him being immaculately concieved is a bad idea.  Many people in today's society, as well as societies long before us, believed that Jesus was immaculately conceived.  So if people can accept His conception as reality, why can't people accept Anakin's conception in a make-believe universe?4) The will of the force - Ok, people are asking, What the heck is up with this will of the force thing?  Let me tell you.Here's what I think.  I think that the will of the force is ultimately good. It's seeking balance, right?  Balance is good.  Therefore the will of the force is good.But then, there's the dark side.  So if there are two sides to the force, how can it have one will?  It's because it's like the yin and the yang. It's an entity that's seeking balance, therefore it has one will. So why does the force allow the dark side to take over?  Both sides are very powerful, but it's still seeking balance.  It's for the same reason why God allows bad things to happen to good people.  We don't quite know the answer, but Christians trust that it's God's will that it happened so that eventually things work out for the better in His eyes.  One cannot fully comprehend something that's beyond our comprehension, like God for instance. So the same goes for the force.  Don't try to fully comprehend something like this.  That's ludicrous.So basically, I think that in the time of TPM, the force IS balanced.  The good side and the dark side are both equally doing the same thing - coexisting.  But then, the sith emerge, Palpatine becomes emperor and creates his evil empire, and the Jedi are pretty much eliminated.  But then, by the end of ROTJ, Vader brings an end to the Emperor, turns back to the good side, and the empire is destroyed, bringing balance back to the force.5)  How you become a Jedi - So we see from The Phantom Menace that the way you become a Jedi is if you have a high midi-chlorian count.

I don't know why its getting all the attention that it is, but I think it is just a case of right place\/right time.  I hope we see more martial arts movies in the future where the stars are real athletes and do not require the assistance of wires!

Great, sensationally, fascinating, astounding  This movie does not deserve those words, it is much better.This movie has just the greatest special effects ever. What I love about this movie ( unlike to Godzilla, King Kong, Terminator 2 or something ), is that the story is more important than the special effects, and not the other way round. Another thing is, that the guys do not say  oh, we are human beings, so we have to kill every single animal danger that there is ( see  in the whole movie, you cannot see even one shot ). Comparison  In Godzilla there were about 1647. I wonder how anyone can not like this movie at all. I am almost embarrassed to say that I have seen this movie just 18 times, but in the end of the year 2001 I will have watched it at least 50 times. I started to watch this movie at least one time a week. I could quote every part of this film, but I still cannot have enough of it. I never get tired of seeing this movie.Good points of Jurassic Park Music, Steven Spielberg, character development, everything on the stylistic level, the camera work, audio\/visual effects, the story and the way it is told, the T Rex, the velociraptor, every single scene with a dinosaur in it ( and the others, too ), actors  ((Alan Grant ( Sam Neill ), John Hammond ( Richard Attenborough ), Ellie Sattler ( Laura Dern ), Ray Arnold ( Samuel L. Jackson ), Tim Murphy ( Joseph Mazzelo ) , Lex Murphy ( Ariana Richards ), Dennis Nedry ( Wayne Knight ), Ian Malcolm ( Jeff Goldblum ), Robert Muldoon ( Bob Peck ), Lewis Dodgson ( Cameron Thor ) and Henry Wu ( B. D. Wong )), the first 60 minutes, and the last 60 minutes, the suspense, maybe even horror, if you are young, the action, the humor ( the bit that there is ), the way that the characters tell their arguments to do\/do not approve the park, and every single shot that you can see.Bad points  the dilophosaur, there was a bit too much of Dennis Nedry ( just a little bit ), a few goofs.My favorite parts  the T Rex scenes, the kitchen scene, both scenes with the brachiosaur, the ending ( in the helicopter, with that GREAT music ). This movie maybe has my three all-time-favorite film parts  the Rex breaking out, the ending and the brachiosaur visiting Alan, Lex and Tim in the tree.This is a definite milestone in cinema history, and I hope it will still be remembered in 50 years. I still have to live about 70 years, and I promise, that this will ever be my favorite movie. There has never been, there is no, and there will never be a better movie than Jurassic Park.Steven Spielberg works his magic again, and he is by FAAAAR my favorite director, and this is one reason why I like him THAT much. OK, he made some bad films, but films like Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler´s List ( my Top 3 movies ) will stay masterpieces forever. I think that every other director would have made another King Kong or Godzilla from the script, but Steven knew what to do, and this is one reason why I love him. Don't listen to the negative reviews or claims that this movie was just a sell out- because it's not. George Lucas has an army of advertising blitzes and action figures and countless other crap, for his overrated films, but he makes magic.Jurassic Park is the reason that I am a film fan. Since I watched this film in 1996 on TV, I watched about 700 films, but there is no movie that came up to it. Till 1998 this was not my all-time favorite, but one day I decided that this is just the greatest thing on earth. This is better than The Lost World ( which is my number 6 movie ), because it is not that much concentrated on action ( I like action, but Jurassic Park shows exactly the same length of action scenes, and The Lost World was a bit too much concentrated on the action ). I hope that I will be able to watch this movie with JP2 and JP3 in a feature in summer, when Jurassic Park 3 enters the screen. I´d love to watch this movie on the big screen and I can't wait for the sequel. If there had not been &#132;Schindler´s List, this should have gotten the 7 awards that Schindler won.All in all, this movie is, on a scale from 1 to 10, a definite 1000. It could not have been better. For anyone who hasn't yet seen this classic film, what are you waiting for?Thanks to everyone that gave us such a great film. We can only be thankful that this movie was made.Can't wait for the sequel, although it is without the masters Steven Spielberg ( on the director's chair ) and John Williams. A definite 1000\/10.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. Is there anyone out there who loves the film as much as I do ?Cu; Rinho.

I had, however, travelled to stay the weekend with a friend, and he really wanted to go.  We both came out of the cinema wishing we hadn't bothered. The film is very flawed, with little of director Scott's talent on show except his willingness to take chances with shocking material.  Having read the book, I can say that Hannibal is a very mundane and unimaginative adaptation.  Neither Hannibal's nor Starling's characters are developed to any depth,leaving me wondering what the film was really all about.  What has Clarice been up to during the last ten years?  She appears to still be single - why?  Surely this is intriguing?  Why this huge self-sacrifice to her career?  We are told that not a day passes when Lector doesn't cross her mind; so how has this affected her?  In what ways has Lector's freedom manifested itself in her psyche?  And what of Lector himself?  We are given no insight into his personality or actions, either those of his past or those seen in the film.  Clearly he is a man of brilliant intellect and extraordinary sensibility, yet we are given nothing of what he wants out of life, what he cares for, beyond superficial details like his love of fine foods and art.  If this is meant to engender a sense of mystique to him, it is misguided since without any understanding of a character's motivations, an audience cannot hope to empathise with them. I was left feeling no involvement, watching a chain of events occur, and nothing more.  What part had Clarice played in Lector's life over the ten years past?  Had he grown to love her?   Had he been following her career, following *her*?  The details are scant indeed, coming along sporadically and even then only in the form of mere hints.  The mystery of Hannibal had already been set up in The Silence of the Lambs - a sequel *demands* a payoff.  There were such details in the book, such as what had made Lector the monster he is, Clarice Starling's life and 'loves' etc. but the screenplay simply omitted these.I noticed a couple of technical flaws i.e. an unjustifiable jump cut and a shot that went out, and then back into, focus, which are, frankly, unforgivable in major studio productions; given that this is a film that will inevitably get nominated for Academy Awards, such faults mustn't be glossed over. Finally, and most importantly, I must comment on the justifiably controversial aspect of this film, its graphic horror.  I knew what was in store, yet I was still deeply disturbed at actually seeing the brain-eating scene.  I felt I *ought* to walk out on it, not because I couldn't stomach it (though some may not be so hardened) but because *it seemed wrong* to be sat watching such images.  The power of film is unquestionable - think advertising, think wartime properganda - so it would be insane to ignore the possible effects of everyday people sitting down to such images as graphic as those in Hannibal, in the name of entertainment.  *This scene was unjustified in the book*, but *no one's* imagination is good enough to deliver the impact that actually witnessing something, with one's own eyes, can.  I contend that *in a book*, such horrors, while having some power, are generally harmless, but to enable such things to be *seen* can actually endanger society.  I am not saying that seeing horror films can make a person kill (though even that can be persuasively argued) but I *am* saying that society will grow increasingly desensitized, which will make us increasing less able to empathise with the suffering of others *in the real world*.  Moreover, children *will* get to see Hannibal on video - don't be under any illusions about this.  With the murder of poor Jamie Bulger, *by children*, so much in our minds again recently, isn't it time society made a stand of some kind against such films getting made, if they are certain to get seen by children once they are released onto video?  Another point is that of where horror films are heading?  Alien was shocking in '79, Starship Troopers in '97(?) - rated 15 in the U.K.- with its casual decapitations and limb-rending, already old hat, and now the slicing, frying and eating of a living man's brain? To conclude, I would say that Hannibal is a very poor adaptation of an enjoyable, quite clever, horror story; there are several plot holes (how did Starling free herself from the fridge, how did she fix the telephone, et al) and some technical flaws.  Characterisations are wafer thin, the style and art direction, score, and even the acting are no more than competant; the final horror scene is gross, utterly gratuitous and morally reprehensible. I would seriously urge everyone to do themselves a favour and go see something else.  If you do, you may also be doing the *decent* thing.

The opening chase scene was the best begining to any Bond film and the plot did have credibility and could be believed rather than the usual taking over the world thing , the choice of actors was good Sophie Marceau was great as a two faced Bond girl, Denise Richards was ok but it is difficult to judge as she did'nt feature until the second halve of the movie and did'nt get many lines. Robert Caryle was good as a villan going back to his days in Cracker, but we did'nt see enough of him and Sophie Marceau seemed the more evil of the two. Brosnan has got better as he has gone on, Goldeneye was good for his first attempt, Tomorrow Never Dies was even better and now he has improved again,as for someone's comment about John Woo directing a Bond film, I don't think he would be ideal although the action would be guranteed I watched Hard Target and don't think his style of directing is really Bond.

Masquerading around as Donnie Brasco, the Jeweler, he gets the attention of Lefty(Al Pacino), a veteran mobster who knows he'll never get ahead in the mob again, and subconsciously wants to mentor a mob foreigner to bring purpose back into his life.  Lefty is enamored with Donnie, and isn't afraid to vouch for him to bring Donnie into his circle of the mob.  Soon Donnie becomes like another son to Lefty, and gradually gets to know his friends, including the ambitious Sonny Black(Michael Madsden).  Unfortunately his time on the job doesn't leave much for his wife Maggie(Ann Heche), who is tired of never having a husband around to support raising three children.  Furthermore, as he spends more and more time with Lefty's gang, Donnie proportionally loses his old identity and actually becomes Donnie Brasco.  Saying more about the film would be time-consuming and wrong, since I only feel like I should give the basic meat of this very intriguing story and let anyone who hasn't seen it experience it for itself.The acting in this film is of the highest caliber.  Al Pacino, of course, gives an unbelievable performance as Lefty, able to elicit a lot of sympathy and empathy from the viewer despite the viewer's knowledge of his 26 hits.  It's clear that if his Lefty wasn't in the mob, he'd be your very admirable old next door neighbor, telling you stories and capturing your attention.  From what I have read of reviews, people seem to be downplaying Johnny Depp's acting abilities.  I thought he did an amazing job, as the transformation from his real identity Joe to the cool Donnie Brasco is very visible and intriguing.  We know that he finds a lot more truth and meaning in the hectic and real mob life than in the impersonal bureaucratic FBI.  When he says to his wife late in the film I can't breathe anymore, we know exactly what he means Joe is almost faded away, and Donnie the Quintessential Gangster's lifestyle is his own.  Also not to be written off is Micheal Madsden, who also did a tremendous job in Reservoir Dogs.  Hey Micheal, why'd you waste your time with Free Willy and not take Quentin Tarantino up on his offer to play THE Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction???A lot of people have written that this film forces a 70s vibe, but I don't think so at all.  Maybe I was too busy noticing Lefty's defeatist stare when he sees buddy Sonny shaking hands with The Boss he so wanted to please- scenes like that made the film for me, and they're sprinkled throughout to create a very well-done picture.  It does have some flaws, however.  The family scenes could have been a lot better done, and I have the feeling that a lot more about the mob could have been explained.  Oh well, I can't even express how much value I got out of this film, as I got it for free from the library.  Please take the time to watch it- it's an excellent glimpse of the life I think we all sometimes desire to live, and also an exploration of the great loving relationship of Lefty and Donnie.Rating Highly Recommended, 8.5\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"18 February 2001","score":"","review":"  Donnie Brasco is the true story of an FBI agent(Johnny Depp) whose job is to gradually infiltrate a lower, yet still quite dangerous, rung of the New York City mob in the 70s.

Urban Legends Final Cut is basically a collaboration of the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer films, except it lacks what they had.Though this film is considered a non-sequel, as it has basically a whole new cast compared to the first Urban Legends along with a different storyline - it still isn't as original as it could have been. Regardless of the fact that it lacked it's own personality, it is probably one of the better non-sequel's in the horror genre, because it does relate somewhat back to the first film. Returning character Reese adds a little bit of the original to this films atmosphere which creates a sense of direction.While watching this film I really had to question who the killer was, which was difficult as they had so many characters in this film that I had a hard time putting a name to a face. That was a positive aspect about this film, as it had a Scream 3 like atmosphere where the killer is revealed only in the last 10 minutes, and any guess towards the likes of the killer would most likely be false. Though the way they displayed the killer was almost like Scream 3, too much of this movie was like Scream 3. A movie inside a movie? Been there, done that. Still though, this film isn't necessarily copying as the script was written before Scream 3 was ever released. I like the concept of a movie within a movie, but Scream had already claimed that aspect back in 1996 and the original Urban Legends didn't make enough impact to have a sequel use that concept.The acting in this film wasn't that good as well. There were too many dumb blonde like characters in this film. Jennifer Morrison who played the lead role as Amy Mayfield wasn't too bad, though she reminded me of Julia Stiles too much and I personally haven't been able to stomach Stiles since that annoying 10 Things I Hate About You movie. Amy's trusty sidekicks seemed like they were thrown together as well and that's a problem when there are too many filler characters and not enough depth. Characterism was a major issue in this film as unlike Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, you didn't get to know or like your characters enough to care whether they were getting killed or not. They didn't seem like real people with real problems so does it really matter if someone slices them up? No.In comparison to the first Urban Legends I think this one would stand better by itself. If they had cut the Urban Legends cliche from this film it would've made a better slasher flick. The film really only killed one person by using an Urban Legend. By connecting this film to the original it only made me think I was gonna be seeing a continuation of a story that interested me.Where do the gems in this film lie? The final scene, after you find out who the killer is, and right before the credits play. I was prepared to give this film a 2 out of 10 rating until I saw that scene. I think it's the only thing about this film that left me wanting more. It was original, and it was clever. It is the only thing that kind of shocked me, everything else I expected. I'm definently glad they added this scene to the film.In conclusion, I would see this film for the heck of it. It's not a complete waste of time, but it's not the best film ever either. If you liked the first film at all see this one, or even if you didn't, this one might make you like the first one more.

If they had cut the Urban Legends cliche from this film it would've made a better slasher flick. The film really only killed one person by using an Urban Legend. By connecting this film to the original it only made me think I was gonna be seeing a continuation of a story that interested me.Where do the gems in this film lie? The final scene, after you find out who the killer is, and right before the credits play. I was prepared to give this film a 2 out of 10 rating until I saw that scene. I think it's the only thing about this film that left me wanting more. It was original, and it was clever. It is the only thing that kind of shocked me, everything else I expected. I'm definently glad they added this scene to the film.In conclusion, I would see this film for the heck of it. It's not a complete waste of time, but it's not the best film ever either. If you liked the first film at all see this one, or even if you didn't, this one might make you like the first one more.

Being the absolute idiots they are, Pete, McGill, and Delmar find themselves following the advice of this clearly eccentric drifter.The three idiots are pursued by various other characters, including a local sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who's bound and determined to bring the criminals to justice, a young musician (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical abilities, George Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco), a manic depressive bank robber with machine guns up the wazoo, Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a deceptive one-eyed bible salesman, and incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) in a close campaign with Homer Stokes (Wayne DuVall), whose manager (Ray McKinnon) is married to McGill's ex-wife, Penny (Holly Hunter).Oh Brother, Where Art Thau? is a moronic shadow of Of Mice and Men, minus the legitimate plot and defined character intentions. This film contains the most annoying of characters; they are bland, boring, dual, dumb, negative-adjective inspiring. What is that you say? The movie's intentions were to induce laughs through the stupidity of the characters? Well, if that were the case I think I would have laughs, or even smiled at that. I found myself moaning and groaning in disgust and agony. Not a single character is the least bit intriguing. That is one of the biggest problems the movie makes, finding a character in which audiences can relate. Maybe if the characters were introduced or developed, or had the slightest interesting personality, then there may have been some involvement.albeit not much.The dialogue is typical redneck blahblah, wooden and straightforward. There is little creativity or sharpness in the writing. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on a poem by Homer, puts you right to sleep, especially in the scenes where the outlaws sit around campfires exchanging depressing, meaningless gibber jabber. The soundtrack is equally as painful, consisting of irritating old-fashion country music, and even some numbers sang by the characters themselves. Those scenes, dragged on way too long, are irrelevant to the story. All of these horrible qualities precede an ending that is not satisfying and inconclusive.Oh Brother, Where Art Thau? is just a really dumb movie; there is no other way to explain the quality. It is just really dumb. Not in a funny way. Not in a slapstick way. Not even in a bad movie sort of way. It is inexplicably dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Oh, yeah, did I mention that this movie is dumb. Still considering going to see this junk? Fine, but do not say I didn't warn you.

While Michelle Yeoh's performance was excellent, I found Chow Yun Fat's performance contrived for the most part. He seems to have 3 expressions to cover most situations solemn, earnest and solemnly earnest. There is a certain sense of amused charm that glows in selected scenes, however these are few and far between. The cinematography was lush and a joy to the eye. Oddly enough, the problems I had with this film for the most part were with the fight and flight sequences and not because I had a problem suspending disbelief, I recognize this film is a fantasy. It was the quality of the effects, or lack thereof that was striking *on occasion*. The first sequence involving the flight over the rooftops felt off to me in many ways. They looked like actors suspended from wires for the most part. They would change direction by pushing off a wall or a rooftop except that it was plainly obvious their foot hadn't touched the surface of the roof or wall. In the Matrix there were similar scenes but one always had at least a vague sense of a body's *mass*. With Crouching Tiger sometimes this would be conveyed and at other times it wasn't. I think it was the inconsistency that bothered me the most. The most compelling fight sequences were those involving Michelle Yeoh and\/or Ziyi Zhang. The writing was good, but not exceptional. It's interesting that the thrust of the martial arts tends to be inner harmony and mental discipline, yet every film of this genre seems predicated on revenge and Crouching Tiger certainly doesn't break the mould in that respect. For the genre it was exeptional and I can see it being nominated and winning Best Foreign Feature, but Best Picture? That's a stretch.
