It has been preceded by the most alarming amount of hype and media frenzy since Gone With the Wind was released in 1939.  It is called Star Wars  Episode One - The Phantom Menace.It has been observed that the venom with which most critics attack a film increases in direct proportion to its overall success.  This is true; one would be hard-pressed to find anyone who will say anything nice about Titanic or Forrest Gump these days, whether it be on the Internet, in the newsroom, or out on the street.  Who gave these films a combined total of seventeen Oscars and nearly two billion dollars in worldwide grosses? Ghosts, I guess.The fashionable thing for people and critics to do is to reject popular things, but only after everyone else has seen it and praised it.  I've seen it happen dozens of times, to dozens of films.  There were the two aforementioned Best Picture awardees, the trilogy in question, Jerry Maguire, Pulp Fiction, and Saving Private Ryan, just to name a few. A skillfully crafted, well-liked, popular motion picture usually goes by a set timeline  First, it is released, accompanied by unusually positive word of mouth from preview audiences.  It gets raves from most critics (though not always), has either a big opening or solid staying power.  It garners a huge number of fans, collects a number of year-end awards, and becomes tiresome to everyone.  Finally, it comes out on video.  By that time, roughly, most folks are saying (honestly or not), that they never really liked insert title here anyway.It's fashionable for contemporary movie critics to say that they never really caught on to the whole 'Star Wars' thing.  They'll say it was and still is nerd territory, intended for no mature person over thirteen years of age.  I guess I'm a nerd, or I need to check my birth certificate.  The Star Wars trilogy was an important part of my cultural education as a young child, along with He-Man, the Transformers, and MTV.  My parents bought me a majority of the Star Wars action figures, though most of them lay in ruin as a result of the many long, drawn-out skirmishes with G.I. Joe.  Since those days I have outgrown the toys, increased my artistic repertoire somewhat by going out of my way to rent lesser-known foreign films, art films, and independent films.  Today, however, whether I'm viewing the trilogy as a whole or just catching a glimpse of it in the electronics section of a department store, they still make me smile.  I am still impressed with the seemingly ageless special effects, and the undeniable skill Lucas has as a storyteller and purveyor of fantastic imagery.  I still find myself laughing at the bits of humor sprinkled throughout the series, however goofy they may be (I believe scruffy looking nerf-herder was one of the insults Princess Leia hurls at Han Solo).  I still find myself enveloped in its wholly original stories.  All in all, I still love the Star Wars series.Thus, I proudly counted myself as one of those who eagerly awaited seeing The Phantom Menace.  It's not a date move, and I didn't take a girl to it (that's why they make movies like You've Got Mail or Good Will Hunting). It's a nerd movie, yes, it's a sci-fi geek movie, this is true, but there's more.  A lot more.  It brings out the nerd, the sci-fi geek that lies dormant within all of us, and makes us grateful for the fact that someone in the world hasn't forgotten how to give us a good show.The number one reason people have given for wanting to see the film  to see what happens.  It's that simple.  They wanted to see what new Star Wars stuff is going on.  It's like the season premiere of a really, really, really popular television series.  They wanted to see what Anakin Skywalker was like when he was six (or eight or ten or whatever).  They wanted to see him before that fateful day when he got up on the dark side of the bed, went down to the local magistrate's office, and changed his name to Darth Vader. They wanted to see Obi-Wan Kenobi when he was in his mid-to-late twenties. They wanted to see Natalie Portman now that she's no longer a minor.  They wanted to see Yoda, Senator (soon to be promoted) Palpatine, Qui-Gon Jinn, C-3PO, and R2-D2.  They wanted to see Darth Maul with his cool double lightsaber, and that big pod race everyone's been talking about.  They wanted to get away, for at least two hours, from their places of work, from hearing more about the whole Kosovo brouhaha, and -- God help us -- another royal wedding.  To quote Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, they wanted to see amazing sights, real big and loud, one right after the other.That's the attitude I took with me when I walked in to see The Phantom Menace.  To begin with, I'd like to get a few of the drawbacks out of the way, so I can say afterwards how much I liked the film.  The first disappointment is John Williams' score.  One of our greatest modern composers, especially of late with his work for Spielberg's Amistad and Saving Private Ryan, he never quite measures up to the legacy he created for the original Star Wars films.  The soundtrack is a disorganized, jumbled mess.  It's a long train of John Williams-style, orchestral sound effects competing with the already overabundant sound effects of the movie itself. Only the section which backs the climactic lightsaber duel matches the exhilarating majesty of his best Star Wars compositions  the famous opening, Darth Vader's dum-dum-de-dum theme, or the chilling Wagnerian music that went along with Lando Calrissian leading the rebel assault at the climax of Return of the Jedi (my personal favorite).  It's probably sacrilege to suggest that the Williams, a staunch symphonic orchestra devotee, ought to use a synthesizer next time, or that Lucas might sign on Massive Attack or Radiohead to put together the score for Episode II and III.  Then again, the rest of the movie is computer generated, why not the soundtrack?Second casualty, the film's pacing.  It's been twenty-two years since Lucas sat in the director's chair, and he is bound to have forgotten a few things. Alfred Hitchcock once spoke of the infinite possibility of images to communicate ideas and story elements, where spoken words would be too awkward and take too long.  The cast spends too much time saying things like so-and-so, I'd like you to meet so-and-so and all right, everybody, this is what happened, this is what we plan to do next.  I thought that if, instead of the usual opening scrawl to explain the film's premise, we had a chalkboard to illustrate the plays and the character relations, we'd be better off.  The movie, after all is said and done, is really just a bunch of set pieces, with in-between bits for the plot to be explained and Subtle References to the follow-on trilogy.But what set pieces they are!  The clamor everyone's made about the high-speed pod race is completely justified.  It's as thrilling as those nine-minute IMAX rides, minus the moving seats and the silly headgear. The obligatory fights with faceless foot soldiers (in this case, skeletal droids) move faster and are more fun than the battles with the old Stormtroopers.  They're awful fighters, those warrior robots, but they're a great visual asset; the shot (digital, of course) of hordes of them in formation is quite a spectacle to behold.  The climax, which has Lucas juggling no less than four simultaneous action sequences -- 1) little Anakin's sortie in and around the orbiting Trade Federation headquarters, 2) Queen Amidala and her entourage's assault on the Naboo capital palace, 3) the epic battle (shades of Braveheart) between the amphibious gungans and the divisions of soldier droids, and 4) the duel between Qui-Jon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul -- gives the audience members exactly what they came for an eye-popping visual feast, at breakneck speed.The much-maligned acting job is much better than expected.  Critics have called Jake Lloyd a cocky little brat.  There's a reason for this  he's playing a cocky little brat.  In interviews Lloyd has displayed an astounding amount of intelligence for his age, similar to the teenage Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple.  Seen in this light, his performance exudes confidence and professionalism -- rare for child actors, even today.  Ewan McGregor isn't given much to do, which is a shame  after seeing him tear up the screen as the addict\/delinquent Renton in Trainspotting, the unwillingness of Lucas to let him cut loose is disappointing.  He handles what he is given very well, however.  Natalie Portman is luminous in her role as Queen Amidala, managing to show tenderness and warmth despite a number of massive costumes and hair arrangements.  Liam Neeson lends authority to his Qui-Gon character, but the real stand-out of the cast is Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine.  The only actor who plays the same role in all four films (unless you count Frank Oz's voice for Yoda), he's also the only one who's allowed to be subtle, sophisticated, and therefore he steals any scenes he's in.The film's sly humor is another plus, though it's not as zany or clever as anything in The Fifth Element or your average Star Trek movie. There's a silly exchange between Qui-Gon and an alien, airborne slave-driver that provided the biggest laugh out of the entire film.  Jar Jar Binks was thought by some to be a grating annoyance, but an equal number found his comic relief to be very welcome.  In particular, his endless mishaps (doing more good than harm) during the climactic battle scene are straight out of old Buster Keaton silent comedies.The film ends, of course, ready for Episode II to be latched in place of the closing credits.  The original Star Wars movies could stand by themselves -- all you needed was a quick run-down of who's who and what happened in the last one, and you were good to go -- so The Phantom Menace loses a few points by being a two hour plus trailer for the next episode.  So what? All in all, it packs a punch and gives us our money's worth.  It may be a Cracker Jack box with just the prizes inside, but they're pretty terrific prizes.

Today, however, whether I'm viewing the trilogy as a whole or just catching a glimpse of it in the electronics section of a department store, they still make me smile.  I am still impressed with the seemingly ageless special effects, and the undeniable skill Lucas has as a storyteller and purveyor of fantastic imagery.  I still find myself laughing at the bits of humor sprinkled throughout the series, however goofy they may be (I believe scruffy looking nerf-herder was one of the insults Princess Leia hurls at Han Solo).  I still find myself enveloped in its wholly original stories.  All in all, I still love the Star Wars series.Thus, I proudly counted myself as one of those who eagerly awaited seeing The Phantom Menace.  It's not a date move, and I didn't take a girl to it (that's why they make movies like You've Got Mail or Good Will Hunting). It's a nerd movie, yes, it's a sci-fi geek movie, this is true, but there's more.  A lot more.  It brings out the nerd, the sci-fi geek that lies dormant within all of us, and makes us grateful for the fact that someone in the world hasn't forgotten how to give us a good show.The number one reason people have given for wanting to see the film  to see what happens.  It's that simple.  They wanted to see what new Star Wars stuff is going on.  It's like the season premiere of a really, really, really popular television series.  They wanted to see what Anakin Skywalker was like when he was six (or eight or ten or whatever).  They wanted to see him before that fateful day when he got up on the dark side of the bed, went down to the local magistrate's office, and changed his name to Darth Vader. They wanted to see Obi-Wan Kenobi when he was in his mid-to-late twenties. They wanted to see Natalie Portman now that she's no longer a minor.  They wanted to see Yoda, Senator (soon to be promoted) Palpatine, Qui-Gon Jinn, C-3PO, and R2-D2.  They wanted to see Darth Maul with his cool double lightsaber, and that big pod race everyone's been talking about.  They wanted to get away, for at least two hours, from their places of work, from hearing more about the whole Kosovo brouhaha, and -- God help us -- another royal wedding.  To quote Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, they wanted to see amazing sights, real big and loud, one right after the other.That's the attitude I took with me when I walked in to see The Phantom Menace.  To begin with, I'd like to get a few of the drawbacks out of the way, so I can say afterwards how much I liked the film.  The first disappointment is John Williams' score.  One of our greatest modern composers, especially of late with his work for Spielberg's Amistad and Saving Private Ryan, he never quite measures up to the legacy he created for the original Star Wars films.  The soundtrack is a disorganized, jumbled mess.  It's a long train of John Williams-style, orchestral sound effects competing with the already overabundant sound effects of the movie itself. Only the section which backs the climactic lightsaber duel matches the exhilarating majesty of his best Star Wars compositions  the famous opening, Darth Vader's dum-dum-de-dum theme, or the chilling Wagnerian music that went along with Lando Calrissian leading the rebel assault at the climax of Return of the Jedi (my personal favorite).  It's probably sacrilege to suggest that the Williams, a staunch symphonic orchestra devotee, ought to use a synthesizer next time, or that Lucas might sign on Massive Attack or Radiohead to put together the score for Episode II and III.  Then again, the rest of the movie is computer generated, why not the soundtrack?Second casualty, the film's pacing.  It's been twenty-two years since Lucas sat in the director's chair, and he is bound to have forgotten a few things. Alfred Hitchcock once spoke of the infinite possibility of images to communicate ideas and story elements, where spoken words would be too awkward and take too long.  The cast spends too much time saying things like so-and-so, I'd like you to meet so-and-so and all right, everybody, this is what happened, this is what we plan to do next.  I thought that if, instead of the usual opening scrawl to explain the film's premise, we had a chalkboard to illustrate the plays and the character relations, we'd be better off.  The movie, after all is said and done, is really just a bunch of set pieces, with in-between bits for the plot to be explained and Subtle References to the follow-on trilogy.But what set pieces they are!  The clamor everyone's made about the high-speed pod race is completely justified.  It's as thrilling as those nine-minute IMAX rides, minus the moving seats and the silly headgear. The obligatory fights with faceless foot soldiers (in this case, skeletal droids) move faster and are more fun than the battles with the old Stormtroopers.  They're awful fighters, those warrior robots, but they're a great visual asset; the shot (digital, of course) of hordes of them in formation is quite a spectacle to behold.  The climax, which has Lucas juggling no less than four simultaneous action sequences -- 1) little Anakin's sortie in and around the orbiting Trade Federation headquarters, 2) Queen Amidala and her entourage's assault on the Naboo capital palace, 3) the epic battle (shades of Braveheart) between the amphibious gungans and the divisions of soldier droids, and 4) the duel between Qui-Jon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul -- gives the audience members exactly what they came for an eye-popping visual feast, at breakneck speed.The much-maligned acting job is much better than expected.  Critics have called Jake Lloyd a cocky little brat.  There's a reason for this  he's playing a cocky little brat.  In interviews Lloyd has displayed an astounding amount of intelligence for his age, similar to the teenage Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple.  Seen in this light, his performance exudes confidence and professionalism -- rare for child actors, even today.  Ewan McGregor isn't given much to do, which is a shame  after seeing him tear up the screen as the addict\/delinquent Renton in Trainspotting, the unwillingness of Lucas to let him cut loose is disappointing.  He handles what he is given very well, however.  Natalie Portman is luminous in her role as Queen Amidala, managing to show tenderness and warmth despite a number of massive costumes and hair arrangements.  Liam Neeson lends authority to his Qui-Gon character, but the real stand-out of the cast is Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine.  The only actor who plays the same role in all four films (unless you count Frank Oz's voice for Yoda), he's also the only one who's allowed to be subtle, sophisticated, and therefore he steals any scenes he's in.The film's sly humor is another plus, though it's not as zany or clever as anything in The Fifth Element or your average Star Trek movie. There's a silly exchange between Qui-Gon and an alien, airborne slave-driver that provided the biggest laugh out of the entire film.  Jar Jar Binks was thought by some to be a grating annoyance, but an equal number found his comic relief to be very welcome.  In particular, his endless mishaps (doing more good than harm) during the climactic battle scene are straight out of old Buster Keaton silent comedies.The film ends, of course, ready for Episode II to be latched in place of the closing credits.  The original Star Wars movies could stand by themselves -- all you needed was a quick run-down of who's who and what happened in the last one, and you were good to go -- so The Phantom Menace loses a few points by being a two hour plus trailer for the next episode.  So what? All in all, it packs a punch and gives us our money's worth.  It may be a Cracker Jack box with just the prizes inside, but they're pretty terrific prizes.

I have read much that it paints a rather inaccurate picture of the genius's life, and yet I am not dissuaded from ranking this film as one of the greatest made.  The historical problem should be addressed first, because it draws the most criticism.  I would advise anyone to shut out the self-righteous whining of those people who fancy themselves as Mozart experts, when they really have little solid evidence for their assertions.  History is only seen by us in fragments, be they documents or eye witness accounts.  These fragments certainly do not amount to a full picture of events, and so Milos Forman and Peter Schaeffer are perfectly entitled to form their own story of genius.This issue aside, the picture is one of fantastic colour and scale, crammed with lavish costumes and wonderful architecture.  This keeps the eyes occupied, but the ears get the biggest reward.  The film uses a large amount of Mozart's music, and does so in a way which is carefully considered. For example, when the insane and enfeebled Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) reminisces on the sheer beauty of Mozart's compositions, we hear music to match his words, And there... an oboe, high and unwavering... until a clarinet takes over, and forms a phrase of such longing...  The effect is deeply moving.  Examples of this collaboration of music and picture are many; when Mozart (Tom Hulce) swaggers through the streets of Vienna taking swigs from a bottle of wine, we hear a jolly piano concerto; and he is hurled into a mass grave to the sorrowful Lacrimosa of his requiem mass. The music should move any viewer, however much they confess to hating anything classical.  If you haven't seen this film, watch, or rather listen, for the scene where Salieri inspects samples of Mozart's music.  The originality in switching the music as he turns the pages is profound. The acting is superb, particularly from Abraham.  Hulce's cackle provides comic relief, and his wonderfully child-like mannerisms are testament not only to his acting skills, but to Forman's exceptional direction and vision. On the other hand, we are shown two moments of antithesis, namely when he is composing at his billiards table (his face taking on a look of such mature concentration), and when he is dictating his Confutatis to Salieri. Yes, we do get to see Mozart compose, and talk about tonic, dominant, second measures, etc.  I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered.  Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart.  We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy.  Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin.  He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri.  Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak.  The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold.  In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real.  This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement.  He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down.  He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee.  Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy.  On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy).  The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning.  This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away.

A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. For these reasons, The Fugitive is a huge blessing for a movie critic such as I. I was just thrilled by the excitement, the performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and the whole Hitchcockian aura that this sensational film delivered. Even though we have been seeing too many films based on television series come out lately, The Fugitive is certainly not one of those that we can add to that routine bushel.Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash\/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by Lt. Gerard (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious one-armed man. As I have stated, this is a simple plot that requires no superficial decoration.Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character. Jones, who has never really been considered a headliner until now, creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent. His only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.I have not previously been a fan of the director Andrew Davis's work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked my interest. With such films as Under Siege, Code of Silence, and Above the Law, he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris). Here, he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, The Fugitive ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993.

It is a remarkably courageous performance, and she sticks to it clear through the end; Moore never once lets the audience know that she -- the actress -- is on to her character and above it.Not the best-made movie of the year -- yes, that goes to RAGING BULL -- but that brings up a fascinating comparison I would suggest that ORDINARY PEOPLE's Beth is all bull in the china shop of her family's hearts, more of a monster than LaMotta who 1) repents; and 2) is not encouraged by society friends to remain unchanged, who perceive that nothing is really wrong. By giving us a real contrast to this monster (especially as Sutherland's character undergoes transformation, waking to a woman he realizes he never knew), the film is ultimately more edifying, entertaining, and life-informing than Scorsese's directorial masterpiece, which ultimately teaches us more about film than people.

The end battle scene is the best, and has been copied many times over in numerous inferior films.

When we write these reviews on the Internet, do we ever wonder how they get from here ( my home ) to there ( cyberspace )?  When you can send a fax to someone, do we ever wonder how that is possible?  The answer to these questions is No!  We never do. We never question what is reality and what may be someone's imagination. I was once told by my favourite English teacher ( Mr. Krisak ) that some people have the theory that we are all a part someone's elaborate dream. That is why we can do some of the things we can.  The 13th floor may just be that person having that dream.  It certainly subscribes to that theory.The film tells the story of a company that has finally figured out how to travel to another time through what can be described as virtual reality. They jack into a computer and it brings them to the thirties.  But this world is not quite perfect yet.  It is like the first draft of a screenplay. The tools are there but small things need to be tightened up.  That is why the smoke only seems to be on one side of the room and the coloring is a little off and people may only be two dimensional.  It needs some work. But then suddenly, in the real world, the creator of the program is killed mysteriously by someone that he knows.  The rest of the film is for us to figure out who done it.  And trying to figure that out is one of the intrigues of the movie.On a technical level, this film is terrific.  As a matter a fact, this film is really quite good in almost every way.  The only problem that I have with it ( as well ) is that it was marketed poorly.  And of course it came out right after The Matrix.
