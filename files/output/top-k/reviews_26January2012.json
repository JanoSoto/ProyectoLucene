More importantly, the two don't exclude each other. This movie definitely stands on its own, and I found it intriguing enough to make me want more. And so, I read the novel afterwards for additional information. This is the best adaptation I've seen so far &#x96; it captures the very spirit of the novel, the impending doom, the desperation.The cast is incredible. Richard Burton doesn't act, he simply IS O'Brien in every single detail. This is Burton's best role in my opinion &#x96; so truthful to Orwell's characterization, powerful and effortlessly nuanced. Burton's O'Brian must be one of the most memorable villains of the silver screen, truly frightening and fascinating, suitably enigmatic and brilliant, just like Orwell described him. His chemistry with John Hurt is superb. Hurt's portrayal of Winston is flawless. He inhabits the role, intellectually and physically. Winston's admiration and fascination for his tormentor, his will to survive, his relentless struggle and desire to remember, understand and overcome his condition are palpable in Hurt's outstanding performance. The complexity of Winston-O'Brian relationship is contained in one single look on Hurt's face, in body language. Mesmerizing acting, right there. Orwell's novel is a masterpiece in every aspect, and Director Michael Radford is so smart, he knows that nobody could write those dialogues better than Orwell himself. As a result, the conversations between Winston and O'Brian, as well as many other lines are taken from the novel, verbatim. Those scenes are visceral. Michael Radford's homage to the great writer is complete. The idea of filming 1984 on the same date and location indicated by the novel makes it both a product of the 80's AND a timeless creation. The music and the dream sequences, the sets are excellent - everything looks and feels incredibly real, and the viewer gets the taste of genuine terror - the kind of horror that is man-made, the kind that actually happened. This is not science-fiction, dystopia or whatever some people call it, but real history in so many aspects. Only those who have experienced communism first hand in the worst East-European dictatorship will agree that 1984 is not far from reality. Not at all, believe it or not. But ironically, as Orwell noted, people do have a short memory, and it's that ignorance that They are counting on. Yes, it's all true. The vaporization was actually put into practice by Stalin, and much earlier by the Romans. The manipulation of the language as a means to reshape the perception of reality is, again, no fiction. In my country, the Communist Party tried to eliminate certain words out of the vocabulary specifically for this purpose. Of course, behind closed doors, when there were no neighbors or friends around (informers that is), people were still talking - and that's only because the Party didn't have the technology of Big Brother. During communism, there were these so called foster homes, which were in fact extermination camps for handicapped children (the name of one such center is Cighid, look it up). The Re-education center from Pitesti, Romania, (known as the Pitesti Experiment), where the treatment of political prisoners between 1949-1952 made O'Brian's methods look like fun and games by comparison, is as real as its victims. The disastrous consequences of forced motherhood in communist Romania (by Ceausescu's decree) surpass by far any dystopian scenario. How about the spiritual genocide of communist propaganda and censorship, inflicted for decades by all possible means? The indoctrination of children starting kindergarten, the food ration and other abominations of the communist regime- these are not Orwellian fantasy, it's historical fact, lived by millions. It's understandable why someone who was born and raised in a democratic society might find these things to be simply unbelievable. Yet it all happened, and Orwell's depiction of totalitarianism is closer to reality than fiction. The ultimate politics manual and a warning for the ages, 1984 is alarmingly relevant even in today's democracy. A must-see for everyone, this is Cinema in its finest hour.

Strange enough it was a box office flop when it was released and it failed to win an academy award.The performance by James Stewart who plays George Bailey is one of the greatest on big screen by anyone anytime in the history. George Bailey makes you so engrossed with his emotions that it naturally calls for your empathy and you start living moments with him and start thinking for him. Even if you don't believe in the angels and God, the part where that comely angel starts alleviating suffering of George Bailey makes a profound impression on you and instills feelings of goodness in you. The second half just emphasizes the importance of life whereas the first one underscores the great character of George Bailey right from his childhood.You witness some instant karmic clean up in the second half and you see how the good deeds George Bailey had done come back to him saving him and making him realize the importance of life he had. Prior to that he lives with the impression of having sacrificed a lot for everyone else and that had some inner lack of satisfaction in his life and the accident which renders bankruptcy to him and his organization just evokes this karmic burden to the fore and then it seems that all the wrong things start happening with him, but then his good deeds come to his rescue. There are so many well-wishers who pray for him and then he realizes importance of life and accepts it the way it's and with this acceptance miracles start happening and money for which was about to end his life; comes rolling on its own and his brother says To George, the richest man in the town.

The milk of human kindness doesn't course through his veins. He is the kind of cop who believes that the ends justify the means and if somebody gets killed in the line of duty, tough stuff! Gene Hackman embodied a different breed of cop. Nothing about Popeye Doyle is sympathetic. He is an opportunistic. When you see a cop like Popeye, he is typically a villain. Director William Friedkin's The French Connection qualifies as a different kind of police procedural thriller. These cops are bloodhounds who make mistakes, but they never let their flaws get in their way. Indeed, the police in The French Connection are their own worst enemy. You know that you are watching a different kind of police movie when the villain--a suave Frenchman--outsmarts them at virtually every turn. The action takes place in New York City in 1971 with Popeye Doyle and his partner Cloudy (Roy Scheider)going after the mother of all drug busts.

The man whose name the car is registered in is a French television star Devereaux (Frederic De Pasquale of Blood in the Streets) who needs the money and treats the visit as a location tour for a TV show. An African-American informant warns Popeye that the junkies are eagerly awaiting a new shipment of junk. Our anti-heroes keep tabs on a suspicious character, Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco of Nixon), who is seen in the company of a big-time drug dealer, Weinstock (Harold Gary of Murder, Inc.),who Popeye knows is dirty. Popeye's superior Simonson (Eddie Egan of Prime Cut)reluctantly lets Popeye follow his hunch and gives him two wire-taps. When Charnier shows up in America, his murderous bodyguard Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi of March or Die) accompanies him. Nicoli is the kind of killer who shoots first and asks questions later.

The film tells a story of a young somber graduate student (who knew) who finds himself tangled up in an affair with his father's business partner's wife. Now, first off, I've heard nothing but great things about this movie. I heard that Hoffman was great in it, it had a great story, soundtrack, dialogue, etc. I can say that after everything I heard, this film definitely lived up to it's hype. The film is almost half a century old and yet I found myself (a generation Z college student) relating to it in a myriad of incredible ways. The fact that this film stands strong after an immense amount of time is, in my honest opinion, the most impressive aspect of the film. Dustin Hoffman is arguably the greatest actor in the business and he's in this movie - it's common knowledge that he's going to be good in it. All of the characters in this film were well written and well portrayed as well. Even the side characters were well-written. The script, in general, seems to be the epitome of good writing. The soundtrack is written by two of my most favorite artists - Simon And Garfunkel. Needless to say, it's timeless and unforgettable. The ending of the film was really well done, and the direction altogether seemed to be executed with the utmost precision. There were even a few editing techniques that impressed me in this film. Overall, The Graduate is a film that truly impressed me. Every person that was at once a student (pretty much everybody) should see and identify with this film. Really good stuff here.

The film is almost half a century old and yet I found myself (a generation Z college student) relating to it in a myriad of incredible ways. The fact that this film stands strong after an immense amount of time is, in my honest opinion, the most impressive aspect of the film. Dustin Hoffman is arguably the greatest actor in the business and he's in this movie - it's common knowledge that he's going to be good in it. All of the characters in this film were well written and well portrayed as well. Even the side characters were well-written. The script, in general, seems to be the epitome of good writing. The soundtrack is written by two of my most favorite artists - Simon And Garfunkel. Needless to say, it's timeless and unforgettable. The ending of the film was really well done, and the direction altogether seemed to be executed with the utmost precision. There were even a few editing techniques that impressed me in this film. Overall, The Graduate is a film that truly impressed me. Every person that was at once a student (pretty much everybody) should see and identify with this film. Really good stuff here.

This is how we open Prick Up Your Ears, and through the use of flashbacks we are told the story of these two men and what drew them together and then so far apart. The dynamic between Orton and Halliwell is fascinating and takes us through many important societal, psychological and social themes, but the whole thing is slightly diminished by the gimmick of telling it through a third party.After Orton's death, Peggy Ramsay helps John Lahr to write a novel based on Orton's life (a novel that the film itself is based on) and we are told their story through her telling the story. It's a really mundane, typical movie structure used to tell a biographical story but it's absolutely unnecessary when these characters and their story is already fascinating on it's own. Any time spent away from Orton and Halliwell feels needless and dampens the impact of when we actually get to see their story on screen, even though Vanessa Redgrave is quite good as Ramsay.Still, this is a slight detractor when the majority of the film is indeed focused on the growing lives of Orton and Halliwell, how they met and ultimately drove to violence. The progression of this relationship is truly fascinating, as we open on the end and slowly get to see what drives them to such animosity towards each other. I think the film hits on some interesting themes in regards to relationships that aren't touched on much in film; how love can eventually become more of an obligation than a passion, in some cases.The performances in the lead roles certainly help to highlight the emotional highs and lows of these two men. Alfred Molina is giving the more theatrical, outwardly emotive role of Halliwell, a man constantly at odds with himself and the world around him, constantly trying to hide who he is and grating the nerves of everyone around him. It's a character that could have easily been grating and unbearable to sit through, but Molina's skill manages to make him tragically sympathetic.The real star though is Gary Oldman, who knocks it out of the park as Orton. The character isn't as showy as Halliwell, but when you look back and consider the progression that he makes in this role, it's absolutely astonishing. It's a very internal performance but, in the way that the best actors are capable of doing, he absolutely transforms throughout the film, making a natural evolution without the audience even noticing. It feels so genuine when you're watching that you can't even tell, but when you get to the end and look back at the beginning, it's absolutely astonishing. He begins as this closeted young man who doesn't even understand who is and over the course of the film is opened into a freed young homosexual and eventually a conceited, arrogant playwright.The performance is tremendous in it's own right, but becomes even more impressive when you compare it to his portrayal as Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy the year before. In just one year he goes from an outwardly chaotic and theatrical extreme to such a quiet and internal one. It's absolutely mesmerizing what this man is capable of doing and if you watched these two performances one right after the other, you wouldn't be able to believe that this is the same actor portraying them.

Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers.The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been.Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie.Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers.Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature.One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt.The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home.The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him?If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot.Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series.Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here?The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

Like the Martrix, Dark City, and News from the Good Lord, this movie asks us the question of what is real. Reality isn't something that we believe is around us and thus things only exists because we believe that they exist, rather reality is a construct by some external force that we are immersed in.eXistenZ is a computer game and it is accessed though a meta-flesh game pod (more on the nature of the flesh later). When one has entered the game, the users entire reality changes to that of the game. To the user, the game in fact seems to be more real than reality itself. Thus through this comes the plot a group of radicals, known as the realists, are attempting to destroy the games and their creator Allegra Gellar.As with similar movies, I cannot go too deep into it as it will destroy the twists and the plots, but what I will explore here is the nature of reality, the malubility of flesh, and then point out a few interesting things.Basically reality in this film seems to be the place you inhabit when you are not inhabiting the game. The whole idea of reality seems to become warped and twisted as one descends into and out of the gaming environment, with Gellar bodyguard, Ted Pikul, not knowing the difference between reality and fantasy upon exiting the game. His comment is this no longer seems real to me. I guess the thing that we are seeing here is the whole idea of immersing ourselves into a fantasy world taken to the extreme.At this time, we have movies, novels, computer and roleplaying games in which we immerse ourselves into to escape from our reality. This movie takes this further where we enter into a completely different reality to escape our reality. But is there a limit on how far we can go before we loose track of our reality? Some people who descend into the realities that we create now have difficulty escaping from them, especially when the reality in which we live just doesn't seem to be all that pleasant. So why not escape into a reality where we are kings and lords and can squash those who upset us? But, there is a time when we should leave and face our realities. If some people cannot differentiate fantasy from reality now, what happens when the technology reaches a level where we can completely escape? I guess that is where we come to eXistenZ.Now there is the idea of the flesh. The flesh is a common element in horror type movies. This is because our flesh defines who we are and to violate one's flesh is the greatest violation that one can perform. When we look at somebody we look at their flesh, and that is how we define who they are. Thus when our flesh ceases to be our defining quality then that is when problems arise. This occurs when somebody betrays us, because the person that we thought we knew is not actually that person anymore.In this movie all of the technology is created from flesh. As such there is a some sort of sickening feeling as we watch these constructs, knowing that they form a part of the human body. The bioport, the hole through which the gamepod is attached, upsets Ted Pikul because he sees it placement as a violation of his body. The further we go into the movie, the more disturbing scenes we see, including the factory where the gamepods are made. Yet by the end we seem to be able to handle it much better. Finally, a few things that I should point out. First of all, notice how sensual Allegra Gellar is towards Ted Pikul.

Despite him not directing this one, I had always avoided it just because I didn't want to deal with another one of his shallow disasters of a script. However, I figured at this point I should at least watch it for Gary Oldman's performance, since a ton of people consider it one of their favorites from him. Oldman did not disappoint. As a white pimp who tries to act black, he crafted yet another unique character in his long career, one totally removed from any other character he's ever played.

With the exception of Tintin and Asterix I never really got into comic books as a kid, or even as an adult. In particular I never really liked Superman, but when one takes some of these comic books and step back and consider the world in which it is set it begins to take on a new life. Most comic book heroes tend to be incredibly wealthy, and in their spare time they are off saving the world for super villains.While it can be suggested that this is the case with the X-men, it is actually quite a lot more complicated than that. The Marvel Universe has three types of people. There are the normal humans, like you and I. Then there are the heroes, normal people who during their life have gained some form of superpower (such as Spiderman when he was bitten by the radioactive spider) and finally there are the mutants, people born with superpowers. It is these mutants that this particular film explores.The setup is complex. First of all you have the humans than fear the appearance of these mutants, and because of the powers that they possess, they are threatened, and as such are looking for ways to restrict and control these people that are appearing. Then there are the mutants themselves, divided into two opposing camps. There are the X-men, who are lead by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and they seek to protect and defend humanity, only using their powers for good. Then there are the mutants who follow Magneto (Ian Mackellan) who believe that because of their powers they should rule humanity. There are mutants that do not follow either of these two philosophies, but in this film it is these three groups that are fighting against each other.The movie opens with Rogue about to kiss her boyfriend, only to discover that when she does so she drains all of the life out of him, so she is forced to flee. Running to north Canada, she falls in with Logan (Hugh Jackman) otherwise known as Wolverine. After convincing him to let her travel with him (he is a loner), they are attacked by mutants who are loyal to Magneto, but the X-men arrive in time and take them back to the Xavier's School of the Gifted (the X-men's base). It is from there that we begin to learn of Magneto's plan to cripple humanity and pave the way for a mutant takeover.The question with this film is the continuity. While this is the first film in the series, there are films that occur before hand, such as Wolverine. In that film we discover that Wolverine and Sabretooth are brothers, but that does not seem to come out in this film. However, Wolverine has lost him memory (we don't know how that happened at this stage), but when he is told about Sabretooth, it seems to jog his memory slightly. As for Sabretooth, at the end of Wolverine he cries out 'nobody kills Wolverine but me!'. In this film this is suggested, particularly when Sabretooth takes a particular interest in Wolverine's dogtags.When one stands back a bit, and considers the movie as a whole, it really comes down to Magneto having a plan to make him more powerful and to rule over humanity, and the X-men going out to beat them. However, one thing that was a little disappointing was how easy it was to kill Sabretooth. He got blasted with a laser, and that was it. However, in Wolverine he was much harder to kill. He had claws, and like Wolverine, he could regenerate. We see none of that here, however one probably does have to consider the comics a bit more, something which I really do not have the time of inclination to do. However, while the plot may be a little dull, it is the background (as well as having some heaps cool actors) that attracts me to this film.There is also the issue of discrimination, and I guess it is a thing that we all need to confront. Discrimination is something created by fear. We fear that we are going to lose our place in the world, and because of that we will discriminate against another race. I remember in the 80s in Australia when the target of discrimination were the Asians, and it is true that the Asians are much more populous than us. We fear that by letting a few in, they will then flood in, and we will lose our identity and power in our country. It is the same fear that rules humanity here. Despite the X-men seeking the best for humanity, humanity fears them, and this is because it is clear that the mutants are so much more powerful than us. Discrimination is actually a theme that seems to not only run through all of the movies, but through all of the comics as well (though Wolverine has a somewhat different theme running through it, as does First Class).

Now I like Kurt Russell but I thought that this character was very contrived. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a cynical and selfish character rather than simply falling into the role. The character seemed to smooth out later in the movie, but at first it seemed to be very contrived.The plot is that the daughter of the president stole a disc that gives access to a defense network and gave it to an anti-American terrorist and the government blackmails Snake into getting it back for them. So he has to go to Los Angeles and get it back and for doing that he is given his freedom.As I said previously the setting is actually very good. The United States had become a cesspool of corruption and people feared for their lives. In the year 2000 a huge Earthquake struck Los Angeles turning it into an island. Later a new president was elected onto a purely moral platform and he declared that Los Angeles was not apart of the United States and would exile people guilty of moral crimes there. The United States thus became a theocracy and a police state where all who refused to be Christian were considered dissidents and exiled.The ending was good, but bad as well. Snake Blisken walks out on top and the bad guys - the Americans and the terrorists, were all killed. The president, who was a sadistic man corrupted by power and deluded by this to believe that he could change America and make it a state of morality. In the end his beautiful state is destroyed, all through the actions of Snake Blisken, who simply did not care.Another thing this movie addresses is the reliance that we have on technology. The key to this are the good old fashioned stick matches. They were the only non-technological things in the movie, and they symbolised that Snake did not need technology to survive. Throughout the movie, the President uses the threat of destroying people's technology as a measure to keep control, but he relies on technology to do this. In the end Snake uses the Presidents technology against him and walks off lighting a cigarette with the matches showing us that he really does not need technology to survive.I guess the reason that I gave this movie such a high rating was that it got better after the start, but there were still some really bad things about it, such as the scene where Snake surfs a tidal wave and catches up with Steve Buschemi's character.

My friend's comment is that it is early 80's but I still think that it is corny. The date in which is was produced is irrelevant, but I think the whole reason behind the corniness is that it is a kids movie. Elliot, the main character, is a kid and he is designed for kids to relate to him. There is little Drew Barrymore for the little girlies and Elliot's older brother for the young teenagers. In essence though, this movie was aimed at the children and as such it was successful.There were facets of this movie that I did not like. First was the marketing strategy. It was released in 82 in the cinemas and released about 92 on video. It disappeared in the intervening time so that when it was released everybody would rush out and buy it. Actually, it is a very clever marketing strategy the only reason that I was annoyed with it was that they did it purely for the money and I saw it as a way of suckering me in to purchasing, or hiring, it on video. In reality, it doesn't matter when the movie appears on video, if it is a good movie then I will hire it. The reason behind ET is that they pulled a money making ploy which put me off.About the movie itself ET is a fantasy movie. It is not trying to be realistic or conspiratorial it is a fantasy and as a fantasy it succeeds. The scenes with ET flying through the air on a bicycle trying to escape the evil US government scientists are the most fantastic of this movie. Even so we see elements of social problems within this movie, such as the infringement of the government on human rights. There is a basic hatred of centralised government and this movie brings it up with the scientists studying ET. But moreso this seems to be also outlining the gap between the adults and the children. The children want to play with ET and want to look after him. They see him as a friend, where as the adults see him as a monster and a freak that needs to be studied.Relationship is the important part of ET. It is the relationship between ET and Elliot. The relationship is a purely symbiotic one, something that simply does not exist in this world. It is not exploring human relationship but a fantasy relationship of symbiosis. What I mean by this relationship is that there is a psychic link between the participants of this relationship. This is natural for ET's race, and we see this with the resurrection scene. This scene is not intentionally mimicing that of Christ's death and resurrection, but rather ET dies because the symbiotic link between him and his fellow aliens has been broken, but when the link is restored, he comes back to life. We do not know if he really did die because ET is not a terrestrial being and thus we cannot say how they operate. In essence, this movie is about the relationship between a boy and an alien, but the relationship is not on a human level but on a fantasy, idealistic level.I was a little annoyed with this movie because I am simply too old for it. True we all have a child like part of us inside, but I was simply irritated by the cuteness of the movie and the corniness of the child relationships, especially with the one girl who makes a short appearance as Elliot's love interest that doesn't hang around.

Elliot, the main character, is a kid and he is designed for kids to relate to him. There is little Drew Barrymore for the little girlies and Elliot's older brother for the young teenagers. In essence though, this movie was aimed at the children and as such it was successful.There were facets of this movie that I did not like. First was the marketing strategy. It was released in 82 in the cinemas and released about 92 on video. It disappeared in the intervening time so that when it was released everybody would rush out and buy it. Actually, it is a very clever marketing strategy the only reason that I was annoyed with it was that they did it purely for the money and I saw it as a way of suckering me in to purchasing, or hiring, it on video. In reality, it doesn't matter when the movie appears on video, if it is a good movie then I will hire it. The reason behind ET is that they pulled a money making ploy which put me off.About the movie itself ET is a fantasy movie. It is not trying to be realistic or conspiratorial it is a fantasy and as a fantasy it succeeds. The scenes with ET flying through the air on a bicycle trying to escape the evil US government scientists are the most fantastic of this movie. Even so we see elements of social problems within this movie, such as the infringement of the government on human rights. There is a basic hatred of centralised government and this movie brings it up with the scientists studying ET. But moreso this seems to be also outlining the gap between the adults and the children. The children want to play with ET and want to look after him. They see him as a friend, where as the adults see him as a monster and a freak that needs to be studied.Relationship is the important part of ET. It is the relationship between ET and Elliot. The relationship is a purely symbiotic one, something that simply does not exist in this world. It is not exploring human relationship but a fantasy relationship of symbiosis. What I mean by this relationship is that there is a psychic link between the participants of this relationship. This is natural for ET's race, and we see this with the resurrection scene. This scene is not intentionally mimicing that of Christ's death and resurrection, but rather ET dies because the symbiotic link between him and his fellow aliens has been broken, but when the link is restored, he comes back to life. We do not know if he really did die because ET is not a terrestrial being and thus we cannot say how they operate. In essence, this movie is about the relationship between a boy and an alien, but the relationship is not on a human level but on a fantasy, idealistic level.I was a little annoyed with this movie because I am simply too old for it. True we all have a child like part of us inside, but I was simply irritated by the cuteness of the movie and the corniness of the child relationships, especially with the one girl who makes a short appearance as Elliot's love interest that doesn't hang around.

What a brilliant performance in this movie. If you have to see this movie, just watch it for the performance that this guy delivers. The expressions, the dialog delivery, the change of emotions, the profound manner he ensures he delivery every single word and every single action is something you would get to relish during the entire course of this movie. Before i forget that I should be mentioning something about the movie as well and not only about Al Pacino who seem to have mesmerized me with his performance that I am not able to talk about anything else, the movie is a master piece in itself... Very good story line up, a big slap on the judicial system and the way it functions. Beautifully directed and with the kind of fine actors working in this movie, I am sure the director wouldn't have had much of a trouble getting such fine actors to act the way he wanted. See the brilliance of Al Pacino and every body else and I am sure you would be praising it all the way just like I am. Have fun watching it.

Yeah. Right. What would they care? Which oil companies? Time and President Reagan proved the premise of this film to be false, a self-serving propaganda piece perhaps crafted to make Jimmy Carter, look good and win a second term. This would likely have resulted in us speaking Russian, those fortunate enough to survive, wouldn't it?The oil companies along with the American people in 1980 were enduring The Carter Glory Years, when both moslem radical and soviet thugs held America hostage, with the apparent approval of the commander in chief. One of the ways in which these intergenerational, symbiotically relatedhead lice held us for ransom was by means of 'oil embargoes'. OPEC constantly engineered 'oil shortages' throughout the 70s, starting in the fall of '73.The Carter Glory Years featured inane 'Big Bad Oil' fairy tales, invented by leftists and repeated by the uninformed. One tale was that oil companies were sitting on trillions of gallons of oil, awaiting a mysterious price hike. Another was the fatuous muth about 'the guy up in Maine who invented a seventy - the number steadily rose from seventy to one hundred to two hundred and beyond - mile per gallon carburetor but Big Bad Oil Companies and Evil Detroit stole his patent and destroyed his plans.That's the false premise of this film, which explains why it's patently stupid, boring, and false. If we'd only stop and THINK about that which we hear, eh? Ask yourself, what oil company and\/or car maker could get away with it? Answer none. Ask yourself, what oil company and\/or car maker wouldn't love to be the first to market a new car line with a two-hundred mile per gallon carburetor? Every one would love to do so, wouldn't they?This fairy tale's silliness was compounded by the fact that by the 1980s, computer controlled carburetors were being supplanted by fuel injection. That said, a gallon of gas can push a given weight only so far and no more, no matter what some 'guy up in Maine' claims to have invented.With Hollywood, if you want to know the truth, turn the lies in its movies 180 degrees around and you'll have it.Interestingly, within a couple years of The Formula's release, President Reagan got government out of the oil business, and gas became plentiful and cheap. This permanently angered The Left as well as sore loser Mr. Peanuts, but facts are facts.Would you expect any different from Hollywood? Why? Didn't both Lenin and Stalin say, 'give me Hollywood and I'll control the world'? You think they just sat back went to sleep after saying that?Marta Keller is beautiful to behold and George C. Scott is as always, a barely contained hi-voltage dynamo of psychic energy.Boring? It's no different from British horror films in which the monster never shows up for curtain call but instead you listen - for two hours running time - to professorial British gents discussing the beast as they sip Port in the walnut panelled drawing room of a country estate located a discrete distance to the west of London.Paul Vincent ZecchinoMassive Critic at Critial MassManasoviet Key, Florida26 January, 2012 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" By all means, see this film if you wish to understand the moronic, disingenuous, commie-rat mindset which infested the 1970s.'The film the oil companies don't want you so see'???
