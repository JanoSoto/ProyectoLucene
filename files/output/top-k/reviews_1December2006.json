This film was shot in color & wide screen & it still looks plush & alive even now. The way to watch it is when Turner Classic films is running it in wide screen too. This film is one of the only times Danny Kaye & Bing Crosby worked together & it is a shame it did not happen more. They are delightful in this film. Rosemary Clooney & Vera Ellen are too. This Paramount production was one of the most expensive they produced the year it was released & it was also number 1 in the box office.While the story is very simplistic by today's standards & even when it was released in 1954, it doesn't matter. You put your brain away & enjoy this holiday film as a rare chance to see some veteran performers from the World War 2 era entertain you. There's lots of musical numbers & dancing from the era of the big musical. All of it is well staged, & the music is at the height previous to rock & roll era. If your into old films, go back to the mid-1940's when Bing Crosby did the song White Christmas for the first time on film in Paramounts Holiday Inn as there are a couple of comparisons to note. First, Bing sings the song solo in the first film where in this 1954 version the entire ensemble (cast) sing it together. Second, the Holiday Inn is the same set used for the Pine Tree Inn in the second film. Paramount saved some money on sets there. Funny, Crosby gets demoted too in a way. In the first film he actually owns the Holiday Inn where in this film, his former Major-general owns it. The scripts between the 2 are quite different too. Fred Astaire is in the first one in 1942 too. In a way, some folks consider this an inferior remake to Holiday Inn, but to me there are vast differences in the films. White Christmas fits the era it was made, as 1954 was a feel good era where every problem was always being solved. An interesting thing about this film, it incorporates the power of the television media into the plot already in 1954. Most folks then did not realize how far that power would grow into todays national fixation where if something is on TV, too often people believe it as true. Back in 1954, people were still intelligent enough to know when something was not true on its media. That is why you don't care about a strong story line in this film. Everything is fake, but back then fake was fine with people, as long as it was harmless & entertaining.

Life seems to be draining out of her, she's becoming passive. She goes to a retreat in the countryside for people who believe they're suffering from environmental illness led by a guru who's just full of homey New Age psychobabble. It's like a summer camp for adults, but they don't seem to be having very much fun. The other patients seem equally wan and passive as Carol. They hang on the guru's every word. I haven't been to such a retreat myself but the filmic rendering seemed authentic to me. Carol feels better, for a week or so, then a car goes by on a road nearby and she runs in terror trying to find safety from the fumes, or whatever it is she thinks is effecting her.I have known people who suffered from environmental illness. Everything and nothing in particular seemed to be poisoning their systems, and their symptoms were equally diffuse and unspecific. The ones I knew did not look to be really suffering, but instead appeared to rather enjoy the distinction that their unique and trendy illness gave them, though they constantly complained about unnamed chemicals that were attacking them. Perhaps it was civilization itself that they feared and which they ultimately blamed as their abuser.The film is straightforward in its telling Carol's story. It reports what is going on but does not take a position. Is this all in their heads? Is the environmental illness a placeholder for a severe and chronic malaise with civilization in general, or Southern California living in particular? Are they just a bunch of narcissists who can only get attention by being ill? Are they physically super sensitive to their environment? The movie doesn't try to answer any of these questions, and that's a cop-out. The film has been praised by other reviewers for this ambiguity but for me that is a major drawback. Is the film maker saying that they all share a common delusion? In that case the material would make a good satire. In any event, this movie is a downer--the patients appear to be caught in a self-created purgatory where there is little hope of escape. It is very boring to watch life slipping away from them without any logical explanation. In a documentary this lack of explanation would be acceptable, but because it's fiction it is dramatically unsatisfying. Here's the spoiler so you won't have to suffer through 2 hours of nothing Carol doesn't get better. She is offered a tiny igloo of a house; presumably inside its cramped confines she is more protected from the toxins in the environment. She has retreated to a sort of womb or tomb. Essentially her life is over. This film may be considered to be artistic achievement, but it is like watching a slow-motion train wreck. It would be sad, but it's hard to feel sympathy for the pale, passive, dimwitted Carol.

But Ladyhawke is one of his more overlooked films from the 80s. A shame, because with this film, Donner took a decent stab at the fantasy genre, and crafted a fairly original love story with a welcome injection of wit.Phillipe Gaston (winningly played by Matthew Broderick) is a sort of Mediaeval Artful Dodger. A pickpocket thrown into prison, we first see him grumbling his way through an escape attempt (This is not unlike escaping my mother's womb. God what a memory!).He eventually succeeds, being the first person to ever escape the dungeons of Aquila. The High Bishop (a hissable John Wood) sends the guards after him, because he rules over the people with an iron fist, and if word gets out the dungeons are not impregnable, it could inspire rebellion.Gaston gets as far as the countryside before the guards catch up to him. There's a wonderful action scene here where Gaston must outmanoeuvre them at every step while hanging from trellises, donning disguises and even crawling on all fours. It almost resembles vintage Errol Flynn.But Gaston is rescued by Navarre (a slightly hammy Rutger Hauer). Navarre recruits Gaston as his sidekick, because he wants to launch an attack on the castle and kill the Bishop. Since Gaston escaped from there, Navarre figures he might be useful.Navarre is almost never seen without a hawk, a hawk he has tremendous affection for. When its night, Navarre disappears, and a wolf is seen prowling around in his place. As well as a beautiful woman, Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer).Gaston is puzzled by Navarre being visible by day, and Isabeau by night. But when the hawk is injured, Navarre sends Gaston to Father Imperius (a great performance from Leo McKern), a disgraced monk for help. Imperius fills in the blanks.The Bishop wanted Isabeau for himself, but she loved Navarre. So if he couldn't have her, no man would. By making a pact with the Devil, he cast a spell on them both to keep them apart. By day, Navarre is human and Isabeau is the hawk. And by night, she is human and he is the wolf.Now a part of this tragic tale, Gaston and Imperius join with Navarre and Isabeau to break the spell, and stop the Bishop. Ladyhawke really is an unappreciated treat. It would be one of Richard Donner's last really good films for a long while. There is something unique to the story, and Donner manages to create equal parts poignancy to the situation, as well as humour and excitement.Rutger Hauer is a bit of an odd choice for the part of a virtuous knight, and if truth be told, he always seems much more comfortable in the part of an eye-rolling psycho. But he's not bad in Ladyhawke. He's up to the action scenes, and does occasionally get some real moments to shine. There's a very funny scene when Navarre gets extremely paranoid about what Gaston and Isabeau might get up to when she's in human form and Navarre isn't.Michelle Pfeiffer is OK. She certainly looks lovely in her first starring role, but as always, she still comes off as a little too emotionless. She doesn't get as many scenes as Hauer, and they hardly share any screen-time, but there is one scene with the two that makes an impression. A beautifully shot scene where for just a fleeting moment between sunrise and sunset, they glimpse each other in human form, a moment that's beautifully illuminated by sunlight. For that one moment, you really sense their love, and their loss.But it's in the supporting performances where Ladyhawke really entertains. In a part perfectly suited to Matthew Broderick, he gets one of his best roles here. In fact its probably his second best performance after Ferris Bueller. Gaston gets all the best lines and gives the film great energy whenever he's around. And special mention should also go to Leo McKern as the monk who betrayed Navarre and Isabeau to the Bishop, and now wants to make amends. Its a similar character to the one Patrick Troughton played in Donner's Omen, which co-starred McKern.The method Donner comes up with to break the spell is clever, and its a genuinely uplifting moment when Navarre and Isabeau stand face to face after so long apart. The only downer on the whole film is the misplaced contemporary rock soundtrack. It only serves as a distraction, and is completely inappropriate to the tone of the film. But other than that, Ladyhawke is a wonderful, magical fable.It might interest people to know that an episode of Charmed ripped off the plot of Ladyhawke wholesale, and even the solution to the lovers dilemma was identical. I'm amazed Donner didn't sue for copyright infringement. Oh well, at least it shows Ladyhawke is held in regard in some places. After all, imitation is the highest form of flattery.

Since Gaston escaped from there, Navarre figures he might be useful.Navarre is almost never seen without a hawk, a hawk he has tremendous affection for. When its night, Navarre disappears, and a wolf is seen prowling around in his place. As well as a beautiful woman, Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer).Gaston is puzzled by Navarre being visible by day, and Isabeau by night. But when the hawk is injured, Navarre sends Gaston to Father Imperius (a great performance from Leo McKern), a disgraced monk for help. Imperius fills in the blanks.The Bishop wanted Isabeau for himself, but she loved Navarre. So if he couldn't have her, no man would. By making a pact with the Devil, he cast a spell on them both to keep them apart. By day, Navarre is human and Isabeau is the hawk. And by night, she is human and he is the wolf.Now a part of this tragic tale, Gaston and Imperius join with Navarre and Isabeau to break the spell, and stop the Bishop. Ladyhawke really is an unappreciated treat. It would be one of Richard Donner's last really good films for a long while. There is something unique to the story, and Donner manages to create equal parts poignancy to the situation, as well as humour and excitement.Rutger Hauer is a bit of an odd choice for the part of a virtuous knight, and if truth be told, he always seems much more comfortable in the part of an eye-rolling psycho. But he's not bad in Ladyhawke. He's up to the action scenes, and does occasionally get some real moments to shine. There's a very funny scene when Navarre gets extremely paranoid about what Gaston and Isabeau might get up to when she's in human form and Navarre isn't.Michelle Pfeiffer is OK. She certainly looks lovely in her first starring role, but as always, she still comes off as a little too emotionless. She doesn't get as many scenes as Hauer, and they hardly share any screen-time, but there is one scene with the two that makes an impression. A beautifully shot scene where for just a fleeting moment between sunrise and sunset, they glimpse each other in human form, a moment that's beautifully illuminated by sunlight. For that one moment, you really sense their love, and their loss.But it's in the supporting performances where Ladyhawke really entertains. In a part perfectly suited to Matthew Broderick, he gets one of his best roles here. In fact its probably his second best performance after Ferris Bueller. Gaston gets all the best lines and gives the film great energy whenever he's around. And special mention should also go to Leo McKern as the monk who betrayed Navarre and Isabeau to the Bishop, and now wants to make amends. Its a similar character to the one Patrick Troughton played in Donner's Omen, which co-starred McKern.The method Donner comes up with to break the spell is clever, and its a genuinely uplifting moment when Navarre and Isabeau stand face to face after so long apart. The only downer on the whole film is the misplaced contemporary rock soundtrack. It only serves as a distraction, and is completely inappropriate to the tone of the film. But other than that, Ladyhawke is a wonderful, magical fable.It might interest people to know that an episode of Charmed ripped off the plot of Ladyhawke wholesale, and even the solution to the lovers dilemma was identical. I'm amazed Donner didn't sue for copyright infringement. Oh well, at least it shows Ladyhawke is held in regard in some places. After all, imitation is the highest form of flattery.

In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate\/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn't put me off. I think the certificate should've been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn't like them at all and she's also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can't put up with being somebody she doesn't want, she bolts out of Titanic's main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she's doing and insists that she doesn't drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren't sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she's engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of Titanic. He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she's flying and at that point they kiss. It's shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it's just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack Jack when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you!, sadly, what I say is you mean IF the ship docks! and from there all the tragedy of Titanic's collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack's is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, I always win, Jack - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that's also too emotional to be true. But there's more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after the ship's arse snaps as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it's too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. You have got to promise me that you'll survive, that you'll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you'll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise. He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there's a boat to save them - but he doesn't answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I'll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, Titanic is irresistible. Over 15s won't be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive Gone with the Wind. Rose may be feisty but she's certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag! Titanic is VERY underrated and Gone With The Wind is VERY overrated - absurd but, cest la vie!Gloria Stuart was 86 when she starred as old Rose and with this film she is most associated. Her final film was Lands of Plenty in 2004. The following year, she contracted cancer but had always appeared well to the public eye. She also looked frail in her old age.

Walter Brennan played Gary Cooper's cynical hobo friend almost to perfection, at least as well as the role could be played given the flawed script. He saw the conventional world as one full of heelots (lots of heels) who were only after the other guy's money. Cooper, as John Doe, handed in a credible performance, as well, and Barbara Stanwick, when she wasn't overacting, was generally interesting to watch and easy on the eyes. The actors portraying the newspaper editor and the media magnate were also effective. But this story and this script, while reaching for greater meaning, had the unfortunate tendency to fall back on schmaltzy clichés and flag-waving propaganda and that kept the movie from realizing its full promise and potential. Director Capra, whose talents were greatly admired in the movie industry, didn't seem able to make up his mind if he wanted this thing to be a somewhat saccharine, albeit uplifting Christmas movie about people forgetting their petty differences and coming together, or something quite different, that being a cynical and gritty political statement about the rich and powerful's compelling need to use and abuse the common man. The movie tried to combine elements of both themes yet it only partly succeeded on either score. In contrast, It's a Wonderful Life, which attempted much the same thing, succeeded where Meet John Doe missed the mark. It was a far more effective Christmas movie, yet at the same time contained significant elements that examined dishonesty, cruelty, and greed. Still, Meet John Doe, a less admired, less focused, and less consistent effort featured some compelling scenes. I thought the argument between Doe and DB Norton, the fascist media magnate who was hoping to launch a presidential bid on the strength of the John Doe Clubs, was probably the best scene in the film, although Walter Brennan's speech about the heelots was also quite good. The mob scene, reminiscent of Christ's crucifixion, no doubt was intended to be the film's most powerful sequence, and on balance it was fairly gripping. Unfortunately, it contained obvious continuity errors that detracted seriously from its believability. For example, Norton's troopers grabbed Doe to stop him from speaking to the crowd and exposing Norton's evil scheme, then all of a sudden, they released him and stood back, allowing him to weakly defend himself in front of the mike. Whereas the mob seemed to sympathize with him even when disillusioned by the disturbing allegations leveled against him, suddenly they were out for his blood. It didn't really add up, at least not as it unfolded. The last scene in the movie, where Doe climbed City Hall intending to commit suicide, aspired to be a very moving moment but was even more flawed. The magnate and his fellow conspirators were on hand and they didn't want him to go through with it because it might spoil their attempts to salvage what was left of their meglomaniacal aims, but evidently they felt somewhat guilty for their part in his destruction. Doe simply brushed them aside, and in what was perhaps Coop's most convincing moment, he was just about to leap to his death when Barbara Stanwick dashed forward to stop him. Unfortunately, that's when the movie took a real nosedive. Her lines were painfully contrived and delivered in a thoroughly unconvincing manner. As such, the ending was like the rest of the flick, inching up on something quite good and then falling flat.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 December 2006","score":"","review":" 　　A good movie moves people and makes them want to watch it twice. Though the translation isn't perfect so that I didn't understand it fully, but which didn't prevent me from flooding inside. 　　 　　For the teacher, John Keating 　　A teacher, who asked his students to rip the preface of the book, who taught every lesson in a unique way, named Keating. You may discover his ambition as well as his misgivings at his first appearing in the opening ceremony of a new term. And I found him a great teacher who made students realize  Carpe Diem  which means  to seize the day  in his first lesson, who asked his boys to stand on the desk  to view the world in an new way , who inspired Todd Anderson whose huge inner talent broke out then, who guided Neal to negotiate with his father and comforted him and assured him not being trapped, who cried badly while discovering the poetry anthology, five centuries of verse, which he had read before and wrote inspiring words on, in Neal's desk, who left at last with his thanks and smile, who is respectable. You may consider Keating had ended with a failure, for his students died or dispelled, for the Dead Society Society broke up and the school turned back to its original tradition at last. But you can't ignore the significant influence he made on his students, on Todd, on Neal, on each member in the Society (though he didn't encourage his students to found it at all), on everyone including us, the spectators. You also can't deny what the boys behaved in the last scene is exactly Keating's triumph. 　　 　　For Neil Perry 　　The excellent guy who owns a virtue of optimism, kind-heart, responsibility, persistence, passion and leadership. And he is also the new founder of Dead Poets Society, an age later. With Neal's encouragement and organization, the Society made its sense. A friend told me that he realized someone would die in the first scene, the picture of former members of the Society, together with the heavy melody in the movie. However, I didn't sense it until Neal took on the coronal and off, in the moon light, naked. Anyway, it's beyond my expectation that he had chosen death as the way to fight against his father's arrangement, order and reproach. Are dreams so gentle in front of the facts? While, just as most poets did, he didn't find a hope in the very verge of despair. 　　How could fate so cruel to such a good boy? I was perplexed, though I didn't burst into tears, a tough stir meant more, and the anguish must be much easier than Todd and Keating. 　　 　　For Todd Anderson 　　Neal's roommate, the boy who is a definitely good student, with all the merits called for in the traditional and principled high school, who turned downed down to go to the carve at first, who wrote and revised his own poem again and again by himself, whose face turned red and anxious in the class while Keating asking students to read their own poems on the platform. And he refused the offer as usual. Nevertheless, he's talent was discovered by Mr. Keating, his captain. He shouted his teeth is sweating by the inspiration of Keating, and his marvelous inner talent shook everyone, Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.

Though the translation isn't perfect so that I didn't understand it fully, but which didn't prevent me from flooding inside. 　　 　　For the teacher, John Keating 　　A teacher, who asked his students to rip the preface of the book, who taught every lesson in a unique way, named Keating. You may discover his ambition as well as his misgivings at his first appearing in the opening ceremony of a new term. And I found him a great teacher who made students realize  Carpe Diem  which means  to seize the day  in his first lesson, who asked his boys to stand on the desk  to view the world in an new way , who inspired Todd Anderson whose huge inner talent broke out then, who guided Neal to negotiate with his father and comforted him and assured him not being trapped, who cried badly while discovering the poetry anthology, five centuries of verse, which he had read before and wrote inspiring words on, in Neal's desk, who left at last with his thanks and smile, who is respectable. You may consider Keating had ended with a failure, for his students died or dispelled, for the Dead Society Society broke up and the school turned back to its original tradition at last. But you can't ignore the significant influence he made on his students, on Todd, on Neal, on each member in the Society (though he didn't encourage his students to found it at all), on everyone including us, the spectators. You also can't deny what the boys behaved in the last scene is exactly Keating's triumph. 　　 　　For Neil Perry 　　The excellent guy who owns a virtue of optimism, kind-heart, responsibility, persistence, passion and leadership. And he is also the new founder of Dead Poets Society, an age later. With Neal's encouragement and organization, the Society made its sense. A friend told me that he realized someone would die in the first scene, the picture of former members of the Society, together with the heavy melody in the movie. However, I didn't sense it until Neal took on the coronal and off, in the moon light, naked. Anyway, it's beyond my expectation that he had chosen death as the way to fight against his father's arrangement, order and reproach. Are dreams so gentle in front of the facts? While, just as most poets did, he didn't find a hope in the very verge of despair. 　　How could fate so cruel to such a good boy? I was perplexed, though I didn't burst into tears, a tough stir meant more, and the anguish must be much easier than Todd and Keating. 　　 　　For Todd Anderson 　　Neal's roommate, the boy who is a definitely good student, with all the merits called for in the traditional and principled high school, who turned downed down to go to the carve at first, who wrote and revised his own poem again and again by himself, whose face turned red and anxious in the class while Keating asking students to read their own poems on the platform. And he refused the offer as usual. Nevertheless, he's talent was discovered by Mr. Keating, his captain. He shouted his teeth is sweating by the inspiration of Keating, and his marvelous inner talent shook everyone, Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.

Knowing the talent he possessed, how did he keep from killing the heads of the studios? Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal, and Brandon de Wilde star in Hud, an unsparing 1963 morality story about a Texas rancher, Homer Bannon, his bastard son, Hud, his housekeeper, and his grandson. The bastard, of course, is Paul Newman, who doesn't have a decent bone in his body. People on this board have said it's his greatest performance. He's given so many great ones, it's hard to say for me. An astounding actor, and he gets a run for his money from Douglas, who plays the moral center of the story.The two characters couldn't be more opposite, as one sees in their treatment of a potential run of hoof and mouth disease that could wipe out Homer's entire herd. Hud wants to ship the whole herd out and possibly infect other people's cattle - he couldn't care less. Homer won't hear of it.If you love animals, this is a difficult film to watch, but it's worth it. Melvyn Douglas is absolutely gut-wrenching as Homer, a proud man who loves the land and his cattle and who has no use for his son, who smashed his car and killed Homer's other son. de Wilde is Hud's nephew who admires him and wants to emulate him but as time goes by, realizes that Hud is made of ice. de Wilde doesn't give an emotional performance - he's almost more of an observer. It works well here amidst the very contained Douglas and the free and easy Newman. You can see he's a good kid trying to grow up and decide what kind of man to be.Patricia Neal is the housekeeper; she and Douglas both deservingly won Oscars. Her delivery is wry and knowing; she can't help being attracted to the virile Hud but she knows he's trouble and never gives in to her desires willingly.As much as I love Newman and think he's one of the greatest actors ever to hit the movies, for me, Douglas' searing performance is the one that will stay with me. It's easy to see why in 1963 this was such a dramatic breakthrough for Newman, but 43 years and many roles later, we're more familiar with what he can do. We know he can play a cold bastard now. His greatest performances for me will always be those in the The Verdict and The Hustler, both of which called for many more nuances of character. Hud represents '60s disillusionment - which as the decade went on was only going to get worse; this is one of the reasons it is an iconic role. For me, Newman had more surprises in store.Brilliant performances, excellent direction, stark photography, Hud is a great American film, not easily forgotten once seen.

However, Fleming came to be a great friend to the new 007 in a very short time and came to feel that the producers had picked the right man for the job indeed.There were changes from the original book to be sure, but substituting radioactive materials for rare bird dung (guano) was probably a good choice. There is danger and a great villain who, thankfully, was not an orangutan as Fleming friend Noel Coward suggested. It may have been because the Bond author asked Coward in a telegram to play the villain of the piece Dr. No, to which he reportedly answered, My dearest Ian. No No No No No! This film shows a rough Mickey Spillane type super spy as the author envisioned and then some. And the delicious Ursula Andress among the equally delicious scenery of Jamaica makes it a treat regardless of the obvious dating. So many rough and tumble scenes that make it an adventure along with the pretty women and the introduction of a character that remains to this day as one of the most popular in film history.

To see the formidable Klaus Kinski is always a great pleasure, but to hear him talk in a dubbed voice is just downright atrocious and almost a crime against nature! No matter how beautiful the cinematography and filming locations remain, seeing this film in a wrong language can simply ruin everything. That being said, Herzog's interpretation of the legendary Dracula story is a very, very strange movie! This shouldn't surprise anybody, as this director &#150; as well as his regular protagonist Klaus Kinski &#150; upholds his eccentric reputation with every movie he completes, but still this is one of the weirdest projects in the history of the horror genre. Even though Bram Stoker's Dracula tale spawned a whole lot of different film versions, Herzog's film is a direct remake of the silent F.W. Murnau classic of 1922. That film is generally considered as one of the all-time greatest genre classics and thus it was quite an ambitious and even perilous idea of Herzog to update it. The tone and atmosphere are very similar to the original film, meaning that Count Dracula is portrayed as a dismal and almost piteous creature that lives in total isolation and exclusively longs for some (female) affection. He is, however, the bringer of doom, forced to feed on human blood and always surrounded by an army of ravenous rats. Young Jonathan Harker, played by Bruno Ganz who recently startled the world with his mesmerizing performance of Adolf Hitler in Der Untergang, is assigned to travel to Dracula's remote castle in the mountains of Transylvania and present him the buying contracts for a house in Wismar. Upon seeing a picture of Harker's lovely wife Lucy (that's right, NOT Mina), the Count gets obsessed with her image. He puts a spell on Jonathan and prepares his own journey to Wismar, accompanied by his army of rats that carry around the plague. It's most remarkable how, in this film version, Dracula's terror affects an entire town! Not just Jonathan Harker and his wife Lucy suffer, but the coming of Nosferatu (= bringer of plagues) threatens the whole population of Wismar. The most intense sequences of the film involve long rows of people carrying the coffins of their departed family members or the increasing mass-hysteria among the last survivors. Other than for the fascinating modifications in the basic screenplay, Nosferatu is highly recommended viewing for the staggering photography. Werner Herzog's talented & detailed eye for beautiful landscape images widely surpasses every other horror director's visions and this is easily the artiest vampire movie ever filmed. Harker's journey through Transylvania, with its fog-enshrouded nights and uncanny mountain roads, is paralyzing to observe and the ominous images of Dracula's somber castle are equally impressive. Klaus Kinski is indescribably brilliant, as always, and thus far the ONLY actor whose charisma alone sends cold shivers of fear down my spine. His performance, along with the photography and not to forget the masterful use of music, all contribute in making this one of the most unique horror films of the 70's decade. It has some flaws too, but they're mere details and really insignificant compared to all the great aspects.

However, while I'm not normally a tremendous fan of musicals, I found this a wonderfully entertaining film adaptation.Of course this movie tells the tale of the English phonetics expert, Dr. Henry Higgins, who wagers with his colleague, Colonel Pickering, that he can transform the gritty Cockney flower seller, Eliza Doolittle, into a sophisticated lady simply by improving her diction, and pass her off as a Duchess at the upcoming Embassy Ball.Professor Higgins must be the most outrageous, most insufferable character ever to grace the silver screen, yet I loved this absurd champion of the Queen's English! Rex Harrison is so perfect, so hilariously entertaining in the role that I can imagine no one else filling it. I'd also sing the praises of Wilfrid Hyde-White as Higgins' kind, gentlemanly academic cohort, Colonel Pickering. Likewise, Stanley Holloway is brilliant as Eliza's ne'er do well father, that spirited scoundrel Alfred P. Doolittle.Regarding Eliza herself, there has been much controversy as to who should have been given the role, Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews, and I can thoroughly understand supporters of both these lovely ladies. Certainly Andrews had the voice and it has been argued, might have played the Cockney flower seller Eliza more convincingly. I feel that her career is one she can justifiably be proud of without having any regrets for missing out on the role she apparently captured so well on the stage. However, I found Hepburn perfect as Eliza and personally had no objections to her casting or any problem with the dubbing. I found her transformation from flower seller to elegant lady completely believable, her appearance stunning and demeanour impeccable at the Embassy Ball, her underlying intelligence, kindness, and wit frequently apparent, her original plight and later her unrecognized feelings for Higgins poignantly portrayed.The costumes are of course incredible, with the highlight surely being those atrocious, highly exaggerated hats at the Ascot races! In terms of the sets, I personally loved Professor Higgins' library with that spiral staircase! For me, the highlight of this film is the magnificent musical score by Lerner and Loewe. I like to leave the theatre after a musical humming one of its tunes, and there's barely a number in this one that didn't remain with me long afterward.In Wouldn't it be Loverly, we glimpse the hardships of Eliza's life and her longing for the simple comforts and a good man to share them with, while I Could Have Danced All Night, gives us an inkling of her burgeoning feelings for her woefully inconsiderate tutor. Where else in the musical world is there such a celebration of triumph as in the ridiculous The Rain in Spain? And...sigh...the light seems to finally dawn upon our Professor in his musing I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face. However, perhaps my favourites are Alfred P's lively With A little Bit of Luck and Get Me to the Church on Time, both perfect for singing in the shower!Perhaps My Fair Lady has its flaws as some claim, but I found it to be a stunning production and a timeless musical classic with unforgettable characters, gorgeous costuming, and incredibly catchy tunes.

Van Heflin is Dan Evans, a rancher whose family is threatened by drought, and who is asked to bring notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) to Yuma to stand trial, for a sum that will undoubtedly help his financial problems. Wade's gang is jailed after committing a stagecoach robbery and killing, but they escape, planning to rescue their leader, so Dan must keep one step ahead of them as he escorts the handcuffed Wade to the train station. Felicia Farr has a nice supporting role as the bar girl, Emmy, who falls for Wade - Ford's villain knows how to charm the ladies, so much so that almost every woman falls under his spell. His engaging manner with the girls - What's a woman for, if you can't treat her right? - his romantic way of telling stories, almost literally makes the female population swoon. Even Dan's wife Alice (Lenore Dana) is temporarily taken with Wade as he sits, handcuffed, at the dinner table, telling a tale of a girl that he knew with sea-green eyes. Heflin can't understand why women fall for this - after all, this guy is a outlaw and a killer. As the two men arrive at the station town, Wade's gang is ready to pounce and so Evans and Wade hide out in a hotel room, the bridal suite, no less, to wait. Ben then plays mind games with Dan, trying to escape, to beat him down. Although Alice wants him to save himself by allowing Wade to escape, Dan realizes that he has to do it - not only for the money, but because it's the right thing to do. The two guys form a strange bond, as Ben's gang closes in. Had things been different, they may have even liked each other. Wade allows Dan to get him onto the train, explaining that he doesn't like to owe anyone any favors. There is a tentative understanding between them as Dan waves to his wife from the moving train, while the final chords of the title tune and Frankie Laine's voice close this psychological, fascinating Western.Ford's performance is just flawless; he embodies his redeemable bad guy effortlessly, whistling the title song throughout relatively quiet sequences. And he is cunning and manipulative, knowing what buttons to push, as he subtly degrades Dan for not being a good husband and father. Maybe it's my female perspective, but somehow I don't' think I'd be immune to his penetrating gaze. After he and Farr engage in a passionate kiss, we see them a few moments later emerging from the back room of the saloon, fully clothed of course, but there can be no doubt of what had transpired between them. As he is taken away by Evans and the marshal, he promises to send her some pearls. Heflin gives just the right amount of selflessness, courage and compassion as the one who has to perform an unpleasant, risky task to support his family. These two underrated actors fill the screen, and it's hard to imagine any other leading men of the time bringing the protagonist and bad guy to life. An up and coming Richard Jaekel plays Wade's right hand, a fair-haired, cold-hearted sidekick who will stop at nothing to free his leader. He would later go on to have a succession of similar roles in several genres. Director Delmer Daves collaborated with Ford on many Westerns, all of which are gems.The DVD Transfer looks great, with a few extra trailers included Bite The Bullet, Silverado and MacKenna's Gold.

Van Heflin is Dan Evans, a rancher whose family is threatened by drought, and who is asked to bring notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) to Yuma to stand trial, for a sum that will undoubtedly help his financial problems. Wade's gang is jailed after committing a stagecoach robbery and killing, but they escape, planning to rescue their leader, so Dan must keep one step ahead of them as he escorts the handcuffed Wade to the train station. Felicia Farr has a nice supporting role as the bar girl, Emmy, who falls for Wade - Ford's villain knows how to charm the ladies, so much so that almost every woman falls under his spell. His engaging manner with the girls - What's a woman for, if you can't treat her right? - his romantic way of telling stories, almost literally makes the female population swoon. Even Dan's wife Alice (Lenore Dana) is temporarily taken with Wade as he sits, handcuffed, at the dinner table, telling a tale of a girl that he knew with sea-green eyes. Heflin can't understand why women fall for this - after all, this guy is a outlaw and a killer. As the two men arrive at the station town, Wade's gang is ready to pounce and so Evans and Wade hide out in a hotel room, the bridal suite, no less, to wait. Ben then plays mind games with Dan, trying to escape, to beat him down. Although Alice wants him to save himself by allowing Wade to escape, Dan realizes that he has to do it - not only for the money, but because it's the right thing to do. The two guys form a strange bond, as Ben's gang closes in. Had things been different, they may have even liked each other. Wade allows Dan to get him onto the train, explaining that he doesn't like to owe anyone any favors. There is a tentative understanding between them as Dan waves to his wife from the moving train, while the final chords of the title tune and Frankie Laine's voice close this psychological, fascinating Western.Ford's performance is just flawless; he embodies his redeemable bad guy effortlessly, whistling the title song throughout relatively quiet sequences. And he is cunning and manipulative, knowing what buttons to push, as he subtly degrades Dan for not being a good husband and father. Maybe it's my female perspective, but somehow I don't' think I'd be immune to his penetrating gaze. After he and Farr engage in a passionate kiss, we see them a few moments later emerging from the back room of the saloon, fully clothed of course, but there can be no doubt of what had transpired between them. As he is taken away by Evans and the marshal, he promises to send her some pearls. Heflin gives just the right amount of selflessness, courage and compassion as the one who has to perform an unpleasant, risky task to support his family. These two underrated actors fill the screen, and it's hard to imagine any other leading men of the time bringing the protagonist and bad guy to life. An up and coming Richard Jaekel plays Wade's right hand, a fair-haired, cold-hearted sidekick who will stop at nothing to free his leader. He would later go on to have a succession of similar roles in several genres. Director Delmer Daves collaborated with Ford on many Westerns, all of which are gems.The DVD Transfer looks great, with a few extra trailers included Bite The Bullet, Silverado and MacKenna's Gold.

This movie was panned solely by the elitist critics because it portrayed (shudder) children using guns. Sorry to the people who did not like this sad but true fact of life, but that is the way things happened for real back then. The British really did commit countless atrocities against American women and children during that War. There were the infamous prison ships that captured Americans were sent to die on from slow starvation. Many of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence themselves suffered greatly at the hands of the British. That is a movie Mel Gibson should make someday. Sorry to the English but your ancestors were not prim and proper in the way they brutalized America back in those days. All Americans and immigrants to the USA owe it to themselves to read the true history of what really happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence. One General who signed the Declaration for real whose own house had been commandeered by the English soldiers asked why it was not being fired upon by their own cannons? The men under his command did not want to target his home. He then gave the order himself to fire upon his own home which was then totally destroyed. In real life he died a penniless pauper on the streets after winning the war. This movie should be required watching for all American School children. Sorry if any English people are offended but no offense to you but the outrage I read in print and I heard in audio clips from your side of the pond over the brutality portrayed in this movie was far less than what was actually done to many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

The same ashtray that for some unknown reason is seen in every one of the five episode's in the movie.We then have a story about this bumbling farm boy Jordy Verril, Steven King. Steven comes upon a meteor that landed on his farm and in him trying to get it out of it's crater gets infected by whatever is on or in it. The green looking fungus turns the poor sap into what looked like the Alfalfa Man.

In a last act of desperation Jordy blows his brains out to keep from ending up a brainless vegetable, like a person on life-support, for the rest for is life.The third installment in Creepshow has funny man Leslie Nielsen playing the not so funny Richard Vickers. Richard get's both his wife Becky, Grylen Ross, and her lover Harry Wentworth, Ted Danson, buried up to their necks in the sand outside his private beach house and gleefully watches, on a close circuit TV monitor, them drown when the ocean waves reaches high tide.
