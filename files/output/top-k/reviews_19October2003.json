Hollywood's first all-star extravaganza, Grand Hotel introduced several techniques that would become familiar to movie and television viewers for decades to come. This included the simultaneous telling of several stories with rapid cuts between individuals, many of whom would alter play out important scenes together.I find it hard to criticize any aspect of this fine old film. It frankly baffles me when others complain of slow pacing, poor acting or other faults. Sure, a few things might have been done differently, had it been filmed 10 or 20 or 70 years later &#x85; but it almost certainly would have lacked much of the magic that it possesses.You start with two of the most provocative divas of the age, add the Barrymore brothers, the great Wallace Beery and a superb supporting cast, along with the magnificent hotel backdrop, and you get an endearing evening of entertainment. I had just fallen in love with Greta Garbo prior to seeing this film for the first time last week. This movie heightened my infatuation &#x96; although I did do some sighing and drooling over the curvaceous and flirtative young Joan Crawford, as well. It is only a shame that the two starlets were prevented from appearing in any scenes together. Both have some truly memorable moments together with John Barrymore. Some have called Garbo's performance over-the-top. I have to disagree. For a pampered Russian ballerina, hailed for her beauty and skill worldwide, yet whisked to and from a never-ending series of rehearsals and performances, taking medication to sleep and sequestered from the world, how would one EXPECT her to act? (I believe some of the shock-effect editing techniques help to increase this misconception.) She absolutely melts my heart when she calls Barrymore's room, shortly after he had left hers, just to hear his voice over the phone. Her majestic exits and entrances through the hotel lobby also make grand spectacles, amidst echoed strains of 'Bring Madame Gruninskaya's car!'Although John Barrymore is pushing 50 and looks every inch of it, he plays the good-hearted rogue Baron von Geigern with aplomb and grace. He and brother Lionel are wonderful together in one of their few opportunities to work together. Lionel, as the dying and therefore carefree clerk, Otto Kringelein, is perfect. A worm who finally turned, he may sound whiny, but has finally gotten the nerve to stand up to big shots like his old boss, General Director Preysing (Beery). Beery, interestingly enough, is the only cast member who attempts a German accent, even though this is supposedly a film about a group of Germans &#x96; other than the 'Russian' refugee, Gruninskaya. He is quite convincing, though, as the self-righteous, flawed industrialist.** SPOILERS FOLLOW **Crawford, just reaching the level of superstar, is a hot young commodity as the stenographer, Miss Flaem. Called 'Flaemchen' by her friends, she makes this pre-code epic deeper and darker than it otherwise would be. The realities as they exited in the corporate world in 1930 &#x96; and would for many decades to come &#x96; are clearly and unmistakably alluded to by the sexy stenographer and her overbearing boss. She agrees to accompany him on an urgent business trip to England, in which she realizes she will be taking more than dictation from him. She negotiates 1,000 marks (perhaps $5,000 US dollars in today's terms) for a new wardrobe and pay and agrees to take an adjoining room to his for their final night in Berlin.The end is especially intriguing, as the Baron is tragically killed, Preysing is ruined, Gruninskaya is led away by her worried entourage, and Kringelein and Flaemchen are thrust by shock and mourning, into each other's arms. One wonders at the ballerina's closing lines as she is ushered into her car. Increasingly frantic about not being able to find the dead Baron, she stops momentarily and reflects on the sunshine. Has she accepted the reality that he will NOT be on the train to Vienna and found the courage to look beyond? Or is she merely avoiding that reality?At the film's end, Kringelein and Flaemchen have quickly put the previous night's tragedy behind them and giddily prepare to leave for whatever remains of their life together. Throughout the film he has asserted that, 'I'm just as good as Preysing' and seems to take great pride in her assurance that she likes him better than the industrialist. There seems little doubt that the dying man's money is the biggest lure for her. Still, she has at least found someone she can respect, and one suspects she will endeavor to make his remaining days happy ones. Perhaps a true love affair will even ensue. Yet the very quickness of their pairing and its various circumstances certainly add a deep and dark element to the plot.Light, glitzy, yet deep and dark in places, Grand Hotel shows how well Hollywood could tell a story in the days before the Bream Code.

Had I been alive and theater-going in 1982 I might've become jaded against the film, only acknowledging the muddled 1982 release. I come from a generation whose first experience with Blade Runner came on the various home video formats, when we were blessed to behold the 1992 director's cut of the film. The director's cut was the first version I saw, hearing horror stories of the theatrical release. Having seen both now, I can fully appreciate having the directors cut as a definitive version.SPOILERS AHEADHarrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, also called Blade Runner. Blade runners are insinuated to be elite police units whose job it is to hunt down replicants, humanoid androids that were built by the Tyrell Corporation to serve humans. After a replicant revolt on an off-world mining colony, replicants are considered threats to society. When they are detected they are destroyed, or as the opening crawl takes pains to emphasize, 'retired'. Deckard is assigned to hunt down 5 replicants who have just escaped from an off-world colony and come to LA. His pursuit of the androids becomes an in depth exploration of what it means to be human, and chiefly why the humans can condemn the replicants for wanting to be like them.A common complaint I here from critics of Blade Runner is that it hasn't aged well. Sadly, this is a truth I have to concede. Audiences new to the feature that go into it without predetermined reverence end up laughing at the Vangelis music, dated vision of the year 2019, and sadly even Rutger Hauer's appearance in the climactic scene.Blade Runner is a beautiful movie, from the opening iconic image of future Los Angeles seemingly ablaze to the scenes of flying cars weaving in between monolithic skyscrapers beneath the perpetually raining sky.Philosophical overtones are strong throughout every aspect of the film, right down to the art-deco\/neo gothic architecture of the city the Tyrell corporation building is a gargantuan Mayan pyramid that rises about the pollution ridden cloud that cloaks the city of Los Angeles. In fact, the only time you see any sunlight in the movie is when it shares the frame with the Tyrell building. The pyramid shape of the building, the presence in the sunlight above the clouds, and the fact that it houses a creator of life (be that artificial) all convey the presence of a god figure. Indeed Tyrell's role in the movie is that of the god figure. This is unadulterated Nietzsche god made man, and then man killed god.Differences between the original version and the director's cut are not subtle, they are glaring. The studio thought that the audience at large would need help in understanding the film, so they had Ford record an irritatingly cheesy Bogart film-noir narration. Legend has it that Ford intentionally made the narration awful in the hopes that the studio would consider it too bad to use. Also, the studio tacked on an uplifting ending in which Deckard and Rachel escape to an idyllic countryside together. One of the most interesting changes however is the unicorn dream that Scott fought to include. Its meaning is wide open to interpretation. One possibility is the connection to the title of the Philip Dick story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Does Deckard's dream of an imaginary creature mean that he is in turn a fictional being? The most obvious connection is to the origami unicorn left on Deckard's doorstep at the end of the film. Does Gaff know Deckard's memories just as Deckard knew Rebecca's? Or is it a coincidence?Memories are precious to the replicants. Each one has his or her own set of memories programmed in to make them believe they have lived full, human lives. This fact is another of the many clues which led viewers to believe Deckard was in fact a replicant himself. More than that, though, it explains why Roy spares Deckard's life at the end of the film. The cheesy narration in the original release of the film explains it thuslyI don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want.This is all fine and dandy if you want to take away the simplistic message that the replicants had become more human than the so called real humans. The real reasoning behind Roy's grace is much more selfish. Consider the brilliant monologue he gives on the rooftopI've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.Roy and his fellow off-worlders have 'lived' more than any of the humans living in their urban wasteland. The replicants have been programmed with a short life span. Roy accepts the inevitability of his death and realizes that the only way his memories can survive, the only evidence of his existence, is through Deckard. Roy keeps Deckard alive because the only remaining traces of his life reside in Deckard's mind.Blade Runner's design may not have been able to withstand the test of time, but its intelligence and message are more than able to transcend the void between the 1980's and this universe.

They talk for a while but their car is ambushed and he wakes up days later in the hospital with only vague memories.  Curious as to who she was he starts to dig, the more he finds the more he realises just how big the truth could be.This film always bugs me a little &#150; the ending is iconic and the film itself seems to have a very high reputation with film lovers and professional critics but I struggle to see it when I actually watch it.  The plot is a solid noir with clever (unexplained) touches that make it stand out, but the actual detective story is pretty impenetrable and doesn't make a great deal of sense &#150; I didn't get caught up and get breathless with the investigation simply because a lot of it didn't make sense.  This really takes away from the film.It does look fantastic though despite this.  The cinematography is excellent and has plenty of really well framed shots.  The use of black and white is good, with shadows used to typical noir effect but with unique and clever touches.  The opening credits are excellent &#150; the breathless pants of a woman are mesmerising &#150; and the ending is different enough to stick in your mind (everyone knows it due to Pulp Fiction now anyway!).  However the film's flaws are too great in the area of plotting and performance. I don't actually mind watching a slightly confusing noir with workmanlike acting when it is a B movie, but it's the lofty idea of itself that this film seems to have that really makes me less forgiving.Aldrich seems to bless his film with a sense of self importance that is not justified and doesn't sit well with the genre.  The cast don't help &#150; none really stand out and, although there are no bad performances, there are few that could be described as anything other than workmanlike or average.  Meeker is pretty solid but that's his character &#150; all he has to do is be a big lug because that's what his character is &#150; in fact it's a big point  that he is not a nice guy in any sense.

The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it.This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate. Many people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas.  The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story.The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off.

But this one is more touchy than the others--it features a character who may be The Man with No Name (a.k.a. Blondie) thirty years after we saw him ride away at the end of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. This particular man is filled with guilt trailing him from his past, when he was a gunslinging drunkard made infamous throughout the west as a brutal killer. Now he's older and a retired cowboy--he lives with his two children in the middle of nowhere as a farmer. His name is William Munny.The film opens in a town miles away run by the evil Little Bill (Gene Hackman), the corrupt town sherriff. In the town brothel, a hooker is beaten to a pulp by two men who get away with simply having to hand over some horses to the owner of the joint. Seeking revenge, the women of the facility put together their small fortunes and put up a stash of reward money for the assassination of the two men.Enter the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), who is eager to hunt down the two men and collect the reward money. He invites Will Munny to accompany and help him with his quest. At first Will refuses, but then he decides to put down his pitch fork and use his weapons one more time. Along the way, Will and the Schofield Kid pick up Ned (Morgan Freeman), another retired gunslinger living out west in peace and harmony. Together they ride off into the sunset in hopes of finding their targets and collecting some reward money for their efforts. Things aren't always as simple as they seem.The Schofield Kid claims he has killed five men. But Ned and Will come to an agreement that they think he's bluffing. The Schofield Kid is like an eager kid wanting to impress his role model. WheUnforgiven is a tender western that isn't quite as unrealistic as you might expect walking into the theater to watch it. Clint Eastwood is famous for the cowboy roles. Now it's his turn to give a new insight into the feelings of cowboys. The underlying roots of the movie are quite simple--you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Even though Will has left his brutal and abusive past behind him, his old personality is still in there, somewhere amongst the chaos of his colliding feelings. He's a man beaten by his heart more than by any enemy he has encountered in the past.Gene Hackman is always good for bad guy roles, mainly because he can create some of the most hateable characters of all time. I saw Crimson Tide immediately after Unforgiven--his roles are often the same, but there is no doubting that he can create a truly mean character while still adding some depth to his persona.Clint Eastwood is one great director. He has created a wonderful and grim epic that transcends the genre. Westerns have always been a bit cheesy as compared to more contemporary films (after all, there's a reason they're often called spaghetti westerns). Unforgiven is given the regular screen treatment. This is a more accurate portrayal of the wild, wild west. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is superior, but that's a given.The end of Unforgiven is a mix between Taxi Driver and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's a bit depressing, but, at the same time, refreshingly noble. It's one of the best cinematic climaxes ever created. The message behind Unforgiven may not be encouraging, but some of the greatest films aren't.

But this one is more touchy than the others--it features a character who may be The Man with No Name (a.k.a. Blondie) thirty years after we saw him ride away at the end of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. This particular man is filled with guilt trailing him from his past, when he was a gunslinging drunkard made infamous throughout the west as a brutal killer. Now he's older and a retired cowboy--he lives with his two children in the middle of nowhere as a farmer. His name is William Munny.The film opens in a town miles away run by the evil Little Bill (Gene Hackman), the corrupt town sherriff. In the town brothel, a hooker is beaten to a pulp by two men who get away with simply having to hand over some horses to the owner of the joint. Seeking revenge, the women of the facility put together their small fortunes and put up a stash of reward money for the assassination of the two men.Enter the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), who is eager to hunt down the two men and collect the reward money. He invites Will Munny to accompany and help him with his quest. At first Will refuses, but then he decides to put down his pitch fork and use his weapons one more time. Along the way, Will and the Schofield Kid pick up Ned (Morgan Freeman), another retired gunslinger living out west in peace and harmony. Together they ride off into the sunset in hopes of finding their targets and collecting some reward money for their efforts. Things aren't always as simple as they seem.The Schofield Kid claims he has killed five men. But Ned and Will come to an agreement that they think he's bluffing. The Schofield Kid is like an eager kid wanting to impress his role model. WheUnforgiven is a tender western that isn't quite as unrealistic as you might expect walking into the theater to watch it. Clint Eastwood is famous for the cowboy roles. Now it's his turn to give a new insight into the feelings of cowboys. The underlying roots of the movie are quite simple--you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Even though Will has left his brutal and abusive past behind him, his old personality is still in there, somewhere amongst the chaos of his colliding feelings. He's a man beaten by his heart more than by any enemy he has encountered in the past.Gene Hackman is always good for bad guy roles, mainly because he can create some of the most hateable characters of all time. I saw Crimson Tide immediately after Unforgiven--his roles are often the same, but there is no doubting that he can create a truly mean character while still adding some depth to his persona.Clint Eastwood is one great director. He has created a wonderful and grim epic that transcends the genre. Westerns have always been a bit cheesy as compared to more contemporary films (after all, there's a reason they're often called spaghetti westerns). Unforgiven is given the regular screen treatment. This is a more accurate portrayal of the wild, wild west. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is superior, but that's a given.The end of Unforgiven is a mix between Taxi Driver and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's a bit depressing, but, at the same time, refreshingly noble. It's one of the best cinematic climaxes ever created. The message behind Unforgiven may not be encouraging, but some of the greatest films aren't.

I was always curious watching his films but it was merely because people had told me they were spectacular and brilliant. I had watched Blue Velvet before. Probably his most famous work, but I just didn't get how it was.... amazing. I found it a bit cheesy actually. So, here I was having my doubts about this man, and one day I remembered I had a DivX (shhh, told tell the feds) of Mulholland Drive and I think I only put it on to test the DivX player on my Xbox. 5 minutes in, I was already keen on watching it all. It sort of grips you in from the start. So I let it run on untill the end, and then I was totally amazed. I had loved this. BUT (there's always one of those). It does require a decent amount of concentration, so I didn't fully get everything the first time around. I searched on the internet to confirm my thoughts of everything and I was right about most things. The week after, I watched it again. This time knowing what to pay close attention to. I was just astonished. You realize how much depth and emotion that is the foundation of this masterpiece. I rarely use that word and I'm highly cynical of everyday type of film, but this is really just mind blowing. I give this 10 out of 10.For those who realized. I did not mention a thing that happens in this film. That was intentional... for if I told you, it was spoil allot more than you think.Happy watching.

Maybe thats a bit harsh because the first Jurassic Park film was pretty good at the time (although hugely overated and over hyped), that time was 1993. Its time to move on but I suppose as long as people actually still want to watch the same old rubbish they will continue to churn them out.

Unfortunately, the subject of Starling's focus this time is first, a grossly disfigured surviving victim of Lecter's savagery, with only a secondary, almost off-handed half-glance of attention at Lecter himself. I found the climaxial scene featuring Ray Liota's...thoughts...to be among the most disgusting piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. What was the point of that? With Silence of the Lambs, we were handed a creative, crafty, intellectual masterpiece of psychological theater. With Hannibal, we are force-fed pure and absolute Hollywood Eye Candy without even the merest drop of water with which to wash it down.The psychological aspect is still present, but Julianne Moore's reprisal of Jodie Foster's original role as Clarice Starling did absolutely nothing for this production. I found her portrayal to be shallow and plastic as a Barbie doll which is not anatomically correct. The cinematography in this movie; the sets, the scenery itself, was far superior, but the plot was just gods-awful. Had Mr. Scott spared us the mind-expanding scene with Ray Liota, it may have been a much better finished product, but with the inclusion of that scene I found it about two steps above Killer Clowns from Outer Space. It took away from the suspense and beauty of Lecter's sickness so much that it rendered the entire film as unenjoyable, to me.Without those three elements Moore, the Liota scene, and the horrid little troll of a client; this would have been a top notch production. But the disgusting visuals, to me, robbed this work of its potential for beauty and elegance. If you loved the original for its psychological edge and eloquence of plot, then this movie will be a horrible disappointment. If you did not like it for the absence of gore, then this movie will make you a happy audience member. As a sequel, it is a mere shell of the original masterpiece. As a stand alone movie, it falls flat on its face. In comparison to the original, it is a sorry, slip-shod production which does not even rate the label of sequel.I suggest Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs, even Manhunter (not one of my favorites), but do yourself a favor and skip this one.All in all, this movie rates somewhere around a 3.1\/10 from...the Fiend .
