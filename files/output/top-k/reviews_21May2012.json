Chevy's own career often seemed to reflect the fortunes of his hapless alter-ego here, Clark Griswald, as many of his subsequent films were flops. So as much as I have always liked Chevy, I have never felt that he really had a lot of control or interest in the quality of his own work post-Saturday NIght Live. Its as though his on screen persona - aloof, disinterested, wise-assed, etc was also his real life persona. Also, Chevy was born into a lot of wealth and probably really didn't need the money. So all this I think spelled trouble for much of his film career. Vacation is possibly the best of the lot, and even here, there are times when he goes beyond comedy and lapses into behavior that just seems absurd for the sake of being absurd. But overall, Vacation is a funny film and it should touch anyone who has found themselves in similar circumstances while on the road.OK, Chevy is Clark Griswald, a nerdy husband to Beverly D'Angelo and a father of two. The family lives in Chicago but want to drive to Wally World in Southern California for a few weeks of fun and rides. To get there, he buys an absurdly built family truckster (station wagon), packs the bags and off they go on their family vacation.Once outside of Chicago, problems surface immediately. Everything is terra incognito to Clark as he bumbles his way across farmland and prairie. The standard schtick is that he claims to be in control of everything thats going on, but he really doesn't have a clue. He makes things up and lies if he has to. Beverly D'angelo knows this. His kids know it. So ultimately, the joke is always on him despite how hard he tries to act casual and remain in command. Sometimes, the result is great comedy. Other times, its a little absurd. But mostly you will enjoy and possibly relate to what they are going through as they wind their way to California. But once they depart Kansas and head to Colorado and Arizona, the movie starts to fall apart for me. Clark's bumbling and antics start to go over the top, and that peaks when they stay at a hotel in Arizona where Clark meets a mysterious blonde (Christie Brinkley) who seems to be following the family across the country. Also, there is a subplot involving an older relative (Imogene Cocoa) that borders on bad taste. So what started out as kind of a cute and funny film begins to escalate into absurdity and anger as Clark begins to get on EVERYONES nerves, including my own. In fact, you almost want to strangle him at some points. Its not the jokes with bad taste so much as the fact that his growing incompetence makes those jokes less funny. There is a balancing act going on here, and at some point, he crosses the line. For example, Beverly's as long as you don't tie me to a bumper line in reference to an incident earlier where Clark accidentally kills his cousin's dog, takes the shine off of the comedy and starts to turn it into something darker and less enjoyable.Anyway, but before they reach California, though, there is one more funny scene where they get lost and crash the car near Monument Valley, Arizona. Clark's father to son talk here is a classic, and he follows that with a dash through the desert looking for a gas station. When they recover the car later and Clark is lashed by an attendant for his stupidity in thinking he could find a gas station in the desert, he replies well, I'm from out of town, another classic Chevyism. So that to me was a funny scene, and oh well, then we hit California...beyond that I probably should shut up or else I could be writing a spoiler here. Suffice it to say, things don't go well at Wally World either...and once again Clark's antics go over the top for me.But vacation is still a funny film worth checking out if you are a comedy fan.

However, Young Guns II, is probably more entertaining than the it's predecessor.Young Guns II is more based on legend than fact about the life of Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid aka William Bonney can be probably said to be the most legendary and beloved of all the western outlaws. The beginning of the movie starts in a first person narrative--and I'd say beware of movies that start with these character voice overs--but however, that doesn't mean that you are in for a bad movie. The Ten Commandments also has the same set up---and it is campy and kitchy but one of the best movie spectacles of its time. Just like the mysterious life of Billy the Kid, it starts out shrouded in legend. The first person we meet (also played by Emilio Estevez) is Bushy Bill Roberts, a man who lived in the harsh Death Valley climate that claimed that he was Billy The Kid himself. Bill who was considered a harmless oddball homeless man who ran his own Billy The Kid museum in some tiny Southwest town. Bill Roberts claimed on his deathbed that he was the surviving outlaw himself but it was later proved by some facts and disputed dates that he was not the gunslinger.Youn Gun II mostly tells it's story through legend than facts. After the Lincoln County War, Billy was tried for murder and did escape but shooting Bob Bell And Bob Olinger. He did not do a ala Helter Skelter\/ Charles Manson act by writing Garrett's Place in Bob Bell's blood on the wall. There was also a dispute on how well he knew Pat Garrett. Most say that he may have met Gerrett or knew about him but they were not as best buddies shown in the movie. However, the ending scene where Garret tracks down Billy The Kid and is seen to kill him is also disputed as legend. So since a lot of legend is mixed in with the facts of Billy The Kid's life, the plot or story entertains us like the old romatized dime novels that were sold at the time....What better way to enjoy a Western. The only fly in the ointment is the character of Billy The Kid changes somewhat from a fun but sometimes serious outlaw, to a non impressive giggling joker JackNapier. The dialog can probably be said as the most memorable than the first movie. Also, besides the rocking Bon Jovi album and song that displayed at the end, please check out the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. It has a definite Mexican Southwesten flavor---one of the best that has been ignored by critics.So go forth and saddle up and enjoy! But again, due to the prevalent legend that shrouds Billy The Kid, you might be heading to the library or Wikepedia for more information afterward.

Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. Cliffhanger is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I. Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

Gregoire embodies this new generation, and it's not a hazard that he's befriended by Bellegarde, the doctor, who doesn't just admire the different uses of wit quips, word-plays, retorts, paradoxes but also honesty and decency.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 May 2012","score":"","review":" Whatever It Takes is mislabeled as being a Teen Comedy. In actuality it's a Teen Farce that tries to be a Teen Comedy. It fails as a Comedy as the majority of the characters are unabashedly selfish individuals in pursuit of their own selfish desires with close to no redeemable qualities. That's the territory of Farce. Other examples of Teen Farces include the American Pie movies and Not Another Teen Movie. Where Whatever it Takes fails is that it tries to be a Teen Comedy only in the romance between our two unpopular characters, when the rest of the characters and situations fit the genre of a Farce. It's like the two leads got picked up out of a Comic world and were left trapped in a Farcical one. And the fight between the two genres of humor gets this film nowhere-fast.If it were a Comedy it would be more celebratory of the community and interested in bringing members who don't fit in the community into it as full fledged members with a place, a purpose, and a partner. What this film is interested in saying is that the community is too selfish and deserving of punishment to bother joining--which is typically the stuff of Satire or Farce.In a farce there's little to no concern for other people, and body humor frequently goes for grossing people out. Which is what this movie nearly goes out of its way to portray. The entire high school community is composed of a group of selfish individuals, the reason for their being so the movie silently postulates is due to the fact that they have very little care or respect for themselves as individuals--a realization which would work in a Comedy if that realization wasn't being completely undercut with only the minimal in character development and the most ridiculous of gross-out humor. I mean what school teaches safe sex with a giant penis and a giant condom? I almost felt sorry for Ashley, the popular girl, whose character is revealed to have a neurotic mind completely entangled around her low self-esteem, but this realization is coupled in the same moment by her eating a chocolate cake and opening her mouth to reveal the cake's blacked out her teeth. Or that she begs all night on Ryan's lawn to ask to go to prom, only to tear away her dress and reveal the skimpy bikini underneath. That kind of humor belongs in a Farce, but is out of place in a Comedy, and it completely undercuts any sympathy the character might otherwise have developed. Had she not blacked out her teeth or revealed her hidden bikini we could have seen under the veneer of her popularity and seen the scared child who desperately wants to fit in and will put herself into near-emotional abusive situations in order to get negative attention and thus feel gratified. If the movie had actually done that it could have given some more weight to the conflict between Ryan realizing his feelings for Ashley, and now feeling obligated to show Ashley how to stand up for herself and be confident in being her own person (in a John Hughes manner recalling Some Kind of Wonderful). However the opportunity is missed as the film would rather make jokes about how hot the actress is and how horny her character is--that she doesn't even notice that Ryan is replaced with another boy and still has sex with him.The soulful parts such as Ryan realizing that he actually likes Maggie as he tells Chris how to woo her in the theater, are lifted from its source material of Cyrano D'Bergerac. The rest of the movie and its sense of humor is more appropriate for a farce, which if you watch the special features seems to be the kind of humor the director is entertained by the most and pushed the actors towards in his direction.In the end the script should have seen a few more revisions to either take out the farcical humor and add some redeeming heartfelt qualities to the high school community and its most popular students, or fully embraced the farcical nature of its humor and dehumanized its pair of unpopular kids and thus be the precursor to Not Another Teen Movie.Either would have been better than this awkward film that can't make up its mind about what genre it is.

This film was Tim Burton's first film on the silver screen and it was a great start from him most of the time first movies from first timers tend to disappoint me; and I personally think it's still one of his best. It stands out because it was something different that you haven't seen before and you have to just see to believe; from it's style but most importantly the content and manic energy which is the reason this film just like the ghosts are timeless to me.The music score by one of my favorite composers Danny Elfman is great, it's a strange lighthearted Gothic tune. The production value is great was obviously inspired by artist Salvador Dali with that desert as well as the hallways and doorways of the spirit realm. This also helps create that really odd surrealistic fantasy world tone from the real world that looks like a typical boring Norman Rockwell like enviorment it feels too strange to be true, some of the interior and exterior of the Dieetz's home, down to the spirit realm itself. Along with the special effects which I think still look great today, there is no CGI which make it all the better, from stop motion effects like the Sand Worms which are comical and nasty looking down to the make up effects. This is another reason as to how special this film is film I feel is one of the best prime examples of the use of special effects in a comedy that works because their used for the right reasons and not mere gimmicks.But most important is the humor, the humor is great mixing in horror with comedy which I always think is a beautiful mix, but also just the mixture of verbal and visual humor that make it memorable, which is just done to perfection here I can't say that about many others out there. From the antics of Bettlejuice which I already mentioned down to others without him, from the infamous Day-O dinner scene, but my favorite no doubt is with the dead Football players one of them says something and the case worker Juno (played with brilliant dry charisma by Sylvia Sidney)replies back, I don't want to give it away but trust me one you hear it you'll crack up. But also just the logic or illogic of the spirit realm that is created, it's funny because of how strange it is but also fills you with wonder I can't help but wonder if there really is a lot more to that spirit realm I still don't know about.The characters are great through the two that really stick out for me the most are Beetlejuice and Lydia Deetz, no surprise there.Beetlejuice is played by one of my favorite actor's Michael Keaton to me this actually is my favorite role from him. Beetlejuice is one of my favorite fictional villains that I don't hate, he's pretty much a dirty insane amoral butt head that just wants to create\/cause havoc for no reason, I like some of the tricks he pulls which are fun but many just his charisma some of the things he says and the way he delivers them are just hilarious; like the commercial he did which was obviously a parody on those car commercial which always had that country western vibe for some weird reason.And of course one of the protagonists Lydia Deetz played by one of my favorite actresses Wynoma Rider is great and this was the role that put her on the map. I remember as a kid having a crush on this actress she's just fraking hot, made me wonder why the hell couldn't I find any goth girls in my high school not just looked that hot but had the persona to boot. Anyway, Lydia is just great because she's a character I can emphasize with a bit, I wasn't a goth but like her I was an outsider. Like the fact that she is always wearing funerary or goth , she just looks so good no matter what she wears. But I just love her persona she has dry charisma and I like the fact she's fascinated with the supernatural, I also am fascinated with unexplained phenomena of ghosts, UFOs, and other things. I also find her kinda a character of sympathy because she is lonely and feels sort of out of place, clearly her character really don't fit the superficial reality she's been forced to live with, another thing I can emphasize with because even I've had those feelings; and we pretty much see her struggling to find her place in the world but it really is closer than she thinks.Well, that's all I have to say, this film has the juice.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm a kid from the 80's, this is once again another timeless relics from my favorite decade of movies.

Going by its plot, those thoughts and its unique genre placing as a camp punk-rock musical\/opera on the surface you would expect this to be nothing more than just loud, brash and superficial. And while there may be an element of that there is also so much more here than just that. It's a film that is full of heart and sincerity. A film that toes the line between humour and poignancy. A film that is both joyous and heartbreakingly tragic. I may even go as far to say that it's a film that is rather oddly beautiful.For an outsider looking in you may think the film and the character will not have much to say to you, much for you to identify with. After all who is going to be able to relate to the story of an East German transsexual punk rock singer? Except that it's so much more than that, it's about themes and emotions that are almost universal. It's about feeling lost and like an outsider, trying to find a place to belong. And it's about dealing with love both lost and found. As a result we can probably all relate to Hedwig in some way.This is just a stunning effort from John Cameron Mithcell. As the film's writer, director and star its a truly immense accomplishment for him. His direction is raw, but so effective at imbuing the film with such a voracious energy and life. His script is a terrifically witty and fun affair, teeming with acerbic humour. And as the self described internationally ignored song stylist Hedwig, Mitchell's performance is just a revelation, absolutely mesmerising. It's probably the most I've enjoyed any performance in quite a while. Hedwig is like a cross between Lady Gaga and....and....no actually just comparing her to Lady Gaga just about does it! Well perhaps with a dose of 70s era David Bowie thrown in. The character is outlandish and very funny, but is also a fragile and rather sad creation. Mitchell brings so much depth and emotion to the role, grasping both the caustic humour but also the melancholy of Hedwig. And the fact that he has a stunning voice doesn't hurt either.Of course this movie would not work in any capacity whatsoever without the songs. And what an amazing success they are. Written by Stephen Trask they seem to channel a bit of a Ramones vibe and are just absolutely infectious. It may have been only my first viewing but before long I already found myself singing along to them. What is most impressive about them is that they are not just purely throwaway efforts only for entertainment. Each song plays a part in moving the story along, detailing Hedwig's journey to this point and adding layers to the character and his emotions. I don't think there's a dud song in the bunch, and my personal favourites would have to be the bonkers but brilliant Origin of Love, the fun and sweet Wig in a Box and the lovely Midnight Radio. Though the one I've been singing most since then is actually Angry Inch. While Mitchell is tremendous there is someone who comes damn close to matching him &#x96; Michael Pitt as Tommy Gnosis. As the lost, troubled soul he is great but it's his scenes alongside Mitchell that are truly remarkable, the two sharing a terrific chemistry. Of special note has to be their final scene near the end of the film. With both men exposing their flesh and their souls it is a very powerful and beautiful moment. They don't actually say a single word, telling the whole story with their facial expressions and it is just wonderful.The film also looks tremendous. The clothes, make-up and sets all have a tremendously flamboyant and extravagant feel to them. Hedwig's preposterous hair, full-on makeup and series of sensational, garish costumes make it a lush, glam rock style picture to behold. Oh and there is also some lovely use of crude but delightful animation, which is just insanely charming. This is especially true whilst accompanying Origin of Love.Conclusion &#x96; Just a delight.

Wonderful ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"21 May 2012","score":"","review":" After the many pressures that forced Francis Veber to write a non-Latino villain in the American remake of The Goat (Pure Luck), the director, probably upset for having 'abdicated', embraced for a long time the idea of a pamphlet against political correctness. The Closet was his testimony and on the surface, the film has everything you'd expect from a Veber film. It has the wits, the mild-mannered average Joe, played by Daniel Auteuil portraying another François Pignon, AND the political and social commentary. What else could you expect? Unfortunately, what certainly looked promising on the paper didn't successfully pass the big-screen test, starting with the main character, François Pignon, a boring accountant (pleonasm?) in a rubber factory. The film opens with a very evocative photo where the poor Pignon is so meek and insignificant that he can't even get in the company picture. He's such a forgettable pawn, that it doesn't surprise us when we learn that he's to be fired. What's more, he's divorced and his son, a typical teenager, ignores him, just like his wife, played by Alexandra Vandernoot. This 'François Pignon' irritated me a little bit, I know he's supposed to be this way to become better at the end, but afterThe Dinner Game, no one could have played a more Pignon-esque character than Jacques Villeret, and any post-Dinner Pignon would pale in comparison. Pignons were all unwitting losers, and never lacked flamboyance and personality; the level of pathos injected in Auteuil's character was too big not to fall in the stereotypical trap.Naturally, it doesn't come as a surprise either that the man contemplates suicide; at that part, we still wait for some laughs to relax the atmosphere. Right before doing the big dive, he's approached by his neighbor who obviously sees a man in need for help. Michel Aumont, another Veber regular, is wonderfully natural and sympathetic and provides what I consider the greatest and most human scenes of the film. He comes up the next day, with THE idea, typically Veberian, to pass Pignon as a homosexual by sending an anonymous fake picture showing him in a gay club to the big boss, Mr. Kopel (Jean Rochefort). It would naturally serve as a warning, since the main product of the company is condoms. We accept the logic with even more enthusiasm that he's not supposed to act 'gay', it's all in the eyes of the employees. That was the cleverest touch of the film, but not a surprise, since Veber always respected the intelligence of the viewer.And it's remarkable how the reputation of one man precedes the perception, the first step succeeds as he's not fired, then he's seen in a different way, he's not dull anymore, but weird. His reluctance to be part of the rugby team becomes understandable, and any attempt to bully him can be a case of homophobia. The problem is that we can't go too far with that. Had the movie exaggerated a little bit, it would have been proved that being gay can somewhat help, which would have spoken a much wider statement about 'being part of a community'. And that's my problem with the film, while The Closet could have been a remarkable denunciation of the lobbying system, it remains a timid little comedy, a farce with no subtlety nonetheless especially when it tackles François' gay facade, homophobia-immune at work but not outside. It could have been more dramatic or more comedic, even if it flirted with the 'Birdcage' spirit (a much funnier film at the end, and no less written by Veber) As an attempt to compensate the shortness of the main story, Veber comes up with a rather unnecessary subplot involving Depardieu's character, Felix Santini, a guy who's warned by Thierry Lhermitte about his constant homophobic remarks. I know it was supposed to be funny, but it looked for me as a remake of the 'Dinner Game' where we're supposed to root for the plotters. I couldn't. When Felix was yelling racist remarks, I felt it was only Veber trying to make him look bad, and conveniently, when a black employee told Lhermitte that he was going too far with Felix, he changed his mind after learning about the racist remark. I still felt sorry for Felix, and I don't think it was a good idea to have Lhermitte, playing again a cunning mean-spirited guy (with the same bald sidekick). Felix is not a totally unlovable idiot but I wish the movie went farther with Pignon, rather than him.By the way, the presence of Lhermitte, Rochefort or other stars also annoyed me because they were not important enough to be important actors; even Lhermitte had nothing to do in the poster. It's like Veber wanted to exploit the commercial success of The Dinner Game for The Closet, but had it kept the same spirit, it would have worked. Not that the film is a failure, but it just can't be compared to its glorious predecessors if only in the characterization's department. Pignon gained more confidence but was it necessary to turn his wife into a sort of one-dimensional villain to make him feel good? Would the son be suddenly proud of him, just because he's in a gay pride? Apparently, being original is the key to popularity, although it's still guided by the others' perceptions, from his wife's shallowness to his son's superficiality, it seems that everything is guided by the way you're seen.The film could have been much better, had it had the guts to go further in its introspection, it's an interesting examination of the ways professional relationships are as undermined by general perceptions than in society, but it just lost too much time on the Depardieu-Lhermitte subplot to enrich the most interesting aspect in Pignon's life, making his metamorphosis too quick to be believable. A minor Veber film but still better than many comedies made today.

When Felix was yelling racist remarks, I felt it was only Veber trying to make him look bad, and conveniently, when a black employee told Lhermitte that he was going too far with Felix, he changed his mind after learning about the racist remark. I still felt sorry for Felix, and I don't think it was a good idea to have Lhermitte, playing again a cunning mean-spirited guy (with the same bald sidekick). Felix is not a totally unlovable idiot but I wish the movie went farther with Pignon, rather than him.By the way, the presence of Lhermitte, Rochefort or other stars also annoyed me because they were not important enough to be important actors; even Lhermitte had nothing to do in the poster. It's like Veber wanted to exploit the commercial success of The Dinner Game for The Closet, but had it kept the same spirit, it would have worked. Not that the film is a failure, but it just can't be compared to its glorious predecessors if only in the characterization's department. Pignon gained more confidence but was it necessary to turn his wife into a sort of one-dimensional villain to make him feel good? Would the son be suddenly proud of him, just because he's in a gay pride? Apparently, being original is the key to popularity, although it's still guided by the others' perceptions, from his wife's shallowness to his son's superficiality, it seems that everything is guided by the way you're seen.The film could have been much better, had it had the guts to go further in its introspection, it's an interesting examination of the ways professional relationships are as undermined by general perceptions than in society, but it just lost too much time on the Depardieu-Lhermitte subplot to enrich the most interesting aspect in Pignon's life, making his metamorphosis too quick to be believable. A minor Veber film but still better than many comedies made today. ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"21 May 2012","score":"","review":" After the many pressures that forced Francis Veber to write a non-Latino villain in the American remake of The Goat (Pure Luck), the director, probably upset for having 'abdicated', embraced for a long time the idea of a pamphlet against political correctness. The Closet was his testimony and on the surface, the film has everything you'd expect from a Veber film. It has the wits, the mild-mannered average Joe, played by Daniel Auteuil portraying another François Pignon, AND the political and social commentary. What else could you expect? Unfortunately, what certainly looked promising on the paper didn't successfully pass the big-screen test, starting with the main character, François Pignon, a boring accountant (pleonasm?) in a rubber factory. The film opens with a very evocative photo where the poor Pignon is so meek and insignificant that he can't even get in the company picture. He's such a forgettable pawn, that it doesn't surprise us when we learn that he's to be fired. What's more, he's divorced and his son, a typical teenager, ignores him, just like his wife, played by Alexandra Vandernoot. This 'François Pignon' irritated me a little bit, I know he's supposed to be this way to become better at the end, but afterThe Dinner Game, no one could have played a more Pignon-esque character than Jacques Villeret, and any post-Dinner Pignon would pale in comparison. Pignons were all unwitting losers, and never lacked flamboyance and personality; the level of pathos injected in Auteuil's character was too big not to fall in the stereotypical trap.Naturally, it doesn't come as a surprise either that the man contemplates suicide; at that part, we still wait for some laughs to relax the atmosphere. Right before doing the big dive, he's approached by his neighbor who obviously sees a man in need for help. Michel Aumont, another Veber regular, is wonderfully natural and sympathetic and provides what I consider the greatest and most human scenes of the film. He comes up the next day, with THE idea, typically Veberian, to pass Pignon as a homosexual by sending an anonymous fake picture showing him in a gay club to the big boss, Mr. Kopel (Jean Rochefort). It would naturally serve as a warning, since the main product of the company is condoms. We accept the logic with even more enthusiasm that he's not supposed to act 'gay', it's all in the eyes of the employees. That was the cleverest touch of the film, but not a surprise, since Veber always respected the intelligence of the viewer.And it's remarkable how the reputation of one man precedes the perception, the first step succeeds as he's not fired, then he's seen in a different way, he's not dull anymore, but weird. His reluctance to be part of the rugby team becomes understandable, and any attempt to bully him can be a case of homophobia. The problem is that we can't go too far with that. Had the movie exaggerated a little bit, it would have been proved that being gay can somewhat help, which would have spoken a much wider statement about 'being part of a community'. And that's my problem with the film, while The Closet could have been a remarkable denunciation of the lobbying system, it remains a timid little comedy, a farce with no subtlety nonetheless especially when it tackles François' gay facade, homophobia-immune at work but not outside. It could have been more dramatic or more comedic, even if it flirted with the 'Birdcage' spirit (a much funnier film at the end, and no less written by Veber) As an attempt to compensate the shortness of the main story, Veber comes up with a rather unnecessary subplot involving Depardieu's character, Felix Santini, a guy who's warned by Thierry Lhermitte about his constant homophobic remarks.

I was 14 when I saw it and it blew me away completely. I had never seen something so radical and beautiful at the same time. It was a film that made me feel so many different feelings at the same time and also confused me in a weird way. Should I feel sympathy or hate? Should I laugh or be disturbed? But that's what made it so interesting, was those complete opposite feelings mixed. This might not be the greatest movie I have seen, but it's no doubt one of the most intelligent and entertaining films. It's perfect in a technical level, but still very though provoking. I'm not going to talk about the main character Alex, everybody always talks about him and how hes one of the finest characters ever, and they aren't wrong. Alex is actually my favorite character of all time, but enough about him, BTW, one of the greatest performances ever, by McDowell.I'm not a huge fan of films that deal with moral issues only, because I don't think you can do much with that theme, but Kubrick does it better that anybody. The film asks, what does it mean to be evil, how do we categorize what's good and evil and if you turn an evil person into a good one, isn't that evil by itself, taking away someones identity. Alex's nature is evil, it's irrelevant how evil he is, but if you take it away from him, you are playing God and changing him. One main theme is fascism. Kubrick plays that theme very subtle, never completely saying it, but it's still about fascism. Alex in a way is a fascist, but so is the government. Alex is like a leader of a small fascist group and the government is like Nazi-Germany. But I think Alex is more than a fascist, hes a bit more of a nihilist. I know that's completely the opposite, but look at it he controls his Droogs by violence, yet is almost a complete nihilist, not caring about anyone and not even wanting money or higher power. He only cares about himself. It also asks the question which one you would rather had? A fascist government that brainwashes people or a nihilist. The film doesn't symphatise with anyone, everybody is evil in their own way. Even if Alex is a psychopath, that doesn't give anybody the reason to change him. Also it does show how it wouldn't work. Alex wrongs people before the brainwash, after hes brainwashed, the people he wronged, aren't going to simply forget about the horribly things. It would only lead to misery. Also it's a social satire, many people don't see the humor of this film. How we react to violence and how our behavior to violence is the wrong method, eye-to-eye. But also Kubrick wants to shock with disturbing images, bizarre soundtrack and with a lot of sexual content. If for anything, this was meant to shock, it was meant to provoke. I love the style. So outrageous, so energetic, so disturbing and so beautiful. The cinematography is one of the best ever. Long shadows, hand-held camera in parts and the bizarre lighting create this wonderful, surreal and nightmarish feel. Also the music help to create the uncomfortable mood Kubrick was going for. It's so unique, so different from anything else and there isn't really another movie saying what this film is. It's a anarchist movie in a way. Also check out Rob Ager's analysis about this film. It's on Youtube, just type in the search Rob Ager the Ludovico lie. That's pretty clever stuff.

(There's a weak spot in the middle, with eavesdroppers falling farcically in and out of the kitchen.) It's from a play but writer Epstein and director Vincente Minelli have effectively opened it up. Your attention is politely directed to the virtually wordless ten-minute montage in which Harrison and Kendall are forced to attend party after party, each indistinguishable from the other. Everyone dashes around in tuxedos and evening gowns, chattering madly, while Harrison -- fiercely bored but still extremely polite -- heads towards the champagne. The parties keep him up until early in the morning and he suffers from daily hangovers and lack of sleep. Harrison is so confused that at one party, instead of Lord and Lady Broadbent, he has himself announced as Broad and Bently Laidlaw or something. Americans of a certain class have their coming out parties too, from the planning of which fathers are ordinarily excluded. One such father, asked about his feeling towards cotillions, put his head in his hands and moaned that they were hideous check-signing ceremonies. (That's not in the movie; it's in a documentary.) Dee and Saxon are a little flat, especially John Saxon, although they both look the part. Saxon is a mannequin but Dee at least has her slight shoulders to emphasize her bust, and that fruity voice suggestive of Bayonne. The rest of the cast are superb. Kay Kendall is the elegantly beautiful but dizzy step mother, always anxious, always confused, and with a nose that could serve as a ship's prow. Rex Harrison is superb in this light comedy. He's able to turn a scene with no dialog -- something as simple as Saxon following him into the men's room -- into a ludic gem.The direction and performances would carry this frothy comedy of mix ups even if the sometimes sparkling dialog did not.

(There's a weak spot in the middle, with eavesdroppers falling farcically in and out of the kitchen.) It's from a play but writer Epstein and director Vincente Minelli have effectively opened it up. Your attention is politely directed to the virtually wordless ten-minute montage in which Harrison and Kendall are forced to attend party after party, each indistinguishable from the other. Everyone dashes around in tuxedos and evening gowns, chattering madly, while Harrison -- fiercely bored but still extremely polite -- heads towards the champagne. The parties keep him up until early in the morning and he suffers from daily hangovers and lack of sleep. Harrison is so confused that at one party, instead of Lord and Lady Broadbent, he has himself announced as Broad and Bently Laidlaw or something. Americans of a certain class have their coming out parties too, from the planning of which fathers are ordinarily excluded. One such father, asked about his feeling towards cotillions, put his head in his hands and moaned that they were hideous check-signing ceremonies. (That's not in the movie; it's in a documentary.) Dee and Saxon are a little flat, especially John Saxon, although they both look the part. Saxon is a mannequin but Dee at least has her slight shoulders to emphasize her bust, and that fruity voice suggestive of Bayonne. The rest of the cast are superb. Kay Kendall is the elegantly beautiful but dizzy step mother, always anxious, always confused, and with a nose that could serve as a ship's prow. Rex Harrison is superb in this light comedy. He's able to turn a scene with no dialog -- something as simple as Saxon following him into the men's room -- into a ludic gem.The direction and performances would carry this frothy comedy of mix ups even if the sometimes sparkling dialog did not.

How could there not be with such limited material. In this instance, Rex Harrison is married to Kay Kendall. Sandra Dee is Harrison's American daughter by his first wife. Dee visits the couple in London and Kendall decides on a coming out party for her during the season. (Evidently these cotillions or whatever they are have a season, like grouse, because they all seem to come in a rush.) The problem is that, at one of the parties, Dee meets the darkly handsome young John Saxon and they fall for each other. Saxon is evidently nothing more than a bongo player in the band -- hardly suitable for the daughter of Lord and Lady Broadbent.The story adheres to all the conventional values of the period. By the end, when Dee and Saxon finally have their embrace unfettered by the conditions of social class, he turns out to be the new Duke of Positano.

With a different director behind the wheel for each chapter, it shouldn't come as much surprise to hear this is an uneven tale that never settles on a firm identity for itself. The underlying theme is light slapstick suspense with a vibrant collection of supporting players, but each act also has its share of dark secrets and sinister overtones. The first two portions are colorful, but too thin for my taste. It seems like both had a solid beginning and ending in mind, and only set about painting by numbers to bring the two together. It's Robert Rodriguez's third act and Quentin Tarantino's closer, though, that drew me to the show anyway. Both serve as bite-sized capsules of both the best and worst traits and habits that have come to define each director. Rodriguez's arc, which naturally features both Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayeck (albeit in short cameos) is a middle ground of sorts between Spy Kids and Planet Terror. It's part kid-focused mayhem and part pulpy, black, gross-out trauma; an enthusiastic, if shallow, ride. Tarantino's adventurous final chapter is more dialog driven, with the director (of course) playing the leading role. Like a caricature of himself, he spends a good ninety percent of the scene spewing pop culture references and jazzy one-liners before the whole drama culminates in a jolting, blunt burst of adrenaline. Overall, Four Rooms is a mixed bag, and apart from the Tarantino chapter, none of the acts stand up particularly well. While fans of the director will no doubt love Quentin's arc, it's short enough that it would probably be just as easily - and effectively - viewed on YouTube or Vimeo.

This is sad but true, and Veber's Diner de Cons aka The Dinner Game builds its plot on a cruel purpose with mean spirited snobs inviting idiots to elect a winner at the end of the evening, and Thierry Lhermitte aka Pierre Brochant, a wealthy publisher, is one of these bad guys.There is a French word to describe a man like Brochant, a 'salaud', a bastard if you prefer, a guy eager to make fun of less smart people, while the so-called Dinner Game can be seen as a tacit bullying, all these dumb-chasers would argue that they don't harm anyone because the purpose of the game is not to let the idiots know why they were invited. It's like 'a crime without victims'. And the players really take their hateful game seriously, each participant having a sort of scout to find the right idiot, either a colleague eager to express some 'new' ideas, a man with strange hobbies, finding a good idiot is not that an easy task. And one day, Brochant receives a phone call from a friend who found a 'world champion' Jacques Villeret as François Pignon, a civil servant working in the Minister of Treasury and building replicas of landmarks with matchsticks, what a promising pedigree! Many people tend to minimize the emphasis on the word 'con' by arguing that we're all the idiots of someone. While it might be true, it doesn't appear to be the message of the film where the personality traits are clearly defined. While not a plain idiot, Pignon is a sweet and lovable buffoon and despite his meanness, Pierre Brochant strikes as a brilliant and intelligent person. The film doesn't try to reverse roles to demonstrate the former idea, and the lyrics of the opening song brilliantly deliver the message that age has nothing to do with brains, when we're an idiot; we're an idiot, period. The genius little song from George Brassens foreshadows the inevitability of the mayhem caused by François Pignon, directly affecting Pierre Brochant's life. And it all starts with the nice twist (indeed) when Brochant hurts his back while golfing and is forced to cancel his participation. After discovering how brilliantly dumb François Pignon is, he decides to go anyway, much to the reluctance of his wife, who therefore leaves him.The movie takes off when Brochant is left alone, incapable to move and with Pignon trying to help him, to see where his wife have gone. And as soon as the movie starts (the set-up took a little time, but for the best) the film features a succession of never-ending misunderstandings, gaffes, and remarkable displays of clumsiness that elevate The Dinner Game to a masterpiece level in the comedy of errors genre. Surprisingly, the film is mostly set in Brochant's luxurious apartment, conveying a sort of trapped sensation. The film is adapted from a play written by Francis Veber and the unity of time, space and plot contributes to a coherent plot getting crescendo, each disaster provoked by Pignon leading to a bigger disaster when he tries to make up for the first. In the progress, other characters make their entrance, Brochant's ex-friend played by a brilliant Francis Huster, Just Leblanc (whose name will create one of the most hilarious cases of misunderstanding in French cinema) not to mention the scene-stealing performance of Daniel Prevost as François's friend, a hard-nosed tax inspector. Alexandra Van Der Noot and Catherine Frot also deserve accolades for the two female parts that will get mixed up by the poor Mr. Pignon.The casting, while minimalist, is enough to conduct the movie with laughs and laughs, creating one of the greatest and most unanimously praised French comedies and Veber's true masterpiece. Indeed, Veber's comedies often relied on the simple but efficient buddy duo, with the white-faced clown and the Auguste, when the laughs mostly came from the reactions of the straight guy rather than the actions of the funny one, but this time, there's also a cynical yet delightful pleasure from seeing the Lhermitte character so tormented. His nightmarish journey seems deserved, and it would take a lot of pains to feel sorry for him because his wife left him, after all, she left him because he wanted to play a humiliating game. Not a villain or an antagonist, he's still a hardly redeemable character, and all the laughs are mixed with the satisfaction to see him get through this pain. As he'd say to Pignon, he avenged in one night all the idiots who ever participated to dinner games before, and he couldn't be truer.But as usual, Veber films don't take their 'seriousness' with seriousness, when we know where the film is going to, we're immediately surprised by a twist that gets the final spice, a masterpiece of wit, sophistication, laughs and cynicism, leading to one major conclusion  never take one's personality for granted.

I have always been very curious about the film as the fact that it was withdrawn from the UK built up so much mystery around it.It is quite a difficult film to watch as the expectation you have leaves you with a feeling that you are going to be let down. However, thankfully this wasn't the case for me as I was quite mesmerised by what I can only call a true work of art. Unfortunately I have not read the book so I can't compare it to the film. This is a film that operates on many levels and explores a lot of ideas. I think the film is primarily concerned with ideas surrounding volition, control, violence (sexual and non sexual), fantasy and psychopathy.The plot follows Alex a sociopath who ends up being a kind of antihero by the latter stages of the film. Alex is a character who as the famous tagline for the film states has made rape, Beethoven and violence his hobbies. I can't help wondering if this isn't reference to Adolf Hitler who was well known for his love of classical music (Wagner). The opening scene is nothing short of stunning. There then follows equally impressive scenes of ultra stylish yet very disturbing violence. The plot moves from a point where Alex is in complete control to one where he is vulnerable and he finally becomes a victim not a perpetrator of violence. I think that the thing that is most worrying about the film is that the moral order is not restored by the end. Although Alex suffers a bit this is not because he is genuinely guilty for his offences it is only due to the behavioural psychology treatment he receives which causes him to feel pain. The story offers much to the viewer to consider, my attention certainly didn't wander and you may be surprised to find quite a few humorous scenes.I can't fault the performances of any of the cast members. The performances are totally convincing and affecting even if the droogs (Alex's gang) look a little old to be teenagers and the presence of Warren Clarke is slightly amusing as I couldn't help picturing him in the BBC TV police drama he stars in, Dalziel and Pascoe.As mentioned before the film opens brilliantly. There really isn't to my mind a single unmemorable scene in the film. The production is wonderful, the colour lavish and every scene makes you feel as though you are there, a guilty spectator.The script is very powerful. This is because of the use of what I believe is a sort of secret language that the writer of A Clockwork Orange, Burgess, devised called Nadsat.The soundtrack is key in the movie as it ties into the plot and ironically it does get you interested in classical music, something which in the film Alex tells two minor characters is extremely important as it is so gorgeous.This film has much to say about British society and it is sad that it had to be withdrawn for so long. It is a haunting and brave film that preys on the mind of the viewer. This is a necessary addition to any movie lover's film collection.
