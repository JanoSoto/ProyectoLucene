Hiding in California, he takes a job as a family therapist and has a group session where he meets Carol Grayland, (Meg Foster) a single mom. When they begin to develop a friendship, along with her son Todd, (Jonathan Brandis) her friend Matty Crimmins, (Caroline Williams) decides to get involved, not completely trusting him. Able to manipulate her to believe him to marry her, which forces her into action and is able to uncover his secret. Confronted with his real plan of marrying to preserve his idea of the perfect, he goes berserk to keep it that way.The Good News This one is a rather decent sequel. The fact that this one still has the creepy motive and back-story for the main villain is a good selling point. It still feels rather creepy and unsettling due to a rather realistic feeling that happens to come from the film. From all the alternative actions taken to ensure that, to the way that it makes the activities he does both normal-seeming and yet really creepy at the same time. That is a fun quality and it adds to the overall tone of the film. This one's best features are it's few horror moments on display. These include the few slashing moments beforehand, which is the confrontation in the house as well as the kitchen brawl later in the film. Both of these are great and a lot of fun, and mixed together with the impressive impound lot scene that has a few comedic moments in it, and these are all rather fun. The wedding, though, is all kinds of fun. From the manic stalking to the constant brawling to it's few blood-splattering moments to the sheer joy at how it ends, this is all considered into a really great sequence. These here are all that work for the film.The Bad News This one here is really disappointing for several reasons, and most of it is due to the fact that it seems to be classified as a slasher rather than a thriller like the first one, which it really should be. There's nothing in here that is characteristic of a slasher film, since the body count is barely there, the few kills on display are barely worth talking about other than the ones mentioned before, and it never once tries to elicit a feeling of constant terror from others before the stalking at the finale. This one never tries to become a slasher, and instead of being called a thriller, which is based around the film's central gimmick and theme, this one tries to play with that rather than going for straight-out horror and all that's left is a feeling of boredom from those who expect a slasher. As a thriller, it isn't that bad, but it's still left with the fact that nothing even happens, and all that occurs before the finale is the attempts to hide the truth from those searching into the past, and these are rarely interesting. That makes this feel even more boring to those expecting a slasher, but when these events aren't that good to begin with, it lowers it to the other fans, leaving this one feeling down even more. Even worse the film plays up all the black comedy one-liners that were requisite for any mass killer anti-hero in a sequel franchise during the late 80s, with the one-liners coming in at very obvious and badly timed moments, and are just plain distracting and rarely funny. This is better than it should be, but still falls a little short.The Final Verdict With one of the main problems that plagued the first one while also fixing one of it's key ones, this one comes out in the end slightly better.

Boy, was that a mistake? I gave up trying to read King's dense narrative that seemed to be all over the place, leaving it aside so that I could remember the effectiveness of Kubrick's screenplay. Only much later, did I learn that Kubrick's script deviated markedly from King's novel. Well, I guess that's art...There are many striking features about the film. First, who would expect to see a true horror movie shot mostly in bright daylight and at such an idyllic setting? Quite the opposite to all the Dracula type schlock that had been so common and that graced cinema screens up till then. Recall Psycho from 1960... The effect for me was to make the narrative all the more horrifying.Did I say idyllic setting? More like modern Gothic, in a way. Or maybe Kubrick was subtlety poking fun at prior so-called horror flicks that had the inevitable dark castle sitting on hill, with lightning crashing around most of the time?And then there's Jack Nicholson, one of Tinsel Town's eccentrics, if not crazy, playing a role tailor made for him. How could it not be, after seeing how well he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)? Some might argue he was over the top, a caricature almost, of a man who truly goes insane. Watching him for the second time, however, I think his performance reminded me all too well of insane people I've met in real life.As a study in abnormal psychology, I think it works very well &#150; in fact, it's a tour de force. And that's why I'm still also a mite disappointed by the way the narrative turns to use supernatural elements to explain the reasons for Jack's descent into his private Hell. (I suppose I'll have to read King's novel to sort this out.) I'm prepared to accept the idea of telepathy between young Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Dick (Scatman Crothers) because I've come across situations that strongly suggest its probability. I see no need, however, to introduce the supernatural, except to appeal to the gullible.Shelley Duval is well cast as the already nervous wife, Wendy; and, I read that Kubrick made her even more nervous with his need for perfection. Scatman was suitably impressive and mysterious; a fine actor and composer. And, hats off to young Danny Lloyd.If this is a movie you've missed, I recommend it thoroughly.

So many elements that in '98 must have seemed alien to the public are now widely understood in a post 9\/11 U.S.However, even after 9\/11, posse comitatus has not been suspended, martial law has not been authorized (save Pakistan), internment camps for U.S. Muslim citizens have not been created or populated, and politicians of both parties, as well as major media outlets and a groundswell of opposition (activists, truthers and the ilk) to torture\/police state\/rollback of constitutional rights (as enumerated in the patriot act) have vowed to not let these things evolve to the extent that this movie portrays.Thus my comment on the political slant that takes over the second half of this movie (I'm a centrist anti-partisan). The first half was good...then oh my.Denzel's performance was fine, however his character became more and more self righteous and preachy as the movie went on. Bruce Willis was...OK, I guess...but his character went from reasonable to tyrannical in an unbelievable blink of an eye (key word - unbelievable). Tony Shalhoub was fantastic! No criticism here.

His obsession with his enemies which led to the documentation and cover-up which ultimately bought him down, are bad and unenviable. Stone, in this thoughtful and powerful biographical movie about Nixon, posits that Nixon was haunted by the ghosts of a pious and, for Richard, insufficiently attentive mother as well as the loss of two brothers before Richard was 20 to diseases which would not have claimed those two young men today. Again, a quite compelling case for Nixon as haunted and insecure made by this movie and many books, for one Nixon and Kissinger by Robert Dallek, is not grounds to dismiss the many faults which became apparent during Nixon's tortured Presidency. However, Nixon's character flaws seem so deep that he seems a Shakespearean character sometimes, nearly helpless against the hands of time. This is the best film Oliver Stone has made, in my opinion. Natural Born Killers was bizarre and not coherent enough to thoughtfully skewer the media's fixation with violence and gore, it seemed to me. While the satire at some points was extremely powerful, in order for satire to work, one needs material which might engage and interest the viewer also. JFK put Oliver in the category of JFK conspiracy nuts with too much time and bandwidth (though it wasn't available at that time) at his disposal. He posited a largely discredited theory which postulates some quite crazy beliefs. Nixon though, it seemed to me, struck just the right balance between recognizing the role of the psyche in effecting fate and in recognizing the deviousness and ambition which played crucial roles in poisoning the leadership of Richard Milhous Nixon. Stone's cinematography and use of flashbacks in the film is second-to-none. He flashes back to incidents in Richard's life (his brothers' deaths, his father's coldness) which may have made indelible marks on young Richard and which gave rise to the innately reserved politician working in the quintessentially wrong profession. As Nixon himself said, I'm an introvert working in an extrovert's field. The acting in the film, from Joan Allen as a devoted Pat Nixon who herself seems mystified by her husband's reserves at times to James Woods as an efficient, bland Ehrlichman, to David Paymer as a deers-in-the-headlight press secretary Ron Ziegler, from Powers Boothe as a low-key Gen. Alexander Haig who supported Nixon's most authoritarian moves to Paul Sorvino as a slouching, perfectly voiced Kissinger, the acting is superb. Anthony Hopkins, who always seems to have something of a natural reserve about him, plays Nixon very well. He seems painfully shy, behind all the bluster and braggadocio, and as the scandals deepen and he becomes increasingly isolated, he is unable to separate fact from paranoia and dream. He received an Oscar nomination for which he, I think appropriately, did not win the Oscar, but Joan Allen I think was deserving of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She is at turns her husband's rock, insecure, loving, his sounding board, the only person able to be honest with him, protective, and jealous. It is a fantastic, supremely self-assured effort.Stone's direction could well have won him an Oscar and I think it deserved the nod. Contrasting the multiple sides of Richard Nixon and his incredible shrinking Presidency required a great deal of ability and never has Stone shown it more than in this film. He situates the material in just the right proportion, in just the right way, not excusing Nixon, but depicting him as a man haunted by painful memories and quite possibly the man with the worst career counselor in the history of man. To depict such a tortured character as Nixon so sympathetically but not as a hagiographer might, is a magnificent accomplishment.

There Alicia receives treatment & they both set off back to the theatre, however what they don't realise is that they are giving an unexpected guest a ride. The mass murderer & ex-actor Irving Wallace (Clain Parker) has escaped from the psychiatric hospital & is hitching a lift with the girls, back at the theatre Wallace kills Betty & the police are called but cannot find Wallace. Sensing a lot of free publicity the play's director Peter (David Brandon) locks his cast & crew into the theatre to rehearse changes to the script which will cash in on Betty's murder, unfortunately the psycho killer Wallace is also locked in with them & proceeds to bump them off one-by-one...Also known under the titles Aquarius, Bloody Bird, Sound Stage Massacre & the more common English title of Stage Fright this Italian production was the feature film debut of Michele Soavi who appears in the film as the young cop stationed in the police car all night to keep on eye on the theatre & is an OK 80's slasher that should please fans of the genre if no-one else. The script by big George Eastman under the pseudonym Lew Cooper with Sheila Goldberg credited with 'dialogue' by the IMDb takes itself very seriously while some say that Deliria is a Dario Argento type Giallo, personally I think Deliria couldn't be further from them. A traditional Giallo is a gory murder mystery where the killer is revealed in usually an absurd plot twist like Tenebre (1982) but from the 12th minute it is made perfectly clear that Irving Wallace a convicted killer is behind the murders & therefore Deliria is more of a routine 80's teen slasher like Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980) & has next to nothing in common with the complex murder mysteries that Argento served up in his hey day. I quite liked the setting for Deliria, the character's are cardboard cutouts there to be killed off, the initial plot is convoluted & silly with Alicia going to a psychiatric hospital for an injured ankle which makes zero sense & there's a bizarre, cheesy & dumb twist ending which is totally at odds with the rest of the film. Deliria is an OK way to pass 90 odd minutes if your a horror fan but others may not be so charitable with it's flaws.Director Soavi show's a little bit of style here, there are some well directed scenes with some nice cinematography & lighting. The golden days of the Italian gore film were long gone when Deliria was made & as such it wasn't as gory as I was hoping, most of the violence is off screen but someone gets a drill through their body, someone is stabbed, someone has their arm cut off & is then decapitated, someone is cut in half & are seen sliced in two & someone is killed with a chainsaw. It sounds nastier than it actually is as the camera doesn't linger on the gore. There's a decent atmosphere to it & there's some suspense & tension in there as well.With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 Deliria is well made with good effects, some decent stunts & solid production values. Despite being an Italian production it seemed to me most of the cast spoke English & are not dubbed, the acting isn't that good Jo Ann Smith who played Sybil the screaming sissy was really annoying & I was glad when she was cut in half. In fact maybe the killer Wallace was murdering everyone because he saw them rehearse the play & discovered they were such bad actors?Deliria isn't a classic from the Italian horror genre, it's too routine & predictable for that but it ain't half bad & slasher fans should like it at least.

True, in-between fantastic and awful is an extremely large space in which a lot of films lie but I truly believe that Halloween III deserves it. The first and most obvious mistake people make with this film regarding actually liking it is the inclusion (or lack of) Michael Myers &#150; my only advice is 'do not watch this film as a Halloween film as such'; it's based around Halloween and has a pretty implausible idea for a premise and yet as a film alone, it manages to stand all by itself as an entertaining, well paced and unpredictable film that has its fair share of cheap thrills, schlock horror moments and gore.Looking into Halloween III a little more deeply, you will see a statement on Halloween as a whole. The incessant repetition of the Silver Shamrock advert or jingle since it's also on the radio is not one of the reasons the film's crap; it's the constant reminder of what Halloween has become cheap, tacky and utilised to sell products. Indeed, the antagonist of the film (a sort of God like dictator whom closely resembles pure evil) states that Halloween used to be a proper celebration or acknowledgement of a certain something evilness and all things nasty. When Veteran's Day or Remembrance Sunday comes along, we don't celebrate it but we certainly acknowledge it as some things need not be forgot. Conal Cochran is saying that Halloween has turned into a consumerism joke over the centuries and he is trying to move things back to the 'old times'.It's true that the film borrows heavily from the science fiction and fantasy genre but horror still remains its primary genre with 'to scare' still the primary aim. When we are first shown the trailer for Halloween (1978) on a television, this immediately zones us out of whatever world Halloween is set and distances itself from Myers and Haddonfield as a whole &#150; it was at this point that the film could've crashed and burnt since it's supposed to take place in the 'real' world where only so much is physically possible; thankfully, Halloween III stays realistic until the final twenty minutes and even then given the science fiction and fantasy that has crept in, it still remains plausible. Halloween III is slower and smarter than Halloween II and changes things round a bit more Jaime Lee Curtis has gone and as a hero, is replaced by a hard bodied doctor called Daniel Challis (Atkins). Myers as a villain is replaced by the Silver Shamrock company\/factory as a whole since they are both big, mysterious and seemingly indestructible and although Conal remains a frail old man, he hides dark secrets.Halloween III takes a Village of the Damned approach without children in the sense a bizarre town seemingly populated by possessed humans (turns out they're robots) and run in the middle of nowhere by a massive corporation. The idea that a Halloween mask can do the things that it can thanks to a microchip that is activated by a certain signal through a TV advertisement may seem elaborate but like I said, fantasy\/horror is not something we are new to these days and if you're talking about back in the early 1980s then I guess Halloween III must have been ahead of its time because the elaborate content and ideas are not an excuse to dislike or hate the film. There is a strong feeling of no hope; a wonderful atmosphere of unpredictability and horror and yet we feel Dr. Challis is up to the challenge so we are kept on the edge of our seat unlike in Halloween II where Myers may have decapitated everyone in the hospital but the scrawny, weak and non-sexually active character of Laurie is enough to win in the end &#150; there is none of that clichéd horror nonsense here, just well placed jumps; the right amount of violence and a nasty ending that will leave a nasty taste in the mouth. I can recommend Halloween III over Halloween II any day but if you watch it forgetting about John Carpenter, Michael Myers and all that business and without knowing what happens when the mask is 'activated' in a certain scene, you will enjoy this quirky and surreal 80s horror.

True, in-between fantastic and awful is an extremely large space in which a lot of films lie but I truly believe that Halloween III deserves it. The first and most obvious mistake people make with this film regarding actually liking it is the inclusion (or lack of) Michael Myers &#150; my only advice is 'do not watch this film as a Halloween film as such'; it's based around Halloween and has a pretty implausible idea for a premise and yet as a film alone, it manages to stand all by itself as an entertaining, well paced and unpredictable film that has its fair share of cheap thrills, schlock horror moments and gore.Looking into Halloween III a little more deeply, you will see a statement on Halloween as a whole. The incessant repetition of the Silver Shamrock advert or jingle since it's also on the radio is not one of the reasons the film's crap; it's the constant reminder of what Halloween has become cheap, tacky and utilised to sell products. Indeed, the antagonist of the film (a sort of God like dictator whom closely resembles pure evil) states that Halloween used to be a proper celebration or acknowledgement of a certain something evilness and all things nasty.

It also restrains the movie its story and keeps it rather simplistic. The movie gives you the feeling it had more potential in its story really.There are some great, almost artistic like looking shots within the movie, which still makes this a certainly better than average one and also more interesting to watch. it's a very creatively put together movie, with also some great camera-work, lighting and use of shadows. Of course the museum chase at the end of the movie is the highlight of the movie. It's a greatly directed sequence that is great looking and constructed.

And I laughed crazy at another 30-something-looking actress playing the maladjusted teenager; yes, it is true they laugh too much on screen, but so much for many other bigger productions. HOWEVER This movie still oozes some kind of (weird) charm because -let's face it- it depicts highschool years like we wanted ours to be...fun...sleaze...pranks...some minor violence for thrills, but nobody dies, gets permanently hurt or sent to jail for life. Sure, women are mainly praised for a bunch of hair down there...but if the movie is women-hating, then women looking at which car men drive or the like (=movies ) are men-hating. That is how teen years are supposed to be, while old eyes see this and react to this like Beulah Balbricker. Not award-winning material, but neither the vile, demeaning tripe some want it to be. Or perhaps those people in high-school were debating global warming, exploitation schemes in perspective since Gengiz Khan & so forth. As well, end titles give 1981 as year of release. That period (late 70s-early 80s) was plagued by escapist movies, preferably set in the 1950-60s...remember the cold war was at its highest, and masses needed escapism.

Yes, it is true this movie isn't refined, sophisticated and its attempts at sociology (EG the antisemitism angle ) are paper thin; yes, it is true it belongs among the juvenile junk movie production of the reagan era, even if the movie isn't a full fledged US production; yes, it is true characters are stereotypical & paper thin...as with most character of juvenile 1980s movies anyways; yes, it is true actors no way look like 16-17yo (that is high school, not middle school like some accurate critic suggests ), but that is true of most juvenile movies, including the pathetic Beverly Hills of the 1990...Luke Perry looked what, 38? And I laughed crazy at another 30-something-looking actress playing the maladjusted teenager; yes, it is true they laugh too much on screen, but so much for many other bigger productions. HOWEVER This movie still oozes some kind of (weird) charm because -let's face it- it depicts highschool years like we wanted ours to be...fun...sleaze...pranks...some minor violence for thrills, but nobody dies, gets permanently hurt or sent to jail for life. Sure, women are mainly praised for a bunch of hair down there...but if the movie is women-hating, then women looking at which car men drive or the like (=movies ) are men-hating. That is how teen years are supposed to be, while old eyes see this and react to this like Beulah Balbricker. Not award-winning material, but neither the vile, demeaning tripe some want it to be. Or perhaps those people in high-school were debating global warming, exploitation schemes in perspective since Gengiz Khan & so forth. As well, end titles give 1981 as year of release. That period (late 70s-early 80s) was plagued by escapist movies, preferably set in the 1950-60s...remember the cold war was at its highest, and masses needed escapism.
