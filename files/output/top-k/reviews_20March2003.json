The most exciting, and great actors.  If ever you just watch one movie with Errol Flynn this is it. I give it ten stars.  Spoiler Robin Hood is a knight which becomes a bandit to protect the poor people of England. He is doing this because the real king of England is captured in a distant land during a crusade. Robin tells John (the kings brother which is taking over England) that he will fight him with every means in his power. From that moment forth, he is for ever an out law. He robs the rich to help the poor and saves the money to send to the men holding the king. Robin meets Maid Marian when he and his men ambush a party (prince John tax collectors) with the taxes they have gathered from the people. Robin falls in love with Maid Marian , right then and there. He tells her of why he is an out law, and she understands why he's doing it.  Prince John thinks of an Ideal, to capture Robin using Maid Marian as Bate. A prize of a golden arrow. ( for the best archer in all of England). Robin knows it's a trick but he can't resist not to see Marian. He disguises him self, but is still captured. He is going to be hanged. Maid Marian discovers this and helps his men get robin free with a very clever plan. Robin thanks Marian in one of my favorite parts. Where he climbs the tower to speak with her. She admits she loves him. She tells Robin she will stay in the castle to warn him of any other treason which might occur.Next, the king is returning, and the Bishop discovers this and he tells Prince John and they hire a knight to kill the king. Marian over hears this and she tells her maid which tells Robin.  John discovers that she was going to tell Robin Hood and will kill her, when he becomes king, in the morning. Her only hope is Robin to find the king and over power Princess John. Will Robin Find the king in time to save Marian and destroy the evil Princes John and his followers?  I know I explained what happened in the movie, but you must understand that you will not know how great it is, unless you go see it for your self. My short sum up is nothing compared to the great movie, which is just begging to be seen again. I wish Holly Wood would make more movies like these ones.

This version of the mythical tale of terror is the closest to the novel that I have seen thus far and possibly not the last.After all, Hammer film studios in the U.K. and Universal studios in America made a bomb on bringing the story and countless unofficial follow ups to the big screen.  This adaptation however presents a different Dr.Frankenstein and a more methodical and intelligent monster from what we have seen before. Frankenstein (Victor is his first name) is the son of a respected, wealthy doctor(Ian Holm) and a loving mother (Cherie Lunghi) in his home town of Geneva in Austria.When he is a young boy of about six his mother and father introduce him to a little gypsy girl named Elizabeth (Who grows to be Elizabeth Bonham Carter)who they have adopted.Her mother and father are dead as a result of Scarlet fever.The two of them grow to love one another as brother and sister but eventually they grow to be in love with one another.  Good things cannot last however and in the case of Victor's mother it's a sadly tragic event in the Frankenstein household.Having fallen pregnant once more, Victor's mother dies giving birth to a little boy who is named William.The tragedy of nature that takes Victor's mother from him drives him into despair more than any of his family.so much so that he becomes obsessed with finding a way to combat death so that those who love another can be together forever.  It's some time after the death of his mother, seven years in fact that Victor leave Geneva to attend the university of Ingolstadt in the hope of becoming a qualified doctor.  It's at Ingolstadt that Victor meets his soon to be best friend and companion, Henry Clerval (Tom Hulce).A light weight person with a sarcastic sense of humor, Henry is a more grounded person than what he appears to be on the surface.He become Victor's conscience and often chides him for his unhealthy obsession with life and death.  It's here as well that Frankenstein also meets his anatomy teacher Prof. Waldman(An unrecognizable John Cleese).Waldman was a once brilliant young young doctor who like Victor was obsessed with seeking out a way to overcome death.This obsession lead Waldman to practice illegal and unethical experiments in the name of science.However this only would result in the discovery of his misdeeds by the proper authorities. Now but a mere teacher he hopes to try and steer Victor clear of making the same mistake that he did.But by doing so he unwitting allows Victor to see the notes that he had written so very long ago on the discoveries he had made.It is not until the untimely death of Waldman at the hands of an enraged patient he is attempting to vaccinate against small pox.  This enrages Victor who respected and admired his contemporary.That however does not detract Victor from continuing Waldmans work from where it left off and well...you pretty much know what happens next.  All in all this is not an altogeher bad movie.Kenneth Brannagh as tried his best to try and bring the story to the closest it can be in just under two hours.The casting choices for the most part are good.Robert DeNiro is indeed an inspired choice to portray the creature that Frankenstein reanimates from bits of various corpses.He lends a bitter melancholy to the tragic creation that he is.Reviled and loathed by all that he meets the creature is one of the classic personifications of the outcast in society.

The same goes for reviews  it's just so much more fun to trash a movie than to praise it.  With that in mind, it is taking an act of will not to completely trash GLADIATOR.  Instead, I will point out the good things.  Its visuals are stunning.  It's the first movie I've seen with really superb CG backgrounds that looked real and added to the film without distracting.  Its fight scenes are incredible.  The opening battle scene is nasty, bloody, loud and almost overwhelming.  Plus, it has a plethora of great old actors hamming it up the way actors should in a movie this big.  The movie was obviously made with a great deal of care and an eye for details.  It is, truly, a big-time, Hollywood epic.  And yet it could have been soooo much more.....First, Russel Crowe delivers the least heroic hero.  An epic lives on its ability to make you want to watch the hero's story for three hours.  Crowe has the size and swagger down, but his squinty-eyed disdain is too off-putting to make him sympathetic.  Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just not villainous.  The hero is measured by the quality of the obstacles he overcomes.  If Phoenix is an obstacle, he's an obstacle with no charisma and a laughable accent made even more laughable by its proximity to the Shakespearian delivery of Derek Jacobi, Oliver Reed, etc.  These guys mouth words like they're sucking hard candy, while Mr. Phoenix mumbles like he has marbles in his mouth.  It's a poor choice.  (Why must he have an accent at all?  Only Britain was British to the Romans, right?)  And finally, the story (though I have friends who SWEAR it really happened) is a little ludicrous with a preachy ending.  It just felt hollow. As gladiator pics go, this does have the violence and mayhem that make for some good watching.  Unfortunately, with a little bit of editing and recasting, it could have been so much more.

It is, truly, a big-time, Hollywood epic.  And yet it could have been soooo much more.....First, Russel Crowe delivers the least heroic hero.  An epic lives on its ability to make you want to watch the hero's story for three hours.  Crowe has the size and swagger down, but his squinty-eyed disdain is too off-putting to make him sympathetic.  Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just not villainous.  The hero is measured by the quality of the obstacles he overcomes.  If Phoenix is an obstacle, he's an obstacle with no charisma and a laughable accent made even more laughable by its proximity to the Shakespearian delivery of Derek Jacobi, Oliver Reed, etc.  These guys mouth words like they're sucking hard candy, while Mr. Phoenix mumbles like he has marbles in his mouth.  It's a poor choice.  (Why must he have an accent at all?  Only Britain was British to the Romans, right?)  And finally, the story (though I have friends who SWEAR it really happened) is a little ludicrous with a preachy ending.  It just felt hollow. As gladiator pics go, this does have the violence and mayhem that make for some good watching.  Unfortunately, with a little bit of editing and recasting, it could have been so much more.

His first feature Clerks, which is my own personal favourite of his and something that I think he's never matched since, was brilliant because it was razor sharp, superbly written and actually quite insightful. It tapped into a gen-x underside to small town life, made up of people who are too intelligent to waste away their time in low-rent, boring jobs but find that's what they choose to do rather than make the attempt to really better themselves. More than anything it demonstrated that you don't NEED special effects and egotistical A-list stars to make a good movie, you just need raw talent and ingenuity. Mallrats is much more of a fan-boy picture. It's funny, hilarious at times, but the humour felt somehow stretched, as though Kevin had simply been asked to do more of the same on a bigger budgeted, studio outing with better actors. It's really just an escapist, feel good romantic comedy. Chasing Amy on the other hand, made for only about 250,000 dollars, was superb, a funny yet poignant and acutely observed film about contemporary sexuality and relationships. Dogma an interesting failure, good ideas and intelligence let down by excess and sloppy direction.All of which leads you to conclude that Kevin Smith is a genuinely good filmaker, but his talents lie best in writing, and if he must direct, then he should limit himself to low-maintenance, understated indie movies. Give him a huge budget and he tries to cram in too much, too many visuals and too many inconsequential details. He doesn't have any real sense of cinema aesthetics or mise-en-scene which means his films can look badly shot and put together. But he's a very funny guy, with a knack for realistic and erudite dialogue and situations. It's a shame therefore that as far as most people were concerned his major contribution to contemporary cinema was the creation of Jay and Silent Bob. As most people have noted the guys are fine in small amounts, as comic characters designed to temper the more normal people we meet in Kevin's films (lets face it, they could have been left out of Chasing Amy without any major repercussions) but too much of them and we begin to see that they really can't carry 90 minutes of screen time on their own.Not that they're forced to. At least Kevin managed to secure the talents of many quality actors for this film, including cameos from just about everyone who's been in a previous View Askew production Chris Rock, Jason lee, George Carlin, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Joey Lauren Adams, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Carmen Lee etc. He even manages to dredge up Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill for a couple of scenes (Mark Hamill has to have, amusingly, a onscreen caption with his name when he appears, due to the fact that he hasn't done anything noteworthy for about 20 years and is therefore unrecognisable to Star Wars fans). Unfortunatly that's one of the movies most signifigant drawbacks. It's very much an insider film, full of self-referencing and in-jokes from other films by the director, and if you haven't seen these movies then you might be a bit non-plussed at times. Then again, if you haven't seen these movies you're unlikely to be rushing to see this one. People say he made it for the fans, and that's fair enough, but I think the fans deserve better.That's the second problem and probably, now I come to think of it, a more important one the movie isn't actually very funny. Oh it has its moments, it is Kevin Smith after all, but nothing like the volume of quality gags we saw in any of the earlier films. There's an amusing Scooby Doo parody which, to be fair, gets more laughs in about 5 minutes than the recent feature did in an hour and a half. There's Jay's impassioned speech on behalf of the Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Treedwellers (geddit?). There's even a very welcome 'Good Will Hunting' sequel 'Hunting Season', and it's nice to see Ben and Matt send themselves up so freely. But a lot of the movie grates. Jay isn't a marvellous character to listen to for over an hour, some of the material is obviously recycled from the comic books (which fans will presumably have read), then there's a lot of redundant dick and fart jokes and profanity just for the sake of being profane i.e. that swearing alone is somehow inherently amusing.It's not a total disaster, and the quickfire approach to the gags means that while little is set up or developed sufficiently to make the jokes really funny, if a line or visual hook falls flat, there'll be another one along in about 15 seconds, so you ought to be able to find something amusing in there. By the way the film, I noticed, came under a lot of fire from certain pressure groups due to accusations of obscenity, homophobia etc, but if you actually watch it you'll realise that it in no way condones anything Jay says; he's like a five year old with tourrettes and it's funny because he has no idea how stupid and offensive he comes off.Flawed, but Kevin Smith is now working on a more mature and intellectualy challenging project, so hopefully this kind of low-brow, juvenile slapstick is behind him now.

Rarely is the film carried by the strength of the actors.  ROPE is one of Hitchcock's few films that ignore most of the typical attributes mentioned above, except for some dark humor, and allows the actors to carry the whole story.  There is no mystery in this film for the viewers as we witness the murder at the start of the film.  The suspense is generated by the actors as they deal with the absence of the murder victim from a party thrown by the two murderers.  The family, fiance and friend of the victim, who don't know he has been killed, become increasingly upset at his absence from the party.  The maid helps fuel the tension as she gossips while conducting her duties. The former headmaster of the school the murder victim, the two hosts and the other young male guest all attended puts the pieces together.  Meanwhile, the two hosts try and drop as many hints as they can that the missing party member has been killed and that they did it.  For one of the hosts it seems to fuel his own idea that he is superior to all his guests and that if they were his equal they could figure it all out.  The other host can barely keep it together as he experiences doubt and regret about what he has done and worries about being caught. Rope boasts some big named actors such as James Stewart and Sir Cedric Hardwicke but also brings some less known actors such as John Dall and Douglas Dick.  The mix works out fine.  Stewart, who breaks from his down home-everyman roles, is perfect as the philosophical headmaster who with his abstract ideas that he passed on to his students really is responsible for the killing that takes place.  I really enjoyed watching Joan Chandler as the soon to be fiance of the murdered man.  It was a treat to see Hitchcock use a brunette instead of his standard blonde for this movie.  I find her role to be in some ways the most complex.  She has dated 2 of the men at the party and has now moved onto the murder victim.  Behind her sophisticated image is a woman who has been unhappy and for the first time is really happy and looking forward to a future with the murdered victim.  The movie never indicates what happens when the party members, other than the headmaster, discover that the missing party member has been murdered by his friends and we as viewers are left to our own ideas as two how they will respond.  I suspect the fiance had a huge mental breakdown and either never recovered from the incident and spent her life single and unhappy or she married the other male guest whom she used to date and they still show signs of caring for each other.This was Hitchcock's first color movie and the set is beautiful.  The view of the city from the killers apartment is so life like it is hard to believe that it is a manufactured setting.Lastly, the DVD for this movie also includes the trailer.  The trailer is the only time the viewer gets to see the murder victim alive and it adds some backdrop to the relationship between the victim and his soon to be fiance.

Spoilers Ahead!**While watching Cast Away, the word that came to mind more than any other was 'right.'  Everything (except one thing) was done right, the way it should have been done.  From Hanks's metamorphosis to the unique ending, each decision of each character was perfect.  If you saw the trailer (which gave away entirely too much), then you know the basic storyline.  In the prelude, he nails the American obsession with work and time, and their conflict with relationships.  Then his plane crashes, and does so spectacularly.  Nothing is ordinary about how Robert Zemeckis shows the wreck.  He uses primarily interior shots, rather than the standard airplane-hurtling-from-the-sky visuals.  As perverse as it may sound, this is the best and most frightening plane crash I've ever seen on film.  The middle act features Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) stranded on his island.  This act is split into two distinct parts that are separated by four years.  The first features Hanks merely adapting and surviving.  The second shows who and what Hanks has become, and how he has honed his survival skills.  This transition dominates the film.  The only noise for an hour are the natural sounds and occasional Hanks dialogue.  How many actors can not only keep but demand your attention for sixty minutes w\/o scarcely a word?  Hanks truly deserved another Oscar for his remarkable interaction with the island and Wilson, in manners both subtle and exuberant.  The cinematography here was marvelous, displaying both the magnificience and grittiness of the island simultaneously.  Finally he manages to escape, and after several dramatic encounters, including the nearly tear-inducing loss of Wilson, Hanks is discovered by a freighter.  That set the stage for what I was looking forward to, Hanks returning to civilization and adapting back to a different life.  I desperately wanted to see him experience the joy of a clean shower, brushing his teeth, or tasting food again.  But most of those scenes were never shown, and that's my singular complaint.  A few nods to this were seen, such as Hanks toying with the pocket knife, chugging the bottled water, and flicking on the lighter.  I suppose my desired scenes would have extended the running time too long, but I still missed them.  The stage was then set for Noland's reunion with Helen Hunt's character, Kelly, who had essentially started a new life in the Hanks absence.  To continue a theme, this was done right.  In a lesser film, the two might have blissfully run off together into the sunset, but Cast Away is smarter and more realistic than that.  While admittedly still in love, the two characters realize that they both must move on.  This is heart-breaking.  There can't be much worse in life than knowing where your heart lies, but not being able to follow it because of something ludicrously random. The coda is perfect too.  Noland finds closure by delivering the package that kept him alive by providing hope, one of the most powerful feelings.  Upon delivery and a chance encounter with the recipient, Noland ends his journey by standing at a literal and symbolic crossroads, not quite sure what's next.  Perfect, because that is precisely where he is at, physically and mentally and emotionally.Overall, so much is well done.Bottom Line One of few films in which I have zero complaints regarding the characters' decisions.

Examples include the darkness which falls at the scene of a disasterous event outside the bowling alley in the second half. Another is the jump cut to an exploding firework used when The Dude is punched whilst lying on his new rug. The trails of light from the firework then morph seamlessly into an aeriel view of the lights on the streets of LA at night. Amazing stuff.Visuals are great, but when not backed up with equally good dialogue you can end up with a George Lucas movie. The dialogue in this film is at times nothing short of astonishing. John Goodman's character, Walter, is a Vietnam veteran with excellent vocabulary, historical awareness, philosophical ability; all shot through with tirades of foul language. He is both hilarious and thought provoking, much like the film as a whole.With a supporting cast of John Turturro, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Stormare and Tara Reid; the movie shimmers with comic timing and great acting.It's one of the best.

The story comes in and out of a period in Jeffrey Lebowski's (The Dude) life and shows the ease with which he gets himself into ridiculous situations.I gave this film 10 out of 10 (one of only 3 films to score this out of about 600 I've rated - take note all you people out there giving Daredevil etc 10 points!)The editing is superb, the lighting and use of colours is unlike anything I've ever seen. Examples include the darkness which falls at the scene of a disasterous event outside the bowling alley in the second half. Another is the jump cut to an exploding firework used when The Dude is punched whilst lying on his new rug. The trails of light from the firework then morph seamlessly into an aeriel view of the lights on the streets of LA at night. Amazing stuff.Visuals are great, but when not backed up with equally good dialogue you can end up with a George Lucas movie. The dialogue in this film is at times nothing short of astonishing.

I have never seen such an actor who can say that genuinely, and never have such a cheesy line been well said by an actor Emile Hirsch's age. Much kudos to him. The rest of the film is pretty much like the way Hirsch said his line. The young actors (Hirsch, Culkin, Malone) are genuine and true. Not only the main characters but the boys who played Francis and Tim's sidekicks were superb as well. This film was well supported by Jodie Foster and Vincent D'Onofrio. Some say that their acting was so-so, but I think the filmmakers did a good job of not letting them get behind the shadow of the main characters yet gave them (Foster & D'Onofrio) enough screen time. Yet, I felt that Foster's performance was a bit empty. This movie shows both the irony and joy of living a teenage life. On my side note, I liked the way the movie was shot...especially when the 4 partners-in-crime are fooling around in the field, drinking and all.

In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking that this isn't a Disney movie at all... the only talking animal has a good excuse for yapping in the voice of David Spade, the only romantic relationship is that between Pacha and his wife (and even there it's more the sign of a happily married couple), and apart from the Emperor's Theme Song Guy (He's the hippest cat in creation...) - and Sting over the end credits, but we'll forgive that - no one bursts into song. Plus the emphasis is more on Warner Bros-type energetic humour than usual. No wonder it was a disappointment at the box office; not your traditional Disney movie.Then again, The Rescuers Down Under was an underrated pleasure as well.The story isn't particularly different - you've got the ruler who has to change externally before he can change internally (Beauty and the Beast), Kronk, the good-hearted sidekick of the villain (Yzma) who can't bring himself to kill the hero (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), and so on - but as is often the case it's not so much what the plot is as how it's handled. Although the movie suffers from Is-that...? syndrome - it's too hard not to see Finch from Just Shoot Me! every time Kuzco speaks (strangely enough, even though Pacha's wife has the voice of Wendie Malick from the same show, I never pictured Nina Van Horn... which isn't the case with Fillmore!, where Miss Malick voices Principal Folsom. Go figure) - the movie's speed, energy and high humour rate make it easy to forgive, with Kuzco and the bad guy's sidekick as standouts. The movie's also a bit more self-reverential than other Disney movies, notably in our hero's narration (plus at one point Yzma and Kronk notice they're leaving a blue trail behind them, which turns out to be the trail they leave on the map to the palace illustrating the race between them and our heroes).The surprising thing is that it even works with character - though the Emperor is enough of a self-absorbed hedonist (to a prospective wife Let me guess - you've got a really great personality) to turn off Paris and Nicky Hilton, he and Pacha have a believable relationship throughout the movie, so that by the end we're rooting for him to get turned back into a human. Too bad Marc Shaiman's score was thrown out (he'd have been a natural, as opposed to John Debney), but no sense whining over what might have been. An adventure, a comedy and a drama all in one, The Emperor's New Groove has everything that was notably absent from DreamWorks' own South American-set cartoon The Road to El Dorado (charm, interest, no Elton John overdose and so on) and is the funniest movie from the House of Mouse since Aladdin. It's easier to forgive them for giving the world Dinosaur in 2000 as well.Why DOES she have that lever, anyway?

Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the stolen kiss on the beach at night and Cue the sun!In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current reality TV obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic childhood existence.
