This movie has many good actors, none of them shines through other than De Niro though, i'm starting to doubt De Niro can make a poor job, he is once again excellent in this movie, even though his role isn't too large.I base my vote on many things i guess, it doesn't deserve a too low vote becuase it is a pretty good attempt and works much of the way and it'll keep you interested and not bored, even though there are scenes that could have been redone or removed, it still works pretty good for entertaining and has substance and a tad of moral as a movie like this needs to have. To the negative side i can only see that i think they paced it too much in the end, instead of giving a patient ending, like they had a patient opening they race the movie to the end and everything seems a bit unclear and confusing, and most importantly, unrealistic and Stallone returns to his stereotype hero role.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This has all been seen before, the movie is pretty well done, but it brings nothing new to a burnout genre, actually i was having positive thoughts far along the way despite this, but i felt the ending off it all seemed rushed and just generally wasn't very well done, the movie let itself down.Sylvester Stallone plays the sheriff of a small town called Garrison, his biggest dream is to become a real cop, as in he wants to be part of N.Y.P.D, however in his teen year he had his listening wrecked on one of his ears, making him incapable of having a job at N.Y.P.D.

You might get a person or two who will say that the acting had its good points or that other factors involved in production were satisfactory. And they might even be correct in their opinion. That still does not exclude this movie from being a huge turkey. And by 'turkey' I mean the evil kind. There are good 'turkeys' such as 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Movies like that are forgivable. This is something else entirely. This movie was made to generate money. A casual eye wont care much, but Im sure this movie will tick off the serious film buff. Especially if they liked the 1976 'Carrie'. So whats this carrie2 all about? (Im gonna bazooka the spoilers here so duck if you dont want to know) The lead character, Rachel, is a high school student with telekinesis and few friends, just like the first movie, it's remake and the novel they was based on. She lives with foster parents because her mother is in a mental facility. As it turns out, her mother did the horizontal mambo with Carrie's biological father making the two sisters. Never mind the fact that Rachel's father would have been in his 60s and her mother in her 20s at the time of her birth and that Rachel's mom's religious nature would have made such a union all the more improbable. The film trudges on to a plot concerning high school jock-types trying to have sex with as many girls as they can so they can display the results later. Now call me silly, but I seem to recall high school always being like that to some extent. For that reason its hard to see the Rachel character as much of a victim. Unlike her 'sister', she has friends and a job and seems to be doing ok. You know whats going to happen next, somethings going to trigger Rachel's telekinesis, she's going to be at odds with the jocks, one of them is going to be the good guy she falls for, and then we have the finale where people die. Thats it. I forgot to mention that Amy Irving is in this. Supposedly she is reprising her role as Sue Snell, but she's only there to be the 'chalk-board' explanation person for Rachel. Never mind how A regular person would know the exact science of telekinetic biology. Never mind that this version of Sue Snell gets a quick death near the end anyway. Never mind that the first movie used Brian DePalma's craft work for some very effective scenes and this version uses a stretchy lens to replace him. never mind any of that stuff, because it does not matter. The studio already has your money. Now if your smart you will realize what is going on here. It isnt so much the story or the acting or anything else that makes this an 'evil' turkey. Its the intentions behind it. Now lets say intentions were good. Well, guess what? It still bombs because the movie also succeeds at making you feel creepy. Not 'good' creepy but that irritating creepy you felt back in high school, the feeling that made you wish you had telekinesis so you could wipe out some cheerleaders yourself. If you liked the original Carrie, you know why you liked it the split screen, the dark cinematography that made Carrie's house look so lonely, the well written music that uses sympathy to evoke horror, the little touches like the ominous hornet logo used for the high school, the ultra good acting, etc. You wont find that here.

Alas, that is not the case.This film can be viewed as 2 separate parts  Peter Parker and Spiderman. The Peter Parker portions (say that 3 times real fast) are far and away the superior portion of the film.  I enjoyed Peter's interactions with Mary Jane - Maguire pulls off the shy, nerdy kid really well.  However, his relationship with Norman Osborn (Dafoe) always felt rushed and silly. Osborn tells him at the end, I've been like a father to you.  Huh?  When did that happen, exactly?  They have perhaps 3 conversations throughout the film and they're very brief and businesslike.  I can't really imagine their relationship growing off-screen, either.Another rush-job was Uncle Ben's death.  Peter gets about 1 minute to see his uncle die.  This could have been a very emotional moment in the film but I felt nothing, since their relationship wasn't explored enough, either. I guess it's excusable since the film was already very long, but Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben is what gives birth to Spiderman as we know him, so it should have been highlighted more.  I should mention, however, that the champion of goof, Mr. Stan Lee, has his Spiderman tag-line appear far too often throughout the film, With great power comes great responsibility.  By the 3rd time I heard this I just groaned.  How melodramatic.Then we come to the 2nd part of the film, the Spiderman portion.  At first everything's great as Peter learns to use his new powers. Unfortunately, it quickly transforms into a goofy-looking cartoon.  I can understand CGI when Spidey is swinging through the streets of NY, but why must we suffer it during street-fight scenes?  Spidey hops and floats around like he's 4 feet tall and fighting on the moon (is he related to Yoda or Gollum?).  No matter how good CGI gets (and it's NOT good, in my opinion, except with junk like spaceships), one thing the effects folks haven't figured out is realistic human dynamic movement and GRAVITY.  Perhaps, however, Raimi wanted Spidey to look like he had jelly-legs with springs inside...but I believe a talented gymnast and some well-choreographed rope-work (see for example the Matrix, but not crud like Charlie's Angels or Romeo Must Die - terrible rope work) would've looked a lot better, say, when Spidey fights off the punks trying to mug Mary Jane in the alley.Last, we come to the Green Goblin, perhaps the corniest villain ever devised (second only to John Travolta's role as Terl in Battlefield Earth?). Everyone raves about Dafoe (and I personally enjoyed him in American Psycho), but he blows it here.  Sad to say I liked Nicholson as the Joker better than Dafoe as the Goblin.  The Goblin's dialogue is CHEESE, even to a five-year old.  Dafoe is much more effective in his Norman Osborn role, when he's talking to himself\/the Goblin.  Also, his suit is ultra-goofy (designed for the military?!?!  How about Cirque de Soleil?) and the fact that the mouth on his mask is fixed made me feel like the Goblin's dialogue was overdubbed (maybe it was).  The overall effect is just plain silly.I'm looking forward to Spidey 2, but alas, it looks like the effects will be no better.  Oh, well, there's always Spidey 3, 4, 5...

Will Ferrell (the less talented of the two) hits with OLD SCHOOL and ELF, while Kattan gets stuck with B-level crap like UNDERCOVER BROTHER and CORKY ROMANO. Keep your agent, Chris, and you'll be the new Dana Carvey in no time.Which is too bad, since Kattan has the stuff. CORKY ROMANO is by no means a good movie, but he gives it his all. I braced myself for another painfully awful comedy (like VAN WILDER), but although it starts horribly (and at first appears to have the oddest title character since CLIFFORD), it, like A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY, does get a little better as it goes along.There are the makings of a decent comedy here; the premise is hardly credible but has promise. Unfortunately, the script is typically lazy, resorting to isolated gags instead of building laughs with smart, character-based humor.Two sequences are particularly embarrassing. The first, in the vet's office, tries to find humor by having Corky knock over everything. When will hack writers realize that acting funny isn't funny? How are we supposed to laugh when it's obvious that Kattan is intentionally knocking everything over?The other idiotic scene is the one with Knee High P.I. Here we find characters defying laws of physics and gravity in a sequence of forced slapstick that starts with Corky unwittingly sniffing panties and ends with characters floating in the air. Don't ask me how.Other quibbles were probably considered by the writers, who just as probably ignored them. No that it matters, but the plot is a total shambles. Some questions When all is said and done, aren't indictments automatic for both Corky (for impersonating a federal agent) and his family (for most everything in their file)? How did the watch connect to the real criminal? Could any schmuck really infiltrate the FBI so easily? In New York?But I guess I'll let all this slide (along with the fact that an out-of-control vehicle wouldn't get ten feet in this city), since the movie, with the exception of one shot, was clearly not filmed in Manhattan. IMDb states it was filmed in California, but the outdoor scenes screamed Toronto or something. Wherever it was made, the movie looks cheap (I cite a moment when a gym bench, ostensibly bolted to the floor, wobbles when nudged). Did all the budget go the the B-cast, since we've all seen movies with lower price tags look more polished?And what about that supporting cast? I like Peter Berg, but comedy is not his strong suit. Doofy fares better, but this Vinessa Shaw chick, if memory serves, gave a better performance as a corpse in EYES WIDE SHUT. I know this is supposed to be a comedy, but, c'mon, isn't she a bit young, naïve, and, well, hot for an FBI agent? And Peter Falk nearly literally slept through his role.Then there's Chris Penn. Dude, you were in RESERVOIR DOGS and TRUE ROMANCE. Why the hell are you wasting your time in an SNL movie by a first-time director? Your closeted character had such potential but was terribly written, and since you, like Berg, aren't naturally funny you better have a damn good script to get laughs. I wish this movie were more thoughtful with the gay thing, but such weight would seem odd next to Kattan in a Girl Scout uniform.Which brings me to the good parts. In movies like this you take what you can get, so I admit Corky's undercover outfits gave me a chuckle or two and his affection for ultra-cheesy '80s pop hits (Take on Me and the undead DIRTY DANCING theme) were somewhat endearing. And I laughed the most (faint praise) after Frank Drebin-esque verbal exchange about J. Edgar Hoover.

Stranger still considering the immense acclaim and debate surrounding the film. Perhaps it's because `Schindler's List' is a film that reaches beyond the limitations of its celluloid to become a cultural and historical institution. Perhaps it's because the film is so perfectly mounted that it is hard to zoom in on a select number of topics. Or perhaps it is simply because I can not fathom the impact `Schindler's List' had on me.I disdain the aura surrounding this film. I disdained watching my parents viewing this film simply because they heard it was `important' to do so. Yes, the film is important and yes, everyone should see it. But no one should view this film based in the mindset that they are doing so only because of its subject matter. It destroys the cinematic experience. It destroys objective thought. And it blinds people from what Spielberg is trying to say with this film. `Schindler's List' has been labelled a Holocaust film. However, I do not see it this way. I see the Holocaust as merely a backdrop for a morality play &#150; which `Schindler's List' is.Spielberg films have often been criticised for their supposed black\/white characters. The good guys and the bad guys. In `Schindler's List' Spielberg has blurred the lines more than he ever has done. Our title hero is a womanising adulterer whose prime goal is to make money &#150; exploiting his workers to do so. He doesn't hire Jews because of sympathy. He hires them because they are cheap and expendable. There is a scene between Schindler and Goeth &#150; it's one of their first meetings. They sit and drink, they casually talk about business and the war like one would talk about sport or the weather. In this scene we see how alike our hero and villain are. We see that Schindler is only a step left to Goeth's path and Goeth a step right to Schindler's. Later on in the film we see two pivotal scenes that keep each on their own path. After flaunting his new found sympathising routine, Goeth looks in the mirror and sees the man he really is. He then shoots the boy he pardoned mere moments before. Similarly, Schindler looks out a window before deciding how his fortune should be spent. Both have `power' as Schindler defines it, both use it in different ways. The film itself is an awe-inspiring goliath of cinematic perfection. It seems Spielberg has studied the master of the epic &#150; David Lean &#150; well. The film is over three hours, yet it is never boring. The film is as absorbing as any you care to mention. Not one frame is wasted. The film is shot in black and white by Janusz Kaminski and is proof, if nothing else that black and white films should still be consistently made. The film is beautiful. No matter how harrowing the subject matter may be, it seems impossible for Spielberg to frame an ugly shot. Backlights, shadows and smoke are all used magnificently to create atmosphere. One of the most controversial aspects of the film has been the use of colour &#150; specifically the red coat used to highlight a girl Schindler watches during the Liquidation of Krakow. This is not Spielberg being pretentious. This is not Spielberg trying to pull the heartstrings. This is Spielberg's spin on the old saying, `One death is a tragedy. One thousand is a statistic'. During the most horrific of genocides, the individual must not be forgotten. The acting is phenomenal. Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley give career bests. Neeson is able to evoke the multiple facets of Schindler with merely a smile, a laugh or a wink. We are never certain what is on Schindler's mind nor his motives or reasons for his actions until their affects have taken place. His performance is similar to Kevin Spacey's in `The Usual Suspects' which both require repeated viewings to fully appreciate. Fiennes is his direct opposite. What you see is what you get. His performance is in-your-face and visceral. Yet, despite his evil, Fiennes is able to evoke a certain likeability about Goeth and when he is executed at the end I actually felt some sympathy for him. Kingsley again shows that he can perfect any ethnicity by playing Schindler's Jewish accountant Stern. He is the voice of reason and solemn dignity in the film. They are all so brilliant it is impossible to pick a best actor from this film. In fact the strongest compliment I can pay to any of them is that no one attempts to steal the show. It is clear that everyone involved in the film are working uniformly to make it as good as possible. John Williams is also on top of his game &#150; the violin and piano solos of the main theme are both hauntingly beautifully and heartbreaking. Many have criticised the film for bowing to Spielberg sentimentality when Schindler breaks down at the end. People say it would have been uncharacteristic for Schindler to do so. I consider this to be tripe. Schindler has completed his arc. He has gone from a shameless money grabber to a man who would give anything to save another life. He has learned the price of human life and so have we. It is neither the price of a car nor the price of a gold badge. It is priceless. At the end of the film we learn there are 6,000 descendants of Schindler Jews. This means that for every life Schindler saved, five more lived.  Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. `Schindler's List' is not a film about the horror of war. It is a film about the beauty of the human spirit. The film is timeless. It is a masterpiece of cinema.

All he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.Quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about.On a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is.Overall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will.My rating 8\/10Rated R for war violence and language.

What else is there to say? \t\t\tWhen presented with the opportunity to watch this film, honestly, I was very excited. This movie stars Marilyn Monroe, whom I absolutely adore! This has by far become one of my favorite movies of all time!\tThe plot of this movie was about two men who are trying to flee from a `mafia' that is after them. They want to escape the state, but are not really having any success. Well, one of the two men has a brilliant idea to audition for an all girls band (the two men are talented musicians). Seeing as how they are men, and would never even be considered for this band, the only way for them to audition is to dress up, and play the role of a woman. Any situation that involves men trying to portray woman is just hysterical, but watching men who are trying to be women, yet thinking the other woman are totally sexy, is even funnier!!! \tThe two men, or dare I say&#133;woman, are accepted into the choir, and are recognized for their musical abilities. Well just as expected, the two men just drool over the beautiful Marilyn Monroe, who plays a gorgeous singer names Sugar. Sugar thinks that these two ladies are just so lovely and kind. However, one of the men seems to like her more than the other, or at least just expresses it more. One of the scenes that was just so funny was where all of the ladies are on the train on their way to Florida. In the middle of the night Sugar sneaks over to one of the men's beds and asks to lie down with him (or her). The man becomes very very excited (and when I say excited I think you know what I mean) yet still trying to disguise himself as a woman. He tells Sugar that he will get some brandy (which sugar is very fond of alcohol) and they will have a little party. He goes on to tell her that maybe the night will bring a few surprises. Eventually all of the woman hear that there is a party in `number 7' and they all pile onto the bed with Sugar and them man, and start drinking. The woman all start tickling him, he gets scared that they will see up his nightgown and realize that he's not really a woman, so he decides to pull the emergency brake on the train, causing all of the other girls to fall onto the floor on top of each other. \tThis movie was just the most perfect comedy. The acting is phenomenal as well as entertaining, and the ending brings quit a surprise to the viewer. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It was just absolutely hysterical, and enjoyable to view.  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Some like it HOT!!!
