Norm MacDonald, in perhaps the role of a lifetime as Mitch (a role, I'm sure, the likes of DeNiro or Pacino would *kill* for) absolutely turns in a performance that should result in no less than an Oscar for Best Actor.  If MacDonald should get bypassed for this award (let's face it, the nomination is already sewed up), it would be the biggest upset since Henry Fonda was bypassed in 1940 for the Best Actor nod for his Tom Joad in the Grapes of Wrath (a role that eerily draws parallels to MacDonald's portrayal of Mitch).The bulletproof plot (I won't spoil it by going into many details, but I will say that the opera scene exhibits the type of class this movie truly exudes), perfectly crafted dialogue, as well as the superior supporting performances of Artie Lange (another Oscar shoe-in), Jack Warden, the great Don Rickles (showing his great acting range in yet another Oscar-worthy performance), Gary Coleman, the late-great Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and even former heavyweight champ Ken Norton chip in with great bit performances, adding to the tapestry that is this wonderful movie.  Bob Saget gets to spread his wings with this project, and once he secures his Best Director Oscar for Dirty Work, one can place him alongside Coppola, Spielberg, and yes, Ingmar Bergman, as a true directorial genius.

If, however, you wish to experience a great film, then I highly recommend *A Simple Plan*. Its disturbing twist on the American dream may be too difficult for some--especially the very dark ending--but that is part of what makes the film such quality fare. Scott B. Smith's screenplay is tight and flawless. Sam Raimi's inspired direction may finally reveal to the rest of the film industry what fans of the Evil Dead trilogy have known for years that, though his tongue is often firmly in his cheek, Raimi is a fine and grossly underrated filmmaker. Especially impressive is the way he and cinematographer Alar Kivilo approach the snow-covered landscapes. There is an immensity to the frozen wastelands of the film's crucial scenes that is almost worthy of David Lean. Also commendable is Raimi's skillful use of animals (among them crows and foxes) for symbolic purposes.But the cast, not to be outdone by their crew, is equally notable. Billy Bob Thornton gives his best performance to date, surpassing even his award-winning role in *Sling Blade*. Bill Paxton is phenomenal as a straight-laced-family-man- turned sociopath, and Bridget Fonda's convincing portrayal of Paxton's determined wife complements him well.Audiences at the screening I saw were commenting on the film's similarities to *Fargo* as they exited the theater, and seemed to belittle *A Simple Plan* for its lack of originality. Granted, *A Simple Plan* is not entirely original. There are indeed vague shadows of *Fargo*, as well as *Macbeth* and Robert Frost, among others. But there is no such thing as an entirely original work, as great art is made by standing on the shoulders of giants. Make no mistake, this is NOT a cheap replay of *Fargo*. The differences are too numerous to note here, but suffice it to say that *A Simple Plan* is a great work in its own right, and deserves to be appreciated as such.

So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being wowed by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  Heck indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not dumbing down your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?
