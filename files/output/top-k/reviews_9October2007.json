The first time I saw it was in the theater when it came out, and I really didn't expect to like it much because at that point I was not a fan of the show and really had only enjoyed the second film. I was about 11 at the time, and saw it with my whole family, and we all loved it. I remember it as one of the more enjoyable films from that time along with Back 2 the Future and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, both of which perhaps not by coincidence are time travel comedies.However when I saw it again a few years later as a 16 or 17 year old fan of Next Generation and The Undiscovered Country the whole ting felt unbearably goofy, to the point where I actually felt embarrassed for the actors. I associated the writer Nick Meyer with the more serious 2nd and 6th films in the series, both of which he also directed, as well as his film Time After Time which is a similar time travel comedy but with a somewhat darker and more ambiguous edge than The Voyage Home. So I wasn't expecting to enjoy it quite as much as I did this time around as an adult in my early 30s. I guess one thing is that my overall attitude about film, and certainly science-fiction, has lightened up over the years &#150; I no longer worry quite so much about the dignity of characters like Scotty and Sulu (but come on guys, if Mr. Sulu can fly a helicopter then can't he figure out how to work the windshield wipers? Lol). But mainly I think they just hit a good note in this film and I would argue that in many ways it's actually closer in spirit to the Trek show &#150; while at the same time providing a suitably cinematic doomsday scenario &#150; than any other film in the series. When I saw it in my teens I was comparing it to the other films in the series and it seemed out of place, but the original show had many humorous episodes including the popular Trouble with Tribbles. And perhaps more importantly, it isn't just a revenge story with a villain; it's got a strong message that applies to our society and culture, just like so many great episodes of the original series. I like the idea that the dangers that we encounter in the future are not all villains &#150; these aliens do not wish us harm, they simply do not realize that the message they are sending to the whales is harming us. If you think about it, these aliens have a similar arrogance as the humans who considered themselves the only worthy race on Earth and killed off so many species after using them for their materials.Star Trek should be about big issues, and it should not feel the need to be subtle in its allegory. That's the power of the series &#150; it actually made political, ethical, and moral questions feel personal and urgent, all in a sci-fi context. I think those who complain about this film's politics &#150; my own teenage self included to some extent &#150; must be selectively remembering only certain aspects of the original show, because it was a very political and a very progressive show. And, as with the original series, this film's message is only growing more and more relevant as time goes on and humanity's impact on the environment becomes less of a fringe issue. Many of our current problems have been solved by the time of the Enterprise, and in the show they often meet our problems by proxy in other planets who are still caught in various stages of development. However here we find that the people of 23rd Century Earth are still plagued by the errors and problems of our time &#150; specifically our wanton destruction of the planet's ecosystem. It's actually kind of chilling to hear Kirk and Spock discuss the extinction of the Humpback Whale in such a casual way. One wonders why it took an apocalyptic cataclysm to make them attempt to fix the problem, and maybe by the end of the story they too have learned something about what Spock calls human arrogance &#150; that we are the only species on Earth important enough for some other life form to want to communicate with.The humor is definitely laid on a bit heavy in the San Francisco sequences. However the jokes are good for the most part and they are anchored in the characters' established personalities. I laughed an enjoyed the colorful metaphors and Kirk's LDS joke which flew over my teenage head. Nick Meyer's writing should be praised, and I doubt it's a coincidence that the film returns to SF like his marvelous Time After Time any more than it's a coincidence that he was involved in all the good ST films and none of the poor ones.A final point on the locations in the film &#150; it looks like the aquarium that's supposed to be in Sausalito in the film is actually the Monterey Bay Aquarium, grafted with mattes onto the SF Bay. I did recognize some actual location shooting in downtown SF near City Lights (and F.F. Coppola's favorite hangout which is right down the street) as well as at the Naval yards in Alameda. I thought maybe they shot on the USS Hornet which is permanently stationed there as a museum but someone here stated it was on a different ship. The scenes in Golden Gate Park do not look like the actual location and are probably backlot shots. Probably part of the reason I loved this movie as a young kid was because I was born here and had to grow up on the East Coast and I always wanted to come back here.

But after seeing Rattle and Hum I was almost literally breathless. It became one of a small handful of VHS music videos that I made the effort to take with me as I moved through life.When I discovered the concept of digital movies, it was the first tape I digitised so I could watch it on my computer, and when video CD came along, I bought that too because the quality was much better than my amateur 'rip'. Naturally when DVD came along I had to have the quality offered by that too. And when I got my first portable video player, well Rattle & h Hum was the first DVD I ripped so I could play it on that (although Pink Floyds pulse had become it's constant companion too).Today, I took delivery of my iPod Touch, and, sad bastard that I am, Rattle and Hum is the first movie I'm watching on it.Why is it I love this film when the music press and the band itself seem to dis this film? I once read an article that suggested the band almost split after the release of the film. Instead they went off and regrouped into their post Achtung baby period. Better they had split and then reformed once whatever itch was out of their system, I think. I still hope they still will.I love this film because it presents the band a their absolute peak. Every inch of concert footage is tight. Bono sounds amazing, much better than I ever saw him. The Edge soars, Larry beats perfect time, while Adam holds everything together. If that isn't enough, the photography is stunning. There is not a single scene in the whole film that would benefit from a different point of view, lighting setup or depth of field (except perhaps the Bono scene 31 minutes in where he tries his hand at graffiti backed by watchtower, personally I'd have made that blurred I think).

In fact, Godzilla is like a Jurassic Park for Dummies book. It is just that dumb and just that absurd. Director Roland Emmerich knows in his heart that the film will suck. So what does he do? He adds spectacular visual effects that astound you from start to finish.The visual effects in this film are so amazing that you finish watching this film just to see the next action scene. That is a bias for me though. Any movie with a gunshot or explosion already has the chance to redeem itself from a bad plot, bad actors and bad dialog. I am sure that by reading that last sentence you already know what elements Godzilla has. You will not care about the plot or characters; you will just want to see the next New York City landmark be destroyed. For example, when the Chrysler Building is blown to pieces by the humans, yes humans and not Godzilla, it is so amazing to watch. Watching buildings explode is probably the highlight of this film, though. Do not pay attention to the useless dialog or plot.There really is not plot to Godzilla. Emmerich's last laughable sci-fi film, Independence Day, was stupid, but at least it had a plot. This film is basically about Godzilla making his way through New York City and destroying landmarks. Why? So he can nest and make little Godzilla babies who will grow up and take over the world. Is this stupid or just plain bad? The writers could have had Godzilla fight Mothra or one of those other mutated creatures. We have Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo, Jean Reno, and Hank Azaria as main characters. Just as a forewarning to my readers, if you begin to focus on the characters and their significance, you will hate this movie.

That is not to say that it does not contain any of the latter, indeed it does have plenty, but they are all suitably used in order to convey the message being put across, not just to show off.This movie is definitely not to be taken on face value because although seriously campy and surreal in it's premise, under all this is a brilliant palette of ideas and questions about human ideals, our future as a species and the very nature of our existence. Combined with a highly interesting overarching science fiction plot of some space explorers landing on a presumably foreign planet ruled by apes, Planet of the Apes serves as entertainment not just for the mind, but for the heart also. As a whole, the story itself is brilliantly paced, allowing for detailed character and plot development that never drags or rushes along too quickly to be analysed.I noticed a lot of critics have slammed the acting and dialogue in the film, but I couldn't disagree more. I adored every character in this film and thought the cast did a terrific job bringing them to life. Sure the dialogue is a little contrived here and there but in the context of the story, it makes absolute sense.

The plot of the film is full of unbelievable contrivances, which stood out like sore thumbs even in 1962 when people were less savvy about everything. The film apparently disappeared for a number of years and legends grew about it, so that people remembered it as being better than it truly was. (I didn't remember it that way since I recalled leaving the theater in 1962 wondering what the fuss was about.) Okay, there are some good performances in the film -- Sinatra and Laurence Harvey are both especially good, despite Harvey's accent being totally inappropriate. Everyone raves about Angela Lansbury's performance but while she was good it was hard to be convinced by her so-called evil because it was based on the unlikely contrivance that this New England rich lady would be in league with the communists and also so powerful she could control them and special order an assassin, who just happens to be her son. (But, oh, she'll get revenge for that!) Janet Leigh is very beautiful but totally wasted; it's too bad she doesn't remove her blouse as Leslie Parrish did. Otherwise, her whole role could be removed and it would have no effect whatsoever on the movie. But back to contrivances -- it's hard enough to believe that the mere sighting of a card would send a man into a trance; we also have to believe that he doesn't even get suspicious when people keep suggesting Hey, how about a little solitaire? He always obliges! He never says, I don't like solitaire. Or, How about canasta or Go Fish? Then his girlfriend, in another contrivance worthy of Hitchcock (the master contriver of absurd situations), shows up dressed as the Queen of Diamonds. No one ever explains exactly why she did this. It's too silly for words. Maybe some of the other commenters are right -- this is supposed to be a black comedy. We can pretend Sinantra is Mel Brooks and Laurence Harvey is Gene Wilder. Now all we need is someone to be Richard Pryor. But as for thrills, I sat on the edge of my seat all right -- so I could get up quickly as soon as this was over! One final comment -- the so-called martial arts fight between Sinatra and Henry Silva (what happened to his character anyhow?) was so embarrassing to both the men and their stunt doubles, I had to fast forward through it! I've seen better fighting on a Get Smart episode (more realistic too). Other than these few carping remarks, I have to agree -- what a classic!

This film has good production designs, excellent Widescreen cinematography by Lloyd Ahern the Second and dynamic music score by Ry Cooder (The End of Violence, Johnny Handsome, Primary Colors). The film has a loyal cult following, especially those who followed Hill's work. This is a remake of a Japanese picture Yojimbo, which it was written by Akira Kurosawa (The Hidden Fortress, Ran, The Seven Samurai) and Ryuzo Kikushima (Runaway Train, Tora! Tora! Tora!). Which Kurosawa directed the original as well. Hill wrote the screenplay of this underrated movie. Plenty of familiar faces appears in small parts.

Which this Texas town is in a war between two gangsters in the control of bootlegging. Smith decides to be a hired gun-men for Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) after Smith kills one of Doyle's men Finn (Patrick Kilpatrick). Which it was misunderstanding and something personal behind Smith & Finn. Which Smith decides to join Strozzi for money and also killing more men from Doyle. Smith starts to make a mistake, when he finally meets Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) and he offers Smith more money to be on his side. Which Smith doesn't care which side he works for, beside who has the better deal. But Smith starts to care for a half native girl Felina (Karina Lombard), which she wants to be freed from Doyle. When he decides to help her to be freed, Doyle's men nearly beats Smith to death. Now Smith makes a personal vendetta against Doyle and his men.Directed by Walter Hill (48 Hrs, Trespass, The Warriors) made an entertaining action\/drama with action and an sense of humour. Director Hill handle the gun play extremely well with style and flair. Willis plays his character well and he gives an good performance. Oscar-WinnerChristopher Walken plays a hired gun-men for Doyle and he delivers some classic dialogue in this movie. Bruce Dern has an good supporting role as The Sheriff that looks the other way and William Sanderson is also fine the loyal bartender\/friend to Smith.

Much was cut out and added to the American version - including Raymond Burr. http\/\/pro.imdb.com\/title\/tt0197521\/usercommentsThe Americanization of the original film reduced the story to a standard Kaiju (fictional monster) film, and in some ways, was more profoundly influential on later Toho projects and other giant monster movies. But Gojira is much more than a big green lizard with radioactive halitosis and much more than a film about a big green lizard with radioactive halitosis stomping all over Tokyo. The film is dark, serious, frightening, and mythic. Something is burning ships off the coast of southeast Asia. A group of Ainu-like natives of a nearby island have myths which speak of a giant monster named Gojira, and though the creature which will eventually emerge from the sea is something entirely new and much more disturbing, the name sticks. When the creature first ventures onto the land, destroying a few of the villagers' huts, a paleontologist is brought to the scene to study the phenomenon. He discovers an enormous highly radioactive footprint - eventually leading him to believe that nuclear tests have caused a holdover from prehistoric times to become a major problem in the modern day. Of course, by the time all of this is figured out, Gojira is on his way to Tokyo, and a scientist who might have the ability to solve the problem permanently is too terrified to do what needs to be done - perhaps because he remembers Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many have discussed the metaphoric and symbolic aspects of this film, and certainly there is good reason to consider these elements. However, I am more concerned with the fact that, unlike so many of its descendants, Gojira demands interpretation and thought. The film's artistic integrity is just one of many reasons it remains solidly entertaining today. Suffice to say that the film is more of a social statement about the psychological state of Japan around 1954 than it is a political piece. The director and writer should be credited with providing an excellent build-up for the action scenes which, unusually, do not take place until more than half-way through the film. The characters are all believable, consistent, and nicely developed. And the acting is professionally accomplished. I was especially impressed with Momoko Kôchi. Also legendary for its special effects, the imagery of Gojira is so well done that it is still viable today - without CGI, a lot blue or green-screen work etc. Slow motion, great camera angles and miniatures - Toho trademarks - comprise the bulk of the special effects.

This is because they have completely missed the point. Indiana is a great character because he's constantly in over his head; he really has no idea what he's doing and is making it up as he goes along. He's funny and likable; he's the everyman who does what he can against forces and enemies much larger than himself. And it's not just him; all the great action films--Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Terminator, Spider-Man, etc.--are about people who aren't quite up to the challenge handed to them. George Lucas once said that a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing. Well, an action sequence without an interesting character achieves the same effect.The main problem with this movie is that Lara Croft isn't terribly interesting. She's too sure of herself. She's not at all vulnerable. She's almost superhuman in strength, ability, and intelligence. It's like watching a robot. There's no reason to invest emotionally in her character. There's no sense of danger, and consequently no thrill as she jumps, slides, dodges, and dispatches effortlessly an army of assassins. Characters need to have a weakness, be it physical or emotional. The film's halfhearted answer to this is a vague backstory involving the death of her father, but nothing ever really comes of this. The only suspense the viewer feels is in wondering how long it's going to be until she takes off her clothes again. (A note for all fledgling filmmakers out there if your entire film is built around a slow-motion shower sequence, you're in trouble.) I don't blame Angelina Jolie for this bland character, but I do blame her for choosing to work on this crappy assignment. She has proved she's quite capable as an actress; why she continues to portray one-dimensional characters in mediocre films is beyond me. What a waste of talent.Predictably, no other characters give us any reason to care about them, except the guy who makes the little robots, who I think might have actually been a better protagonist. It's all about who's prettiest, really. The action sequences try way too hard to be hip. The most ridiculous example of this is a simple dog sled chase, shot with shaky cameras, throbbing techno music, and lightning-fast cutting. Is it really necessary to get our adrenaline worked up over this? They're not even racing anybody, they're just going from point A to point B. I guess Simon West felt the need to illustrate the point that Lara doesn't do anything unless she does it IN STYLE. If the movie had shown her going to the supermarket to buy a loaf of bread, she probably would have crashed through the skylight, blown up the dairy counter to propel her cart down the aisle, snatched the bread, and back-flipped over the cashier in a rain of coins. If you took that sequence in Monty Python and the Holy Grail wherein Lancelet frantically crashes a wedding, slaughtering many innocent guests and toppling over wedding decorations for absolutely no reason, stretched it out to ninety minutes, put in a hot chick with a huge rack, and expected the audience to take it all seriously, you would have Tomb Raider.

But if you can get past those very few short-comings, then The Monster Squad is one of the best experiences you'll never forget from your childhood.10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"9 October 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The original Child's Play came out in 1988. Right at the end of 80's horror. People actually thought the film was scary. What worse a thought than your child's toy coming to life and attempting to possess his body while knocking off people all the way!? Add to this that ever single child in America had one of those My Buddy dolls at the time and there ya go. The Look as well as the wardrobe worn by Chucky was eerily familiar with the My Buddy Doll so much in fact that the dolls started scaring children and children being scared may have led to the demise and decline in sales of My Buddy. But that's just my opinion.So basically we get the story of Charles LeRay (Brad Douriff) - The Boston Strangler. During a night of chases and shootouts with the cops, Charles takes a bullet and is about done for. While finding his way into a toy store, the voodoo educated serial killer puts his voodoo to use and puts his soul in the Good Guy doll which just so happens to be the current Toy craze in this film. We then go to young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) who wants one so bad for his birthday. His mother is having a difficult time finding one but manages to pull it off from a creepy old street vendor who rescued the doll from the toy store fire. Which dolls survived? The possessed one of course. So we get Andy trying to convince people that Chucky is alive all the while Chucky is killing. The movie is great for it's time. While I don't see much scary about it, it is definitely fun. The FX are top notch for a 1988 flick. Best scene bar none is the elevator scene for the sheer comedy of it.

The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.

I can't believe this film is so unknown. I am not even sure if it is a cult classic, but it should be.The story is original. David Duchovny is a struggling writer who plans to take a road trip to California, and along the way he has mapped out a number of stops where serial killers have committed murders. Michelle Forbes plays his yuppie girlfriend who also is a photographer.To cut costs, they agree to have another couple come with them. This couple turns out to be Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who are about as redneck-hillbilly as you can get.Pitt and Lewis steal the screen. Their acting in this movie is absolutely superb. This could be Pitt's best performance.Pitt's character, in fact, turns out to be a ruthless killer, who is ignorant, yet manipulative in his own animalistic way. Lewis is his antithesis, a really good person who is also extremely stupid and reliant on others.I don't want to give too much away about this film. At times it can be absolutely hilarious (Lewis and Pitt are really funny), amazingly sad, thought provoking, and it even has its sexy scenes. If you like dark comedies, you won't want to miss this. Yet, it is not really characterized as a dark comedy. A truly fascinating character study with a gripping story. Rating 10 of 10 stars.

This shows how ironical it is when a black woman goes to work in a white oriented home for so long. She loses her sense of fighting for her race's rights. (Pardon me, if this may offend anyone). John is quite annoyed by this as we see. I think this what the picture is about, not the cruelty of white men and how racist America is or etc. It's simply a simple love story about uniting the people together, throwing skin-tone accusations into the bin.
