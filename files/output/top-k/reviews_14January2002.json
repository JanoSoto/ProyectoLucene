Go figure.SPOILERS HEREPersonally, I was both dazzled and disappointed. Dazzled because Gandalf, the hobbits, the birthday party, and Gimli all looked exactly as I'd pictured. Rivendell, Hobbiton, and Mordor all one-upped my own imagination and I prefer the director's vision to my own. The script was nearly true to the story (that I've read more than 20 times) and most of the abbreviations were acceptable. The movie, as a stand-alone piece is infinitely more beautiful than the latest offering from star wars.My disappointments were few, but one in particular was disconcerting. I found myself jarred from total immersion in the piece by some poorly-executed cuts. I found this to be true as the hobbits head for Weathertop with Aragorn, and again when the fellowship heads for the mountain.The other irritation is the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, a great source of amusement in the books, is not given enough of a pass. In fact, Legolas' role in this movie (I'm sure it will be expanded in the next two, but still) is merely to show off some rather keen special effects (he walks on snow, slings arrows like one of those ball delivery systems for learning tennis) and look absolutely stunningly elfishly beautiful. Unfortunate. The visit to Loth Lorien by the party reveals that the destruction of the ring will not only end the evil in Middle Earth, it will also remove from it the most valued of treasures. This is part of what makes Tolkien's stories so real; it is not all good and evil; the characters have their faults AND their virtues, consequences are not just, do this, and we'll all live happily ever after, more, a choice between greater goods and lesser evils, with every good thing having that twinge of sadness to it that so mirrors our daily lives. Without this piece, Tolkien's work would have been just another fantasy book on the shelves, and the director's omission, though understandable, was, I believe, a poor choice.My last beef has to do with Loth Lorien itself. Though beautiful, it felt, to me, and this is COMPLETELY subjective, to be more structured than it should be. Loth Lorien in my mind was the  most organic of places, like what you might see if you looked at moss under a microscope. It's a petty beef, though.END OF SPOILER I think it definitely deserves best picture, as it has certainly advanced both the art and science of movie making to new heights. Also think Ian McKellen deserves a nod for his portrayal of Gandalf, and absolutely Peter Jackson deserves accolades and a statue for what he's created.And when it comes out on DVD, I'll be sure to buy two, as I'm guaranteed to wear out the first one in nothing short of a month.

How do you realize a million people's daydreams? Think about this, too the movie cost about a million dollars. Titanic cost nearly twice that. Go figure.SPOILERS HEREPersonally, I was both dazzled and disappointed. Dazzled because Gandalf, the hobbits, the birthday party, and Gimli all looked exactly as I'd pictured. Rivendell, Hobbiton, and Mordor all one-upped my own imagination and I prefer the director's vision to my own. The script was nearly true to the story (that I've read more than 20 times) and most of the abbreviations were acceptable. The movie, as a stand-alone piece is infinitely more beautiful than the latest offering from star wars.My disappointments were few, but one in particular was disconcerting. I found myself jarred from total immersion in the piece by some poorly-executed cuts. I found this to be true as the hobbits head for Weathertop with Aragorn, and again when the fellowship heads for the mountain.The other irritation is the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, a great source of amusement in the books, is not given enough of a pass. In fact, Legolas' role in this movie (I'm sure it will be expanded in the next two, but still) is merely to show off some rather keen special effects (he walks on snow, slings arrows like one of those ball delivery systems for learning tennis) and look absolutely stunningly elfishly beautiful. Unfortunate. The visit to Loth Lorien by the party reveals that the destruction of the ring will not only end the evil in Middle Earth, it will also remove from it the most valued of treasures. This is part of what makes Tolkien's stories so real; it is not all good and evil; the characters have their faults AND their virtues, consequences are not just, do this, and we'll all live happily ever after, more, a choice between greater goods and lesser evils, with every good thing having that twinge of sadness to it that so mirrors our daily lives. Without this piece, Tolkien's work would have been just another fantasy book on the shelves, and the director's omission, though understandable, was, I believe, a poor choice.My last beef has to do with Loth Lorien itself. Though beautiful, it felt, to me, and this is COMPLETELY subjective, to be more structured than it should be. Loth Lorien in my mind was the  most organic of places, like what you might see if you looked at moss under a microscope. It's a petty beef, though.END OF SPOILER I think it definitely deserves best picture, as it has certainly advanced both the art and science of movie making to new heights. Also think Ian McKellen deserves a nod for his portrayal of Gandalf, and absolutely Peter Jackson deserves accolades and a statue for what he's created.And when it comes out on DVD, I'll be sure to buy two, as I'm guaranteed to wear out the first one in nothing short of a month.

How can such a movie justify the universe that one J.R.R Tolkien used his entire adult life to develop. These questions have been pondered my many directors during the years, but it was to be Peter Jackson that took it upon him the task of venturing into this enormous project.An assignment like the one Jackson have embarked on, must have been one with many challenges. Who would act the roles of the members of the brotherhood? Established stars or up-and-coming method actors? Which sequences from the book should be a part of the film, and which could be let out? Should one focus on the conflicts of one or two characters, in order to follow an ordinary dramaturgical recipe, or should one embark on the immensely difficult task of trying to embrace the book's enormous amount of main characters?These are questions that Peter Jackson, along with millions of Tolkien fans, have asked themselves. And it is a great pleasure to see that Jackson has solved these and all the other problems in a superb manner. Jackson has succeeded in both transferring the magic and mystery of the book and at the same time interpreting the story into a unique and truly enthralling work of his own.The movie's finest quality is its dramaturgical pace. Like a perfect poem, the story shifts between smooth tempo and beautiful sequences, quick, high-action and unbearingly exciting thriller scenes. This gives an unbearing feeling of unpredictability which for the entire movie keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just when you think you are given time to breathe, something happens that makes you almost choke. This dramaturgical curve is epic and effective, and it brings to the story an excellent focal balance between the overall journey and the individual sequences. Because of this the three hours never feels long and tiresome.The next superb quality that has to be mentioned, is the casting. Sir Ian McKellen is fenomenal in the role of Gandalf, bringing to the caracter the difficult combination of power and empathy, force and generosity, a combination that is showed so masterfully in the book. Also Sean Bean as the ambivalent Boromir is done masterfully. One can almost feel the pain and suffering of his weak human mind, as he tries to understand the power of the ring. The ringbearer Frodo is also perfectly performed by Elijah Wood. The graceful movements, the frightened looks, the shivering voice and the almost androgyne appearance of Wood is perfect for showing Frodo's unimageaneable ambiguity towards being made the bearer of the ring.And this brings me to another excellent quality of Jackson's filmatization the presentation of the ring. One of the unique thing about The Lord of the Rings as a story about good vs. evil, is that evil is not represented by a living thing. The Dark Lord Sauron is of course the enemy, but seeing that he is not a material part of the story per se, the protagonist is actually the ring. And what is beautifully done by Jackson in this respect, is that he has given the ring the lifelike and dynamic features that actually makes the viewer fear it. We can sense the brotherhood's fear and attraction towards the ring, we can feel the temptation of its golden, smooth appearance. And this makes the overall story even more excrutiating.Add to these qualities marvellous landscapes, beautiful pronounciation of Elf language by Arwen\/Liv Tyler, a powerful Sarumann, disgustingly gracious orcs, mounting nazguls, a gorgeous Cate Blanchett as Galadriel and breathtaking fight scenes, and one will understand that many claim that Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings The Brotherhood of the Ring is the greatest film ever made. I will not make this claim, for it is an impossible claim to make. I will however declare that the film has created a genre in filmmaking, a standard which fantasy-, science fiction-, and adventure films in the future will strive for. This kind of thrill is what every director will dream of being able to replicate. This is the movie to rule them all.Oh, and by the way, the CG graphics and special effects are just as good as they ought to be with this kind of production budget...

The TV show got very preachy during its run, and often seemed to forget it was supposed to be a comedy. The movie's comedy had an anti-authoritarian bent to it, which kept it from degenerating into complete farce or cheap laughs (which the TV series did--e.g. Klinger).But MASH isn't just better than its TV follow-up--it's a great movie in its own right. Thirty years later, it's still funny as hell. And the surgical sequences are still shocking--especially that sound as Hawkeye saws a through a bone, or the sight of that spraying artery. The overlapping dialogue, muted lighting, and the episodic plot (or lack thereof) still strike me as daring; few movies these days are willing to take those sorts of chances. This is one of the best comedies, and one of the best war movies, ever made. It was a pleasure watching again recently on DVD, which enriched the experience considerably--I highly recommend it.

It's a story he wants to tell and he's been criticized since the release of the first movie.  Back then, many critics attacked the original Star Wars as being cornball, cliched and, again, crass and commercial.

The first time I saw it, I was blown away by how Lucas had managed to create settings that looked like nothing I've seen before -- the waterfalls of Theed, Coruscant, the underwater city, and the details of Mos Eisley.  (A number of people have insisted they've seen all of these things before.  WHERE??!!)  By comparison, Return of the Jedi (which I consider to be the weakest of the four movies) had very little in it which inspired a sense of awe.  Phantom had more effects shots than any movie to date, and required innovative computer imaging techniques, which were unjustly ignored at the oscars.  Also ignored at the oscars was the brilliant costume design.As for the plot, yes, it was convoluted, but not hopelessly so.  The main problem was that it revolved around Anakin, and therefore needed a strong actor to pull us in and make us care about what was happening.  Jake Lloyd didn't pull it off.  And yes, Jar Jar Binks was very annoying.  (Less annoying than Ewoks, though -- I can't STAND Ewoks!) And Gungans, as a whole, were fine.  There were also some lame aliens, such as the Pod Race announcer and the Humpty-Dumpty-like creature who's pod exploded.  What was up with that? On the other hand, Darth Maul should have been given MORE screen time.Overall, I think George Lucas should have chosen to make Anakin slightly older and given the film a more mature tone, as well as being a little more concerned with the dramatic undercurrents.

And yes, Jar Jar Binks was very annoying.  (Less annoying than Ewoks, though -- I can't STAND Ewoks!) And Gungans, as a whole, were fine.  There were also some lame aliens, such as the Pod Race announcer and the Humpty-Dumpty-like creature who's pod exploded.  What was up with that? On the other hand, Darth Maul should have been given MORE screen time.Overall, I think George Lucas should have chosen to make Anakin slightly older and given the film a more mature tone, as well as being a little more concerned with the dramatic undercurrents.  That's why I'm really looking forward to Episode II, despite the inclusion of Jar Jar Binks and *shudder* nSync!

The best part about it is it took some of America's top comic actors when they were at the prime of their careers and built a comedy that's more than just the sum of its parts. I mean, just having Bill Murray or Rodney Dangerfield in a movie, even a mediocre one, guarantees you will laugh, but this film features these two, along with Chevy Chase and Ted Knight, in what is arguably each man's funniest effort. As with most comedies, the plot is pretty much incidental to the film itself. In this case, it's centered on a young caddy who can't afford to go to college, so he is forced to suck up to the head of the country club (Ted Knight) in an effort to get his blessing for a caddy scholarship. His golf mentor is a rich heir (Chevy Chase, back when he was still funny) who's into Zen golf and gives Danny advice like Be the ball and A donut with no hole is a Danish. To complicate matters, a real estate developer (Rodney Dangerfield) shows up with his entourage, looking, not to join the club but instead to buy it. This is the setup for the rest of the film. From the start, the expansive, profane, boorish Dangerfield character clashes with the anal, rigid, and tantrum-prone club president, Judge Smails. And, in the background, Bill Murray is the groundskeeper who's been ordered to kill all the gophers on the course. Of course, this order comes from his Scottish boss, a man with an accent as thick as Guinness Stout, and Murray's character Carl, replies But if I kill all the golfers, they'll lock me up and throw away the key!Anyway, that's the basic premise. What makes this movie work are the lead actors, as well as first rate scriptwriting. You normally wouldn't think of a golf course as being the scene for great comedy, but with this bunch, anything goes. There's tons of great dialog; Judge Smails Danny, I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn't want to, but I felt I owed it to them, Dangerfield to a woman at the club Last time I saw a mouth like that it had a hook in it!, Carl to gopher Don't mind me, I'm just a harmless squirrel, not a plastic explosive or something, and on and on. There's great physical comedy, especially when Rodney goes berzerk with his massive yacht, crashing into anything and everything in sight, and Ted Knight, whose eyes seem to bulge of of their sockets at least once a minute. In short, it's a comic classic that was hilarious 20 years ago, and is still funny every time I watch it now. A must see!  10 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2002","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie will never get old, like Airplane!, it's a comedy classic.
