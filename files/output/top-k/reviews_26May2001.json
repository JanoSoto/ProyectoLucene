Having seen literally hundreds of recreations of the Pearl Harbor attack over the past decades, what could they do that would dazzle or even inform the audience? Not much, I'm afraid. So the good effects don't really mean much. They are kind of wasted, because they are so humdrum. Although the flying bullets were scary.Second, the history is rudimentary.

For example, the movie depicts Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, the inspiration and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, commenting on the bombing success. In the movie, he (as played by way-cool actor Mako) is merely a head-shot, evidently in the open air. He says, Perhaps we have merely awakened a sleeping giant. Ok, that's historically recorded. What isn't depicted in the movie is context within which he is said to have made that remark.

Echoing another viewer's comments, this character is redundant &#150; he's just there for the minorities in the audience.The story really should've ended at Pearl.  But wait, there's more!  The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.  The only good thing about this part was that it killed off one of the leads.  I don't know how many people were laughing when Alec Baldwin was giving his pep talk to the pilots in the ready room &#150; but it was more than one, myself included.  Baldwin cannot play a gruff, tough military man &#150; he's just too sensitive and urbane, and his performance came off as too campy and laughable. As far as the acting goes, most of the veteran actors are good, and I'm talking about Voight and the like.  The leads are another story.  The two pilots Rafe and Danny are just good old boy southerners who are patriotic and loving the same woman &#150; but that's ABOUT IT.  We barely get to know these characters.  FDR had more character development than these hayseeds. Kate Beckinsale (FOX!) was passable, but she suffers the same fate as every other actor in the movie  She just doesn't have the LINES.  I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but there were SO MANY scenes with the nurses &#150; it almost came off like a chick flick.  I wouldn't have minded it so much, but the writer didn't develop these women, nor give them any flaws, dreams, fears, ANYTHING  It was all, `Tee-hee, tee-hee, did you see that cute pilot staring at me?'.  Jesus! I was almost CHOKING from all the close-ups in `Pearl'.  Now, where is the pony in all this s***?  His name is SFX.  The aerial sequences and the attack on the Seventh Fleet are quite amazing &#150; thanks to the folks at ILM. Unfortunately, we had to sit through two hours of forgettable cinema to get to them. And I thought `Enemy at the Gates' was a mediocre film!

No, it is not a great movie in any sense of the word.  It is an entertaining movie, and I heavily enjoyed it.First off the bat, I'll discuss some of the bad stuff.  I didn't like how the movie started.  There are no opening credits, just a short cut of the title.  The opening, in my picky opinion, was too short.  I think that they could have slowed it down and made it a bit more dramatic.  Oh well, this will do.Problem number 2 While some parts of the movie move too quickly, other parts move too slowly.  Many of the romantic scenes are nice, but they draw on for too long.Next Problem There isn't much here that you haven't seen before in terms of character in story.  I could have (and did) predict the entire movie before hand.  The story is that cliché.Okay, another problem This movie didn't take enough opportunities.  There are so many stories involving Pearl Harbor, that I was disappointed that the never told any of them.  Well, they did tell of Doris 'Dorie' Miller, the first black man to receive the silver cross.  But there are so many other stories.  The USS Nevada tried to make a run for it out of the harbor and got shot to death.  I think that would have been great.  Another historic disappointment to me was the USS Arizona.  Correct me if I'm wrong (please), but I read in a book that a torpedo hit the ballast tanks (or what-have-you) underneath the Arizona, causing a massive explosion that shot the ship into a 90 degree angle with the water.  It sat there, pointing into the sky for ten or twelve minutes then crashed back down into the water.  The Virginia or the Utah, I cannot remember which one, was connected to the Arizona, making repairs to it when the Japs rolled in.  When the Arizona shot up like spring, the repair ship was thrown like a toy boat into the shore, where it landed face down in the mud.  There are so many chances this movie could have taken, but sadly, this isn't Spielberg quality.  Oh, and please, I don't want anyone crying about the historical accuracy.  I know some things are fictional in this movie, but Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator are filled with made up crap, so stop your bellyaching.Final problem the movie is too long for its own good.  After the tragic happenings of Pearl Harbor, the movie goes to the Dolittle bombing of Japan. I think it would have been better just to end the movie at Pearl Harbor.Okay, the good stuff.  This movie has the best special effects of the year (at least so far).  Some special effects range from spectacular\/photo-realistic to something I could have made in PhotoShop.  But, when they're good, hot damn, they're good.Another good point is the movie is very entertaining.  I can't really explain how, it just is.Well then, next point this movie will get your patriotic blood pumping like never before.  Well, at least since you saw SPR.  Lots of people said Gibson's The Patriot made them feel proud to be an American.  Well, I never liked that movie, and let me tell you, when our boys start fighting back against the enemy, I have never felt so proud.In conclusion, Pearl Harbor is not a great movie.  But it is a good movie. If anyone hates this movie, they cannot call themselves Americans.  As a film critic of sorts, I admit the movie has a lot of problems.  Hell, that's an understatement.  This is a mess of a movie, and yes, it could have been much better.  But see this movie for what it is a fun popcorn flick.  I still can't believe people expected this movie to be Spielberg material.

Steven Spielberg has bought the rights to the great, GREAT book, Flags of our Fathers, which is the true story of the six guys raising the flag on Iwa Jima.

I made my brothers and sisters sick of always talking about it, and before we had a VCR, I recorded it on audiotapes and listened to it endlessly till I memorized the dialogue.  I recited Terry-Thomas' rant about Americans for a speech class. Almost forty years later now, it is holding up in a stellar manner.How could it be remade as the final joke is crucial to chivalry keeping the women off the fire escapes at the end.  They must enter the hospital room for that last final joke to take place.  It would not have worked had they been in body casts as well. Another note, for Dick Shawn to have laughed at the end would have been out of character, but notice his face is wrapped up like a mummy.Ethel Merman literally tears into everyone at one time or another, but her antics are provoked from the likes of Thomas, Rooney and Hackett, even Silvers in the hole.  She obviously got this part for being passed over in favor of Ros Russell for 'Gypsy'.  This was her only non-singing part too. All persons are from different walks of life; Winters is blue collar, Ceasar is educated, Berle is business, Rooney and Hackett are entertainers. Kramer obviously strived to do more about the relegation of women to wives or mothers-in-law by giving Dorothy Provine a very special moment with Spencer Tracy (won't spoil it).  Both Provine and Adams seem to be included simply to keep Ceasar and Merman from being alone. Rooney\/Hackett and Berle\/Thomas were perfect matches. the gas station scene I cannot comment on any further, the men in the airport tower are hilarious on their own as well, Don KNotts scene always made us laugh (Deputy Fife with Sgt. Bilko),the black couple who are run off the road at the beginning was always one of our biggest laughs as children and still is.  Kramer also seemed to want to do more about blacks with the addition of Eddie Anderson (who just as easily could have been omitted) and to keep the mood light with his plummet off the ladder at the end.

Also not showing the USS Nevada getting under steam and heading for the harbor entrance in it's famous dash for the sea was criminal. That act alone was also a rallying point for the men that saw it. Adm. Kimmel is portrayed too kindly also. While it is true he was not completely at fault, he also was lured into complacency in the real attack. There are more but I will not get into these.

In fact all we saw is a lot of dead dogs being dragged around and snarling animals being held apart - it was relatively easy to envision how it was done. You muzzle the dogs, let them at each other and make lots of quick cuts. Et voila.It did look cool though.The first story involved the dogs and one of their owners. Reasonably interesting. Things started to slow down dramatically in the second and third stories. The third story in itself was not too bad but at that stage the second story had sapped my interest. Question who is going to let their dog be trapped under their floorboards for days with no food and surrounded by rats? In similar circumstances I'm sure the pitbull\/rottweiler owners would have long since torn up the floorboards and these are guys who fight their dogs to the death.In terms of both style and the quality of its acting, this movie is excellent. All in all however, its pretty forgetable stuff and some of the other comments explain why in a more eloquent fashion than I can.

It is so unlike any other film I have ever seen, and it really affects you.  It is the story of a cowboy named Joe Buck who dreams of becoming a big-time hustler in New York City.  But because of his innocence, he gets taken advantage of, and can never find the success he dreamt about.  Instead, he resorts to becoming a male prostitute just so he and his friend, Ratso, can survive.  Midnight Cowboy features two magnificent performances by its leads, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who were both nominated for Oscars.  I just can't say enough about Midnight Cowboy.  It's a movie that everyone needs to see at least once.  If you haven't seen it, you're missing one of the greatest movies ever made.  See this movie!!!!!

Wayne, IN., in his May 25th commentary.  Jason, we were NOT at war with the Japanese when they attacked Pearl Harbor.  We were, up until the day before the attack, involved in negotiations with them to form a peace alliance in case we had to go to war against Germany.  Therefore, we had NOT declared war on them and they had NOT declared war on us.  That being the case, I would argue that strafing the unarmed men floating in the water was a cowardly act, and not excusable as a reality of war.**     This movie was terrible.  Don't get me wrong, the CGI people should get well-deserved pats-on-the-back, but man were their efforts wasted.  I've seen too many comparisons between this movie and the film, Titanic.  I suppose I can see why one might want to try to do that, prior to seeing this dreck, but not after.  There is no comparison...other than, perhaps, the date of their respective opening weekends.  The love story that, I suppose, is to draw us into the movie is so transparent, it's laughable.  The filmakers forgot the most important rule in using a love story to draw the audience into the disaster\/tragedy\/war\/etc.  That rule states that the characters you have spent the last 100 minutes getting to know (although they didn't even get that part right) MUST BE PRESENT AT THE DISASTER\/TRAGEDY\/WAR\/ETC.!!!!!!!!!  Jack and Rose were ON THE SHIP.  William Wallace was AT THE BATTLE OF STERLING.  Tom Hanks's character was PART OF THE NORMANDY LANDING FORCE.  Harrison Ford was ON AIR FORCE ONE.  I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the point.  Too bad Bruckheimer and Bay did not.  That being said, I repeat that the special effects were impressive, but the attack itself was totally uncoordinated and choppy.  I recommend skipping this farce and renting Tora!  Tora!  Tora! instead.p.s.  My stomach still hurts from all the laughing I did when I heard that they were going to release changed versions of this movie for its release in Japan and Germany.  Please.
