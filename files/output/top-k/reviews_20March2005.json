Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.I think the power of Ghostbusters are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe. I have the feeling that the movie's ending could have been done way more spectacular.

He really is a great actor, sure you can question some of his decisions and roles, but he can really pull off an emotional scene at both ends of the spectrum, and he has to show them all.The film certainly shows how harrowing the first assault of the Vietnam war really was, and how utterly pointless it was. It was amazing to see the courage and strength of the young men involved, and then being shown the flip side with the cowardice and idiocy of the suits in charge and their disregard for the lives of the soldiers.Although the movie concentrates on the US Soldiers it does turn to the Vietnamese Commander and show the similarities between them and their belief and love for their soldiers.Something that strikes me about many of the US historical movies is their blatant disregard for history, and their total belief in the American way above all else. The US won World War II by themselves, they managed to break the hold of the German Submarines by finding and cracking their code machine and they leapt into action and poured destruction on the Japanese after Pearl Harbour.None of this is seen in this movie, yes there is a strong American belief, but in this movie it's much more real. The belief is there, but it's from the soldiers who really believe in their Country and what they are fighting for, a feeling that was present in the real world before this war, and has struggled through since.It is a great war movie, it's also a very moving and harrowing one, showing what the Soldiers went through for their country and how their officials, and indeed their people, failed them.However it's not all good. The movie seems to have many swift cuts which are suited to the battle scenes, but not in transitions, and it begins to have the feel that there are portions of the movie edited out. This is certainly backed in the continuity of the story and how some crucial background and key scenes just seem to be raced through giving you the barest of information before heading off to another battle.That really harms the movie for me, and it's a shame because there is so much of this movie which is really, really good.

After that the movie starts slowly and keeps going faster till the end. Thats another reason why it is good. From the beginning till the end you just are watching as if you were there, this is meanly done by the music which fits perfectly by the pictures you see. Great work from Hans Zimmer just like the latest movie King Arthur.

Had some really great one liners from Joe Dirt, some of the stuff he does is just so trailer trash! I gave it a 7 out of 10 on first viewing - great but not a classic.After watching this a second and third time, I really think this comedy classic with James Spade is a shockingly neglected and under rated comedy. Not only is this film hilarious at times, but the way the story is told via the DJ who is always making fun of him, is simply great. You just feel even more sorry for him when you watch it again. And Christopher Walken is so great! He really should be in more comedy - the parts when he is talking to himself in the mirror, acting out his old mafia days, are true classic movie moments! And So what if the acting isn't Oscar material? This film wasn't expecting to win any Oscars for acting! And so what if the humor is toilet humour sometimes - sometimes this kind of humour can be the funniest - take a look at English comedy classics like monthly python, fawlty towers and the like - these all use a lot of childish or toilet humour, but they are still classics! Stop bashing this film - sit down with no expectations and watch it (again). If you don't laugh more than 10 times in this film, I'm sorry but you need to get out more. Some people just hate films so much that they refuse to laugh even when they know its funny, just so they can say they didn't laugh once - i think this is the case with many people and this film, especially some of the other people that have commented badly on this film!

It's really not that bad, and definitely sports some pretty good scares.The plot is this\/Some sort of warlock named Conal Cochran wants to play a pretty rotten trick on every child in the universe, or at least those who celebrate Halloween and have a television. That is until he is sort of discovered by Harry Grimbridge, whom we meet in the film's opening. Harry is eventually killed in a Northern California hospital by one of Cochran's emotionless, obsessive-compulsive robots. Harry's daughter Ellie shows up, and teams together with a concerned and curious doctor, Dan Challis. The two of them travel to Santa Mira, the home of Silver Shamrock Novelties, where these mysterious masks are being mass-produced, and it just so happens that the late Harry Grimbridge was holding one of these masks when he died, spouting, They're gonna kill us all. Well, this is getting kind of long. Basically it turns X-files-ish as Dan and Ellie try to foil Conal Cochran's plan before nine-o'clock on Halloween night. Do they? I'm not telling....Mwahahaha! Just kidding.Anyways, there are several scary scenes in this film. One includes, among others, a woman who is poking at the Silver Shamrock thimble. Wow, my heart fell to my feet. What the hell was that?! And then the gore is there, thankfully, because without it this film would be nothing. So it works, if you can ignore the fact that it's called Halloween III!!! So where's Mikey? Big mistake, I think, but on its own it's really not that bad.5\/10 is my vote.

If I hadn't known this was such a recent release I'd have thought it came out in the mid 80's. The atmosphere and photography, as well, as the highly charged performances were what I enjoyed most.Unfortunately, the movie is really difficult to watch. There are a handful of movies that, while very obviously maybe well made are just almost to intense. That's the way I felt about Panic. It isn't gory but is very emotionally upsetting though the characters, all of them, hold an element of fascination as well.SPOILERS THROUGHOUT There is an element of gloom throughout the movie that does not let up. Of coarse, the plot, is in itself, pretty much a downer but Panic while being a very good film in a lot of ways, is so disturbing while watching that it's hard to get through it.

It also has that element of complete realism and really gets you thinking about one's neighbors, friends, coworkers etc-who they really are and what secrets they maybe carrying around.

It is so inspirational that when I rented it on 3\/14\/05 I was totally motivated to take up working out again after a 2-year break. It has the best tunes... Hearts On Fire, Burning Heart, No Easy Way Out, and Living In America. The training montages are, in my humble opinion, the best of any sports-oriented movie ever. OK, the movie is a Rocky flick, and it's not Schindler's List or Glory.But who cares! The interaction between Apollo and Rocky is amazing and shows how the two characters developed an undying friendship over the course of their careers. The East vs. West theme is dated but indicative of the late Cold War era of the 1980s. The final fight is unrealistic as expected, but awesome! If you wanna see boxing how it really is, watch a televised match or Million Dollar Baby for some authenticity.I can be realistic, and Rocky IV isn't close to the greatest movie ever made. Not by a long shot. But a movie is many things the story itself, the directing, the casting choices, the technical aspects, and the soundtrack. To me, the camaraderie of the cast is wonderful. Rocky, Adrian, Apollo, Paulie, and Duke (Tony Burton; Apollo and Rocky's corner man) have wonderful moments and dialogue together. My favorite is Apollo's mention of nails and Rocky jokingly mishears it as snails and the dialogue that follows. Plus I like when Bridgette Nielsen's character (Drago's wife) is at the press conference and says Why you insult us? I dunno, she says it kind of choppy-like, and she sounds like an authentic Russian\/Soviet chick.Some gripes... it's too short by about 15 minutes. I would have liked to see some more of Apollo's wife... I mean, after all, it was HER hubby who died after fighting Drago. A few scenes with her and Rocky and Adrian would have given the story some amazing emotion and depth. Also, Rocky's final speech is kiiiiinda lame and simplistic. If he had shown some more emotion at certain moments, it would have helped a bit (or maybe it shows his distancing himself from anything but the upcoming fight). Lastly, since Adrian flew to Russia to be with Rocky for his fight, it would have been cool if she participated in his conditioning. I mean, she could have done some calisthenics with him(aren't women into it?)... something I've never seen Rocky do! A real fighter has got to be limber! Plot hole!All inconsistencies aside, the story is direct and easy to follow. It must be said that having a great soundtrack is no small feat.

Russell Crowe stars as a successful general who is sold into slavery after being deposed by a ruthless upstart young emperor. We see him fight his way through the ranks as a gladiator and eventually square off against the young tyrant on the floor of the coliseum. Though not a historically accurate film, it is still worth seeing for a few of the fight scenes, and some of the performances.Crowe is as good as he needs to be as Maximus, the deposed general who only wishes to return home to harvest his crops after defeating a barbaric army at the film's beginning. However the dying old emperor, well-played by Richard Harris, wants to hand over control of Rome to this fine man. When the emperor's evil son hears of this plan, he kills his father and takes control of the empire. Since Maximus refuses to swear allegiance to the new emperor, he is order to be killed along with his wife and child. Maximus escapes the Roman soldiers, but is soon captured and sold into slavery as a gladiator. The rest of the film is centered around Maximus and his plans to overthrow the young emperor with the help of the emperor's sister and a few well-meaning senators.Gladiator could have been a great film, but it's a little unfocused, and some of the scenes could have been filmed a little better. For example, the opening battle starts off well. We see a fully-armed Roman army set to do battle with a Germanic hoard. We get some good shots of Roman archers and infantry men launching a barrage of arrows and flaming debris on the barbarians, and that looks pretty impressive. However, when the battle becomes hand-to-hand combat, everything becomes too murky and hard to follow. Some of the fight scenes between gladiators have the same sort of problems. Maximus, as his instructor tells him, does in fact kill too quickly. Sometimes he has dispatched five or six men without us even realizing how he did it. True he was an experienced soldier who would have gone for quick and efficient kills, but the spectacle is lost in some instances. The re-created Battle of Carthage is probably the most memorable combat scene, and it works fairly well.Few of the characters in this film are likable or well-defined. Oliver Reed gets the best lines, but his character is never fully developed to the point that we understand him. This could be the result of his untimely death during filming, though. Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi also have curious roles in the sense that we never really know who's side they are on, or if they are only using Maximus. There is an implied close relationship between both Maximus and Nielsen's character, but it leads nowhere. When I first saw this film, I thought Jaoquin Phoenix was over-acting badly, but now I'm not so sure. It is more than likely that a young emperor of Rome would have behaved with selfishness and paranoia, and Phoenix seems to revel in his role.Overall, this film reminds me quite a bit of Conan the Barbarian. We have similar scenes and themes throughout. Also, we even get an appearance by Sven Thorsen who played a bad guy in Conan. Here, he plays a former champion who comes out of retirement to challenge Maximus in one exciting scene.This film is really no better than Conan The Barbarian, and Crowe lacks Ahnold's charisma and physique.Bottom line 7 of 10 stars.

No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real hero or villain) trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just trying to get by. This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film.

You can't actually pass up a good opportunity on seeing this awesome movie. I freaking hate the people who voted it down to a 4.8. It is much better than that, much better than silence of the lambs, the shawshank redemption, the godfather, se7en, the lord of the ring movies and the pixar films, and don't dare arguing because i think it is the best exciting, fun, great movie ever created!!! It is really worth renting and buying, Freddie Prince Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cordellini are awesome. Perfect 10 on my scale!!

It is very sad to say but it's the truth. That movie is really funny, you laugh even if it's way too much stupid. The cast play well their characters and they add new characters so it add a bit of fantasy in the movie for their new plot. It's not half the 1st but still it's pretty good! It's your typical fast-food sequel made for the big bucks but hey, they do what they can with that plot, it failed but for the fans it was a success!! Estevez always do movie at that time (D2, Judgment Night, Another Stakeout, Loaded weapon...) that man was everywhere and he was indeed my favorite, that's an actor I really miss!

It's clean, HILARIOUS...and even though unrealistic...most movies are! I wish Disney would make more movies like this! I REALLY wish this was on DVD! As a matter of fact I'm watching this movie right now with my other college buddies from church....we all would give this a 10\/10! Come on people! Lighten up and live! How many movies are full of humor, have no sex scenes, no violence, no cussing, no gore, a silly plot (it might not be amazing, but who cares?! It's the humor that really counts in the movie!), and yet STILL become an enjoyable...nay, a most EXCELLENT movie to watch at any time! I really don't understand the logic of most people these days. According to most, good movies NEED a good plot, violence, sex, and other immoral aspects. I really disagree with this way of thinking. That's my opinion however.... Gosh I've seen this movie at LEAST 100 times! God bless and enjoy!
