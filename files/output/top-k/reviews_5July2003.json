The story is that of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has arrived in a small town to cover the Groundhog festival with his producer Rita (Andie McDowell) and camera man Larry (Chris Elliot). But when he must stay in the town for the night, he wakes up at in the previous day and it does so, again and again. This movie has the ultimate gag of all time with the concept of living a day for the rest of your life, it is used with great effect and Harold Ramis the director sets up very neat scenarios and does a time warp of the situations he is in but in different days. Bill Murray is in his prime here and Phil Connors is one of his best characters and his portrayl deserved perhaps a nomination, if Kline got one for A Fish Called Wanda then Murray should have recieved one. The sarcasm of Phil is great and the first cover of the festival is some of the most funny sarcasm I have ever seen. It is a shame that Murray doesn't sometimes write his characters dialogue, because he can handle the use  of sarcasm to the best comedic possibilities. There is one scene in the movie which he improvised, Ned comes up to him and instead of being a wise ass he hugs him, Ned is shaken and while hugging, Murray comes up with... I don't know where you're heading, but, can you call in work sick. Ned obliges politley and runs away, Murray is right on par here in some of his best work. McDowell and Elliot are good too providing solid support but the movie truly belongs to Murray. The two category's this should have been nominated for at the Academy was Best Screenplay and Best Actor, overlooked without a doubt. This film is a very intelligent film, it has such spiritual foundations that it is feel good and also you come away with something new to your life.

Wells story, it caused mass hysteria during the depression when first broadcast as an (unannounced) radio play.  The 1953 movie of the same name has long been considered a Science Fiction classic.  Independence Day is the 1990s, Hollywood version of the same story.  There are no real surprises on this three day journey of technically superior aliens invading and destroying the earth, but the trip is well worth it thanks to a great ensemble cast, terrific special effects, and a quirky script.Will Smith heads the cast as Marine pilot Captain Steve Hiller, a one-liner kind of hero whose goal is to be an astronaut, but he is challenged as the star of the picture by Jeff Goldblum (playing David Levinson), the MIT techo-geek who first realizes the threat of the alien ships.  In a wonderfully woven (and very convenient) plot, their lives entwine with those of the President and a drunken crop-dusting Russell Casse. Judd Hirsh and Harvey Fierstein also shine in supporting roles.But perhaps the special effects are really the star as the aliens rampage and thoroughly destroy Washington DC, New York City, and L.A.  As I said, there are no real surprises, but sometimes you just want to kick back and enjoy a movie.
