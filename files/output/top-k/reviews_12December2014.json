I've always picked it up from a shelf, looked at the cover and thought to myself I don't think I want to watch this. Then I looked up movie reviews on IMDb, YouTube and other social media sites and all have said that it's a brilliant film, it's one of a kind, it is heart-breaking and tragic. For years I still see these reviews and new ones always come in and they all the same thing. That's when I decided, 14 years after the film's release, that with all the hype, I could lower my expectations and expect something like a mediocre movie. Because I've never really liked movies that are based around drugs (like Altered States or The Panic in Needle Park). They just seem dull and boring or the acting isn't as great. But this. This movie with all the hype, after listening for 14 years on how perfect it was, on how tragic it was, how REALISTIC the movie portrays drug addiction, and I just shrugged it off and told the people that movies like that aren't worth watching. After finally watching it, I wasn't prepared for it. This movie, as soon as the credit rolls, has become one of my favourite movies of all time. I don't see myself watching it over and over again, no this will only be watched maybe a few times in my life. I can't say I can connect with these characters, because I have never done drugs, smoked or even had much alcohol in life, but the acting from Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn are enough to make you not even take a drop of alcohol or a puff from anything ever in your life! Ellen Burstyn was a magnificent actress in this, watching her go from this lovely, yet lonely, plumpy young woman and then slowly going on a downward spiral as she turns into this addicted, crazed old lady who just wants to be on television and for her son to be happy. I don't think I've cried this much since either Titanic or The Stoning of Soraya M. Jared, Jennifer and Marlon were brilliant too don't you worry. Watching them go to great length just to get their hands on the goodies is enough to make you never take drugs again.I would just like to say that this movie is worth the hype. Darren Aronofsky has made some great films (Black Swan and The Wrestler are my favourites from him) but this has to be his best yet! It is somewhat educational, and I really do recommend it to anyone!10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Just like I said in the summary Just wow!

Does it portray the Iranian people in a bad light? Maybe it does. But don't forget, Not Without My Daughter is a highly dramatized movie, the seemingly sadistic nature of Moody and the primitive conditions in the setting chances are have been exaggerated to make the movie more exciting to viewers. It's also told from the POV of an American woman who traveled to another country, not used to the culture, during a conflict in the country, so her view on the subject might be different from the other people involved. This is why I'd highly recommend not taking this movie too seriously. Yes it was based on true events, but it's all dramatized.It doesn't matter if you're from Iran or America or any other place in the world, an abusive husband is an abusive husband. And the movie never went to say that all Iranian men are wife-beating creeps, in fact most of the Muslim people shown in the movie were very nice and caring people, trapped under the thumb of strict religion and laws. They were obeying orders to protect themselves and their loved ones, just like we would do, like anyone would do. In fact it wasn't America that brought Betty and her daughter home, it was a very understanding Iranian shopkeeper and his partner (and by the way Betty leaves her baby son there, no idea why).Stereotypes are often in the media, where countries portray other countries in stereotypical ways. For example, Canada and the United States have a back and forth game. In movies and TV, The States portrays Canadians as environmental hippie, eh-saying do-gooders who love eating moose and seals (we're not at all like that, none of the people in my town anyway). Canada portrays Americans as gun-loving, obese idiots (they're not). Unfortunately stereotypes are always going to be there. I recently noticed a plot similar to Not Without My Daughter in the 2012 Lifetime movie Left to Die, which portrays South America as a poverty-stricken world of thieves and liars. An American woman gets arrested and put in prison there. I found it to be very inaccurate, but it was only a movie.Not Without My Daughter is much like a Lifetime movie, don't expect it to be the most accurate thing in the world. For what it's worth, the acting and soundtrack wasn't bad at all. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but for entertainment alone it manages to keep you watching 'till the end, so you've gotta give it credit for that. Just don't watch it in place of reading a textbook or accurate information. If I were you I'd read up on the Muslim religion and the conflicts taking place at the time of the movie to get a better understanding of the reality behind the Hollywood drama.

It was a cute idea so Capra asked Columbia studios to buy the rights to it and then he forgot about it. Frank's previous feature was LADY FOR A DAY which got great reviews and was Columbia studio's first film ever Oscar nominated and Capra's. Irving Thalberg wanted Capra to make his next film at MGM in exchange for $50k and the loan of a star. But at the last minute Louis B. Mayer canceled the film but honored the deal. Back at Columbia Capra wanted to make Night Bus, but studio tyrant Harry Cohn and all his advisers fought against it. They said things like, It's nothing; froth, trivia, just another bus picture, no suspense, no heart, no oomph, winter's coming and it's all exteriors. All they could get Capra to do was change the title to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT which they said was too long to fit on a marquee! Capra tried casting Myrna Loy &#x96; she turned it down; then Margaret Sullavan &#x96; said 'no thank you'; Miriam Hopkins was insulted and said, 'Not if I never play another part'; Constance Bennett told him to go fly a kite and then offered to buy the script and have it rewritten for her! Capra had co-written the script with his favorite writer Robert Riskin but they brought in Myles Connolly who added more sympathetic and interesting characters so people could identify with them. The pretty girl, a spoiled brat, was rich yes but bored with being an heiress now wanting something real. The man was made a guy we all know and like; a tough crusading reporter on the outs with his pigheaded editor. It's The Taming Of The Shrew, but the shrew must be worth taming and the guy must be one of us. Back to casting, this time they went after Robert Montgomery a great light comedian at MGM. Mayer called Cohn and said, Montgomery says there are too many bus pictures and (don't take this in the wrong way) but going from MGM to lowly Columbia was an insult. But you've caught me in a good mood. I got an actor here who's been a bad boy. Wants more money. And I'd like to spank him. You can have Clark Gable. Surprisingly the next knock on Capra's shabby office door came from a very drunk and cursing Gable, reporting to Siberia as he called it. Gable's objections almost made Capra throw in the towel but then Harry Cohn suggested getting Claudette Colbert for the girl in the story. (He had heard she liked money.) So Capra and Riskin made an appointment that very night to see her at her home. When they arrived Colbert regretted agreeing to the meeting as she was packing to leave on a month long skiing vacation. Capra saw this attractive, wealthy and spoiled woman and knew she was perfect for the part. So Capra, after being bit in the butt by her dog, asked what it would take to get her in the picture. (Capra had directed her first picture, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE a silent made in 1927 and a flop) To throw him off she said she normally made $25k a picture (a price Columbia had never paid to an actor before), he would have to double it AND she was only available from her studio Paramount during her Christmas vacation. They would have to shoot all her scenes and retakes in less than 4 weeks -- half the time they had budgeted! So Capra called Cohn to ask would he pay her the $50k, Cohn said I can pay it if you can shoot it in 4 weeks. Capra said, he didn't know, but he'd try. So they told her, Deal, Claudette! $50k for 4 weeks! Okay? To which she replied, Oh for God's sake! She was trapped. That next day she had to report for her costume fittings and the day after that they begin filming&#x85; in a hurry. While they shot film all day Capra edited and rewrote the story to tighten it up at night. To make the film and story move quicker he asked the actors to talk faster, his amazing cinematographer Joseph Walker to shoot faster. They had little time to build sets so most of the film had to be shot on location. If an actor didn't show up one day he was replaced by another and lines were rewritten. Most scenes were shot in one short take and then they sprinted on to the next location. Capra, getting exhausted claimed he felt like a boxer who left his fight in the gym. But, things started to pull together as they filmed. Capra in his autobiography talked about the happy accidents like when Colbert did not want to undress in front of the camera came up with the blanket being used as the walls of Jericho. Gable to save time undressing skipped wearing a t-shirt, causing t-shirt sales to later plummet. One of the best happy accidents happened when Capra decided to add a scene on the bus of a couple hillbilly musicians who start singing The Man On The Flying Trapeze to break up the monotony. He noticed the extras started smiling and singing along, almost becoming child like. Frank stopped and called for 4 more cameras and his stars. He told everyone they had no time to rehearse but to feel free to join in the singing and ham it up if they wanted too. He then told Gable and Colbert that they were a pair of icebergs when the scene stars and they were to slowly melt. Then they shot it all in one take. Just watch the actor's faces as they naturally shed their inhibitions and join in having fun!

They had little time to build sets so most of the film had to be shot on location. If an actor didn't show up one day he was replaced by another and lines were rewritten. Most scenes were shot in one short take and then they sprinted on to the next location. Capra, getting exhausted claimed he felt like a boxer who left his fight in the gym. But, things started to pull together as they filmed. Capra in his autobiography talked about the happy accidents like when Colbert did not want to undress in front of the camera came up with the blanket being used as the walls of Jericho. Gable to save time undressing skipped wearing a t-shirt, causing t-shirt sales to later plummet. One of the best happy accidents happened when Capra decided to add a scene on the bus of a couple hillbilly musicians who start singing The Man On The Flying Trapeze to break up the monotony. He noticed the extras started smiling and singing along, almost becoming child like. Frank stopped and called for 4 more cameras and his stars. He told everyone they had no time to rehearse but to feel free to join in the singing and ham it up if they wanted too. He then told Gable and Colbert that they were a pair of icebergs when the scene stars and they were to slowly melt. Then they shot it all in one take. Just watch the actor's faces as they naturally shed their inhibitions and join in having fun!

Same goes for Helen Hunt. Both of these cute young women jump off and leap out of the screen in this cool and hip '80s teen dance classic. Sarah Jessica Parker looks so cute and so flirty and so bright and so sweet and so perfect. She really can steal a guy's heart with one simple smile. SJP is beautiful. SJP appears in her P.J.S. as GJWHF surprises us with a good long glance at sexy young Parker in her blue and red undies. I mention this only because it's so important. SJP's so adorable, still is. Helen Hunt is dancing and living it up in GJWHF. I have a big crush on Helen, right away. Hunt makes just as an unforgettable first impression as Parker does, and she looks just as cute and all too sweet. I wanna see Helen Hunt in more teen dance flicks, is that possible? I wonder if Helen and SJP stayed good friends through the years. It's great seeing Lee Montgomery and Shannen Doherty and Jonathan Silverman as kids. Montgomery makes a handsome-haired rebel with his role and he made it big by landing it. I know a good star when I see one, and Lee Montgomery is a movie star, though I'm unsure why he never did anymore movies. Doherty makes a punky preteen little sister as a bright future lies ahead of her just like it does for Sarah Jessica and Helen. Shannen's really good. Silverman makes for a slick talking sidekick as he talks himself with this part into the Weekend at Bernie's movies. Ed Lauter does fine work for strict military dads, but his son's a total pervert. Girls Just Want to Have Fun is a very fun and very popular movie. It's a great dance flick for girls especially and a little bit underrated. It would have had an added fun dimension if it had the original 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun' song sung by Cnydi Lauper herself, but it worked out well since it made way for the other memorable '80s dance songs we get to hear, like 'Shout', 'Dancing in the Street', and 'I Can Fly', especially 'Dancing in the Street'! The big dance-off with that theme hit song is like the movie's best part. SJP and HH both show off their sizzling hot dance skills and both look really good doing it too in those moments.

It is too convenient and far-fetched. Characters are a little too stupid for the sake of the plot, mostly the main character, whenever it suits the movie. There is a scene where the main character gets attacked in a manner that would fit a James Bond film but this particular occasion does not call at all for such an attack, except for the show of course.Some movies like L.A. Confidential have too many minor layers that may end up losing the viewer, while this film goes the opposite direction, as far as to make its characters clarify out loud what had just occurred when it is not at all necessary.However, you will not care about the contrivance issue because the general structure of the film is so nice, it is so well shot and the performances are so great that the rest does not matter.The tension can be cut with a knife, and once it starts, it continues with barely a break until the end. Even though the movie can be a bit predictable, you cannot wait to see what happens next anyway.This is one of the more original and better looking movies. There are neat little tricks Hitchcock with the camera that keep surprising and this is all done in the 1950s may I remind. The mood of location is conveyed with excellency, like showing the vast middle-of-nowhere by shooting from a hight with a good long perspective.Perhaps a minor note, but this film also has quite a few good looking night scenes for the time. Many of the movies of this era use the day-for-night technique where the scene is shot in the daylight and then darkened in post-processing, which always looks really fake. North by Northwest does this much better, through a variety of techniques.Perhaps one visual issue is that it tends to use a lot of matte paintings to fill out the background and unfortunately some of them are quite noticeable.A brief word on the music it goes a long way to help the movie feel tense.

Basically, this Disney work is a collection of four cartoons, each under 10 minutes. Between these cartoons, we find out some information about life in South America at that point. I did not like the introduction about cartoonists traveling down south, but the other sequences between the cartoons very informative and certainly worth a watch already for the contemporary historical documents they are.The four cartoons were all created by different directors and also work as stand-alone films. The first is about Donald experiencing South American in his usual slapstick fashion. We see his struggles with a llama and with dizzy heights. The second is about little mail plane who suddenly gets called to action after his parents suffer from high oil pressure. I found the ending a bit too melodramatic, but everything else about this short film is very good, possibly my favorite from the quartet. The third is another how-to short film featuring Goofy about how Argentinians\/Gauchos live. I like especially the sports-related Goofy shorts, but this one did not do too much for me. Finally, Donald is back and meets a Brazilian bird. A fruitful collaboration as these two caballeros join two years later for The Three Caballeros with another bird not seen yet in this short film. Also, I would like to emphasize one scene, where a bee gets swallowed by a carnivorous plant, then transforms into Donald and spits out the bee again. This example that the bee is not just gone shows how family-friendly these cartoons were and really neglected the presence of death completely unlike animated films these days.Saludos Amigos scored three Oscar-nominations in the music\/sound categories, which is fairly uncommon for a short film looking at today's standards. It did not win an Oscar, but its success was probably one of the main reasons for the sequel. Worth a watch for cartoon enthusiasts or people interested in the history of South America.

When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made them they were essentially comedies, with just a touch of melodrama to move the romantic plot lines forward. But by the time of 1977's Saturday Night Fever and 1987's Dirty Dancing, dance had become a framework for commentary about heavy topics like rape and abortion. It is arguable whether audiences really noticed; decades afterward Saturday Night Fever is famous primarily for its time capsule soundtrack and John Travolta's white-suited disco pose, while Dirty Dancing remains alive in the collective memory for one famous line of dialogue and for the slick moves that Patrick Swayze showed off and later parodied on Saturday Night Live.Yet to understand the non-dance bits of these movies, it helps to be familiar with the periods in which they were made. In the case of Dirty Dancing, it is helpful also to know something about the time in which it is set the early 1960s, the brink of a major generational divide. Despite Jennifer Grey's clothes and hair, a few of the song choices, and the fact that the font and color of the title look like they come straight off a Prince album, this movie is consciously and by necessity a period piece. It is set in a family-focused lakeside resort, a kind of place with a kind of ethos that no longer existed by the time of the movie's release in 1987. Much is made of the emergence of new forms of popular entertainment, new interpretations of old words like baby, and the new social frontiers that would turn old- fashioned liberals like Jerry Orbach's character into conservatives without their knowledge. This is fertile ground for a drama, but a movie about dance&#x97;and this is, to its credit, a movie about dance&#x97;doesn't have time to do these ideas justice. The dangers of unsafe abortions in the pre-Roe era are highlighted, but in a way that is unfeasibly convenient. It is structured so that the romantic leads come out squeaky-clean heroes and their antagonists more villainous. The feelings of the woman in trouble are explored only in passing and only at moments calculated to serve the needs of the central story. Similarly, the prejudices of the upper middle-class are touched upon, but in the vaguest way. One oily sort speaks of sexual liaisons with the help as slumming, and Swayze's itinerant dancer is obscurely identified as coming from the streets. What streets, exactly, remain unknown, as does his ethnic identity, which he seems to hint at through a very tenuous, arguably Italian, inflection.Though Eleanor Bergstein's script takes itself very seriously, and though its desire to say something meaningful is laudable albeit misplaced, its real power is, quite rightly, in the dance sequences. Unlike Saturday Night Fever, which spends far too much time away from the dance floor and among dislikable people, Dirty Dancing is a worthy successor to the classics because it spends the bulk of its time on music and movement. Grey and Swayze look genuinely happy when they dance, and when the world shrinks to them they generate a feeling of goodwill that overshadows the movie's missteps and instances of overreach. There is an unshakable cheesiness to the film that the great dance movies of the past were too self-aware and witty to fall into. The way Grey's character falls for Swayze's is so pat, the way he expresses himself is so hammy, and the way Orbach's comes around at the end is so cutesy and orchestrated. But the important scenes, the dance montages, all look and sound great, and it's easy to feel good while watching them.Happily, the film avoids the clichés of its genre.

When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made them they were essentially comedies, with just a touch of melodrama to move the romantic plot lines forward. But by the time of 1977's Saturday Night Fever and 1987's Dirty Dancing, dance had become a framework for commentary about heavy topics like rape and abortion. It is arguable whether audiences really noticed; decades afterward Saturday Night Fever is famous primarily for its time capsule soundtrack and John Travolta's white-suited disco pose, while Dirty Dancing remains alive in the collective memory for one famous line of dialogue and for the slick moves that Patrick Swayze showed off and later parodied on Saturday Night Live.Yet to understand the non-dance bits of these movies, it helps to be familiar with the periods in which they were made. In the case of Dirty Dancing, it is helpful also to know something about the time in which it is set the early 1960s, the brink of a major generational divide. Despite Jennifer Grey's clothes and hair, a few of the song choices, and the fact that the font and color of the title look like they come straight off a Prince album, this movie is consciously and by necessity a period piece. It is set in a family-focused lakeside resort, a kind of place with a kind of ethos that no longer existed by the time of the movie's release in 1987. Much is made of the emergence of new forms of popular entertainment, new interpretations of old words like baby, and the new social frontiers that would turn old- fashioned liberals like Jerry Orbach's character into conservatives without their knowledge. This is fertile ground for a drama, but a movie about dance&#x97;and this is, to its credit, a movie about dance&#x97;doesn't have time to do these ideas justice. The dangers of unsafe abortions in the pre-Roe era are highlighted, but in a way that is unfeasibly convenient. It is structured so that the romantic leads come out squeaky-clean heroes and their antagonists more villainous. The feelings of the woman in trouble are explored only in passing and only at moments calculated to serve the needs of the central story. Similarly, the prejudices of the upper middle-class are touched upon, but in the vaguest way. One oily sort speaks of sexual liaisons with the help as slumming, and Swayze's itinerant dancer is obscurely identified as coming from the streets. What streets, exactly, remain unknown, as does his ethnic identity, which he seems to hint at through a very tenuous, arguably Italian, inflection.Though Eleanor Bergstein's script takes itself very seriously, and though its desire to say something meaningful is laudable albeit misplaced, its real power is, quite rightly, in the dance sequences. Unlike Saturday Night Fever, which spends far too much time away from the dance floor and among dislikable people, Dirty Dancing is a worthy successor to the classics because it spends the bulk of its time on music and movement. Grey and Swayze look genuinely happy when they dance, and when the world shrinks to them they generate a feeling of goodwill that overshadows the movie's missteps and instances of overreach. There is an unshakable cheesiness to the film that the great dance movies of the past were too self-aware and witty to fall into. The way Grey's character falls for Swayze's is so pat, the way he expresses himself is so hammy, and the way Orbach's comes around at the end is so cutesy and orchestrated. But the important scenes, the dance montages, all look and sound great, and it's easy to feel good while watching them.Happily, the film avoids the clichés of its genre.

It is just about ranchers bullying settlers, centering on Shane's experience being with one of the families. There are no sub or side-plots, just the escalating conflict. The movie paces itself quite well and the story has a traditional and steady rise up to the climax. It was quite interesting and well paced.The acting is a mixed bag, but there is a very clear culprit to point out.There is a kid named Joey played by Brandon de Wilde. He is in this movie a lot as one of the main characters and he is absolutely terrible. Everything about his scenes is uncomfortable. The camera hangs on too long until he stops moving his eyes and says something. His delivery is excruciatingly fake. And maybe it is a sin to comment on an actor's looks but his buck teeth, squinty eyes and and giant forehead in combination with his manner of speaking just make him seem ...special.Dialogue overall has ups and downs. There are parts that sound like they were written by an unschooled person for a comic book, and Joey is the concentrated juice of that style. Weird thing is, there are also moments when it suddenly gets deep and grown up.The villain is really good though. Snake eyes, evil smile, everything about this guy is wonderfully psychotic. He is played by a certain Jack Palance who I thought was wearing some special mask for this movie, but that is actually the guy's real chin! In fact, this bad guy pretty much makes up for the boy's acting, but is unfortunately not given as much screen time.The cinematography's alright, although has imperfections here and there like a noticeable cut in the middle of a scene or the day-for-night scenes (it was the CGI of those days wasn't it). I can tell at one point that a man whistles but the makers dubbed a word being said over it instead. Hoping no one would notice? Also, this is not a point against the film so much, but it is a point of contention. The motivations of the good characters are weird. The farmers are no fighters and have families. They insist on standing their ground against a number of armed men and the main character only seems to encourage this behavior, knowing the danger this brings to the families. It sounds increasingly more stupid and irresponsible as the movie progresses and things become more dangerous.Have I mentioned I hate the kid?

It was quite interesting and well paced.The acting is a mixed bag, but there is a very clear culprit to point out.There is a kid named Joey played by Brandon de Wilde. He is in this movie a lot as one of the main characters and he is absolutely terrible. Everything about his scenes is uncomfortable. The camera hangs on too long until he stops moving his eyes and says something. His delivery is excruciatingly fake. And maybe it is a sin to comment on an actor's looks but his buck teeth, squinty eyes and and giant forehead in combination with his manner of speaking just make him seem ...special.Dialogue overall has ups and downs. There are parts that sound like they were written by an unschooled person for a comic book, and Joey is the concentrated juice of that style. Weird thing is, there are also moments when it suddenly gets deep and grown up.The villain is really good though. Snake eyes, evil smile, everything about this guy is wonderfully psychotic. He is played by a certain Jack Palance who I thought was wearing some special mask for this movie, but that is actually the guy's real chin! In fact, this bad guy pretty much makes up for the boy's acting, but is unfortunately not given as much screen time.The cinematography's alright, although has imperfections here and there like a noticeable cut in the middle of a scene or the day-for-night scenes (it was the CGI of those days wasn't it). I can tell at one point that a man whistles but the makers dubbed a word being said over it instead. Hoping no one would notice? Also, this is not a point against the film so much, but it is a point of contention. The motivations of the good characters are weird. The farmers are no fighters and have families. They insist on standing their ground against a number of armed men and the main character only seems to encourage this behavior, knowing the danger this brings to the families. It sounds increasingly more stupid and irresponsible as the movie progresses and things become more dangerous.Have I mentioned I hate the kid? I really hate that kid.Anyway, the film is a feel-good traditional western. It is a bit thick, but it makes sense and it is for most part enjoyable.

I haven't seen it in 30 years. It was a real joy to see Eddie Murphy in prime comedic form. Dan Aykroyd is fine, but this isn't a breakout for him compared to the Ghostbusters series or The Blues Brothers. What I particularly liked was the view of Philadelphia in the early 1980s, with its blue-collar workers, unemployed people standing in the street doing little or just warming their hands near a burning trash barrel, and the run down neighborhoods. It was surprisingly reminiscent of post-2009 America in Detroit or other hard-hit areas. A reminder that the more things change, the more they stay the same.As for the movie, it has the antic energy of a comedy from that era. Compare it to last summer's comedic hit, Guardians of the Galaxy. The production values are vastly different and show what's happened in 30 years of filmmaking with the introduction of CGI. However the writing, the plot, and the acting are just as good if not better in the older film.
