Winslet is average, not great in her portrayal, but that's partially because the script doesn't present Iris Murdoch in her early days as a very sympathetic character. Instead of coming off as a free spirit she's far more of a sexually confused egotistical dilantette who uses everyone around her. Scenes where Iris is supposedly revealing her shady past and her motivations fall completely flat...there's not enough of a sense of vulnerability or that she really NEEDS her husband. Ultimately that takes away from the Dench-Broadbent storyline. I felt badly for Broadbent's character as he clearly was in way over his head trying to take care of Iris, but I was puzzled as to why he stayed with her in the first place as she treated him so awfully when they were young. The flashbacks also aren't handled quite right, the interaction between the present and past scenes is too jarring. I suspect that it was a conscious choice to do it that way in an attempt to describe the ravages of Alzheimer's, but the film really suffers as a story because of it. This film would have been better served as a straight linear narrative without the constant flashbacks, focusing on either the young or old stage of Iris' life.

The Dead Zone centers around young schoolteacher John Smith (the awesome Christopher Walken) who leads a pretty normal life in a small town in Maine. John is a nice young man with a classroom full of students who like him, a pretty girlfriend he wants to marry and a good relationship with his mom and dad. But late one night, a horrific car accident takes all of that away from him...and replaces it with the gift - or is it the curse? - of precognition. John awakens from a five year coma to find his girlfriend married to another man, his job long gone and his parents much more feeble and shaken. But the one thing he does have - and isn't sure he wants - is a powerful ability to see both into the past and the future. Everyone he touches is an open book - the nurse whose house is burning down, the doctor whose mother escaped Nazi occupied Poland, the reporter whose sister killed herself...and a brutal serial killer who is raping and strangling young women. But the worst is yet to come. John meets an eager and ruthless politician (Martin Sheen) who is determined to get into the White House and declare nuclear war in the name of God. John finally decides to make use of his harrowing visions and sets out to change the future, even if it means he will not live to see it for himself.This is an emotional, sorrowful tale of loss, grief and sacrifice. John is no superhero, no butt-kicking killing machine out to stomp the bad guys. He's a sad, lonely man with a limp and a terrible case of bad luck. The pain of John Smith haunts the expressive face of Christopher Walken throughout the entire film, and the rage he feels at the rotten hand that life has dealt him is understandable, believable and shattering. This is a man who has suffered every pain and loss that a man can suffer, yet is still determined to make the world a safe place for those he loves, even if it means losing them forever.John is indeed one of screendom's saddest heroes - accessible, believable and heartbreaking. Christopher Walken is thoroughly convincing in his performance here very likable and, at the same time, frighteningly intense. The cold, eternal winter in which the film takes place just reinforces the sense of loneliness and alienation. The violence is brief, but shocking, and the images are so powerful that they remain with you long after the film ends. Martin Sheen is also incredibly good as the dangerously psycho politician, and Brooke Adams is the dark ghost of regret as John's true love, Sarah. This is a powerful, unforgettable film, whether you consider it a mystery, a horror-thriller or a tragic love story. Don't miss it, if you can help it. 10 huge stars!

I'm infatuated with it. The cinematography can't be put into words, its the single greatest motion picture achievement these eyes have seen. No need to get into plot details here. If you haven't seen the movie and you're here reading this, you've read the hype already. People will preach to you about how this is an anti-war movie or an anti-Nam movie. These are the narrow-minded and short-sighted who fail to see the big picture. Thats not to say they're wrong, but they're missing the point. This movie is a commentary on humanity, not one short function of life known as war. Its not the violence of war that throws Kurtz off the deep end. The war simply provides as a backdrop. Society and human nature is the culprit here. Coppola is not attempting to show us the horror of war, hes showing us the horror of man's violent nature.Back to the movie itself. I've noticed my favorite films all have narrations by the main character (Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, American Beauty are some examples). This movie tops them all in that aspect. Coppolla uses the narration and psyche of Willard to create and detail the character of Kurtz.We only know of Kurtz that Willard knows, and the suspense is amazing. No one can watch this movie and not be drawn to this character. Along the way we are taken through hell on the banks of a river. One cant help but wonder what would cause humans to behave in such a way or subject themselves to such conditions. My example here is the bridge scene. You have a group of human beings in a world of s**t. Their existence has been reduced to nothing. They are only there to kill VC's. Their once normal lives back home no longer exist. They are too deep to ever go back. I bought the Redux version of this film, and I think it makes the original seem more perfect. Every scene that was cut didn't belong. These scenes offered us a more personal look at Willard, and offers more compassion towards him as having a human side (when he steals the surfboard or gets close to the French woman). I personally prefer the cold, stoic character I came to know from the original. It gives the film a darker sense and does more for me. Had the movie been released in Redux, i doubt id feel the same way about it. Kudos to Coppola for knowing what to remove.

Most of the comedy in this film spoofs 1980's movies, with a few current barbs thrown in from more recent films. I am an 80's child, and I laughed so hard during this movie! I saw it with younger kids from the mid-to-late 90's, and they didn't get half of the jokes. The school cafeteria is named The Anthony Michael Dining Hall. The school is John Hughes High School. There are send-ups of Risky Business, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty In Pink, Sixteen Candles, and an absolutely priceless scene that spoofs The Breakfast Club, along with the original Breakfast Club principal, Richard Vernon, spouting almost exactly the same dialogue. Sure, there are much more recent films that are skewered, such as Varsity Blues, (which was HORRIBLE) and She's All That, (Which was EVEN WORSE.) There's an hilarious running gag spoofing Cruel Intentions, in which the slutty sister will stop at nothing to bed her brother, high school football hero Jake Wyler, who makes a bet with his team members that he can turn plain-jain, boy-hating Janie Griggs into the prom queen. Sex jokes and excrement jokes run rampant, all hilarious.

However it fails miserably to deliver for a number of reasons, not least of which is a poor script.As a filmmaker myself, I know all too well how much hard work goes into these things. You only have to look at the extras and watch all the work that goes into production design to realize this (which does happen to be the best contribution to eXistenZ, by the way). But just because a lot of hard work goes into something doesn't make it good.Some comments on here marvel at Jude Law's performance in this, but I've seen a lot of his work and this is by far his most wooden. I almost had to cover my eyes when he stepped into the virtual reality world for the first time. He, with co-star Jennifer Jason Leigh, stumble around and converse like a couple of school kids. I grant Mr Law a reprieve solely due to the material he had to work with.I can also deal with blood and gore reasonably well, I have no problem with it. But this movie seemed to relish in gore for gore's sake. I also found the many saliva-lubricated-fingers-into-bioports a bit sexually charged for this type of movie, particularly since Mr Law's tongue also gets a bit of action (and said bioport is only three or four inches above... Well, you can guess).Perhaps it was a mistake watching this in the same evening as Pier Paolo Pasolini's Mamma Roma because I found eXistenZ somewhat lacking in that which draws me to a movie... Having a soul. eXistenZ appears to fumble along with no real aim or directive and there was nothing of substance about it because we didn't care about what happened to the characters in the VR world.

This is particularly true of main character Joe Slovak (Matthew Modine), as apparent from the introduction of him sitting in various admissions interviews trying to answer questions the way he thinks would please the representatives. Joe's a bright guy, and a pretty gifted med student, if only he'd apply himself. And that's pretty much the whole ponit of the movie. What is Joe Slovak's goal here?The one to impress that on him the most is a pretty tight-fisted, but well-meaning professor played by Christine Lahti. Her character is not simply there to turn out med students who know the human anatomy, but who also have compassion towards their patients and realize that there is really much more to the whole field than just memorizing terms or grades on exams. Joe Slovak has yet to learn that.The movie is pretty funny, despite being a somewhat sad story towards the end (and you'll probably guess why early on). But, it is a pretty entertaining film, and often a funny one at that. It's also interesting to take a look at the day in the life of a med student, particularly if those are your perspective plans.

Indiana, along with two other explorers, lead their way into the Temple of Doom where they must fight for survival!

Stu (the next door neighbour) is more popular at school, good at sports and comes from a very abusive family.  Both are closeted and Stu finds it hard to come to terms with being gay and being popular with his mates at school. This is basically a sweet, small love story between two, coming-of-age, gay teenagers.

Romero is a name synonomous with zombie-horror. He created the immensely popular Dead Trilogy and after hearing how great his films are I finally got around to seeing the original Night of the Living Dead. The film paints the picture of a world facing an epidemic of cannibalistic zombies. It focuses on a group of people who are holed up in a farmhouse trying to fight off the zombies over the course of a night. The characters, as they fight for their lives, deal with their own conflicting ideas of how to survive. I was disappointed in this film. While it is a classic of the horror genre and the pioneer of the zombie subgenre, I was not impressed. It's outdatedness and virtual lack of a budget proved to be too great of a distraction for me. I will never write off an entire movie because it lacked an adequate monetary resource in it's production. I know that great things can be done in film with little money and I understand that many people see greatness in Night of the Living Dead, however I did not see it.The slow moving zombies of the film were meant to creat a creepy atmosphere but I almost found the zombies comedic. After having seen so many horror movie cliches recently it was interesting to see them back when they were not cliches yet. Situations where the victim falls while being pursued or can't get a car started are now only used for comedic effect and in Night of the Living Dead it was hard to see them as terror-inducing.The acting talent was overall mediocre. I thought Judith O'Dea's performance was just annoying and a little too much. While she was terrified at the beginning of the film she almost seemed to be holding her breath to create the feeling. She tried too hard and came up as unbelievable. The rest of the cast was fine, with special mention towards to Karl Hardman as the hot headed know-it-all. The film's saving grace was Duane Jones. From the minute he appears onscreen he takes charge, becoming the leader of the group. His performance was the only thing that held my interest. The ending of the film would have been incredible had I not seen a certain movie recently that stole it's own ending from Night of the Living Dead. Unfortunately for Romero, I hated the movie that took his ending. Overall I would rate this movie at **. I am happy I saw it because it is such a classic and so respected but I will not buy it because it comes off as too cheesy for my tastes.

I don't even consider it a sport. I consider it legalized violence, that people pay money to see, knowing that each blow to the head costs countless braincells. So, there is no way I would ever like a boxing movie. But Rocky isn't a boxing movie. It's not about boxing; it's about determination, will-power, and doing what you can to realize your dream. That's why I think Rocky is a great movie; it has something that everyone can relate to. Many people who watch this movie don't know the first thing about boxing, nor do they care about it(myself included); but everybody has a dream, something that they want to accomplish, something great they want to achieve at some point in their life. And that's why it's going to appeal to so many different people; everyone can relate to the theme wanting to realize a dream. The plot is good, it moves along at a slow, steady pace, so you will need to be fairly patient with this film. Don't worry, the waiting pays off in the end. That I can promise you. The acting is pretty good, by pretty much everyone in the film, even Stallone, who I'm normally not at all impressed by. The characters are well-written, credible and likable(the ones we're supposed to like, at least). The story and theme is something that really sparks some interesting thought, especially since this was based on something that really happened. It's definitely one of Stallone's best films.
