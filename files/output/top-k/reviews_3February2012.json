Some people say this darkness mixture with blue makes the movie scary and interesting, but comm om, it just makes it confusing. It's not even enough to scare us, but it was enough to make me bored. Acting here goes pretty much the same as Alien (since the first movie wasn't that exceptional), except for some short role characters interpreted by bad actors. But good news the third and fourth Alien its about to get worse. Soundtrack passes by without get stuck in your memory, it just accomplishes it's role follow the scene.Aliens plot gives you more twists than the first movie, but right in the end of the movie you gonna see something amazing an Alien waiting to use the elevator. Isn't she brilliant?Since Aliens basically repeated it's predecessors formula, if you have enjoyed the first one, you'll like this. If you haven't, you'll agree with me.

I mean how can you follow up a film like 'Jaws' without engaging in silliness? I'm not surprised in the least that Universal wanted to cash in on the popularity of 'Jaws' with a sequel. It's a hard act to follow. As far as unnecessary sequels go though 'Jaws 2' has some charm and is competently made with thrills that pack some punch to them. It's problem though deals with it's total lack of interesting characters besides Roy Scheider's reprisal as Brody.'Jaws' was a great film because of it's characters and how we cared for them. The dialogue, chemistry, and the acting between Shaw, Scheider, and Dreyfus elevated that picture. The fact is the rubber shark in 'Jaws 2' actually looks better in a lot of ways than the shark in the first one. I know a great deal of people credit Spielberg for saving the shark for the last act of the film but I think what adds to that is that the characters are stranded where they cannot get help and are at their most dangerous moment. 'Jaws 2' has that moment too. The Brody boys and their friends are trapped in the middle of the ocean with a shark circling in on them, it is a frightening scenario. What it is missing though is well developed and acted characters. Scheider isn't trapped on the water here and so we have to fear for these under developed characters. I didn't. A great deal of them play like something from a bad 'Friday the 13th' rip off. While horrible things happen to them we just aren't as pulled in to care for their survival. It's a miserable combination of bad dialogue and acting. The scenario is pretty frightening and I think had Spielberg been in the director's chair with a polished script it would have been quite memorable. The film just feels so anti-climatic in comparison to 'Jaws' and it no doubt has to do with the characters because the film tries newer and bigger things to do with its shark.Scheider makes this film work on a certain level. One of the high points of the film is that he is the only character who has changed from his experiences from the first film. Scheider doesn't play Brody in the same way, he's bolder and far more paranoid. I really like seeing this aspect of the character and the performance. Of course we know a great white is terrorizing Amity again but I like the fact that Scheider's Brody compounds the fears to new manic levels where we can see why Amity residents might think this guy is a little unhinged. I think this aspect of the character certainly should have been explored more. It would have added more psychological thrills to the story and it would really give Scheider a stronger role to explore. I would have loved to have seen them explore Hooper in this way as well. Universal should have tried much harder to get Dreyfus back. Besides Scheider everyone else's' character is a carbon copy of their role in one. The fact that Mayor Vaughn got elected to a second term is pretty astounding and of course his first response is boating accidents. Brody's wife Ellen is a bore and expanding her character didn't help the film at all. We'll be seeing more of her later on in the series...All in all 'Jaws 2' is a flawed film but it has some merit to it. I think it has merit and with a more competent director and script it could have been a truly great sequel. I think the film will definitely appeal to fans of Scheider's Brody because it does explore this great character a little more.

But please note that favorite in my book is still something totally different than best. It's just so that this is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.Basically this is a movie about a hunt for treasure\/gold but set in modern times and in the midst of a modern war situation. Seriously, how many other adventure for treasure movies are out there, set in modern times, in the first place. This alone already makes this movie a real original one. But it's an original and unique movie, in so many more ways.It's also a war movie, dealing with some serious and heavy issues at times but yet the movie overall is still being a very fun and entertaining one, due to the approach by director David O. Russell, that turns this movie into a subtle comedy, combined with some heavy moments and a strong anti-war message beneath it all. Really, it's one of the best anti-war movies I have ever seen. It shows the craziness of it all and in particular that of the whole Gulf war. It's a movie that is definitely not afraid to criticize the American involvement and show how some poor political choices made a lot of innocent people suffer. It's really making a statement about this but without shoving things down your throat or constantly putting too much emphasis on it, so it never becomes a distracting or annoying thing. Expect for its ending maybe.

A New Yorker, most of all. If you're a New Yorker, you know what I mean.He's a quirky individualist who is the tour guide on one of those buses with an open second layer on top, and he rambles with idiosyncratic abandon about different aspects of the city. It would be fun to have him for your real tour guide, but I don't do tour buses, and of course the movie is all most of us have instead, so you do get something here of the man's style and his love of the city. Eventually it becomes more than a weird love letter to New York, and we come to see how a man is coping with being alive in the city and making sense of the systems that he finds insidious (including the justice system, which he once negotiated as an accused). If you like documentaries, and you like New York, and you appreciate oddball people, this might just be a great little movie. Overall, I found it too narrow, too dependent on liking the main and only character, and too unexceptional (actually) to take off.Don't look up until after you're dizzy. This is just after he tells a boy on the bus that it's fun to stand between the twin towers and spin until you get dizzy, and they you can look up and it seems like the two buildings are about to fall on you. In a way, this defines fully half of the man, his boyish lack of restraint, his joy for life. He layers lots of facts about New York City into this zany fun outlook.I didn't get swept up by his monologues partly because I've known too many people like Levitch, at least in pieces, just by knowing lots of artists and others who want to do their thing and the world can take it or leave it. His freewheeling theories are really not that strange, either, and the self-aggrandizing hidden by a veneer of humility is a bit too much about ego. Listen to me, he says, and we have to listen, even when it's not really so interesting. Don't get me wrong, I find Levitch to be an attractive kind of person, someone who is alive on their own terms, who has theories about how that world works that can't hold water but are functional anyway, and who is actually happy amidst all the grey sadness.Still, I got a bit restless and bored by the not-so-brilliant after all chatter. Yet, it occurs to me that other people may not have run into these kinds of people, and this movie is a great entry point, and hopefully one that makes you appreciate all of them, Levitch in particular. Really, I wish I was more like him, and maybe in my own way I am, though I lack his unselfconsciousness. But what I mean is we are all secretly wishing we could just throw out all the worries we have and live what seems to be a very simple life, giving people pleasure on these bus tours and therefore seeing New York yourself, and lots of different kinds of people, every day you go to work.It's not enough for a great movie, but it's unique enough and unpretentious, and filmed with a low-budget accessibility (by the director), you should give it a shot.

If you're a New Yorker, you know what I mean.He's a quirky individualist who is the tour guide on one of those buses with an open second layer on top, and he rambles with idiosyncratic abandon about different aspects of the city. It would be fun to have him for your real tour guide, but I don't do tour buses, and of course the movie is all most of us have instead, so you do get something here of the man's style and his love of the city. Eventually it becomes more than a weird love letter to New York, and we come to see how a man is coping with being alive in the city and making sense of the systems that he finds insidious (including the justice system, which he once negotiated as an accused). If you like documentaries, and you like New York, and you appreciate oddball people, this might just be a great little movie. Overall, I found it too narrow, too dependent on liking the main and only character, and too unexceptional (actually) to take off.Don't look up until after you're dizzy. This is just after he tells a boy on the bus that it's fun to stand between the twin towers and spin until you get dizzy, and they you can look up and it seems like the two buildings are about to fall on you. In a way, this defines fully half of the man, his boyish lack of restraint, his joy for life. He layers lots of facts about New York City into this zany fun outlook.I didn't get swept up by his monologues partly because I've known too many people like Levitch, at least in pieces, just by knowing lots of artists and others who want to do their thing and the world can take it or leave it. His freewheeling theories are really not that strange, either, and the self-aggrandizing hidden by a veneer of humility is a bit too much about ego. Listen to me, he says, and we have to listen, even when it's not really so interesting. Don't get me wrong, I find Levitch to be an attractive kind of person, someone who is alive on their own terms, who has theories about how that world works that can't hold water but are functional anyway, and who is actually happy amidst all the grey sadness.Still, I got a bit restless and bored by the not-so-brilliant after all chatter. Yet, it occurs to me that other people may not have run into these kinds of people, and this movie is a great entry point, and hopefully one that makes you appreciate all of them, Levitch in particular. Really, I wish I was more like him, and maybe in my own way I am, though I lack his unselfconsciousness. But what I mean is we are all secretly wishing we could just throw out all the worries we have and live what seems to be a very simple life, giving people pleasure on these bus tours and therefore seeing New York yourself, and lots of different kinds of people, every day you go to work.It's not enough for a great movie, but it's unique enough and unpretentious, and filmed with a low-budget accessibility (by the director), you should give it a shot.

But Gil and wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen), as every couple, have their own problems with career demands, family issues and 3 young kids with their own idiosyncrasies and developmental problems.As you might guess the cast is quite stellar and probably wouldn't be possible in this day and age of inflated salaries and egos, Parenthood isn't so much an 'event film' as one which shows the various generations dealing with raising kids of various ages in their own ways.Some of the occurrences and developments in the film are quite serious in tone but obviously dealt with in amusing fashion. While teenage angst, sex and domineering parents might seem like easy targets for comedy they also manage to squeeze a chuckle or two from broken and breaking relationships and neglectful parents.The entire cast does well at providing carefully rendered characters, Steve Martin as always provides the deadpan laughs, the exception being the immortal kid's birthday party scene where he is allowed to run wild and crazy as Cowboy Gil the most amusing party entertainment on film.Hulce is unlikable as the fast talking deadbeat Larry &#x96; which is the point, and Weist is very good as the downtrodden and almost desperate single Mum Helen trying to juggle 2 growing kids and a moronic live in boyfriend\/husband to her daughter played by Keanu Reeves, who at the time was still embracing his doofus image.It's hard to talk about Parenthood in more detail, the humour is created through the low key realistic situations and how those going through them deal with them. Aside from the Cowboy Gil scene there aren't too many laugh out loud moments but there are numerous chuckles to be had and the film quite accurately proves what Robards' character says near the end; 'once you start you never stop being a parent'.Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 \/ 10.

If Mean Girls is the Heathers for a new generation, the latter has certainly softened in comparison to the former. While both films deal satirically with their subjects, Waters' screenplay goes way over the top in the attempt to expose the frailty and weakness most people try to hide in order to thrive socially. Indeed, many others have noted that the notion of society is perhaps the main contribution of this film. The fact that Veronica (Ryder) feels obligated first to be part of the Heathers clique and then tag along with the disturbing rebel JD (Slater) seems to indicate that even she herself is not as strong-willed as initially thought. Everyone in this film has at the core of their selves a deep-seeded urge to be something or do something beyond what their lives can offer. This sets up for what has become a cult classic that to this day retains its bitter edge, particularly in this hyper-sensitive society where seemingly everything teenagers do is considered a social watershed moment only after the fact.Very funny dialogue, wonderful performances (especially Ryder and Slater) and a remarkable stylized sense of direction make this film the logical conclusion to the end of the 1980s.

The film starts out by introducing the five different teens as their label; the princess played by Molly Ringwald, the brain played by Anthony Hall, the criminal played by Judd Nelson, the basket case played by Ally Sheedy, and the athlete played by Emilio Estevez. As the movie progresses the viewer gets to know them as Allison (previously the basket case), Claire (beforehand the princess), Andrew (was the athlete), Brian (who was the brain), and John (which was the criminal).The theme is shown by the changes made in the letter from the beginning of the movie to the one at the end of the movie. The first version just admits what was done to get them there was wrong, they thought the he was crazy to tell them to write an essay about themselves, and that he wouldn't care to read the essays anyways since he sees them as their stereotyped labels. The corrected version at the end doesn't have them admitting to having done anything wrong just that they deserve the detention and accept it, writing an essay about themselves is crazy, and he'll see them as he wants to under the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions which they each sign off as under their own label.The other way it is shown is as each individual explains their home life. Each of them have the same problem, their parents don't understand them as their selves but as their labels. They further their realization of that as they realize they are just different is all. They each had something different as their lunch; with one of the having nothing, one having sushi, one having sugar on bread, one having a regular nutritious lunch, and one having tons to eat. Then they understand that in totality after seeing what each person carries around in either their purse or wallet.This same theme is covered in a different way in the movie The Pregnancy Project. That film focused more on pregnant teens being stereotyped as having no future any more. However at the end the girl conduction the project realized the problem wasn't that the pregnant teens were treated different the problem was stereotyping and happened to more than just pregnant teens. She gives a presentation at the end to explain this, while this is explained only in the letter and their new friendships in The Breakfast Club.Film elements and techniques added to the film to help get the theme across. One main way was the music and in specific the song ''Don't You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds. The song's lyrics are very similar to the plot of the movie while the song is played at the beginning and picked up at the part that has the word la repeated in beat by John as he helps the others avoid getting in trouble by getting himself in trouble, the song then is repeated at the end of the film. Another way is how the film goes back and forth between the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Paul Gleason, and the 5 teenagers.Overall the film covers how labels shouldn't be put on people. Everyone is different but their differences aren't given justice by labeling them. Stereotyping just causes problems. I feel that the movie was excellent and the acting was done excellent as well especially with the actress Ally Sheedy's playing Allison who at the beginning of the film was a funny character by the way she acted entirely different than the rest but over time starts talking and at the end changes her look all together with help of Claire.

All two hours fly by &#x96; it's tightly paced, action packed, has a fantastic story, rich sounds, colors and cinematography and above all else, has two great leads with two awesome performances. I'm a Denzel Washington (when he's not screaming for an Oscar, 'American Gangster,' anyone?) fan and he did great himself, but doesn't hold a candle to one of Gene Hackman's best performances ever. His ability to turn an eyebrow movement into a full semester in film school is uncanny. Overall, I loved the film, never tire of it and despite the You're both wrong finale at Pearl Harbor &#x96; I never agreed to that, I am glad to now own it on BluRay. My Producer is telling me to shush up and go to bed now. Thanks to guys like these, I can without the fear of nuclear war!(Oh, and on a side note, I developed a whole work news letter based on this film's title & font called The Crimson Side since it was in 1996 (so, topical) and we were the RED side of the call center (as opposed to the failing BLUE side.)

I originally thought the movie was outdated, since I have experienced the human\/robot social films for a while now, mostly with Battle Star Galactica, Blade Runner, i, Robot, and even Terminator. However, this is one of the first and original stories to convey the human\/robot social conflicts and was glad to find the film on my video on demand lists.Worth mentioning first is the fine acting by Peter Weller, and I can't help but wonder why he never became more than a cult film actor, he truly could have been a big time action star on par with the other heavyweights of the 90s. And he really is convincing in this film, as a man who was on the brink of madness from desolation and hardship. As for the supporting cast, excellent performances for a low budget film. It reminded me of a time when all Science Fiction films were B-movies, before the Star Wars and Star Trek's came along.Come to think of it, the film had a decent sized budget for a 90s film. Nothing like other adapted Phillip K. Dick novels had gotten, such as Blade Runner, Minority Report, or Total Recall, but still, Screamers is a story that needed a bigger budget and if it had gotten one, this film would be a classic to be mentioned in the same breath as Dick's other masterpieces. The story reminded me of Blade Runner in some ways, and another short by Dick called The Defenders In a sense, Dick re-tells his themes over and over again, but nevertheless, Screamers is well written and unique in its own way. It's just perplexing why this film didn't come out in the 70s, or even early 80s, before the original Battle Star Galactica, and before Terminator, etc. This story would have made for a very pioneering film.

The Fugitive, however, is different because the story provided the impetus rather than the cast, who are merely characters rather than personalities (the wrongly-accused doctor, the obsessed marshal, the one-armed man). Because of this, skilled actors such as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones can slip into the roles like they are well-worn suits and, together with the enhanced opportunities offered by big-budget cinematics, can create something terrific.Part of the reason this re-make works is that Harrison Ford plays this type of role so well the reluctant hero, resourceful everyman and unfairly-treated victim. Just about anyone can identify with Ford's plight and imagine themselves in the same situation, and conversely hope that they might use the same courage and initiative. On the other side of the coin is US Marshal Tommy Lee Jones, who is conscientious to the verge of obsession and strives to think like his quarry - but not so blindly that he also doesn't empathise for him. That's what makes The Fugitive better than the average cop-and-crim chase movie both characters are likable, and the climactic meeting between them doesn't disappoint.It has its fair dose of action, but not so much that it overrides or smothers the tension and suspense of the plot.

The story takes place in a mental institution and is about the rebellion of conformism against authority. This film depicts how society views the mentally ill, and helps give more of a connection to the patients in order to get a better understanding of their behavior and struggles. In the film, Jack Nicholson is cast in the lead role as, Randall McMurphy, who is a small time criminal that chooses to play crazy and spend the remainder of his jail sentence in the mental ward, in order to get out of hard, laborious work. His plan works, but he soon discovers that life in the asylum isn't what he thought it would be. While many of the rules of the ward are not as restricting as those in the prison, there are many privileges that he has to forego. Despite this realization, he decides to try to make the best of it and quickly befriends many of the different patients on the ward. Such as the, very small and very talkative Martini (Danny DeVito), the stuttering young man, Billy, (Brad Dourif) and the tall and large deaf and mute American Indian, who he nicknames The Chief (Will Sampson). The villain of the film, Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, becomes the main obstacle of McMurphy's personal freedom and rights. Throughout much of the film, you see Nurse Ratched manipulate situations to favor her own opinions and thoughts and you could see how she was constantly trying to maintain her control and dominance over the patients. She would rather destroy and belittle the men, rather than help them or try to cure them. Her so called therapy involved humiliation and exposing the men's weaknesses. McMurphy was always pushing Nurse Ratched to her breaking points, by constantly questioning her authority and trying to get the other patients to agree with his requests and opinions. Nurse Ratched is the symbol of authority and society and her behavior represents how society expects us to act and behave towards individuals and their struggles. In the end, McMurphy gets to be free, but not in the way you anticipate him to be free. When watching this film, I am reminded of another film, also directed by Milos Forman,The People Verses Larry Flynt. This film is also about rebelling against authority, and the struggles of one man who went up against a society of others and stood for what he believed was his right and privilege. This film also showed, much like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, what happens to individuals who don't conform to what is deemed normal or socially accepted. The director does a great job of incorporating feelings with the colors used within the mental institutions atmosphere. Most of the film's scenes are gloomy and dark which conveys what it must have been like for the patients to be confined in the ward. The hospital displays no bright or happy colors and the movie is mostly filmed with dingy blues and grays, which I believe symbolizes the patients' despair and hopelessness. Many of the patients are dressed in the hospital uniforms, and they often appear disheveled, and messy. The director also uses sound to help convey to the audience the pain and misery these patients were going through. The choice of the sounds makes the audience forced to see and almost feel how the mental institution must be in reality. Nurse Ratched's character represents order and authority, while McMurphy's character represents rebellion. The film does a great job of showing the rebellion against authority, by choosing to use the psychiatric ward as a representation of a small part of the world, human beings and society. The film depicts society as a way to conform everyone to its narrow-mindedness and rules. It shows how when you conform to what other people's views are; you lose your own individuality. The director, Milos Forman, conveys the daily struggles that everyone must face when trying to go outside of what is deemed normal, and how you can eventually overcome these trials, even if it means dying so that others can pursue their own freedom.

An interesting gimmick. Sadly, that gimmick is about the only interesting thing the movie has to offer. When you're making a movie out of a board game you can't expect to produce a cinema classic. All you're looking to do is make a movie that's fun. And this movie just isn't fun enough. The performers have a good go at it, most notably a deliriously over the top Tim Curry, but the material lets them down. Jokes fall flat, the movie drags and by the end you really don't care who did it. And finding out who did it is the whole point of the movie so that's a problem.The movie sets itself up the way anyone who's ever played the game knows it would. All the famous characters are brought together in a secluded mansion. Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard. Somebody ends up lying dead on the floor. Who did it? And where? And with what? Well the where part is no great mystery. Or is it? There may be surprises to come. Anyhow our six suspects must figure out which of them is the killer. They are assisted by the butler Wadsworth, who serves as a sort of master of ceremonies for the bizarre evening, and the French maid Yvette. Along the way more bodies pile up. Attempted jokes pile up too but so many of them miss the mark. The comedy falls flat and the movie does too. None of the six suspects really stands out. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to point your suspicions in any one direction. But the effect is that bland characters make a bland movie. Michael McKean's Mr. Green and Madeline Kahn's Mrs. White are particularly dull. No fault of the performers, they really have nothing to work with. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing Professor Plum, is rather dry and boring. If you can make Christopher Lloyd boring you've really done something. Not something good though. Lesley Ann Warren does make a ravishing Miss Scarlett, always my prime suspect when I played the game. But she's upstaged in the va-va-va-voom department by Colleen Camp's wonderfully bouncy Yvette. Martin Mull makes no real impression as Colonel Mustard. Eileen Brennan's Mrs. Peacock does have some personality but she's more annoying than anything else. It's really left to Curry, playing Wadsworth, to inject some life into the movie. And he tries. Boy does he try, never more so than near the end with his madcap recap of events. But game as Curry is he can't perform a total salvage job on this largely disappointing movie. It's a whodunit where the answer is who cares?
