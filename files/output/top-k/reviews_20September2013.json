But why not? This will always be a new movie for someone. First time I saw it - in VHS format - I was about 12. Now I watched it on blu-ray, so here goes.One of the best action movies of the 80's and it doesn't even feel like an 80's movie too much. A true pioneer, introducing us a fantastic, all new alien species and quite a few memorable scenes, characters and of course some one-liners from Arnold.The jungle is an excellent environment, and it's used well. Cinematography and camera-work is usually very impressive. The story is clever enough and moves forward at an enjoyable pace. There is action, suspense, comic relief and of course sci-fi all mashed into one unforgettable movie in a manner that is hard to surpass. This movie starts just okay but gets better with each passing minute, climaxing wonderfully in the end. There are no significant flaws for me.Before I get to the little disappointing things, I'll list some things I love about Predator- Location. The jungle isn't only cool, it also serves the movie well in a way that still feels fresh and ageless. Imagine if this film was set in a city in the 80's. - The Predator itself. Not only how it looks (good), but its behavior, background, the whole concept. It is a real character, not just an enemy in an action film.- Arnold. I can't help it. He's the most entertaining action hero ever.- Muscles and guns everywhere! The whole commando squad is a well-cast, enjoyable group of different personalities.- Satisfying violence. PG-13 just wouldn't cut it. - Jesse Ventura with the Old Painless. Yes, this had to be mentioned separately.- The awfully hilarious female genitalia-related jokes. - 1st, 2nd and 3rd act are all wonderfully different from each other, yet somehow still fit together as a whole.Now, to the nitpicking. Sometimes the editing is a little off to me. Only a few scenes where it's noticeable, but it sticks out a little. Sometimes during intense action the big picture gets lost and it feels like people are just running wherever and explosions just happen without much established geography, and that takes just a little out of the experience for me. The effects, well...most of them have survived the test of time. Quite an accomplishment. Some effects still look very cool. Some of them sadly don't and I was taken out of the movie at times, but after 26 years that's more than understandable. But if someone's reading this and hasn't seen this movie, don't be discouraged. You'll love it, and you'll find plenty of stuff here that you won't find from the majority of action films today.The blu-ray picture quality is surprisingly good (I got the Ultimate hunter edition), considering how much they had to do. There are a couple of shots that are not re-mastered for some reason, but they're only 2-3 seconds long each and didn't bother me that much.I was about to give this a score of 8\/10, because I might've just seen this movie too many times to fully appreciate it anymore. Then I slapped myself in the face immediately. If I had a Top10 list of action movies, Predator would be in it. For the originality, overall quality, certain agelessness, pure entertainment value and also nostalgic value it gets a respectable 9\/10. Truly a classic. If you ever meet someone who says Predator is his\/her favorite movie, do not think you're dealing with an idiot. You just might be dealing with a genius of the highest caliber. Not bad for John McTiernan's first big studio film! McTiernan's next movie after this was Die Hard, not a bad combo.

One of those people was Writer\/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of Alien he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, The Terminator, came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time.The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. The planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a consultant to a battalion of Marines along with a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group, forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters.One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. Its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was\/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in.Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed Newt. Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film.What makes this film far different from Alien is instead of it being a straight up horror\/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd Mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. Bishop's Countdown is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason.The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive.This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup.As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator-\/kidnapping-scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser Söze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known stands for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement.I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop\/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.
