So given his affection for 60's nostalgia, he decided to helm this 1991 biopic on one of rock and roll's all time greatest bands (one of my favorite rock groups as well). The Doors is a prime example of what a filmmaker can do if the vision of what's on screen is entirely his (not necessarily what the remaining members of The Doors themselves had intended). With as much clout as any major voice in Hollywood, Stone made an exercise that veers almost completely away from the storytelling of the band, and instead concentrates on the madness and mystery of lead singer Jim Morrison. The result is a fiery yet saturated, powerful yet overwhelming, and sad yet involving portrait of a musical icon who passed over much too early. Now I gotta warn ya, this thing is over 2 hours long and is exhausting. It's also an ambitious mess (don't worry, this is a compliment) that's filled with every Stone nuance in the book (you almost have to wear dark sunglasses to tackle the look of it). But it's saddled with a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer as the lead. And he anchors this kaleidoscope of late 60's culture bent on entertaining you if you let it. So to make things clear, I am to this day, a huge fan of Oliver Stone's 90's endeavors. He has calmed down a bit as a director these days. And don't get me wrong, I still think he knows what he's doing behind the camera. But I kinda wish the maverick in him would come back (a la The Doors). There is just too much control with his technique in present day. I kinda hate it to be honest.Anyway, this movie tells the story of the band going from heralded beginnings (guitarist Robbie Kreiger and Jim Morrison were students who met at UCLA film school) to virtual stardom, and then to an eventual break up with the lead vocalist (the drummer, keyboard player, and lead guitarist continued on but the film ends with Jim's death). The Doors chronicles the years 1965 to 1971. Two to three aspects are driven home by Stone to get his point across. One is Morrison's alienation from the other band members (Kevin Dillon as John Densmore, Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger) through his relentless drug\/alcohol abuse during their tenure. Second, we get a sort of unclear spiritual journey that Kilmer (Morrison) goes through in the form of flashbacks caused by a drug fueled haze-type behavior. Lastly, Stone puts emphasis on Morrison's relationship with his hippie girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). Their love affair is volatile and dangerous. Just watching them together makes you think that they would not, and could not live very much longer. Finally, there is the music. The concert and studio recording scenes are so well filmed and seem so real (that's because the actors actually learned to play the instruments from what I understand), you get the sense that Mr. Stone really took his time to get the right attention to detail. Oh, and I almost forgot, look for Crispin Glover doing an Andy Warhol impersonation (In the film, Jim meets him at a party). With Velvet Underground's music in the background, it's a wallop of a scene in terms of sensory overload.To put it all into perspective, if you are a fan of the music via The Doors and don't mind a film that's rough around the edges, this is something worth checking out. The performances are adequate and Kilmer's turn as rock and roll's misunderstood poet is downright Oscar worthy (the reason he got snubbed could have been the film's early release in March). Yes, the overall structure of what's on screen is choppy and somewhat of a downer, but there is a storytelling light at the end of the tunnel. And as usual, Stone likes to wrap things up rather quickly. Is it justifiable after two hours and twenty minutes? Yeah, why not. By then, the audience has embraced the bruised heart of a fallen legend. Morrison is dead but the music of The Doors lives on forever. This film is a raw, battering interpretation of a band who's sound could never be copied. At close to the two hour mark, Frank Whaley (Robbie Krieger) says to Jim, you said you like pain. Well you run from it every chance you get. Well, I plan on viewing The Doors again and again and believe me, no matter how intense Stone's vision gets, I certainly won't run from it. That's a guarantee.

Before the success of The Hurt Locker (2009) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), she was making films that weren't deemed Academy Award worthy. She was cutting her teeth with raw unflinching action flicks like Blue Steel (1989) and this screw loose guilty pleasure known as Point Break. I've seen it many times and honestly it just never gets old. It belongs in a time capsule. Point Break represents a lot of beliefs I have about the possibility of what an action film can be because it goes completely over the top and throws everything in it but the kitchen sink. Yes, it's a movie that is choppy in shape and form. But it has bombastic originality along with a handful of important jaw dropping key scenes that make up for its shortcomings. Initially, when I first set foot in the theater over 20 years ago for my first screening of Point Break, I was dumbfounded. I was completely taken aback by the casting (Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey, Patrick Swayze), the plot, and the fact that the initial viewing left me cold, like I had seen a film that an average audience would stay away from (the theater was small, it was Friday night, and there were 8-10 people in the seats). Over time, I've grown to surrender to Point Break's giddiness as full blown cinema. It stands the test of time and breaks every film making rule in the book. You think the director, the stars, or the production staff cared, well they didn't. I have one word for these people, bravo!The story begins with our hero, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves in a his first starring action film role) entering his first day as a FBI agent in sunny Los Angeles. Right away, he gets paired with an over the hill aging veteran named Angelo Papas (played with improv overload by the likable Gary Busey). The two of them team up to try and catch a group of bank robbers who may or may not be surfers. Oh and I almost forgot, they also dress up as the ex-presidents with masks and all, only taking money out of the cash registers (apparently the vault takes too much time). Throughout the full running time of two pulse pounding hours, Reeves character befriends a local named Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and romances a spunky surfer girl Tyler Endicott (Lori Petty) all the while going undercover and bruising his whoooaaa like ego in the process. I'm not gonna lie, his performance demands attention. As a actor, he tends to be as wooden as aged oak but he's likable in Break. Bigelow saw something in Reeves that I think most directors would have dismissed as a veritable disaster. But she gave him his shot and he went on to shine later in Speed and the Matrix movies. Also, the pairing of Busey and Reeves as law enforcement associates is something I initially thought was some kind of nocturnal joke, but it works. Busey, with his purely white fanged teeth, runs amok with this character and becomes Utah's scary, perverse uncle. As the movie takes a lot of trippy twists and turns, the two of them form a friendship based on polar opposite attraction. It's the key to the film I think because ultimately it's a buddy cop yarn just like Lethal Weapon (1987) and 48 Hours (1982).Buddy cops movies aside, Point Break is pure adrenaline and has a harrowing intensity that shows in three key scenes the sting operation of a drug house followed by mistaken identity, the skydiving scene with no parachutes, and the apprehension of the villain in Austrailia's nastiest waters. I can say that a cult following this flick garnished, is well deserved. Kathyrn Bigelow, a maverick back then and an Academy darling now, deserves praise for this early 90's endeavor. She directed Point Break with reckless abandon and I'm proud to say it owns a special place in my eccentric collection of well worn DVDs.

A contributor to this is his directing of one of America's most famous horror films, Psycho. Aside from being extremely captivating and an overall great film the movie has a lot of significance in terms of both historic significance and social significance. For film history Psycho was one of the first and most iconic films to really push the envelope on what the current rating system, studio exects, and viewers would allow and embrace. The studio was not very keen on the subject matter and screenplay. In anticipation it would be a dud because of what they thought to be its bad taste, Hitchcock was granted a very low budget to make the film and most of the profits were to go to him. This proved to be a mistake. Psycho was a huge hit among audiences and made Hitchcock a very rich and well known director. Audiences praised Hitchcock and the movie. The reason for the studios and some others distaste in the film were its all around subject matter and some of the gory, revealing scenes. Obviously the most notable is the shower scene in which Norman Bates is seen murdering Marion Crane as she takes a shower. The scene was highly controversial because it revealed an unprecedented amount of nudity, blood, and violence for that time period. This kind of event was never (never ever ever) revealed in a film before. It is now easily the most iconic scene in American film history. Despite the controversy audiences were enthralled with the scene and the movie itself. Other controversial scenes included the opening one in which Marion and her lover Sam are featured sharing a bed together with Marion wearing only a bar and a scene where Marion is flushing a toilet that has toilet paper in it. Furthermore there was controversy over how the killer and villain Norman is depicted. Instead of the audience being left with disgust for his action the conclusion of the film makes us feel almost a sense of sorrow for him. It is revealed he committed the heinous crimes because of the psychological abuse he was subjected to by his mother, as a viewer we begin to attribute his horrible acts to being a result of this rather than him being inherently evil. The fact that the film was such monumental success despite its unorthodox subject matter for that time period is significant of the change in attitude toward film subject matter that was occurring in America. Viewers were becoming desensitized and willing to embrace and even enjoy racey material. This shift in attitude signifies the coming end of classic Hollywood and the code era.

A contributor to this is his directing of one of America's most famous horror films, Psycho. Aside from being extremely captivating and an overall great film the movie has a lot of significance in terms of both historic significance and social significance. For film history Psycho was one of the first and most iconic films to really push the envelope on what the current rating system, studio exects, and viewers would allow and embrace. The studio was not very keen on the subject matter and screenplay. In anticipation it would be a dud because of what they thought to be its bad taste, Hitchcock was granted a very low budget to make the film and most of the profits were to go to him. This proved to be a mistake. Psycho was a huge hit among audiences and made Hitchcock a very rich and well known director. Audiences praised Hitchcock and the movie. The reason for the studios and some others distaste in the film were its all around subject matter and some of the gory, revealing scenes. Obviously the most notable is the shower scene in which Norman Bates is seen murdering Marion Crane as she takes a shower. The scene was highly controversial because it revealed an unprecedented amount of nudity, blood, and violence for that time period. This kind of event was never (never ever ever) revealed in a film before. It is now easily the most iconic scene in American film history. Despite the controversy audiences were enthralled with the scene and the movie itself. Other controversial scenes included the opening one in which Marion and her lover Sam are featured sharing a bed together with Marion wearing only a bar and a scene where Marion is flushing a toilet that has toilet paper in it.

I knew who Spike Lee was, even though I had never seen any of his movies, but the only real information I had on it was that it could be intense at times, which my Dad had told me over the phone a few minutes before I saw it in my film class a week or so ago. And he was right. At first, I almost pegged it as a bit quirky. I was surprised by some of the other actors (I hadn't recognized who they were by their names in the opening credits), but I thought that it wasn't too shabby. And then, there was the ending. Or, in reality, the scene before the actual ending scenes. I knew that Spike Lee made important movies, and that he was into topics that were prevalent with African-Americans at the time, but, it was very rough to watch. I've never liked violence, I've never liked fights, I've never liked confrontations, and I've never liked extremely loud music and noise; all of which this movie contained. The worst two parts of all though, that actually scared me (the second actually sending a shiver down my spine) was the police brutality right after they broke up the main fist fight, and the part where Smiley was walking and sort of humming along to Fight The Power in the midst of the fire and destruction of the pizza place, and calmly attaches the picture of MLKJ and Malcolm X on the wall, next to all of the other pictures, of which caused one of the main conflicts in the first place.

What we see here is a man (Dr. Frankenstein) become so obsessed with his ambition to create humane life, and essentially play god, his monstrous actions result in his own actual creation of a monster. In his attempt to create a human Dr. Frankenstein is introduced at the beginning of the movie as he goes around digging up graves and taking bodies from execution sites. Using these stolen bodies he takes parts of each and creates a man-made man, in a literal sense. The doctor is spending so much time and become so obsessed with this project his fiancée and friend begin to worry about him. Prior to bringing the creature to life the doctor appears almost deranged. He embraces the idea that the monster has never lived because he created it despite that it is made of once living humans. The monster is then brought to life and appears seemingly gentle but unsure about its existence. As it twitches for the first time the doctor proclaims he now knows what its like to be god. After convincing the doctor agrees the monster must be killed but before it can be done it escapes. While free the monster is responsible for the death of a young girl and as a result the downs people seek to murder it. The significance we can see here is that when our ambitions are unethical and we go to unethical lengths to pursue them, the end result will be unfavorable not only to us but also everyone in our surroundings. Not only that but such an obsession as the one Dr. Frankenstein has can drive even wise men to act irrationally and not think things through. this significance is perhaps responsible for the subject matter of horror films that is still seen today. A seemingly good person looses sight of morals, rational thinking, and overall reality to pursue a goal that does more harm then good.

Vincent is speeding down the highway with Mia who is having an overdose, he is frantically calling the drug dealer, the camera then switches to the drug dealer, the shot is slow and doesn't cut to anything, giving the effect that he is in no rush to pick up his phone, and is very unaware for what is about to happen. Once Vincent gets to the house we hear the car screech down the road, the camera follows the drug dealer out and the camera isn't quick or steady but instead shaky as if we are running behind following him outside.

Pulp Fiction is a great movie in many ways and isn't for the faint of hearts, Tarantino is very innovative and uses editing, cinematography and sound to really capture the mise-en-scene of this film.

With a new-era of Hollywood production (no studio monopolies) and the Hayes Code a thing of the past a drastic change in film subject matter was inevitable. In my opinion, the graduate probably exceeded the expectation of what viewers thought they were in for. The movie is about a shy, awkward, confused college graduate (Ben) who winds up in an entangled affair with the older wife of his fathers business partner (Mrs. Robinson). Later after a date with the women's daughter Ben beings to think it is her who he wants to spend the rest of his life with. When Mrs. Robinson is told this she threatens to expose the affair, so Ben goes and beats her to it causing a less then favorable outcome for himself. Despite the daughters newfound hatred he purses her anyway and it seems she is almost falling for him. In light of this the Robinson's attempt to rush her into marriage with another male friend of hers. Ben breaks the wedding up and leaves with the daughter. As far as the films significance for Hollywood it marked an era of film that would deviate from the Hayes Code style films immensely. The idea that a young man would have an affair with a mother and fall in love with her daughter, and viewers could see all the details transpire was very unnatural with regard to past films. Notably Ben and Mrs. Robinson are featured nude in bed together several times. At one point in the film an up close image of Mrs. Robinson's exposed breast is shown. These type of scenes and the subject matter indicated the change in films that was going to ensue. In addition the film does have a more traditional social significance. As confused young Ben pursues different love affairs that are based purely on lust he starts to loose his ability to think rationally. When the daughter expresses her undesirable opinion of him it simply drives him to want her more. He moves to her college town and essentially stalks her and begins to almost force her to consider liking him. When she is to be married Ben drives cross country to break up the wedding. Up to this point all of his actions had been out of lust. When he breaks up the wedding the daughter leaves with him the last scene features them sitting on a bus with a sort of unsure look on their faces. It is as if they are both realizing they weren't acting out of true love. The social significance this illustrates is the dangers of pursuing actions based on lust.

Sidney Poitier, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy give wonderfully believable performances in a film about fear of societal intolerance and overcoming racial prejudice. Some characters are pointedly rounded, which is centrally important to the film's plot, but some are terribly flat and that's just something you have to get over. The overall photography isn't all that noticeable, but makes up for it with this important subject material.I had some issues with it by the end. The entire story takes place in one day, mainly just a few hours in the evening; I can only explain the nagging issue I had with that the movie was&#x85; 'less than action packed'. I understand that this film would by nature lack explosions and battle scenes, but it unfortunately caused me to lose interest almost completely about two thirds of the way through. One particular speech towards the end of the film is so dragged out that despite its importance I wished it to be over. Half the time they're just standing around, talking about what's happening, and I'm not the type of audience who appreciates watching multiple conversations that play out the exact same way. Call me crazy.I valued the film much more when it was over, and I could look back on it for its overall subject material, rather than how I felt whilst watching it. My point is, if you're going to see a film about fear of societal intolerance and overcoming racial prejudice, think about whether this one is the right one for you, because that could alter how much of an impression the social message leaves on you.

The country was almost flipped upside in a sense and it was a challenge for many to embrace and tolerate the shift that was occurring in our culture. Easy Rider is a significant representation of the dividing line that existed between the American people at that time. The Anti-war, care free and love embracing sub culture faced disapproval and in some cases oppression from the Americans who believed in a more traditional, less tolerant, and culture lacking lifestyle. What is also significant of this film is instead of putting American atop an artificial pedestal as the greatest freedom embracing country on the face of the earth, it acknowledge the ugly truth about how others tend to act toward people who look and act differently then they do even they are doing no harm. The adversities Wyatt and Billy face in their journey and the death of both George and them sheds light on how seriously people mistreat those just because of their appearance and what it implies. Easy Rider also touches on the issue of what truly defines freedom and how despite its reputation people in America who just to exercise their freedom by going against the grain are discouraged from doing so. Furthermore the illustration of the prevalence of drugs and sex in the film is significant to the American hippie sub culture and younger generations of Americans overall being more comfortable with the idea of openly addressing drug use and sex rather than ignoring it by pretending it is not there. There is even a scene where to women are scene being sexually active. This shows the true change that was not only taking place in Hollywood but also America.
