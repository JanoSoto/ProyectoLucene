However this time its the opposite; how can such a bad movie like this receive such a high score plus outstanding reviews to boot? Were those people watching the same movie? I saw this movie quite a while ago and the only reason why I am even talking about it is because I recently saw a story on cinema blender that suggested this would be a great idea for a remake. The problem is that the movie barely registered in my memory (never a good sign when measuring the entertainment value of a film) and then I remembered how boring it was. This was supposed to be a romance, comedy, and action all in one where Harrison Ford and Anne Heche are stranded on a desert island, they hate each other, are forced to band together, and then fall in love. One basic problem of the plot is how is that a sophisticated New York woman like Anne Heche, can fall for a man over half her age? I mean, Harrison Ford is not exactly a young chicken here. All this might be forgiven if the movie wasn't so darn boring. The comedy falls flat, much of the movie is nothing but Ford and Heche arguing, and even when some pirates show up, there just doesn't seem to be any thrill at all. Some people here have said the movie failed at the box office because of the fact that Anne Hache was dating Ellen DeGeneres at the time and people simply discriminated against the movie for that reason. Please folks, lets not use excuses like that to cover up a bad movie. To sum it up, Six Days Seven Nights is something that should stay in the past. Period.

A fire breaks out in one of the rooms and soon spreads to the whole building with people trapped inside. It is a classic disaster movie.I really enjoyed it, but it was way too long. The movie goes on for just under 3 hours. There was no need for the movie to be that long. They could have easily made that movie 2 hours or even 90 minutes. The first hour of the film I thought dragged on a bit too long.Paul Newman to me was the main character in the movie. He played the part well... Steve McQueen was in the movie too. He didn't disappoint. He did a great job as the fire fighter in charge of the situation. He should have been in it more though in my opinion.

Firstly, it badly wants to convey a message about consumerism, evil corporations, the shallowness of modern society, and all the things that that phony guy in college used to talk about while wearing expensive brands and a $100 haircut and generally making way too much of an effort trying to look like he just doesn't give a sh*t. Unsurprisingly, it's exactly that sort of people who tend to evangelize about this movie and how profound it is. Secondly, these same people will also insist on telling you how surprised they were with the ending and how clever they thought it was. Don't get me wrong, it's not super obvious, but as twist endings go it's pretty vanilla. It's a bit like the appearance of twins in any mystery story (you know the reveal will involve them swapping identities at some stage) crossed with the age-old it was all a dream. Anyone who pays attention to these things I give about a 50% chance of guessing it before the end (or 90% if you know there is a twist). So the message is laid on a bit too thick and the ending not mind- blowing. Big deal, right? Indeed, these are no big vices, but the problem is that the film and its following are so infatuated with themselves that they lead one to expect something between artistic genius and an article of faith.

The action sequences are great especially the flight sequences at the Battle at the Death Star scene, but the strongest aspect goes to the acting and the special effects.

What a great film it is. I do agree with the others that this is indeed one of the best movies in the history of Hollywood. I love how it took the science fiction genre to the next level in cinema history and it's done really well. That's why I'm giving this a solid 100% for being an epitome of brilliance from George Lucas himself.It has no flaws at all which is a good thing because it's redeemed by it's pros that made it a masterpiece for all time. The story is very original and has a great concept. The direction from Lucas is excellent and I like how it moves along very nicely at the 2 hour length. The action sequences are great especially the flight sequences at the Battle at the Death Star scene, but the strongest aspect goes to the acting and the special effects.

The story was far from what could have been a very cliché plot. I like to think of it as A Christmas Carol meets John Grisham novel. The romance in the movie was well played and very touching. Even though this movie may have some spiritual content that Christian's may not agree with, it does express the relationship between good and evil in and out of this world and touches upon spiritual warfare with demons and angels. Heaven and hell are both shown in detail, but it makes it look like if you do good things you go to heaven, and vice versa. I believe that this is not the case in my faith, that all you have to do is accept Jesus into your heart; but even so people of all religions should enjoy this movie. The suspense and action did not disappoint. The real star of this movie was Whoopi Goldberg, who stole every one of her scenes with her bold and loud presence, personality, and humor; she well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Oda Mae Brown. She wasn't the only actor who did exceptionally well though; Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Tony Goldwyn made a fantastic ensemble.

From the children in the pee-wee hockey team, from its headlining stars, to just plain background characters, it seems everyone has that same question on their mind.Well, where the hell do I begin? The Mighty Ducks is an experiment done by Disney that was allegedly aimed to usher in a more tweenish fanbase than their animation studios, by providing a live action experience and a more mature feel. They succeeded in making a spontaneous, somewhat entertaining piece of nostalgia for the current generation of teens, but to be completely honest, this is one of the most vanilla sports movies I've sat through in my day, only elevated to being somewhat passable because of its efficient use of its star, Emilio Estevez (seeing this as a child, this was my introduction to the man who would later be one of my favorite male character actors) and its surprisingly successful array of motivational music, which make the cliché ending satisfying and memorable.The story is paper thin, but works as some minor league, or pee-wee, entertainment. Estevez plays Gordon Bombay, an immensely cocky, successful defense attorney who has never lost a case in his life, but is sentenced to coach a team of young, misfit hockey players after being caught drunk driving. Bombay has had contention with the sport of hockey after he blew a title win in a penalty shot as a child, greatly putting his coach (Lane Smith) to shame.Now, coaching the District Five team, Bombay is unmotivated and careless, until he sees these kids are genial and somewhat good-natured (and the fact that his old coach is still employed at their rival team), leading him to finally put effort into his work. He names the team the Ducks, after the most noble creature in the wild, who travel in packs and stick by one another.Estevez gives about the most entertaining performance one could bring to the table for this kind of movie. His character is a smart-ass, cut-throat, boisterous know-it-all, who winds up having his heart warmed by a group of helpless kids who don't take that much pride playing for the hockey team until he gets involved.One of the downfalls of the children is that they are carbon-copies of the rambunctious tykes we see in so many movies, and any point at connecting or learning about one of them is especially moot. They are not interesting children, and even in a hundred and three minutes, we do not even get one as our surrogate to learn more about. Not to mention, the film is also about twenty minutes to long, thanks to a needless romantic subplot involving one of the children's mothers. The result is corny and usually unnecessary, but Estevez's chemistry with the mother, Heidi King, is just charming enough to make us somewhat care.As simple, pleasant entertainment, obviously the film's main goal, The Mighty Ducks works just fine as basic and has competence to carry a long runtime. The problem lies in its screenplay, which is flat and unambitious. Even though it's branded with the Disney name, just a few years later, we were welcomed with the brilliant breath of fresh air which was Remember the Titans, so Disney clearly wasn't incapable of delivering the goods in a sports film. The slapstick-reliant humor is goofy, yet it works, Estevez is fitting in his role, and the ending with music dominated by Queen brings a smile even to a hard-headed cynic's face. It's a Disney movie that gets half the job done.Starring Emilio Estevez, Joss Ackland, Lane Smith, Heidi Kling, Josef Sommer, Joshua Jackson, Elden Henson, and Shaun Weiss. Directed by Stephen Herek.

The story then shifts to Paris where on the same day young French woman Véronique (Irène Jacob), a doppelgänger who in a sudden moment feels grief and sadness, she teaches music and takes her class to see a musical piece by the same composer who performed with Weronika, conductor Van den Budenmayer (Aleksander Bardini), and in a few instances she hears more of his music playing in places.

Véronique feels manipulated finding out that it was Alexandre wanting to gain her attention and meet again, she eventually lets him off and they sleep together and make love, and the next morning he finds a photo of Weronika that obviously looks just like Véronique, but she denies it is her as he is the one who took the photo.

Unfotunately, it's occasionally pulled back down to less rarefied atmospheres under the weight of its overwrought, clunky romantic malfunctions. Jody Foster's character's atheism may be used against her to deny her the opportunity to fulfill a lifetime dream, and her attraction to the man responsible for this possible denial is played for all it's melodramatic, soap opera worth. And Jodie Foster - a consummate pro whose career credits are the envy of any working actor - is here just so relentlessly earnest and strident, and as focused as a cobra poised to strike. It's a bit of a one note performance, and maybe a little tiring. She does, of course, posses a wonderfully photogenic face which we are invited to scrutinize at great length in the countless increasingly tight close ups of her tense square jaw and piecing baby blue eyes. The special effects are a bit sketchy by today's astronomically high standards, but 15 years ago I imagine audience's were sufficiently impressed. The most glaring weakness are the matte painting backgrounds upon which has been place a considerable responsibility to generate awe and wonder, but their unnatural cartooniness is distracting. Most of the other digital effects are executed sufficiently well enough to serve the increasingly exciting action. The effects, and in fact the entire film very effectively plays off our collective memory of other classic landmark Sci-Fi films, such as 2001 A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, and even The Andromeda Strain with its terse and clinical scientific dialog executed with icy cold precision. These three films are certainly very fine company to be keeping and Contact earns its position by virtue of the challenging and unique questions raised by its intelligent script. It might come off as self important and smug of me to be nit picking this film, but my petty criticisms can be read as a testament to the high standard to which Contact strives and largely achieves.

The film is set in a large estate mansion, at the eve of the 20th century. It strikes by a predominance of red, tainted by the virginal white worn by three sisters. The symbolism is so striking that I guess we shouldn't get too far analytically, red refers to the emotions, the pain, the passion, and the very expression of what makes humans living persons (in Persona, it was only when she walked on broken glasses or when she was threatened by boiling water that Liv Ullman started to talk). Bergman never dissociates life from pain and passion, and the reddish abundance remarkably contrasts with the restrained directing. The mansion is occupied by three sisters Harriett Anderson is Agnes, dying of cancer, and she projects the ghostly mask of an imminent death so extraordinarily it's hard to think she was the luscious Monika, twenty years before. Liv Ullman and Ingrid Thullin play the two other sisters, Maria and Karin. Maria's youthful beauty and Karin's cold classiness are predictable characteristics from women of their class, and Bergman uses insightful flashbacks to enrich their personalities. Maria, disenchanted by her marriage, openly flirts with David, the doctor (Erland Josephson), the romance is so anticlimactic that it cancels off the first feeling Maria's lively personality inspires and her rejection of a despaired suicidal husband is a blatant display of heartlessness. Karin seems to be the rejected one and in a very hard-to-watch scene, she expresses her hatred toward her husband by mutilating herself with a piece of broken glass and triumphantly licking her lips, with a shocking defying look. I suffer, then I exist resonates like Bergman's Cogito. Ignoring compassion, Maria is below suffering; caricaturing it for selfish reasons, Karin is above it. And ironically, despite her agony, Agnes is the closest to what life represents. Yes, she suffers, but her pain is authentic. She makes some of the most realistic and dreadful agonizing sounds I'd never have experienced in my life but as painful as they were for the ears, they also expressed a vivid and ferocious attachment to life, like begging God to end this nightmare. It's like a Christic realization that life is all about feeling and suffering, and more than that, accepting suffering as a part of life and resigning to it. Both Maria and Karin are incapable of that for they are too disillusioned and too blinded by their own egos. And the strike of genius in the writing, to show where the soul's salvation can rely on, is the character of Anna, the round-cheeked maid, played all in nuance and profound humanity by Kary Sylwan. Anna wakes up in the morning, kneels before God, and pray for the soul of her daughter, and after that, she bites into an apple. She embodies the resignation to live, to love those who're present as much as those who were. She's the only one who takes care of Agnes with a maternal affection, putting her head on her bosom, caressing her and providing her the kind of maternal affection, one would need before dying. The toughest soldiers cry to their mommies when they're mortally wounded, anyone would love to have an Anna staring at him with affectionate and motherly eyes to catch the last breath. And what makes Anna so exceptional is that she is the only character, driven by faith and genuine affection, and through her, Bergman strangely accredits a certain positive role to religion. Cries and Whispers expresses Bergman's existential dilemma about the mindset that should prevail in life and how it takes its full meaning only facing death. The dilemma is even more puzzling because Bergman gives a chance to Maria and Karin to communicate, without the help of God. Dressed in black, they're mourning Agnes' death and the spirit that was theirs when they were expecting her to die. More lucid then, they comprehend the necessity to overcome the distance, to communicate, before one of them is bed-ridden again. And the miracle almost happens in a scene of authentic poignancy, when they start caressing each other like frail little animals, seeming to discover a whole word within the other's look. No words, except violin music, in one of Bergman's greatest moments, showing that it's never too late to reach a soul.But the film gets back to its initial pessimistic state, after a night vision, when they are incapable to talk to their sister and when the two sisters discuss with their respective husbands whether Anna should stay, or leave, with a little keepsake reminding her of Agnes. In their minds, Agnes became history, and as if they were all drunken by the whole deadly ambiance, the hangover finally passed. Anna refuses the keepsake for she had the most previous thing anyone could have, the conscience of having helped a soul to face pain and death, symbolized by the journal she finds in the drawer, revealing one of the few moments of sheer happiness, Agnes lived. This memory seems to indicate the end of Agnes' torment, her soul probably resting in peace and harmony. Is it heaven? Anna would believe so, as she would certainly believe the same if it was her own death, and she would probably deal with it with a wise serenity. As for us, and maybe Bergman, we'd rather share Anna's existential view than Maria or Karin, who'd probably have more miserable deaths. Some take the suffering as a proof of God's nonexistence, other as the proof of life, then as God's greatest miracle, and the price of that miracle is that we should also accept our mortality. I don't think Bergman supports the belief in God, but believing in nothing is not a better alternative.

In their minds, Agnes became history, and as if they were all drunken by the whole deadly ambiance, the hangover finally passed. Anna refuses the keepsake for she had the most previous thing anyone could have, the conscience of having helped a soul to face pain and death, symbolized by the journal she finds in the drawer, revealing one of the few moments of sheer happiness, Agnes lived. This memory seems to indicate the end of Agnes' torment, her soul probably resting in peace and harmony. Is it heaven? Anna would believe so, as she would certainly believe the same if it was her own death, and she would probably deal with it with a wise serenity. As for us, and maybe Bergman, we'd rather share Anna's existential view than Maria or Karin, who'd probably have more miserable deaths. Some take the suffering as a proof of God's nonexistence, other as the proof of life, then as God's greatest miracle, and the price of that miracle is that we should also accept our mortality. I don't think Bergman supports the belief in God, but believing in nothing is not a better alternative.

In this case I like it WAY better. One of my main problems is Mara Wilson. I can't put my finger on it but I didn't like her for the role of Susan.Other than that it just didn't have the presence the 1st film had. I'd have to re-watch it to give you more specifics and I don't intend to do that.If you haven't seen the other one I recommend you watch this one and then watch it.If you've already seen the 1947 version just walk away you will not care for this one. It might stand on it's own but it doesn't hold up in the shadow of such a classic work.
