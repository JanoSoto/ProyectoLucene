That's because I had heard about this film initially in the early 90s, when I was in high school and was just discovering the timeless joys of Stanley Kubrick films. I heard at that time he was working on A.I. as well as Eyes Wide Shut. Then I heard the news a few years later that he was going to do EWS first and then do AI. When I heard the news of Mr. Kubrick's death just prior to the release of EWS, I was standing in the lobby of the now-defunct Berkeley UC Landmark Theater about to watch a double feature of Persona and Wild Strawberries. Very fitting I suppose. One of the first thoughts that came to my mind was a kind of profound sadness I'll never get to see AI. Nobody will ever get to see AI. So why has it taken me so long to see it? Why was I not the first in line? I don't really like Steven Spielberg's films. And I think it was disingenuous of him to imply in interviews that he and Kubrick had planned to make the movie all along, while in actual fact Spielberg had abandoned the project in favor of Jurassic Park 2 many years ago. I see Spielberg as a vulture, basically, trying to get some of Kubrick's reflected glory.But every time I talked about Spielberg and the film, people here would rightly tell me that I should see the film before I talk trash about it. I agree, but it's against my aesthetic philosophy to watch a movie intentionally to dissect or criticize it. So I tended to stay away, especially after seeing the horrible Minority Report which kind of ruined Phil Dick's story.This one is a Phil Dick imitation also. It bears very little resemblance ot the Aldiss story as far as I can recall it. But it's an excellent idea in many ways, a sci-fi Pinoccio, and the execution is uneven but more or less emotionally sound. It's torturous almost in an existential way to imagine this poor boy has been programmed to love a woman who turns out to be such a flaming B**$!!@. I enjoyed the story element with his jealousy of Teddy and his growing affection for him throughout the story. It was painful to see teddy sitting at the table and to realize that the family really saw David as nothing but a sophisticated toy, while for David the family was the ultimate meaning of the world. It forms a strong plea for empathy.The scenes at the giant robot killing rally were also very impressively done, except in the sense that the crowd changed sides much too fast, and then we didn't even really see how they rescued David and his friend. Brendan Gleeson was very impressive, but I didn't believe that the crowd would turn from supporting him 100% to hating him 100% in a few seconds. In terms of the performances in general, they were solid. Osment should be singled out for praise because he manages to effect the character transitions required by the role. Jude Law was the only one I thought was kind of weak, he really did not make me care for his character the way I think we were supposed to.My main problem with the movie comes in the finale. I actually think possibly it would have been a better film if it had ended with him underwater watching the blue fairy. Spielberg made the same mistake he always makes, to explain and show too much. It wasn't quite as happy as the usual Spielberg movie ending though. I think it could have been fine if they had skipped the whole part with the aliens explaining to David about the whole she can only come back for one day thing. First of all, it doesn't make sense. Second of all, the audience does not need that much information. And certainly to give it in dialog exposition was a show of weakness and Spielberg's tendency to underestimate the audience. I think it would have been more powerful if we had never actually seen David talk to the aliens, or if they had disguised themselves as the blue fairy and given him a lot less information. If you think about the ending Kubrick probably envisioned, it was probably a lot more along the lines of the ending of 2001 where you do not have any dialog and you let the audience connect the dots and draw conclusions for themselves. Spielberg is afraid to do this.All in all though, a successful film that combines Spielberg's talents as an emotive director who elicits empathy with a more adult story than usual from him.

This is a terrible adaptation of Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein or A Modern Prometheus. Except for the fact that there was a Frankenstein who created a monster from corpses and brought it to life, which then escaped and began terrorizing the countryside, there is almost nothing in common. The Monster is not the intelligent and murderous creature from the book, but rather a hulking brute. Victor (Henry, in the movie) does not abandon the creature, he doesn't travel to the North Pole to hunt it down, he doesn't converse with an explorer who finds him and he doesn't die. Victor's Father, bride and everybody else who's connected to him all live, instead of dying as they would have in an accurate rendition.This, simply put, is not Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This is John L. Balderston's Frankenstein, this is James Whale's Frankenstein... this is a different story. This must be understood beforehand, so that no confusion can be made. This is different.That being said, this movie is deservedly a classic, an excellent and brilliant example of early-sound film. The direction is excellent. James Whale knows exactly where and when to point the camera, how to instruct the crew, what everybody needs to be doing. The acting is incredible.Colin Clive's performance is nothing short of perfect. He shows Henry's (Victor's) troubled mind, his romantic and sentimental disposition, and his descent into suffering as the monster runs free. He perfectly portray's Frankenstein's complex he's an over-achiever; he creates a creature that can revolutionize science and medicine, but it is beyond his ability to cope and comes to terms with the abomination, with his Foul Abortion. To date, this is one of my favorite performances in any film.Boris Karloff gives an equally superior and classic performance as the naive and innocent monster, a creature who through no fault of his own weaves a path of terror, death and destruction everywhere he goes. Wihtout words, he conveys the creature's every thought, every fear, every emotion, with only grunts and body-language to aid him. In fact, the timing of the film, on the advent of talkies, is an asset to the feature; just after a time when body-language was quite literally the only way that an actor could speak to his audience.The rest of the acting, while not nearly as incredible as these two leads, was far above average. While some of the parts themselves left something to desire, their performance and execution was utterly flawless. In fact, it was one of the all-around better acted films, as a whole, that I've seen.The sets were quite excellent. While it was always perfectly obvious when there was a back-drop, and equally obvious that this was filmed in its entirety within studio-walls, the sets were quite impressive. The windmill, Frankenstein's tower, the Baron's home... all of them were beautifully designed and created. The special effects, for the day, blew me away, as did the sound-effects. I was utterly surprised how much that they could accomplish with so little to work with (especially compared with today). The make-up on Karloff's Monster was marvelous and sickening; just the way that it should be. The costumes were fitting for the characters, and Elizabeth's (Mae Clark's) dress was simply gorgeous.The score (or lack thereof) was extremely minimal. Except for the beginning, I don't believe I heard it again until the end-credits. The sound effects, however, more than made up for that silence in the background. At times, silence was even this movie's greatest strength. It allowed the mob's shouts and the character's dialog. I believe that this is the only time I can say that no score ( basically what they had) was a wiser choice than more score.Overall, this is a classic and must-see film. It's the quintessential horror movie and a masterpiece in its own right. It has stood the tests of time despite not being faithful at all to the book upon which it's based.

To put it in the same category of films like Dead Alive and Evil Dead (both of which I love) seems a bit unfair to the term B-Movie, this feels more like a C-Movie. It's not Manos the Hands of Fate or anything, but it's still extremely crude film making wise. Years ago this would have been available to film enthusiasts who spent money and time track down a bootleg copy, but now, thanks to Jackson's current success, the film has been released to mass audience on DVD. It's nice that it's available, but unless you're a Peter Jackson completist or a very forgiving genre fan , stay away, this probably should have been left in the world of bootleg VHS.Those who are interested in Jackson would be better served by checking out movies like Heavenly Creatures, and the Frighteners. If you think you would like to see this movie, perform this test; first rent Dead Alive (which looks like Oscar material compared to this movie), if you can stomach that and want more then next you want to go rent Meet the Feebles. If you still feel the need to go back to Jackson's roots, by all means go check out this movie but be warned, these people giving this movie 10 stars are obviously hardcore low budget genre enthusiasts or insane, possibly both.

It was so badly made by the Cannon group and Sydney Furie! Even with the low budget it had to work with, I think a good director could have pulled off a more successful film! We have three Superman saves Lois Lane scenes, in the first film we have the helicopter scene which was edge of your seat suspense! and an awesome special effects scene in the pre-CGI era. The Eiffel tower scene in Superman II, almost as awesome! another edge of your seat suspensor, then we come to Superman IV, the Subway train scene, which I almost fell asleep through! come on Sydney! what were you thinking? If Richard Donner had made this film, it would have soared! The subway scene could have been suspenseful even on the low budget the crew was given to work with! So, you ask, why are you giving this film four out of ten stars? Because of the story, the performances of Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and the over all fact that I was glad to see another Superman Movie! The ideas that went into this movie were great! Superman tries to save humanity from itself! Perry White looses the Daily Planet to a competitor! Superman fights a villain created from his own DNA! If the filmmakers had anywhere near the passion for this material that went into the first two films then it would have been a very entertaining Superman movie! and it may have been the first Superman film to break 200 Million at the Box Office! But, it was not to be! I was hoping that there would be five Christopher Reeve Superman films and this film, sealed that fate! I have seen the new Brandon Routh Superman and I feel that the new filmmakers have a passion for the material, but the films story is weak! The special effects were top-notch and the cast is great! But I think the story ideas for Superman IV are actually better then the story ideas that went into Superman Returns! (However, it's good to see a Superman film in the hot 100 selling films of all time again). I would like to get all the film shot for Superman IV and find the special effects team for Superman Returns and get them to take out the bad special effects and re-do the Special Effects through CGI!

After I saw this back in 1984 in the theater, I went back and saw it probably 4 or 5 times more. I was only in high school, but I really enjoyed the set up and the execution of this smart, 'Jungle-Love' story. The real test is how does it do over time and watching it 21+ years later, it still holds itself in a practically perfect place. I know it was eighty-four then, but it just still plays out well, everything is still as it should be. It is amazing that the original role of the male lead was offered to Christopher Reeves (Superman) that would have been a whole different Jack Colten, character no doubt about it in my mind.Two convincing actors and a right on supporting cast, a location that is very odd for a romance to take place, however it takes shape along the way. You understand the story as it unfolds, and does it very well! The acting was vaudevillian at times and very 'festive' at other times, and made for an interesting combination. The 'adversarial' Ira and Devito's Character 'Ralph' was quite a surprisingly wise choice as an assistant Villain. For as much suspense filled activity, really great performance and dialog between the characters in this first, a second installment was made as a continuation of the story. This was 'The Jewel Of The Nile'. Now this with a few great scenes, set-up shots framed really 'smart' and the 'Jewel', his performance in the movie that was sort of a heart-warming, attribute, beside that what cooled it for me was, taking a natural order of people, and inserting American-pop music into their midst and trying to make as if it was all just happening that way. I didn't understand that. It may be small to someone else, but to me it is an authenticating problem. There was a change of directors for 'Jewel' as well and just a bit too much hustle and bustle, just kind of going through one tribe and nationality to another, then a 'scenery' change at one point, that if it was the same country and area they were filming in, it didn't seem like it was the same area once the change of camera shots had happened.

Brosnan's role sounded good, really good, so I went with my wife and a friend and we saw it one evening. This movie, was quite a wondrously detailed beautiful painting, emotionally enticing with sophisticated adventure. Truly I can say, it sparkled. This film was like enjoying a fine and expensive dinner with a nice bottle of wine. This just totally satisfied us. I noticed from early on, that the soundtrack was very alluring, almost sensual in nature. The musical artist 'Sting' performed the 1968 title track from the original film. Now remade with a stunning grace. Then at times the music kicks it up a notch and goes into an action mode. We really didn't stop talking about it for quite a while. The characters from, Catherine Banning (Russo) and 'Det. McCann' (Leary) and (Frankie Faison as) ' Det. Peretti' and of course Pierce Brosnan as the lead 'player' Thomas or 'Tommy' as friend to be Catherine would call him. But from an interview that I saw, truly I am of the same opinion that Denis Leary is when he said,I'm a big fan of Steve McQueen, but I think he was just miscast in the roll of Thomas Crown. I liked this remake a lot more than the original in 68. From the art galleries to Manhattan, the beautiful twin towers and all the city lights, where a tremendous addition to this 'platinum story' directed by John McTeirnan of 'Die Hard' I & III and 'Preditor' etc. was one of those, have to be seen again and then down the line again, movies that just reminds you of style, travel, romance and all centered around Manhattan. This was a truly delicious tale of passion, an art lover, a business baron ...with a magician's talent for the sleight of hand, with a love's twist of fate.

At the end of The Fly, Geena Davis was determined to abort the baby, but now she (or rather, her character) is giving birth under the watchful eyes of the Bartok Corporation. Well, perhaps they talked her into keeping it.One thing that cracked me up was that smirking, sneering security guard. He was such a bad, one-dimensional character that as soon as he showed up on screen I knew he was doomed to suffer a terrible fate. It was confirmed for me when he gave the transfer and the video to Beth. I guess that's what you get for F***ing around with Bartok's pet freak he says with a smirk and a sneer. But Mr. Smirksneer pays a heavy price for being such a badly written character when Martin the Flything ejects a stream of burning fly vomit into his face, which melts off. The special effects boys had such fun melting John Getz's body parts in The Fly that I knew they'd bring the fly goop back for an encore, and I wasn't disappointed. That's what you get for being a smirking, sneering villain in a B horror sci-fi flick.Speaking of John Getz, I felt he was the only good part of the movie. He livened up the one scene he had and his character was pitch perfect, bitter over what happened to him, but able to crack wise about it. Stathis Borans didn't miss a beat. To this day when I see John Getz I can't help but look to make sure his hands and feet are still intact.Bartok's character reminded of one of those evil, mad scientists in old cartoons or pictures. He knows Martin will mutate, but instead of investing in barrels of Raid or a large fly swatter, he plans to use him as a means to world domination. You vill help me to discover ze secret to biological engineering, and zen I shall rule ze vorld! He pays the worst price of all, being mutated into the lumpen, hideously deformed monster. I don't know. I guess he deserved it after what happened to the dog, and for his plans at world domination, but it still turned my stomach. You think one person involved in the movie would say let's end with with Bartok dying and knowing he's getting better than he deserved. I guess that is one reason why I truly don't like the film-the ending. I like Eric Stoltz, don't get me wrong, but this film didn't do it for me. Of course, if you know any smirking, sneering security guards or fiends bent on world domination (Stewie Griffin, perhaps) and have fantasized about their getting a badly needed comeuppance, then you might like this film.I don't mean to offend those who might genuinely like the film.

Talk about that 'lightning' striking again!! It's Powerful stuff! He starts out in a slow and 'sober' manner literally and catches his first, second and then third 'Wind' through out the movie. As he crosses paths with a kind Samaritan, from Harlem... what a team! He (McClain) didn't even need a partner, but it works, explosively well, I think. The first 'Die Hard' was amazing, the second was better than a lot of other movies at that time, but not as great as the first, however, this one blows-back onto the scene. From the beginning, it grabs anyone with a 'pulse' and then works the story through and through, tightly weaving it and bringing wild-action and of course that famous-made McClain- 'attitude' by Willis and McTiernan the original directer and the best suited for this crack-action New York centered drama. Transferred from L.A. of course.With the pressure coming down all around them, McClain and Carver(Willis & Jackson) stumble around, back and forth a little and get their footing, (barely sometimes), but keep their 'Wits' about them and a sense of humor, just to survive and deal with the cuts, bruises and then find their strength and deliver some deadly blows to their adversaries, with razor sharp accuracy! This was better than I had hoped for, considering dreading most sequels. Abandoning my thought for them as just Hollywood 'looking for more money' in most cases. This series has come really far for me, considering that I thought the first Die Hard was gonna be just a 'senseless', maybe even stupid undertaking. Man, was I wrong! I enjoyed the respect for good original story and plot, that John McTeirnan -Director and the novelist Roderick Thorp had in working to make this one stay in the best of the best category of FILM. The only part that I would have omitted was the water in the tube pushing that 14-ton dump truck along and John, surfing it then grabbing that drainage grate cover. He would of had a crushed chest cavity! Altogether, that would have to be GOD helping John through that one, because I think that would be at the very least, a very complicated feat, even for the 'Terminator'.To any and all Willis fans even those who don't care about him...see the film!

Transferred from L.A. of course.With the pressure coming down all around them, McClain and Carver(Willis & Jackson) stumble around, back and forth a little and get their footing, (barely sometimes), but keep their 'Wits' about them and a sense of humor, just to survive and deal with the cuts, bruises and then find their strength and deliver some deadly blows to their adversaries, with razor sharp accuracy! This was better than I had hoped for, considering dreading most sequels. Abandoning my thought for them as just Hollywood 'looking for more money' in most cases. This series has come really far for me, considering that I thought the first Die Hard was gonna be just a 'senseless', maybe even stupid undertaking. Man, was I wrong! I enjoyed the respect for good original story and plot, that John McTeirnan -Director and the novelist Roderick Thorp had in working to make this one stay in the best of the best category of FILM. The only part that I would have omitted was the water in the tube pushing that 14-ton dump truck along and John, surfing it then grabbing that drainage grate cover. He would of had a crushed chest cavity! Altogether, that would have to be GOD helping John through that one, because I think that would be at the very least, a very complicated feat, even for the 'Terminator'.To any and all Willis fans even those who don't care about him...see the film!

What I liked best about it was the fact that The One was original, as far as the setting goes. The idea that there is a copy of each person in each of the many dimensions was original. Other high points included the special effects, camera angles, and stunts. All of these were brought together in the scene where Jet Li fights a copy of himself. However, there were low points in The One as well. For one, I thought that there was too much action in this movie, which somewhat ruined the plot. For instance, most of the movie was fight scenes, which got old after a while. However, since Jet Li is relatively good at fight scenes, that wasn't much of a problem. Another thing that I disliked about this movie was that it seemed like a stereotypical Jet Li film; all action and little plot. The One was almost exactly like Hero and other Jet Li films specifically because most of it was occasionally mindless action. Also, the dialog of The One wasn't great, and occasionally hard to understand, and I thought that the writing wasn't up to par with the special affects and stunts. However, with a great story, setting and ideas, this movie kept me entertained, which is what a movie is supposed to do. For that, I give it seven stars. If you like action movies with intense and good martial arts sequences, then you'll love this movie. However, if you don't enjoy action sequences, then The One will most likely bore you. To conclude, I say that The One was an original movie that is worth taking some time to see.

Yep. That pretty much sums up SIX STRING SAMURAI. It's quirky. It's B-movie all the way. It's wonderful.What we have here is a film shot on weekends on a minuscule budget in and around Death Valley, California. It also pays homage to many films; every Clint Eastwood spaghetti western ever made, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Night of the Living Dead and, of course, The Wizard of Oz, just to name a few.The movie was dubbed giving it a hokey spaghetti western feel that matched the production values perfectly (very low). The Kid in the film was a complete carbon-copy of the mangy little guy that follows Mel Gibson around in Beyond Thunderdome. There's a family of cannibals and The Windmillers who represent the slow brain functions from Night of the Living Dead. And then there are the multiple references to The Wizard of Oz (Just follow the yellow brick road).The story's focus is on Buddy (Jeffrey Falcon), a six string carrying, Samurai sword wielding bad ass who wants to be the new King of Lost Vegas. But first he has to get there. Traveling across the desert wasteland of the post-apocalyptic world, Buddy (who looks remarkably like Buddy Holly) has to slash, punch, and scratch his way toward The Emerald City (another Wizard of Oz reference that we see, Lost Vegas looking very much like the gateway to Oz's hometown). Along the way Buddy picks up The Kid, a young boy who's mother was killed by humans resembling troglodytes. The Kid doesn't speak (initially) and only screams\/moans whenever he wants Buddy's attention. But The Kid is good with mechanical objects (cars, motorcycles, bicycles) and the two form a grudging relationship as they travel together. The only issue between them is Buddy's priceless guitar which he nurtures more than The Kid ...in the beginning. But Buddy can play his six string as potently as he can don his sword, giving him a good shot at becoming the King of Lost Vegas.On Buddy and The Kids' tail, however, is Death (represented as the four horseman of the apocalypse ...but without their horses). Death wants to be\/remain the King and kills anyone who gets in his way, leaving a lot of rock-n-roll wannabes as corpses. And in front of Buddy and The Kid is the Russian Army (Oh! Did I forget to mention that the USSR took over the U.S. after it nuked us in 1957?) After much bloodletting, Death and Buddy have their day on the sand. First comes a guitar duel (Death wields a wickedly good six string himself!), then the sword. But what will happen if Buddy wins? Can he be a true father-figure to The Kid? And what would happen to The Kid if Buddy died? Would Death take the little tike, too? There are A LOT of well choreographed fight sequences (perhaps one or two too many). The camera work was done with an eye toward professionalism, never being herky-jerky or under -over exposed. The acting was okay. And the story was so ridiculous that suspending disbelief was quite fun. The dialogue often set the tone for the entire production, giving us some great bits like...Death You have failed me for the last...hey, nice shoes. Then we watch Death kill the men wearing the shoes and walk away with new footwear.The musical score is also pulled off well. The Red Elvises leant their music and themselves for the production (they are the ones with the nice shoes mentioned above). Their musical numbers reminded me very much of The Stray Cats (a band I liked).If you don't mind low production standards but enjoy spoofs with a good, if somewhat ridiculous, script, then slip this little B-flick into your DVD player and bask in its foolishness.

Christopher Reeve is simply an incredible Superman - he's charismatic and cool in costume, pleasantly dorky and fun as Clark Kent, and he has just the right iconic and handsome (but not too sexy) look. The rest of the casting is top-notch as well. Marlon Brando classes the joint up, of course, and Gene Hackman is awesome if not comic-accurate as a zany Lex Luthor. (I know Kevin Spacey was more dangerous in the new movie, but he just wasn't as cool!) Margot Kidder is lots of fun as Lois Lane, but somehow seems weird to me, sort of like an alien bird or something.I also like the first half of the movie, which is played very straight. The scenes on Krypton are pretty mysterious and cool (also cheesy these days, but for me that's a bonus!) Maybe better still is the segment when Superman grows up, which is also very serious. Casting Glenn Ford as Pa Kent was another inspired notion.The film falters a bit, for me, when the action shifts to Metropolis. I think my problem is that the whole tone changes radically. The beginning is so serious, but once you hit Metropolis you've got wacky Clark Kent, wacky Lois Lane, wacky Jimmy Olsen, and wacky Perry White, not to mention wacky Luthor and his wacky henchmen. That's a lot of wacky to cope with. I don't mind too much because a lot of the jokes are funny - but it just doesn't fit with all that dignified stuff on Krypton.Thankfully, Luthor's evil plan is very compelling, and well-realized with the help of some cool model effects. (The collapsing dam is especially neat.) Some of the other effects don't work as well, but on the whole this looks good for its time.So which superhero movies do I think might be better? I'd say various Spider-Man and X-Men films give this a run for its money, as does Batman Begins. But I do acknowledge that Superman is the ultimate iconic comic book character, so his movie has a mythical aura that's missing from the others. That said, the guy's kind of boring, ain't he?

However, this film is not without it's flaws. In fact, they're quite numerous. But an excellent set design and Bela Lugosi's performance are really what make this film what it is.The acting in this movie hits a very wide spectrum, and ranges from brilliant to terrible, although mostly staying within the realm of average. Bela Lugosi, who plays Dracula, gives and absolutely classic performance in this movie. His accent is perfect, and his slow, steady and very deliberate deliverance of his lines are flawless. He captures the essence of Dracula, the very core of evil.Dwight Frye, however, was terrible. He gives, easily, one of the worst and over-acted performances that has ever been captured on film. Everything he does is so over-the-top that it ruins the character. He so obviously tries to act crazy that he just comes off as laughable on screen.The rest of the acting was rather average. Edward van Sloan, who plays Van Helsing, gives the only other memorable above-average performance in this movie. He knows his character, and portrays him as he should be, a little underacted while still giving off a commanding presence.The direction of this film is atrocious. The shots that are meant to be serious are comical, the ones that should be horrific barely manage to touch the viewer. A ridiculous amount of time is devoted to Lugosi's eyebrows, and seriously subtracts from this film. If James Whale, instead of Tod Browning, had directed this movie I have no doubt that it would rank at least a full point higher. As it stands, though, the direction does nothing but get into the film's way.The set designs are simply superb. Count Dracula's castle is powerful and atmospheric. While it's not as the book describes it, it does much to add to the film's tone and charm. The Harker's home has a wonderful classic touch to it, and looks just as one would expect a Victorian estate to look; impeccable, proper and richly decorated.Except for the beginning, there is no musical score in the entire movie. I'm inclined to think that this might be, perhaps, due to it being 1931 (only four years since the first sound motion picture, The jazz Singer). After watching Frankenstein (1931), I'm even more sure of this. But this is still one of the film's greatest downfalls. The utter silence throughout the entire film brings focus to every excruciating little detail throughout, and brings out every flaw and every imperfection. Every moment stretches exponentially, and every minor defect is exaggerated more than it should be.

However, this film is not without it's flaws. In fact, they're quite numerous. But an excellent set design and Bela Lugosi's performance are really what make this film what it is.The acting in this movie hits a very wide spectrum, and ranges from brilliant to terrible, although mostly staying within the realm of average. Bela Lugosi, who plays Dracula, gives and absolutely classic performance in this movie. His accent is perfect, and his slow, steady and very deliberate deliverance of his lines are flawless. He captures the essence of Dracula, the very core of evil.Dwight Frye, however, was terrible. He gives, easily, one of the worst and over-acted performances that has ever been captured on film. Everything he does is so over-the-top that it ruins the character. He so obviously tries to act crazy that he just comes off as laughable on screen.The rest of the acting was rather average. Edward van Sloan, who plays Van Helsing, gives the only other memorable above-average performance in this movie. He knows his character, and portrays him as he should be, a little underacted while still giving off a commanding presence.The direction of this film is atrocious. The shots that are meant to be serious are comical, the ones that should be horrific barely manage to touch the viewer. A ridiculous amount of time is devoted to Lugosi's eyebrows, and seriously subtracts from this film. If James Whale, instead of Tod Browning, had directed this movie I have no doubt that it would rank at least a full point higher. As it stands, though, the direction does nothing but get into the film's way.The set designs are simply superb. Count Dracula's castle is powerful and atmospheric. While it's not as the book describes it, it does much to add to the film's tone and charm. The Harker's home has a wonderful classic touch to it, and looks just as one would expect a Victorian estate to look; impeccable, proper and richly decorated.Except for the beginning, there is no musical score in the entire movie. I'm inclined to think that this might be, perhaps, due to it being 1931 (only four years since the first sound motion picture, The jazz Singer). After watching Frankenstein (1931), I'm even more sure of this. But this is still one of the film's greatest downfalls. The utter silence throughout the entire film brings focus to every excruciating little detail throughout, and brings out every flaw and every imperfection. Every moment stretches exponentially, and every minor defect is exaggerated more than it should be.

The Crow wasn't (and still isn't even despite the film) a successful or very well-known comic book character. However, the dark atmosphere, story and tone of the movie was a hit with fans and served as inspiration for many superhero flicks that wanted to transition to a much darker side. Additionally, a lot of the buzz around Brandon Lee's death in the film also attracted so many to the flick, since it was an extreme travesty that was a once in a lifetime occurrence.So despite Brandon Lee, there was a sequel made, hoping to cash on the wild cult popularity of the original, dark and moody Gothic flick. City of Angels really does only one things good here. It definitely captures the spirit of the first Crow and didn't butcher it too bad like some sequels do (Batman Forever ring a bell?). The dark settings, the creepy atmosphere, it's all there in it's gloomy Gothic glory. However, once you get past the fact that you're in the Crow's world, everything goes south pretty quick. And I mean real quick.First of all the acting is atrocious. Maybe it's the acting or maybe it's the script, but it's probably a combination of both. Vincent Perez sure doesn't capture the spirit of the Crow character completely, but then again, this a wildly different character from Brandon Lee's in the first film. He doesn't need to be Brandon Lee, so I didn't care if his personality was different. However, Perez nor anybody involved in the film didn't understand that, and they tried so hard to emulate a character like Brandon Lee that they just did a laughable job and Perez suffered because of it. Kershner and everybody else were awful as well, but then again, maybe it was the script. It was almost as if i was watching the first crow done again, seeing the same characters trying to play roles similar to ones in the first movie, only this is supposed to be a sequel, not a remake. Somebody didn't tell the dircetor that i guess.If the acting is bad enough, things still go sour. The story is a mixed up piece of trash. It was okay at first, I liked the idea of a man getting revenge because of a slain son, but the whole film detracts from that idea and tries to capture a superhero good vs. evil thing. The only thing, it does a poor job doing that. So instead of getting a simple story, which the first crow did, and did well, we get a whole crow mythology which isn't developed enough and only falls flat on its face. If anything, this film should've stuck to either one story the revenge of his son or the mythology of the crow, because combining the stories only left with a muddled plot that seemed rushed and corny beyond belief.I wanted to like the Crow City of Angels. I loved the first movie's plot, its atmosphere, the bizarre world that seemed to blend fantasy and reality oh so well. Unfortunately, while it does a good job capturing the first film's atmosphere, everything is a mess, a glorious mess of when a director goes too far in order to recreate something that doesn't need to be recreated. All the City of Angels really needed to be for me was its own movie with its own story, its own style. Unfortunately, I didn't get that, only a pile of muck that has sunken the Crow comic and character only deeper into mediocrity.

However, very recently I re-visited this film while it was making a glorific return via cable TV and am now more cognizant of the incredibly diverse layers of psycho-dynamic dissection one could perform on the characters, especially the main ones, of this film. Since then, I have written intently on various ICM message boards, trying to sort and clarify the incredible amount of controversy and confusion this film sometimes elicits. One thing is for sure even though this film has been billed in various circles as being a comedy, nothing can be further from the truth. This piece is one of the purest dramatic character studies set on film - truly a masterpiece. Many people can easily be turned off, even repulsed, by the frat-like shenanigans the two lead male characters attempt to pull off in the film. However, if you can get past this most superficial perception of the film, you will find, in a stepwise fashion, progressively deeper insights of how human behavior is successively governed by innate human needs and emotions. Many themes and messages should be easily conjured by the viewer of ICM including, to name a few, corruption of power, psychological control and manipulation, and the accountability and culpability of human behavior. People could debate ad nauseum who the most evil character of the film was - and interestingly, in a very uncharacteristic-of-a-film way, all would be right. The main characters presented in ICM are certainly flawed in various ways and certainly some have lost any semblance of a societally acceptable moral compass. LaBute goes to great lengths to make no bones about this; in fact, perhaps the only criticism I have of this film is that at points some the acting is a tad over-the-top but, in retrospect, I see now why this was necessary. I hope that people that get to watch this film (and, in my humble opinion, I believe every adult should watch this film, no matter what station in life they're at) will ultimately use this dynamic presentation to discern, at the most basic levels, what the human interactions portrayed in this film are all about. Biological needs and drives - preservation of the body by food and shelter facilitated by work and preservation of the individual genome facilitated by sexual relationships - are, in fact, the most powerful life forces on this planet (in front of the psycho-dynamic and socio-dynamic forces). Societally, we see intensely cruel and evil actions being perpetrated in this film which I'm sure most non-sociopathic people would agree are just that. However, let us not forget that at the most basic levels, humans are biological creatures that, on an individual basis priority, fervently work on self-preservation - whatever it takes. Sometimes, as portrayed in this film, this really involves extending beyond the bounds of what society would deem as morally and ethically acceptable.

Even if it was disgusting most of the time, it was superb. I don't like porno films, but You have to See the hole film.

All the characters are good, and I thought the flashbacks were pretty cool as well, plus Sandra Bullock and Ryan Gosling were fantastic in this!. Ryan Gosling was just so twisted in this, and I absolutely loved it, and Michael Pitt was great as the somewhat innocent accomplice, plus the only thing bad about the acting was that Bullock and Ben Chaplin didn't have much chemistry together, and looked somewhat uncomfortable!. It's got some decent twists, and Bullock did an excellent job of portraying a character with a haunted past, and proved she can do more then Romantic Comedies, plus the finale was quite suspenseful. Sure it's a type of thriller that we have seen before, but I still rather enjoyed it, however as I said I just wish the story was better at times, plus Gosling and Pitt had pretty good chemistry together!. This is a decent thriller, that at least kept me watching, with it's fine performances, however the story wasn't all that great at times, still worth the watch. The Direction is decent. Barbet Schroederdoes a decent! job here with good enough camera work, good angles, adding some decent atmosphere, and keeping the film at a fairly fast pace. The Acting is very solid. Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is fantastic here, she plays a character with a haunted past, and does it well, she got a lot of criticism for her performance here but I thought it was great, and it was different from her usual characters, and I also felt sorry for her, she was just fantastic!. Ben Chaplin is awful here, he looked completely lost and bored, and had no chemistry with Bullock what so ever, I was quite disappointed with his performance. Ryan Gosling is amazing here, he is very creepy and very menacing as the Killer, with twisted intentions, this guy is one of the rising stars, and has huge things ahead of him, he also had great chemistry with Pitt, I loved him!. Michael Pitt is excellent here as Gosling's accomplice, he is innocent, but is also very creepy just the same, and I also felt sorry for him, especially at the end, he did an excellent job!. Agnes Bruckner is cute and did fine as the somewhat love interest. Chris Penn does what he has to do adequately. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall worth the watch. **1\/2 out of 5 ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"27 July 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a decent thriller, that at least kept me watching, with it's fine performances, however the story isn't all that great.
