Basic problem with the series is that it limits it scope by always having to be tied to the Federation especially a ship and its crew. They are all obviously written to appeal to no more then a 10 year olds intelligence level.I can ONLY recall a couple episodes that perhaps stand out (God knows I have NOT seen them all - I quit wasting my time years ago) - Arena and Doomsday Machine (was that the title?). Arena astounded me as it is based on my favorite S-F short story by my favorite author...IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT REAL SCI-FI IS LIKE, READ IT SOMETIME AND IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FILMED EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.Roddenberry tried but obviously had to adapt it to the SFX and budget he had at the time. I give him credit for his occasional choice of good source material however.Anyway as for The Wrath... (I liked Mad magazines parody better (The Wreck of Khan). Gosh they really tried hard to make an exciting film (especially after the BIG disappointment of TMP) but alas...Does it make sense that the Captain (or in this case Admiral was it?), in fact supposedly the very BEST commanding officer of the top Star Ship of the Federation would carry around enough emotional baggage to keep 3 or 4 shrinks busy ( seems Bones was always psycho-analyzing him)? Man what a screwup! Conveniently violates Star Fleet rules at the outset and jeopardizes the whole ship and crew. Sheeesh.Overacting abounds in this mish-mash of space swashbuckling. If I was an actor, I think I'd be ashamed to admit I was in this film (or any others like it). This film is so full of illogical plot elements, flaws, and plain laughable scenes that I won't bother trying to list them all here. I take it there were no Academy Awards nominations for this film which tells you something. Talk about a clash of the egos - Kirk vs. Khan. Ricky Montalban overplays the uber-evil Khan to the max! God, anybody seething with that much hate inside would have burned himself up long ago. I think any serious actor would laugh their ass off when Khan (his face all torn to ****) looks into the camera and spouts From Hell's Heart I spit at thee!

Death is the ultimate unknown and the idea of it being a malicious presence should give way to a classic horror movie. However, anything that should have been good about this movie isn't, and unfortunately it ends up being another teen slasher, just with an invisible killer instead of some goon in a mask. After a relatively decent start, the movie descends into a routine, cliché ridden, teen horror movie with not an interesting character nor a frightening scenario in sight. The story follows a group of teenagers and their teacher (also a teenager) that survive a plane crash after one of them has a premonition and gets himself thrown off the plane. What then follows is a series of over the top death scenes intertwined with a boring 'investigation'.It's a shame that this film is rubbish as the death sequences aren't that bad. We've got one kid being strangled in the bath, another is decapitated by a piece of stray metal while another is mauled by glass from a computer monitor, and later a set of kitchen knives. However, it's all spoilt by the boring characters and silly dialogue (imagine 'death' is after you; would you really 'challenge' it with harsh language?). I'm all against remakes, but this is a premise I'd love to see tackled by a talented group of people. With a good cast, interesting writing and a talented director; this idea could be taken all the way to the realms of the horror classic. Unfortunately, the chances of anyone making a film like that these days is slim because all of these sorts of things have to be done with 'teens' (a.k.a. actors in their early twenties, playing teens) for teens to ensure that the film will sell.

Cast and crew were smart enough to put the whole horror genre into perspective a bit and therefore this feels a lot more like a light-headed spoof than a sickening gore flick. Ever since that dreadful Scream, the teen-slasher flicks are going through a revival and Idle Hands picks into this in a funny way with a very exaggerated plot, eccentric characters and outrageous situations. Devon Sawa (Final Destination) stars as an offbeat teenager whose goal in life is too sleep late and smoke dope. It takes him quite some time to realize that his right hand is possessed by evil forces that force him to kill. With the help of his stoner-friends (killed as well, but too lazy to reach for the light at the end of the tunnel), he has got to prevent that the beautiful muse across the street gets killed by the bloodthirsty hand. The storyline is ultra-thin but don't let that keep you from having a good time watching the well-elaborated gore effects and funny one-liners. Very creative (but especially comic) butchering in this film, as it for example contains one of the potheads getting stabbed in the head with a beer bottle! That same bottle than remains embedded in his skull for the rest of the movie, which is a pretty cool sight. There are terrific tributes to horror titles that featured the same idea of a murderous hand earlier (like Evil Dead 2 or Oliver Stone's The Hand) and an excellent soundtrack with songs from Mötley Crüe, Rob Zombie and The Ramones. The best acting performance is given by Seth Green who has an undeniable talent for comedy roles. And then there's Jessica Alba who portrays one of the most gorgeous horror-heroines ever! I've seen a few episodes of her Dark Angel TV-show but she definitely didn't this good there! Idle Hands is an overall okay film...not good enough to be named among the better horror-comedies but surely a lot better than the so many other pretentious spoofs.

I've never seen a film as original as Pulp Fiction. The structure of the movie is so creative, that it's hard to stop watching once you've started. This film is one that is very well liked among people everywhere, but some people don't understand it. The film does happen out of chronological order, as you may already know. Being out of chronological order makes it a little bit hard to follow, but having certain things happen at the beginning makes the film more involving the whole way through. (this part contains spoilers) Pulp Fiction is set up in three stories. Stories 1 and 2 do happen in chronological order, but the opening scenes are actually a few clips of the third story, which chronologically happens before the first 2 stories. If that was too confusing, this part might analyze the movie a little bit better for you. In the opening scene we see a man and a woman in a diner talking, and then they start a hold up. Then it cuts away to the opening credits. After that we see 2 mafia hit-men, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield(Samuel L Jackson) going to an apartment where they are supposed to take care of a few guys who stole a brief case from the mob boss, Marsellus Wallace. After that scene is when the stories take place. The first story is about how Vincent is asked to look after Marsellus's wife. The second story is about how a boxer(Bruce Willis) cut a deal with Marsellus and is being pursued by Marsellus's hit men.

I've never seen a film as original as Pulp Fiction. The structure of the movie is so creative, that it's hard to stop watching once you've started. This film is one that is very well liked among people everywhere, but some people don't understand it. The film does happen out of chronological order, as you may already know. Being out of chronological order makes it a little bit hard to follow, but having certain things happen at the beginning makes the film more involving the whole way through. (this part contains spoilers) Pulp Fiction is set up in three stories. Stories 1 and 2 do happen in chronological order, but the opening scenes are actually a few clips of the third story, which chronologically happens before the first 2 stories. If that was too confusing, this part might analyze the movie a little bit better for you. In the opening scene we see a man and a woman in a diner talking, and then they start a hold up. Then it cuts away to the opening credits. After that we see 2 mafia hit-men, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield(Samuel L Jackson) going to an apartment where they are supposed to take care of a few guys who stole a brief case from the mob boss, Marsellus Wallace. After that scene is when the stories take place. The first story is about how Vincent is asked to look after Marsellus's wife. The second story is about how a boxer(Bruce Willis) cut a deal with Marsellus and is being pursued by Marsellus's hit men.

Considering where the director was starting from, I felt she did a superb job. It is not for all tastes, pardon the expression, but as a director who has watched other directors turn the good Shakespeare scripts into really bad productions, I was very pleasantly surprised to see this woman turn chicken sh*t into chicken salad -- bad script into pretty good movie. She gets extra points just for having the guts to try something so crazy. The visuals, especially the opening, were superb. The editing of the script was well done too -- I know from experience how hard it is to trim down one of Shakespeare's 3-4-hour scripts into a quick, coherent story. I thought Hopkins' spoofing of Hannibal Lecter at the end was fun, and it is an improvement over the classical work he did when he was younger.For those of you undecided about Lange, here's a tidbit to remember -- in her most striking scene, in the beginning when she must deal with the death of her sons, she jumped into the shoot that day with no warning. They had planned to shoot something else that day, but technical difficulties forced a change of plan, so the production team asked her -- hey, want to take a crack at that mega-mother scene and see how it goes? --with glorious results. And I think her experience with Shakespeare was practically nil at that point. I've seen a lot of actors do a lot worse with a lot more experience and preparation time.

Then, once it did get good, and the story got interesting, it fails at about the point our heroes and their relentless nemeses decided to be too invincible. Harley Davidson (Mickey Rourke) and the Malboro Man (Don Johnson, hubba! hubba!) are the subject of our story as two loner heroes. Their rugged terrain in their Texas town, one that motorcycle riders and cowboys love--dirt roads, dust, etc--is being overrun by skyscrapers. Amidst their routine bar brawl and pool hustling, they learn that their close friend's bar, the 'Rock N' Roll Bar', is facing a tough financial crises because, with all the development in town, rents are on the rise. The bar owner's five year lease is now $2.5 million, and without it, his landlord is threatening to shut him down. So, Harley Davidson gets the bonehead idea that he and his buddies, including Malboro Man should rob the bank. Only, what they steal turns out to be blue bricks of Crystal Dream. The bank CEO (I guess that's what he is), played by Tom Seizemore, orders his three invincible goons in bulletproof Matrix-like trench coats to get back their stash--no matter what. Harley Davidson and Malboro Man think they're just going to hold the junk ransom and order that the bank goons pay $2.5 million and that will be the end of it. No way.****SPOILERS BEYOND**** There's too many far-fetched action sequences that for me, ruined the makings of a pretty decent action flick. For example, when Harley and Malboro stow away on a plane to Las Vegas, their trench coat-wearing nemeses still magically find them. Even know the hotel where they're staying and what floor they're on. Then, Harley and Malboro, having to run for cover on the roof, decide that it would be a good idea to jump off the hotel into a swimming pool. Jumping from that height into a pool of water would be the equivalent of jumping onto concrete. They would have never survived the fall. Harley Davidson and Malboro Man (except for the very end for Malboro Man) never ever get shot despite the fusillade of gunfire they always manage to step into. The villains always carry around something like Uzi's and the heroes carry around plain old handguns. But they never get hit. There's that part in the airport graveyard where, even though one of the guys is wearing the bulletproof trench coat, and Harley and Malboro know they have to shoot him in the head, they still pierce his chest with bullets despite the trench coat. The end is even more ridiculous as Tom Seizemore is hanging out of the window by the heel of his shoe. I was just starting to enjoy the movie before all of that happened. But, that's basically what you're in for. So, if you like a movie with bar brawls, pool hustlers, boobs, motorcylces, and shoot outs, and can still have fun with it, despite all of those incredulous flaws, then this movie is probably good for you.

It's full of little gems, like Mayor McKrinkle (Cliff Emmich) schmoozing his way into Chez Ernie and having his disastrous encounter with the Lobster Loaf. The two fedoraed hoods from Zeppco International proclaiming that Twine is yesterday &#150; Single-strand cord is today. William Hickey, in his last performance, as the dying Rudolph Smuntz, father of Ernie and Lars, a man who's passion in life has always been string and whose motto is A world without string is chaos. Maury Chaykin as the eccentric billionaire Alexander Falko, who wants to obtain the missing LaRue at a bargain price. Lars' wife (Vicki Lewis), who loved string when she thought she was marrying the son of a wealthy string magnate. The Belgium hair models (Debra Christofferson and Camilla Søeberg). Caesar, the demented exterminator (Christopher Walken). The stuffy auctioneer (Ian Abercrombie). Maury, the Cat Care Society employee (Ernie Sabella) who provides Ernie and Lars with Catzilla, the cat with a history of mental illness he was about to gas again. And, The Mouse, who is ably played by CGI, animatronics, and hordes of real mice and rats.There's some dark stuff here all right. The Cat Care Society scene could be disturbing to very young children and there is some mild (by today's standards) cursing.But, like I said, this is a cartoon for grownups.
