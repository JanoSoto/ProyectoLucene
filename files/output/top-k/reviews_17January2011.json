This one's no exception to that rule, although this is a harsher movie than the preceding three with little sense of the fun that was involved at least from time to time in its predecessors. In that sense, it perhaps resembles most the second instalment (Beneath ...) Roddy McDowell is back once again as the star, although this time playing a different character. Having been Cornelius in the first and third movies, he's now Caesar - the son of Cornelius and Zira, born during the third movie and hidden away in a circus. It's somewhat interesting to watch Caesar develop in this movie from the docile and uncertain chimpanzee at the beginning of the movie who's been taken care of all his life by circus owner Armando (Ricardo Montalban) to the leader of an ape revolution by movie's end. And that's basically the story.To the extent that there's a reflection on human society seen in this, it's to the institution of black slavery and the later Civil Rights movement of the very recent (to this movie) past. Apes, originally taken in as pets after a plague wiped out dogs and cats, were found to be much more intelligent and easily trainable to be servants, with their treatment becoming less and less humane. They become a seething mob of discontent, needing only a leader to organize them - and in steps Caesar to fill that role. I get the reflection. It's pretty in your face, and it makes its point in a fresh way. It also seems much too easy, mind you. The revolution begins and seems to end (at least in this little corner of planet Earth) on a single night. As a result, a movie that's already pretty short at less than 90 minutes seems to move at an even more frenetic pace than that at times. It's an extremely one dimensional movie. In all honesty, had I paid to go to the theatre in 1972 to see this, I think I'd have left feeling that I didn't really get my money's worth. The best scenes in the movie are the riot scenes, which take up the bulk of the last half hour or so. The riot is very realistic, but that so much of the movie is taken up with such scenes also means very limited performances for the most part by the cast.McDowell was - as always in the Ape series - excellent in the role of Caesar. His closing speech (as he vented his rage in front of the assembled apes and their now human captives) was certainly passionate, albeit perhaps a bit over the top. The human characters were less developed and the performances not as convincing. Don Murray as Governor Breck (I wasn't entirely clear on what he was the Governor of - did the United States still exist in this timeline?) and Severn Darden as Kolp - the head of security - weren't entirely convincing in their roles. Hari Rhodes was somewhat more effective as the Governor's assistant MacDonald, who's sympathetic to the plight of the apes, largely because as a black man he understands the evils of the slavery the apes have been placed in. But even MacDonald isn't front and centre enough to be a truly sympathetic character.Conquest is, I would say, weaker than its three predecessors.

seemed to have had trouble,trying to make Christmas\/New Years Day event films in a post-Lord of the Rings era (with the main exceptions being 2005s double bill of event films,with the first Narnia film,and King Kong fighting it out, lion v ape,and last years world conquering return of James Cameron,after thirteen years,with the sci-fi adventure epic Avatar.)In the meantime,Bollywood has been turning the end of the year event film,into a unstoppable juggernaut,with such films as the Mermento-inspired ultra-violence revenge thriller in Gujini,a gathering of (almost) every living Bollywood legend,in the fun reincarnation film Om Shanti Om,and a shockingly stunning mix of extremely strong writing,good casting,and an amazingly fast paced feel (even at a running time of over two and a half hours) with 2009s 3 Idiots.Sadly,this great run got stopped in 2010.with the comedy event film Tees Maar Khan,whose characters were just that little bit too annoying for most audience members to be entertained by.When I started reading up about Tees Maar a few weeks before its release,and I found out that the movie wad going to be a remake of a film called After the Fox.Since I have enjoyed watching some of the other great films that Neil Simon has wrote,and having always been entertained by some of the film and radio work that Peter Sellers has done,I was very intrigued to see what type of film would be made,with both of them working together..The plotAs news of a $3 million robbery of gold bars, reaches the ears of the (jailed) worlds best criminal Aldo the Fox Vanucci,He decides to tell the wardens that he is going to break out of the prison at 3pm!.With having stolen someones identity,Vanucci escapes the jail right under everybody's nose.When he returns to his old home,he finds the person who has set up the robbery,who needs help to bring the gold into the country.Although both men are able to work out a deal (with Aldo getting 50% of the gold)Vanucci also has to deal with the trouble of his sister giving up school,so that she can become an actress.Luckaly for The Fox,when he is getting chased by some officers who want him for the prison escape,he hides at a film premiere.Suddenly,a light bulb goes off in Aldos head,that if he pretends that he is a film director,making a film in a small town,he will be able to use all the local people and police offices to unwittingly help him transfer the gold!.Although,when he starts to make the film,The Fox realises that keeping his patients with the cast & crew might be even tougher then importing the gold...View on the filmThough the screenplay is not as strong as some of his later films,such as the excellent movie The Odd Couple,the first screenplay by Neil Simons is still filled with a good amount of fun material.With,parts of the film (such as the scenes where The Fox is trying to get a faded Hollywood actor to star in his avant-garde film.)showing some great signs of some of his future work.Whilst I was watching the film,one of the main scenes that instantly stuck out to me,was a scene where Aldo talks to the gold smuggle through the middle (wo)man,which I instantly recognised as something that was copied for the third Austin Powers film,although I think that Simons version of the joke is a lot stronger.For the avant-garde false- film shooting,director Vittorio De Sica,impressively always

Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who finds himself trapped in the small town of Punxsutawney, repeating the same day over and over again. Why Connors is forced to relive the same day isn't explained, but it is made clear that Connors was trapped in a cycle of repetition even before his never-ending day began. Projecting nothing but facile sarcasm, ironic self-awareness and aloof detachment, Connors is a thoroughly postmodern man, his life long filled with what he perceives to be pointless and mindless routine. But Connors is not a pessimist or self-centred, so much as he is super-aware, perpetually dejected and world-weary. For Connors, every day offers only what philosopher Francois Cusset called the dead end of postmodernity. Enchantment is thoroughly dead and everything that will happen has already happened.When Connors wakes up to find that today is, and always will be, yesterday, he is forced into violently confronting the fact that postmodernism conceives of contemporary life as a spectacle before which the individual always sits powerless, and within which questions of the real are always problematized. To the postmodern subject, there is nowhere else, no other time or place, the subject a ghost-viewer in a movie that plays regardless of his volition.At first Connors uses this opportunity to engage in pranks, hedonism and deceit, concocting schemes to amass money and bed a beautiful woman, played by Andie McDowell, but gradually these games start to lose their appeal. After learning that all the material and sexual gratifications in the world are not spiritually sustaining, Connors grows suicidal. He takes his life several times, but still the curse continues. From here on the plot becomes a mixture of the myth of Sisyphus and Dickens' A Christmas Carol (Bill Murray is essentially Ebenezer Scrooge), with a little Camus and Nietczhe thrown in. The film's existential avenues are best hinted at by a poem (The Lay of the Last Minstrel) by Sir Walter Scott, an excerpt of which Andie McDowell recites to Connors in a diner Despite those titles, power, and pelf, The wretch, concentrated all in self, Living shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down, To the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.And so gradually Connors relinquishes the Self. Of course contemporary neuroscience has now thoroughly undermined the notion of a Sovereign Self, but director Harold Ramis is a Buddhist, and Buddhism has long denied the existence of a metaphysical self. Buddhist's call this Anatta, or not self, in which it is taught that all things perceived by the senses are not really I or mine, and in which a line is drawn from the problem of personal identity to moral responsibility.A thoroughly changed man, Connors thus now begins to live each day to the fullest. No longer obsessed with moving on or possessing Andie McDowell, he instead helps everyone, acts selflessly, without ego (paradoxically an egotistical, if not impossible act) and uses whatever spare time he has to engage in various artistic and intellectual refinements (piano, ice sculpting, poetry etc). To his co-workers, Connors now seems like a radically different person. He seems reborn. Unsurprisingly, at this moment of transformation, the temporal curse is broken and tomorrow finally comes, though Connors now refuses to move on and instead opts to stay in Punxsutawney.Connors's transformation (which resembles the Buddhist Samsara cycle) goes against almost everything postmodernity teaches, author Jonah Goldberg says. Connors doesn't find paradise or liberation by becoming more authentic or individual, but by doing exactly the opposite. He learns to appreciate the crowd, Goldberg says, the community, even the bourgeois hicks and their values&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;and most of all by shedding his ironic detachment from the world. Unsurprisingly radical economists view the film in different lights - man trapped in an sociocultural dead end unless he relinquishes greed, profit and egomania - but such readings are byproducts, rather than intended.The film is regarded as a family classic in the US, Canada and UK, and is routinely played around Christmas time, embraced by middle-class folk the same way Frank Capra's sentimental morality tales gradually became inextricable from the whole codified spirit of Christmas and national image and values.

I knew the film was considered to be a classic by many, but I was interested to see whether it held up at all in the light of modern cinema.It does, and then some.This is astonishing, ahead-of-its-time film-making and quite possibly the first man vs. nature movie. Since then, our screens have been deluged with endless backpackers\/hikers\/teenagers on a camping trip get lost in the woods with psycho rednecks for company-type movies, but DELIVERANCE is, as far as I know, the first and best of this cycle (although there are many other low budget gems, like the 1977 film RITUALS).The movie begins deceptively ordinary, with a group of guys going on a canoeing weekend and bantering together. Not a great deal happens until the infamous, still shocking sequence, which is all about power and degradation and still leaves a deeply unpleasant impact on the unassuming viewer. From this second in, the tension is riveted up and the film becomes chilling, disturbing, and to my mind, utterly frightening. As director, Boorman is at the peak of his game, shooting his rugged locales with an expertly eerie eye and making excellent decisions during the storytelling (I loved the uncertainty surrounding the fate of a central character).Four well-known actors were picked for the film and boy, do they give fine turns. Burt Reynolds is the typical stock macho guy he's well known for playing, but he gives him warmth and a likability that shines through despite his hard-ass, egotistical behaviour. Ned Beatty starts out as a rather unlikeable chap, but our opinion of him changes once he undergoes a terrible ordeal and he becomes the most sympathetic in the film. Ronny Cox (best known as the bad guy from ROBOCOP) is the straight, out of his element guy, and Jon Voight is the film's hero &#x96; a man who must delve inside himself to rediscover his primal instincts.The film is superbly shot throughout, the sense of menace is overwhelming, the plot is thoroughly engaging and the twists and turns always surprising.

One of them finds tapes containing old interviews with a woman, who had multiple personalities, and starts listening to them. Meanwhile, the usually calm, reliable family man in the group seems to be working his way up (or down?) to a nervous breakdown.The asylum interior is kind of spooky, and there are some truly beautifully eerie shots here. So eerie, in fact, that the movie inspired the Silent Hill 3 creators, among others. Silent Hill does this good, though, while the movie had me struggling to stay awake.The idea is okay, but the production painstakingly slow and predictable. A couple of other commentators claim that this movie is brain candy, but my brain got bored after the first 10 minutes and decided that it wasn't needed to figure this one out.Here's where I start spoiling the movie - including it's ending - so if you don't want to know it, stop reading right here.There are some key things that completely ruins it for me The crew takes on a job that should take three weeks, but they promise to make it in one. This makes a good setting for a stressed environment, a good reason for family man Gordon to really snap, and it could have helped build suspense. But we never see them stressed. We hardly ever see them working. Instead they seem to take a lot of breaks, eat a lot of lunches, happy-go-lucky Hank goes sight-seeing in the basement, and lawyer-to-be Mike spends a lot of time listening to old tapes. So the general air is never pressed or tense - it's drowsy and lazy.We're constantly following the interviews between a doctor asking what happened that Christmas, and patient Mary (with alter egos Princess and Billy), who refuses to answer the question. Apparently Mary saw or did something bad in her childhood, and has suppressed the memory. The answer seems to lie with third alter ego Simon, but he doesn't want to show himself. It would have added a bit of mystery, had it been interesting.During one of many lunches Mike explains a procedure to make people more docile. It involves a long nail, and the loss of an eye. Recommended cure Sunglasses. All of a sudden, sight-seeing Hank finds a long nail, he meets a mystery man in the basement, and when he appears again, he's very docile and wearing sunglasses. It's so easy, it had me face-palming. The only thing we're left with now, is trying to figure out if the villain here is stressed out Gordon, or his work-mate, intense Phil. Not exactly a tough one, since A) Gordon, like Mary, is very secretive about what's making him feel bad, and B) Gordon is shown spending time both in Mary's old room and by her grave. It doesn't take a genius to understand that they're supposed to have something in common.As it, in the end, turns out that Gordon has killed not only all his work mates, but his wife and child as well (and suppressed the memory), we are also finally introduced to Simon, who is given the role of background noise.

Generally speaking, this third instalment of the series continues to do that - and, as in the first two - humanity doesn't come off looking particularly good. In and of itself, standing alone, this isn't a bad movie. Its basic problem is its lack of originality (although the very fact that it created a sequel to Beneath the Planet of the Apes - whose ending did look rather final - counts for something, I suppose.) Still, in many ways this is the mirror image of the first movie. In that, of course, three human astronauts land on a future earth rules by apes. Here, three ape-onauts (as they're referred to) land on a past earth ruled by humans - namely, our own (well, at least the world of 1973.) A lot of this is very similar to the original. Cornelius (Roddy McDowell, who returns in the role after missing Beneath) and Zira (Kim Hunter) essentially take on the roles of the human astronauts in Planet while Drs. Dixon (Bradford Dillman) and Branton (Natalie Trundy) are the Cornelius and Zira of this society, sympathetic to the apes and wanting them to survive, while Dr. Hasslein (Eric Braeden) is the personification of the evil human who wants to kill these intelligent apes (just as most of the apes wanted to kill the intelligent humans of the original.) So, aside from the ingenious way of resurrecting a series that you would have expected to be finished, originality was somewhat lacking. There are a few twists. Overall, human society seemed generally kinder to the apes than ape society was to the humans, and it's somewhat humorous to watch as at first Cornelius and Zira are feted as celebrities in Los Angeles. Overall, though, this really does have the feel of the original in reverse.It's not a bad story. It's a bit far-fetched to believe that the apes could have not only raised Taylor's spaceship from the original and learned to launch and pilot it, given that in the first two movies (which seemed to take place over a relatively short span of time) the ape society hadn't even invented the internal combustion engine. Yes, that's kind of explained by Cornelius' assertion that Dr. Milo (who accompanied he and Zira on this journey) is a genius well ahead of his time. Obviously!

And that is while he tries to free his wife Dora from the camp and giving his own life away at the same time.The day after, the Americans entered the seemingly deserted camp just as Giosué emerges. Hitching a ride on the tank from the American solider, Giosué soon spotted his mother and they were being reunited.It may be a fictional story set in a real-life scenario amidst the backdrop of a war, but the fact that the father would go all lengths to try telling his son that it is all a game and he will get his prize if he collects the points required to win a tank, it is very admirable considering of the situation the family is in. It is actually very heart-warming, with award-winning actor Giustino Durano who plays Guido reminding us why, life is beautiful.

I've found myself thinking about it often, pondering over the subtext of the film and seeing what conclusions I come to. Kubrick has created an abstract film where each viewer is left to their own devices to find meaning. It begins in the past, as an extraterrestrial monolith spurs our man-ape ancestors to use their first tool\/weapon. Thousands of years later, as man begins exploration of the lunar surface, a second monolith is discovered. It beams a powerful radio signal to Jupiter, leading to the next phase of man's interstellar journey. A mission of the utmost secrecy is dispatched to Jupiter. Two astronauts (Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood) attend to the ship's operations with the assistance of the advanced AI, HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), with three scientists in hibernation. Complications arise when HAL, who appears to have evolved enough sentience to feel emotion, becomes paranoid of the astronauts intentions and turns on them. Those who complete the mission will be catapulted into the next stage of evolution.I've gone years hearing about how epic Kubrick's film was. I'd tried watching it once as a child, gotten about ten minutes into the Dawn of Man sequence, and given up. It's certainly a rough watch for those with shortened attention spans. Kubrick fills his science fiction opera with long-winded scenes of slow-moving space vehicles drifting through their operations while classical music tinkers in the background. The dialogue is minimal and, with the exception of the Jupiter mission sequence with HAL and the astronauts, serves little purpose except to set the stage for the journey being undertaken. This isn't a commercial film meant to appeal to the masses. Kubrick has done what few others have successfully accomplished used the film medium to create a piece of art. Images and music come together to tell a story of mankind's evolution and where it might eventually lead. The story is hardly the traditional three-act structure audiences are accustomed to, and the characters are barely developed. That's because it's not the characters that are important here, it's the human race as a whole and a vision of our next phase in the universe. The characters are merely tools in the story, and don't really carry it themselves.It's a trippy experience and I'm not so bold as to claim I fully understand it. The entire final act of the film is a fantastic mind-trip of color, sound, and psychedelic visuals leading to an odd conclusion in a glorious bedroom setting. I hope to avoid spilling too many details and urge those who are curious to watch it themselves, not that my descriptions will make the end any more clearer. Kubrick has stated that each audience member is to draw their own meaning from the film and I see it as being that humans must transcend their reliance on technology to achieve the next stage of evolution. The astronauts' confrontation with the similarly-evolved HAL 9000 seems to act as a final challenge to overcome this dependency, as well as their near-equal in evolutionary terms. The entire HAL sequence is my favorite part of the film and will probably remain one of the most memorable movie sequences ever (particularly the last bit as HAL sings Daisy...it's so haunting...). As much as I want to share this film experience with friends, I'm aware it's not for everyone. Even with my intense interest in the film, I had a hard time sitting through some of the drawn-out sequences and the 2.5 hour run-time is pretty daunting.

With the exception of Short Cuts, these films tend to be very contrived, filled with strained connections and spending much of their time making laboured points about fate, fragility, coincidence and the interconnectedness of life.Though better written than its imitators, Grand Canyon does the same thing. Set in Los Angeles, the film glides gracefully across a set of characters, all of whom share common experiences despite their different economic strata, ages and racial backgrounds. Though at times unfocused, the film is ambitious and contains a number of well written sequences, including one in which actor Kevin Kline describes the moment a stranger saved his life. Another scene, in which a father and son share a driving lesson, is particularly beautiful. It points to life's precariousness, the way every mundane activity carries with it both risk and bravery, as well as the infinite number of little miracles which occur everyday.On another level, Canyon is a white, middle-class, suburban disaffection movie in the vein of American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Safe, Far From Heaven and Happiness, most of which were released in the mid 90s. Canyon, however, predates them all, and is resolutely upbeat. Where those films tend to end in violence, disillusionment and disaffection Canyon ends on a note of almost naive optimism. And while most of these films focus on a white, middle class, Canyon jumps from the staggeringly rich, to the middle class, to ghetto-trapped African Americans. Another distinction is Kasadan's direction itself, which isn't afraid to drop into surreal territory. The film includes several extended dream sequences, one of which recalls the Coens' Big Lebowski, another LA flick.Canyon indulges in two recurring metaphors or motifs, that of The Grand Canyon and that of permanently patrolling helicopters, the latter resembling the med fly aircraft of Altman's Short Cuts. Kasdan's point man is utterly inconsequential when stacked up against a universe that is simultaneously vast, beautiful, horrific, malevolent and seemingly time-less. Elsewhere Kasdam's patrol helicopters offer a mixed sense of guilt, danger and perhaps cosy communal safety, the world presumed dangerous, but rendered navigable alongside the watchful eyes, or even miracles, of others.Canyon isn't as good as Short Cuts, but it is better than all the other ensemble movies and disaffection dramas that came later. In terms of flaws, all of Kasdan's characters speak the same, regardless of their economic standing. The film is also at times very heavy handed, condescending and has that typically overproduced look of early 90s Hollywood.7.9\/10 &#x96; There are a number of great scenes here, but the film can't sustain these highs.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 January 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Lawrence Kasdan directs Grand Canyon, a sprawling ensemble piece which recalls such films as Magnolia, Crash, Short Cuts and City of Hope. With the exception of Short Cuts, these films tend to be very contrived, filled with strained connections and spending much of their time making laboured points about fate, fragility, coincidence and the interconnectedness of life.Though better written than its imitators, Grand Canyon does the same thing. Set in Los Angeles, the film glides gracefully across a set of characters, all of whom share common experiences despite their different economic strata, ages and racial backgrounds. Though at times unfocused, the film is ambitious and contains a number of well written sequences, including one in which actor Kevin Kline describes the moment a stranger saved his life. Another scene, in which a father and son share a driving lesson, is particularly beautiful. It points to life's precariousness, the way every mundane activity carries with it both risk and bravery, as well as the infinite number of little miracles which occur everyday.On another level, Canyon is a white, middle-class, suburban disaffection movie in the vein of American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Safe, Far From Heaven and Happiness, most of which were released in the mid 90s. Canyon, however, predates them all, and is resolutely upbeat. Where those films tend to end in violence, disillusionment and disaffection Canyon ends on a note of almost naive optimism. And while most of these films focus on a white, middle class, Canyon jumps from the staggeringly rich, to the middle class, to ghetto-trapped African Americans.

Stand By Me is a must see, endearing film based on the novella by horror author Stephen King. It seems like it would take the direction of a horror movie, or get easily sidetracked, when it takes the route of an extremely interesting drama film. The drama in this movie is realistic fiction about four boys coping with extreme home life troubles, and their only source for hope is in each other.Can you guess why I wanted to see this? Corey Feldman. I wanted to see him in a young role, playing a kid or a teenager. I saw this pop up in the guide, but missed both showings of it. I feel so ashamed, and so much of an idiot, I feel like I owe the movie an extra two watches. I finally found the DVD at a used store and immediately picked it up. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, and Corey Feldman all as youngsters? Count me in! The plot Four boys; Gordie, the bookworm from a careless family (Wheaton), Chris, the stereotyped delinquent (Phoenix), Teddy, a boy who's ear was badly burned because of his father (Feldman), and Vern, a chubby, picked on fellow who means nice at heart (O'Connell). All have strict home lives as you can imagine, and when Vern overhears his brother talking about the location of a corpse who has been looked for all over town, he rounds up the gang and they walk to the location of the body.Along the way to try and find the body, the four friends gather more information about each other and uncover more mysteries about their home lives. They are each victims to both physical and emotional abuse. Gordie, whom is a good writer, is ignored at home, and is unappreciated by either parent. Chris' parents are alcoholic and in the nuthouse leaving him to be the subject of an unproven stereotype. Teddy's dad is a violent drunk who nearly caused Teddy to go deaf in one ear by burning it on a stove. And Vern's family is never really revealed, but is expected to be the same sort of deal.The film is narrated by a grown Gordie played by Richard Dreyfuss. His voice adds a nice tone to the film, and adds to the film's creepy and unsettled atmosphere. It's such a unique addition. Plus this film makes me wish I had more friends that I could do activities like this with. That sounds like cliché #1213 when writing a review about a group of childhood boys, but I feel like I've missed out and I'm only fourteen. When a film makes you feel old and make you look like you've not done a thing with your life, by showcasing characters who are young and adventurous who are not to far off from your age is a pure accomplishment. What other movie has done that and succeeded as well as this? Without a doubt this is my favorite Stephen King movie adaptation. My favorite was previously Christine, but this takes the cake for being a very emotional and eventful King film. Wil, River, Corey, and Jerry all give their performances of a lifetime in this movie that maybe twenty-four years old, but still is recognized today. It may be one of a kind, but it makes me cry like many.Starring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and Kiefer Sutherland. Directed by Rob Reiner.
