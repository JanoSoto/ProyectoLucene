Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie- yes, a RAPPING genie- where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits, all ending in him in a Christ-like pose with lots of light surrounding him. So, yeah, expect really cheesy bits, including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky (and, regrettably, not knocking out the two main characters, particularly the kid). What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O'Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy! The main plot of the film involves this kid, played in that all-too-typical and annoying-kid fashion by the great-grandson of Frank Capra (where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily), who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom-box. Then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the Shaq-genie his quasi-slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady-gang-type absentee father.This really sappy, contrived son and father story would be bad enough, as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies (i.e. the two chances in life speech from father to son). But it's Shaquille O'Neill who is both the reason to watch the film (ironically), and the obvious sinking crux of it all. His plot line involves him, when not getting the over-talky treatment from Capra, to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career. On top of this, he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom-box. So is there a camp factor to the movie? Up to a point, but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and 'heart-felt' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material. One might ask if the people making the movie, who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon, if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing. I'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid. But I'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaq-machine.So, if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genie-turned-rapper-turned-wisecracker, all the more fun to you. Hell, it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel. But if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells, stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996, and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's.

OK, so she doesn't recognize him, maybe, but why shoot the poor guy who is in no way threatening, just a sad, pleading face on the dance floor. Explain that to me. Sorry, I don't see it.

On one hand it's perfectly entertaining, but it's so bizarre and - to be blunt - utterly far-fetched and beyond-ridiculous that it actually kind of distracts from the entertainment value at times. The plot is so dumb - and the way it's handled - that suspension of disbelief is pretty hard.However, if you look at it as a realization of every teenage boy's fantasy, I guess it's all right.It's essentially about two 15-year-old boys (Ilan Michael-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who create a woman using electricity, a computer and a Barbie doll.This was my problem with the movie. John Hughes is usually great at character development and dialogue - but there's so little here. The setup is weak and the boys' decision to create a woman is handled waaaay too fast. And then the science behind their actions is ignored so much that it's almost insulting. The hacking of the computer mainframe that takes place during the Barbie doll's transformation into a human is classic '80s technology - they had no idea what a computer even was back then and as a result the hacking segment is basically an animated slideshow of cool images on the computer screen as Smith types noisily away on his keyboard.Their result? The beautiful supermodel Kelly LeBrock, who promptly takes a shower with the boys (their clothes are left on, of course, but hers are not) and then teaches them how to be cool, get girlfriends and so on.I was surprised by the amount of sexual content for a 1980s movie involving under-age teens. I've seen people say here on IMDb before that '80s movies couldn't get away with anything but that's not true. It may have been the Reagan era but this movie features 15-year-olds making out with a woman in her late '20s, sexual innuendo involving the woman (it's implied one of the two boys has some type of sexual contact with her during the first night), underage drinking, underage smoking, and then of course a classic scene that could never be filmed today - Anthony Michael Hall mimicking African-Americans in a seedy downtown bar.I don't mean to sound like a prude, I was just shocked at how much they got away with for a 1980s, PG-13 John Hughes comedy.The acting in the movie is decent. Anthony Michael Hall is a revelation, and his scenes as a drunk pimp in downtown Shermer are hilarious. He comes across as a true comical force, which I was surprised at considering he's not usually the leading man in films.On the other hand, Smith is poor - he smiles throughout the movie, even when he's supposed to be scared or angry. Maybe it was his first acting job and he was nervous or in disbelief, but it's kind of annoying.Bill Paxton is responsible for the movie's most memorable scenes. He is utterly hilarious and his scenes were usually the only ones I laughed out loud at.Overall this is one of Hughes' weakest films and it's probably because it was one of his more early directorial works. In terms of character development, The Breakfast Club reigns supreme. The dialogue isn't that great and the movie is too short and spends too little time with its setup. It's entertaining if you're not looking for anything of substance, but I think if Hughes had tackled this a few years down the road of his career the result would have been a bit more intelligent and memorable.

And, I need someone to explain to me how that little skiff with the rocket-powered engine kept right on scooting down London's streets, but no wheels were visible.The most impressive characteristic of the entire film is the many suits that Mr. Bond goes-through. Has it ever been explained how he affords them ? - never has any luggage ! I guess he has them stashed all around the world, huh? Am I to understand the pipeline had never been used to pump oil from way over there to way over here? So clean inside, but then I guess you really need to use your imagination for Bond films. I tried! Laughed a lot, anyway.........most admit I had to read some other commentaries to get even a smidgeon of what the plot was about; was there one? Some wrote about protecting a girl. The automated smart-car was pretty cool, but that cutter hanging from the 'copter was stretching it a bit much - however did they get it from country-to-country without it getting shot-down ? Oh - I forget this IS James Bond and you don't ask any questions.As I've written about other movies, it's just entertainment and I WAS entertained - still laughing. You see, I didn't actually buy this DVD - although the colors in it are fabulous - I got it as a bonus from a credit-card. So, it being free and funny, I guess I lucked-up. Has Pierce Brosnan done any other work? Might have to run him through Google........

Good or bad, this movie was wonderful and exciting - I just watched it to make certain I liked it as much as I thought I did.I also loved that other classic movie about subs - Das Boot, which had none of the wide-screen and surround-sound stereo features to enhance its great story. Although THAT movie showed us just a little too graphically how trashy submariners are when they're on shore (and some on the boat), I think they can be be forgiven that human characteristic IT WAS SO TINY ! Even the luxury of Red October couldn't entice me to join her crew. Too many OTHER submarines down in the water and torpedo's are much too smart, today. About the only comforting realization to be a crew-member would be that you'd feel nothing if a torpedo hit it. I don't trust the ocean even to float ON it - never mind for diving beneath it !! How tragic Das Boot ended so brutally.I don't think I'd like Harrison in The Hunt for Red October......not enough action for him. Eric Baldwin was just perfect for that role. Sean Connery - a little worn-looking from all his other action-films - was also perfect for Remius - Bravo ! I hope I'm right that Scott Glenn was the captain of The Dallas - he was terrific - as was Sam Neill, ET AL. The crowning cast-member, for me, was James Earl Jones - has he ever played a bad role ? One commentator was slightly rude to say nothing in the movie had mentioned his color - WHAT does that have to do with great acting? I saw the film when it was released in major theaters - that was a treat, but TV does nothing to detract from its impact. Another commentator said the VHS version was tacky - guess they didn't have the one I have. But, I'm serious about getting the DVD.......Hey guys !  am I the only one who noticed this goof? How did the rescue-vessel get onto The Dallas ???? It wasn't there when it surfaced to haul Baldwin out of the ocean. No matter - I'll overlook that.Yes, the cinematography was awesome - so, I guess John McTiernan (never heard of him) got all his business together to direct a masterpiece. With such an outstanding cast, perhaps he didn't have to do too much after all.

A lot of cities have been illuminated for freedom, (which looks now almost like a new trend, if you look at the former Soviets states.)

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"3 June 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Submission would be a good first word for the description of Wayne Wang's Chinese Box.John(Jeremy Irons),is a British photojournalist who lives and works in Hong Kong, and who is suffering from unrequited love for Vivian(Gong Li). With the approaching political changeover, John is feeling a deep sense of melancholy that is deepened when his doctor gives him some bad news about him having leukemia. The bulk of the film follows him as he makes one last, desperate play for Vivian. However, his attempt to win her over is doomed to fail, not only by the changing political tides, but by a series of dark secrets that emerge from both of their pasts. A subplot of greater interest centers on John's endeavor to record the life story of Jean(Maggie Cheung), a street hustler with a burned face. This pretty much sums up the plot.First of all let me say it is interesting too see Wangs view on the situation with China and Britain and their all time taboo Hong Kong. A lot of cities have been illuminated for freedom, (which looks now almost like a new trend, if you look at the former Soviets states.) Wang doesn't seem to really pick a side, weather it is for Britain or China, which makes it pleasant to watch.The issue here is the love story, which is the biggest barricade here. Although The actors are good, the plot just doesn't seem to be going somewhere. Some people might view this as a flaw, but it really is just a point of view, not so really much TELLING than SHOWING a story. there is a difference.Irons seems to be in his element (after M.Butterfly) and makes a good stand, in keeping up where the story falls down. Gong Li also makes a good impression, but she doesn't seem to have the same intensity as her processors in films like Farewell my Concubine or In the Mood for Love. Being the mistress of a rather pathetic Chinese salary man (I know that the term is Japanese but this is the best way to subscribe him). Not highly but of some level, and she fits nicely around Irons.Maggie Cheung, and her character is the one who is standing out in both story as well as in acting. Somehow it doesn't really fit in here, therefore it was a smart move of Wang to let it be a sidestory.Remarkable is the music by Greame Revell, who delivers a brilliant Chinese Score for this film. You can hear that he tried to find the things that made China what it is, and if you listen to the music then it doesn't sound like china, it IS china, if you understand what I am getting at (Revell isn't imitating, but he is recomposing). Nice sound design, and the song Reuben Blades sings when Irons leaves the hospital is just wonderful, with very emotional lyrics.The cinematography is at some points interesting but not of a high art. Wangs direction isn't brilliant, but it holds up. WHat makes this movie so good then. The feeling, and the lead actor Jeremy Irons.

The plot is paper-thin, the characters are shallow and lifeless, and the action scenes are pretty corny. For those of you who haven't haven't already seen the movie, the film is about two Narcotics Division police officers from New York chasing down members of a drug cartel.Of course, that only happens in the final half of the movie, because the first half of the film drags like a mule. The whole reasoning behind the uncovering of the drug operation is incredibly stupid. I mean, are we to believe that these two cops get jealous of an already convicted felon, then proceed to run all-night stakeouts on him? Do you realize how idiotic that sounds? Yes, they do uncover the operation, but it's only because of sheer foolishness on the villain's side. First, Alain Charnier deliberately leads on Doyle into realizing that he has shady motives, then he gets his hit-man to shoot Doyle in broad daylight! The much talked-about chase scene was good...back in 1971. Now, not so much. It's simply Doyle driving really fast down the street while avoiding vehicles. As for any other action scenes, they are few and far between.I also thought the ending of the film was a letdown. It only feels like the plot pulls itself together in (literally) the last 10 minutes. What, are we to believe that Charnier drove his vehicle, without anyone tailing him, to the warehouse to make the deal, and all the police were waiting and biding their time for him to come over the bridge so they could arrest him? How could they know that? It seems like the writers were just rushing to tie plot threads together, such as the shooting up the other cop in the last minute, and the title card ending.One thing that was impressive about the film was the acting. Gene Hackman and Roy Schieder give excellent performances for the threadbare characters that are given to them. We barely even know anything about these guys, and yet, the looks and actions they convey tell more than their words can even say. The supporting cast is largely forgettable, and I personally couldn't pick out anyone notable.There are numerous plot holes in this film. A couple of notable examples include how it makes no sense how Charnier's car is taken apart (literally, piece by piece), and then put back together in four hours. It also makes no sense how Charnier got away from the police who surrounded the building at the end.I am also surprised at some of the character's behavior. I didn't realize that you could put around-the-clock surveillance on someone that might not even be guilty, on the basis of a hunch. I also didn't know that you could walk into a bar, tell of the African-American patrons to stand against the wall, then berate them and call them derogatory names while searching them. I also found it funny how no one even cared that much when people were shot, even when it was an old woman or car crash victim. Finally, was Doyle even charged with reckless driving? Christ, he almost killed a woman and child, smashed into cars and shot a man in broad daylight. Unbelievable.On the upside, the cinematography is quite astounding, despite it taking up most of the film. Many of the shots feel gritty, washed-out and realistic, and, to be fair, there's none of that CGI stuff going around like in so many Hollywood films today.However, I refuse to believe that this film won a Best Picture award. William Friedkin should have handed it back to the Academy.Bottom Line I have a feeling people will down-vote this for being mean-spirited towards the film. I don't care. It's slow, plodding and yawn-inducing. If you like this sort of film, more power to you, but I could do with less of these kinds of films.

Once the Djinn grants the 3rd wish by his waker, he and his brothers (other Djinn's) are released unto the earth. If he can get that far...Wishmaster's a favorite of mine. The premise of the movie is really cool and shows off some creative thoughts as to how an evil genie could twist any wish into something bad. The main problem with the Wishmaster films is that the rules of the movie seem to change. For example, in Wishmaster 2 it is said that the Djinn can only grant 1 wish to people for their soul though the security guard in the first movie (played by Jason Voorhees' Kane Hodder) gets 2 wishes. The first he uses to get the Djinn to leave and then he has another to see the Djinn go through him. I just wish the continuity in these movies had stayed intact all the time, that may have made the sequels more worthwhile.An impressive note is that this film was only shot in about 4 weeks, maybe a few days more but that surprised me. To get this quality type of movie in such a small time is quite remarkable, reminiscent of John Carpenter's Halloween which was shot in just a few weeks.The actors did a pleasant job with the movie, especially Andrew Divoff who has the most evil voice to be heard on film (in my opinion). This brings me back to Wishmaster parts 3 and 4 where Divoff turned down the roles which brought John Novak in to replace him. Now, I must say that Divoff is excellent but a lot of people don't give Novak the credit in which he deserves. Think about how hard it is to fill Divoff's shoes with this role, not just in the acting but in the voice. I think Novak took the correct approach in his roles by making the Djinn sound more like a genie (he actually reminded me of a genie when he spoke) instead of imitating Divoff's evil voice.The music in Wishmaster is your usual horror suspense score, nothing too different in this but it sets the tone well enough. The special effects, although sometimes looking a bit too fake were adequate and satisfying enough. The gore in the movie was nothing short of fantastic though. Also the addition of 4 well known horror actors (Robert Englund, Tony Todd, Kane Hodder and Angus Scrimm) to the cast is a treat, if not a gimmick to gain a wider audience by using the if they're in it, it's got to be good trick. That also brings up the fact that the movie is not directed by Wes Craven though is advertised to make people think that he did without actually saying it.Wishmaster is a treat for most horror fans. It's got action, horror, suspense and gore to satisfy your needs. This is really a recommendation for all horror fans, I don't see how a slasher fanatic would be bored during the movie, or a gore-hound, or someone who likes suspenseful movies that have you on the edge of your seat.

If, however, you value character depth along with an interesting story-line, I suggest that you not spend your time watching this film. First, the characters in this film are very flat, all of whom embody the values typical of what the moderately educated middle-class place so high a reverence and desire for all things that, on the surface, seem worthy of attaining (money). More specifically you have the 'caring, yet bumbling Dad just trying to secure a future for his family'; 'the hot and naive teenage daughter', whom, because of her good looks, we are supposed to pity when she is unjustly assaulted by one of the ghosts ; 'the mouthy Negro woman who 'tells it like it is''; and, of course, 'the sketchy character of the family that cannot be trusted', namely the rich uncle.The story-line of the film is told before the backdrop of these lame characters. And as if the plot were not already predictable, it is then explained to the viewer TWICE! The result is devastating for the movement of the plot, as any interesting ending it could have had is laid bare for the viewer. The reason for this self-sabotage suggests that the makers of this film either believe its viewers to be completely stupid, or have no clear idea how to tell a story with an eye to holding the audience's interest. This is not a work of art as good cinema is, but just a collection of archetypal characters supporting a very tired and weak formulaic story-line. The special-effects are fairly good, but they can and never will be a replacement for rounded characters, an interesting story-line, and artful scripting. Leave this film on the shelf.

More specifically you have the 'caring, yet bumbling Dad just trying to secure a future for his family'; 'the hot and naive teenage daughter', whom, because of her good looks, we are supposed to pity when she is unjustly assaulted by one of the ghosts ; 'the mouthy Negro woman who 'tells it like it is''; and, of course, 'the sketchy character of the family that cannot be trusted', namely the rich uncle.The story-line of the film is told before the backdrop of these lame characters. And as if the plot were not already predictable, it is then explained to the viewer TWICE! The result is devastating for the movement of the plot, as any interesting ending it could have had is laid bare for the viewer. The reason for this self-sabotage suggests that the makers of this film either believe its viewers to be completely stupid, or have no clear idea how to tell a story with an eye to holding the audience's interest. This is not a work of art as good cinema is, but just a collection of archetypal characters supporting a very tired and weak formulaic story-line. The special-effects are fairly good, but they can and never will be a replacement for rounded characters, an interesting story-line, and artful scripting. Leave this film on the shelf.

In English, it means Me, my shoes have traveled a lot. So, just watching the opening scenes from the movie, where the camera zooms on Forrest's shoes, made me understand that Forrest Gump was that kind of guy, too.In fact, Forrest's journey began right after the end of World War II and it went on throughout all of the baby-boom generation events 'till 1982, where his childhood sweetheart, who became his wife, died of AIDS.But what Forrest Gump never understood is that any single event of his life would have been a lifelong dream for somebody else. Everyone on Earth would die for a single sight of the President of the United States. Well, Forrest personally met three of them (Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon) and he never realized how lucky he was. And that's a single element of his existence.Forrest Gump's character is played by Tom Hanks, a role which deserved him the Best Actor Oscar for a second-straight year (he won for Philadelphia in 1993). But it's very easy to understand. I think that Hanks' performance is one of the most brilliant interpretations of any kind in the history of cinema.Also brilliant are Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn, who play respectively Lt. Dan Taylor (Forrest's superior in Vietnam) and Jenny (the girl of whom Forrest has a crush on). While Forrest is a very lucky guy, Taylor and Jenny are mostly down on their own luck. Taylor lost his legs during the Vietnam war and after the war, he depended on the government for living and became an alcoholic. Jenny had the bad luck of having a cruel and abusive father and she met a lot of men who weren't as tender as her childhood friend Forrest was. She even became addicted to drugs during the hippie movement and she contemplated suicide for a while.But it's Hanks' performance that really makes this movie a unique one. Not only does Hanks put all of his skills into Forrest's interpretation, helped by young Michael Conner Humphreys,but the script is also a gem. It shows a character whose innocence is still a part of him, like if he still was a child. Forrest's IQ is very low, but his physical shape is great (especially in his legs) and he's led by his heart, which is as big as his own Alabama estate.Visual effects are magnificent. It's one rare movie that features state-of-the-art special effects in such a drama. Most of the time, this kind of effects are featured in genres such as action, adventure, fantasy or science fiction. I loved to see Gary Sinise without his legs and the feather movement in the opening and the closing scenes. But the most astonishing of all is the interaction between Forrest and famous people, such as presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, and also Elvis Presley and John Lennon.So, all in all, Forrest Gump is a unique movie. It's a great historical drama, featuring one of the most recognizable characters ever conceived and it's a very enjoyable showcase of one of the greatest historical periods ever. It means that I perfectly understand why did this movie win the Academy Award for Best Picture. However, this award should have belonged to Pulp Fiction...

I can't say that I knew a lot about this film before watching it and I can't say that I saw this earlier than this year (though I could blame that on the fact that the movie has been banned in my state for quite some time). What I can say is that this is an experience for all horror fans. I'm not implying that a slasher fan is going to love it, or a ghosts fanatic will too but this is at the very least, a one-time viewing for all of the movie-going public.From information that I've gathered, this film was just a bunch of friends getting together on the weekends to make a movie. I'm not sure if a script was present but supposedly this film was totally improvised whilst being filmed. Now, you may have just thought that I contradicted myself by saying that there may have been a script and yet the movie was improvised but I mean it in the way that there is a script with no real dialogue, just details on what kind of path the movie would follow. Technically, if they did have something like that, I guess you wouldn't call it a script in the first place. Let's just say that the movie isn't exactly the works of Shakespeare but works well enough for the film that it is.All of the acting is campy and not all that serious. I don't think anyone really needs to question the acting in the first place as it's not really required and would have probably been a lot worse if taken into the serious approach. I'm not sure if these guys have acted in anything else, possibly just small films that aren't backed by major studios but gt a thumbs up in my book. Peter Jackson playing the main role in the film as Derek kind of surprised me. I can't say that I'm a huge fan of Jackson's work in movies such as The Lord Of The Rings or even Braindead\/Dead-Alive (not to say this movie didn't have its moments) but I can certainly see why he got so famous.All of the gore is lovely to watch and is presented in a more comical manner. It's not the type of film I'd go Ughhh! at (do I do that to any film?) though the more relaxed viewer may find the gore highly disturbing. I can see why and don't blame them, though they deserve it for not keeping a healthy horror movie diet.Overall, the movie is pretty good.
