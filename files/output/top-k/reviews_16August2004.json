I'll try to do so without revealing too much - don't want to ruin someone's initial viewing, but if I do this inadvertently, please forgive me- hence the SPOILER ALERT.Charlie is a gay man, coping with the death of his lover, Chris, killed before his eyes by thugs, with Charlie being restrained and prevented from helping. He carries the guilt with him that he could not protect his lover. He recognized a tattoo on the arm of the killer and suddenly remembers cruising him. He has (oddly enough) chosen not to reveal the man's identity to the police - he wants to take his vengeance on him personally. (You may ask why the gang left him alive if they knew he could identify them, but that's a plot point I cannot resolve).So begins a journey of a Ulysses in Nighttown as he seeks stories from the flotsam and jetsam of humanity he meets while searching for Dean, the identified killer- a hunk of a beast who delights in abusing women and gay men. The odd assortment of types he is thrown up against - or manages to avoid are a woman who seduces men, drugs them, and then cuts out one of their kidneys (a particularly gruesome and disturbing piece that opens the film); a woman who pays a bartender to expose himself, a homeless brain-damaged man, a friend who is dying of AIDS, a woman who places her wet poodle in a microwave to dry it (wrong move!), a straight couple he taunts at a bar, a bisexual tease he follows to a belligerent sexual encounter, etc.When he finally finds Dean, he begins a cat and mouse game, befriending the man while not revealing his gay identity, as he learns more and more about the hateful and abusive monster who killed his lover. Finally, he has him at his mercy, knife in hand, in an abandoned field.What makes this film so engrossing is the exceptional direction of Jon Shear, although the excessive violence left me quite queasy and disgusted, and the trio of exceptional performances - Dan Futterman (reminding me so much of Ben Gazzara), Samuel Ball, and Matt Keeslar.The romantic scenes between Futterman and Keeslar (in flashback and particularly in one set in a white heaven after life - a dream- a hallucination???) are amazingly palpable. You feel as if you are a voyeur allowed in to the most intimate of moments. How these actors achieved this connection is astonishing. Keeslar is strikingly handsome with a personality that is gentle and kind. He lets us FEEL Futterman's emotional pain at his loss by making us fall in love with him too. Ball is like an accident - incredible bone structure, containing a loathsome soul - you want to turn away, but you're fascinated to see if some part of him is redeemable. Lothaire Bluteau delivers an exceptional turn in a small role as a homeless man, Charlie befriends. Likewise, Alan Cumming is unforgettable in one scene. We wanted to see more of him. Christopher Bradley appears all too briefly in two scenes - barely a minute on screen.Futterman's emotional breakdown in the white room, confronting a lover who no longer exists, is so heartbreaking, you'll be in tears if you haven't gone there already.This is an incredibly powerful film - very hard to take - have the fast forward button handy during the violent scenes if need be. I can guarantee one thing- the images will stay with you - you'll never forget it.

I remember seeing it at the cinema in 1996 instead of the film I'd originally intended to see, because of some technical error. I wasn't really looking forward to this, however the movie completely surprised me. It's a wonderful story, based on actual historical events. James Horner's spirited soundtrack adds depth to the film. The animation isn't on a par with the Lion King or other Disney, but it has its charm. *SPOILER*Balto is an outcast in Nome, Alaska. Half-wolf, half-dog, he doesn't know where he belongs. Ridiculed by other dogs and viewed with suspicion by humans, his only friends are a goose and two polar bear cubs. But he befriends a husky named Jenna who can see Balto for what he really is a true hero, selfless and brave. The defining moment in this movie has to be the part where Balto comes face to face with the white wolf, and finally faces up to his lupine heritage. A wonderful film for the whole family.

While not everything in this movie is original, there are some interesting twists on the way things were filmed.  SPOILER ALERT!!!  Like when Ice T sets up Charles Dutton.  I knew what was going to happen (when the bike blew up) but was totally shocked by the way it was presented.  I didn't see Hard Target, which others have compared to this film, but I certainly enjoyed and believed all the characters.  One person mentioned the inability of the particular gun used to shoot down a tree.  That's not what I consider 'common knowledge' and it doesn't diminish my opinion of the film.  I was totally shocked to find that Roc and the others were simply cold blooded killers.  However, I only glimpse trailers and skim reviews before seeing a movie so I'll be surprised.  I always chuckle at those who read entire reviews beforehand and then say the movie is predictable.  -) ","genre":null},{"date":"16 August 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I actually bought this movie a few years ago before I knew it would become a TNT classic.
