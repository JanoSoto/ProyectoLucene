This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of Shakespeare's play, but Branagh didn't do it just because it was there. His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain.The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well, it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps immensely when you're watching a four-hour movie. Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of 'Hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor\/writer\/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with 'Henry V.' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. Let's face it, 'Hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before, he or she needs help even if they've read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.There are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney, and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn't, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist.Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie, but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle's score? No doubt I did. I'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet,' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.

But people just can't seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film make.After *that*, we get yet another version of a tired, clichéd mission movie, filled with your usual stereotypes reminiscing about the good ol' days before this all ever happened, doing whatever it takes just to get home, blah, blah, blah.

Oh, I forgot, it was the Americans that won the war (flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sad).The middle of the MOVIE is incredibly boring.  Pointless, predictable set-pieces are tiresome.  The scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home (the medic talking about his mother, Ryan talking about his brothers, etc.) are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentality.Then there's the final battle.  Outnumbered, the men revert to primitive tactics (a bit like Predator).  Quite unbelievably, this lengthy fight is incredibly boring, and the one at the end of Young Guns is far better.5 Oscars?  Obviously due to the beach landing bit, they are mostly undeserved.  Best Director - should have been Peter Weir, or Terence Malick. Best Cinematography - John Toll for The Thin Red Line, without any doubt in the world.  Editing - Out Of Sight deserved this even more than The Thin Red Line.  I suppose the two sound awards are justified.For people to call this the Greatest War Film Of All Time is just wrong. The best is Apocalypse Now.  This is not the best World War Two film either - Das Boot is.  This can't even be described as the best D-Day\/Normandy beach landings movie either - The Longest Day kicks its a**.   To go even further - this is not even Spielberg's best war film.  Schindler's List is superior.To summarise - great beginning, but the rest sucked.  If you haven't seen it, don't bother.  Or, if you insist, watch the beginning, then leave\/press stop.  You'll be doing yourself a big favour.

It made them physically ill.  I stayed and I don't know why. The film disturbed me in the most non-constructive way I ever thought possible.  It was pure shock with no value and no comic relief.  I found it completely impossible to relate to any of the characters.  The only redeeming quality to this film is that krarma ends up getting everyone in the end.

Aliens was the most popular part, but the one I didn't like because I just experienced it as very boring all in all. Alien³ was very dark, but in its darkness it really had power. Resurrection is indeed much more suspenseful than Aliens, but it's just too obviously just stupid.It doesn't really seem to be a bad movie, because it is very entertaining. It's gloomy, creepy, suspenseful and very much action. But it's only visual, if you look at it as a puzzle, no piece fits the other. When it comes to a quiet scene and some dialogue, you get like paralyzed and Huh?, Explain?, Come again?... When you read a synopsis it sounds like it made sense, but... I don't know We get too much and no time to make something of it.The movie seems like very very much was just cut out and thrown away. There are many scenes that seem to indicate what kind of story should have been told. Like the one where the big alien creature seems to like Ripley because she's one of her kind. The whole Ripley with alien DNA idea was interesting, has always been announced and praised, but it's not worked out. Most of the time is running, facing the aliens, trying to figure out who is who and who is dead and who not, who is up to what. It seems like Jeunet wanted to tell a story, failed and did something different.As in all Alien features, the cast consists of (up to date) rather unknown actors. But in Alien, everyone was talented and everyone was to become a well-known actor. I hardly think anyone will speak of Gary Dourdan again, for example. The cast consists of Sigourney, Winona Ryder, Dan Hedaya, Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott (who looks a bit like Gary Oldman), many many un-known people and in one of the biggest parts one of the most unsympathetic and un-shining men in movie history, Ron Perlman. No good at all. Even Winona Ryder is just silly in this one.It's visually stunning, atmospheric but don't think, just watch! Maybe you shouldn't even listen.Oh, and I read that there was some irony in the movie, and I have to agree, there is. But there's also a lot of dullness therefore.

I have to admit I was frightened how I felt immediately at home, back in the Star Wars universe with the exact same atmosphere and aesthetics as all those years ago.Unfortunately the film doesn't maintain this magic evenly, it comes and goes. I'd have to agree with all those who've been disappointed by the kiddy-esque qualities of the film. The great kind of human rapport we used to see between Han, Luke and Leia for instance, is hardly in evidence. I felt shimmers of it between Obi-Won (I loved Ewan MacGregor!) and his master, but this story is about introducing us to Anakin, and in many ways we are in a child's world, so to speak. And yes, the rubbery alien Jar Jar grated on me enormously! He really eats up the screen in an unhelpful and overly 'cute' way that even the Ewoks never did. If I had been Queen Amidala, I would hardly have relied on Jar Jar for anything, let alone arranging a treaty with the other major force on my planet!And yet there's lots to love in this film too. When we do recapture that old atmosphere.. like in the climactic lightsabre battle! The scene where Obi-won is trapped behind the forcefield - well, that's my favourite scene. Very Jedi, very Star Wars, frightening and suspenseful. Accuse me of fidelity studies, but this recaptured some of those great scary traps-and-lightsabre duels at the end of Empire..General reaction to Darth Maul has been 'great! wish there was more of him!' I suppose part of me agrees, yet I think Star Wars has a great tradition of briefly experienced villains who nevertheless exude great threat and mystery by their presence. Boba Fett, for instance.

Seamless CGI, hectic laser fights on the ground (the 'Saving Private Ryan' part of Star Wars) and in space. Definitely at the expense of story and character, which was Not Good, but impressive and a technological feat nevertheless.Overall - there are some moments of greatness and charm in this film, and it was just exciting to be back in the Star Wars universe for me. But I wasn't there throughout the whole film - the childish aspects, some klunky dialogue and the deficiency of involvement between the characters made a disturbance in my force and would take me away every now and then to a much more mediocre and less interesting universe. Yet, what film could live up to this much hype, and to the hopes in my imagination after all this time?I was excited, but also disappointed.

First mistake was there.  Next, they chose a different actor as Batman.  Then, after Batman Returns sucked audiences down to the 10th level of hell, they tried to brighten their moods by making everything bright, colorful, and cartoonish.  The result is one of the worst movies ever made, Batman Forever!  I was repulsed by how astonishingly annoying this film was.  The villians always overact, and their makup is too ridiculous to be taken seriously.  A friend of mine told me this was good because it was more like the cornball comic books.  True, but does that make this a good movie?  Well, I'll make it short. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!  On top of that, the bright neon colors and effects, which were intended to brighten the moods of audiences who were put through Batman Returns, simply come off as annoying and off-putting.  Joel Schumacher is famous for overdoing the effects and colors in his films, so I'll bet he had fun doing this.  The skyscrapers are also overkill, in which everything looks like a druggy's perception of New York while high on dope! The sound effects are overdone too, because they have added too many Looney Tunes cartoon sounds.  The only standing ovation for this film, is that it is better than the Batman film that follows it, Batman and Robin.  Now that movie was just painful to watch!  I'm glad I only saw it once, and not in theaters either!  I liked Jim Carrey in this, because he's funny as the Riddler.  However, his presence alone already has defined Batman Forever as a comic mockery of the Batman series altogether.  Nicole Kidman is merely an overrated plot catlyst.  Not much to the characters.  Robin should have stayed in his nest with all of the other babies.  The only way to appreciate this in the slightest is to play it on the Stereo.  Forget the plot, and just eat the eye candy.  When I did that, I started to like it. But when I thought about it after I watched it, there was nothing to it. It's pure moneymaking junk food, and very little movie.  You will like it, no doubt, but it's not a good movie!

Then, after Batman Returns sucked audiences down to the 10th level of hell, they tried to brighten their moods by making everything bright, colorful, and cartoonish.  The result is one of the worst movies ever made, Batman Forever!  I was repulsed by how astonishingly annoying this film was.  The villians always overact, and their makup is too ridiculous to be taken seriously.  A friend of mine told me this was good because it was more like the cornball comic books.  True, but does that make this a good movie?  Well, I'll make it short. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!  On top of that, the bright neon colors and effects, which were intended to brighten the moods of audiences who were put through Batman Returns, simply come off as annoying and off-putting.  Joel Schumacher is famous for overdoing the effects and colors in his films, so I'll bet he had fun doing this.  The skyscrapers are also overkill, in which everything looks like a druggy's perception of New York while high on dope! The sound effects are overdone too, because they have added too many Looney Tunes cartoon sounds.  The only standing ovation for this film, is that it is better than the Batman film that follows it, Batman and Robin.  Now that movie was just painful to watch!  I'm glad I only saw it once, and not in theaters either!  I liked Jim Carrey in this, because he's funny as the Riddler.  However, his presence alone already has defined Batman Forever as a comic mockery of the Batman series altogether.  Nicole Kidman is merely an overrated plot catlyst.  Not much to the characters.  Robin should have stayed in his nest with all of the other babies.  The only way to appreciate this in the slightest is to play it on the Stereo.  Forget the plot, and just eat the eye candy.  When I did that, I started to like it. But when I thought about it after I watched it, there was nothing to it. It's pure moneymaking junk food, and very little movie.  You will like it, no doubt, but it's not a good movie!

In my opinion, these people have missed the entire point. One of the characters actually says you can't see the big picture from in here, you gotta concentrate on what's in front of your face!. That's exactly where this films strength lies, you are trapped throughout along with the characters. You don't even get to glimpse the outside world at the beginning. Instead you are thrust straight into the disturbing and claustrophobic plot. If you thought that the truman show was smart or original then think again... If you are after gore then you'll get plenty of the red stuff. If you're after laughs then sure, there's one or two... but most of all, if you are after nightmares and thoughts plagued for days with the intricacies of a tidy, intelligent, and utterly edge of seat movie then this is the film for you. 5 out of 5 just for not pandering to the masses.
