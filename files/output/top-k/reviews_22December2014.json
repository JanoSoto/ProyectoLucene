[{"date":"22 December 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Humphrey Bogart is the coolest actor ever. Sure there are actors that are better than him, but none have his spunk that only he can deliver. After first starting off with movies, the world fell for his bad guy gimmick and he changed his birth-date to Christmas to make himself seem nicer (or so I read). His breakout role was in the complex mystery The Maltese Falcon, where he plays cop, Sam Spade, with an edge. Every cop after has just been trying to match Spade in toughness and coolness. Casablanca was the role that really made his versatility grow and made him one of cinema's greatest heroes.During this time, there was roughly a movie a week that was released. All of them blended in together very well and nobody really cared about Casablanca. It was based on a relatively unknown play and the actors treated this as if it was just another movie. Nobody knew this would stand the test of time and become more loved over the years. When Orson Welles made Citizen Kane, he knew it would become the best movie ever. The people in Casablanca could not say the same thing. Casablanca is said to be the greatest film of all time more than any other. The only other movie that's a worthy contender as the best ever is Citizen Kane. The Godfather is also a good rival. But Casablanca is a nicer and more feel-good movie than Citizen Kane and The Godfather,but it has mostly been Citizen Kane and Casablanca that have been rivals since the beginning. Citizen Kane changed the way movies are made with unbeatable camera tricks and the best delivery of a life lesson ever, whereas Casablanca uses just great acting, a great story, and great dialogue. It is about a tough nigh club owner in Casablanca, Morocco named Rick (Bogart) who re-encounters his old flame (Bergman) with her war hero husband (Henreid) laying low. Rick is the only one with letters of transit that can help them escape, and only she can convince him to do it. What makes a movie so good? It has to have good acting, a good script, a good look, great filming, be relatable and emotionally connecting. Casablanca has all of those, minus great filming techniques. What makes Casablanca so special? Awesome swing music a none swing fan would like; great acting by a star-studded ensemble; a wide variety of emotions such as comedy and excitement and drama; unbeatable and quotable dialogue, more than any other in film history; and the amount of love that's in this he is willing to sacrifice himself for her, she wants to be with Rick, and Rick reawakens his love for her. This is raved as being the most romantic movie ever. There's crappy Zac Efron movies these days that are more romantic than this. But this has the best and most original love story ever.Since Casablanca's release, there have been various copycats and adaptations of it, but none have ever been able to capture its magic. It is the best movie that did not rely on any special effects or filming usages.

The African Queen is definitely one of those moderate films. A bit better than The Man Who Would Be King, a bit lesser than The Asphalt Jungle. In any case nothing to write home about. Nonetheless I was a bit disappointed. Not because it's Huston directing (he's too precarious to rely on), but because it's Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn acting. I love both of them. Like, really, adore. Especially Hepburn. It might be because of misguided romantic ideas of a lost Hollywood era. Or it might be just because I like the sight and style of them both. Anyway, both Bogart (who won his first and only Oscar for this movie and called it the best acting he had ever done) as Hepburn were not on their best. By far. Did Bogart get the Oscar because it was the first time he was seen in colour? He certainly makes a different impression when seen in colour... I liked him better in The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Big Sleep and especially in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Same with Hepburn, who just seems sick all the time (which she partly was during the recordings). Compared to Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib and even The Lion in Winter her acting was often annoying and laughable. I get why this movie is seen as a classic, but a classic doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. This was just okay. No more, no less.
