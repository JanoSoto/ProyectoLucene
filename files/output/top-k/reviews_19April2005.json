[{"date":"19 April 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" SLC Punk is a very well done film about two good friends who live by a code they define themselves and establish on their own terms. They are disillusioned when their antics get out of order and it is time to check back into the real way of things.The dynamic way in which the characters change in this movie are really the best aspect of it. There is also occasional strong photography and imagery, such as the desolate shots of the salt flats, or the bleak morning in the apartment.It's definitely worth seeing, and if you enjoy it, probably worth owning. I recommend that my younger friends watch it when they are in middle-school, again in high-school, and then again in college. They tend to experience different appreciations for it at each developmental stage. By showing this to mature audiences, more can be gained from seeing the film.SPOILER WARNING!For those of you who consider this film to be about the joys of punkdom and anarchy, watch the film again and consider what it is trying to say about maturity and growing up. The true point of this movie is that the ideals of Steve and Bob simply don't work in a world of rationality and maturity. Their dedication may be admirable, but the sobering consequences of their lifestyle turn Steve into a college-bound, everyday guy. This film shows that the anarchist ideal is really just a life of chaos, unpredictability, violence and loneliness. It's not about punks, anarchy, or doing whatever one wants; this is a nice film about growing up.
