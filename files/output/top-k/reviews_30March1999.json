I knew it would be like A Simple Plan, which is by the way a better film in all respects, in lack of shock value and its concentration on how characters changed their relations between one another after an incident.  But Schrader doesn't pull it off here, no matter how good a job Nick Nolte does.  I'm watching Raging Bull right now for a class, and I realized he can't direct his own screenplays as well as Scorsese can.  Take any scenes between Cathy Moriarty and De Niro in Bull, vs. Sissy Spacek and Nick Nolte, and you'll realize there's something missing in Schrader's direction.  The cinematography, the atmosphere, the music all seems dulled somehow, losing its focus.  I mean, if Joey had been able to wax philosophical to us about Jake's decline, would the film's images have had the same power?Examples of relationships Spacey and Nolte's relationship could have been performed much more interestingly- there was no JOY there, only empty, almost forced smiles.  Just like it's no surprise for a sinless man to yell out I'm saved! it's no great tragedy or drama to watch a joyless couple decline.  It seemed like Schrader really didn't know what to do with Spacek, even more so with Jack Hewitt.  The relationship between Jack and Wade is kind of at the heart of things, their similar economic positions, their friendship going back a while.  Wade lets Jack slip by every now and then for a few favors, etc.  Schrader sacrifices this tension in the process of exploring every possible dimension of the life of Wade Whitehouse and then show it ALL declining.  This made for a rather hammering, dulling film in which we could almost predict and soon not give a damn about where Wade was headed in his paranoia and frustration.A Simple Plan gave us four characters and a palpable tension created between them over a bag of money.  How did it transform their relationships?  Why? Who suffered, who gained?  How do we arrive at the deaths at the end, what went wrong?  All these questions were central in my mind after seeing A Simple Plan.  Similarly, Affliction created a catalyst, the strange death of Twombly, but didn't take it far enough.  An IMDB criticism here was just right Rolfe's character had a SEVERE effect on how Wade interpreted the incident, but Dafoe's narration somehow allowed him to back out.The narration was excessive that first shot of Affliction with the car coming in could have resembled Heat's grand opening shot of the subway. Dafoe screwed it up with words, since film must be primarily a medium about the power of visual suggestion.  I was disgusted by how far Schrader let it go ending it on the frame of Nolte drinking and the house burning in the background would have been fine, though horrible.  The final ending was real overkill.Nolte is always interesting to watch, but you don't give a damn eventually because nobody else here really interests you.  Jack, Larriviere, Spacek, Rolfe, even his father by Coburn, who should not have gotten the Oscar over Thornton, don't create really interesting situations or tensions with Wade. Even if they are created, they're not sustained.  For me, the most interesting relationship has to be between Wade and his ex-wife's family and daughter.Yes, the daughter was way too whiny and I could see how we could dislike her character, but watching Nolte struggling to be tender and commanding with the girl was my favorite part of the film.  His not knowing how the hell to get her to trust him or even like him was all over his face, body language, tone.  The way she says, Don't WORRY, Dad.  I love you, and the look of doubt that formed on Nolte's face really captivated me.  For me the tightest, best performed scene in the movie was when the ex-wife came to pick the daughter up.  Everything gets so screwed up for Wade, when he so wants to be good.  Don't say a word....I didn't hit him, I didn't hit him was probably the most human, fragile moments in the film (thankfully without any strange, depressing music in the background.)I don't know what Schrader was trying to do here, but the film seemed to fail for everyone in the audience.  Definitely, Dafoe's closing narration rotted a lot of the effect of Wade's burning the barn.  Certainly, the parts of Affliction didn't hold together.  And even though Nolte is a dynamic actor to watch, if we can't really care about the people he interacts with, what's the point?  A film where the supporting ensemble outranks the lead actor is usually a better scenario than one where the lead has no support. That was the case here, due to the faulty structure and direction of Affliction.I'm just waiting for a Mel Brooks snow movie he could really have some fun with this genre we've conjured up...

And if the entire movie had been about this, had been about the Titanic itself, then I would have loved it. However, it wasn't. Instead, it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring, predictable, badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years. Let's see a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents, and then a young drifter (who looks suspiciously like a 25 year-old model) rescues her, and they fall in love. Gee, no cliches so far. Some of the script was awful. For example, at the beginning, Rose says, You think you can save me? and Jack responds, No, only you can do that. That's fine, except then at the end, old Rose tells her granddaughter, there was a man named Jack who saved me, in all the ways a person can be saved. Which is a total contradiction to what Jack told her. And the worst line of the whole movie (or any movie I've seen in recent years) the ship is going down. Right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men, women and children are dying. So what does Rose do? She looks at Jack, smiles, and says, Look honey, this is where we first met! How dramatic! I wanted to puke. I realize that I'm nitpicking here, but my point is, if you're going to make a drama about such an important event, why give us two hours of watching Kate Winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things? I've met some morons say that they consider this to be the greatest movie ever made. Say WHAT?! Better than Star Wars? Better than The Godfather? Better than Casablanca? Better than Schindler's List?! Get a grip, people- it's a good movie, but you're blowing it way out of proportion.

Instead, it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring, predictable, badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years. Let's see a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents, and then a young drifter (who looks suspiciously like a 25 year-old model) rescues her, and they fall in love. Gee, no cliches so far. Some of the script was awful. For example, at the beginning, Rose says, You think you can save me? and Jack responds, No, only you can do that. That's fine, except then at the end, old Rose tells her granddaughter, there was a man named Jack who saved me, in all the ways a person can be saved. Which is a total contradiction to what Jack told her. And the worst line of the whole movie (or any movie I've seen in recent years) the ship is going down. Right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men, women and children are dying. So what does Rose do? She looks at Jack, smiles, and says, Look honey, this is where we first met! How dramatic! I wanted to puke. I realize that I'm nitpicking here, but my point is, if you're going to make a drama about such an important event, why give us two hours of watching Kate Winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things? I've met some morons say that they consider this to be the greatest movie ever made. Say WHAT?! Better than Star Wars? Better than The Godfather? Better than Casablanca? Better than Schindler's List?! Get a grip, people- it's a good movie, but you're blowing it way out of proportion.

It is gripping 100% of the way through.  The acting is superb, the imagery is breathtaking, the violence is thoroughly brutal.However I did have some gripes about the actual intent of the movie.  The story follows the lives of Derek (Edward Notron) and Danny (Edward Furlong) Vinyard.  Danny, the younger brother of Derek, is instructed to study the life of his brother after he submits a paper on Mein Kampf for school. Danny looks up to and admires his brother and they are both neo-Nazis. Derek ends up in prison after a race related manslaughter, yet his time in prison shows him the error of his ways and after release he attempts to reform his younger brother as he himself has been reformed.The first part of the movie explores Derek as a character and his white power motivation and ideas.  Derek is not your stereotypical thug.  He is intelligent and articulate.  The whole first section presents both racism against whites and racism against blacks.  Both black and white are seen to be equally discriminatory and violent, a war of two equal sides.  Yet we only ever see the motives of the neo-Nazis.  We are given the propaganda that the neo-Nazis feed on, social problems are dredged up and the blacks and immigrants are blamed for all of it and Derek is Hell-bent on putting those wrongs right.  Apart from the awful violence there are no strong reasons given why Derek is in any way 'wrong.'  We have no real reason to hate or despise him, after all the men he killed were trying to kill him. His father was killed by black people as he tried to save their lives. This whole idea prevails...both 'sides' are 'wrong' yet both are justifiedIn prison, however, Derek becomes disillusioned with his 'own kind' and turns from them realising they have shallow motives and are unguided.  He feels the thugs in prison don't share his ideas; they are simply thugs. He decides to become a loner, neither friends with the white gang or the black gang.  This leaves him wide open as to even survive you have to take at least one side.  The only reason he makes it out alive is due to a friendship he develops with a black inmate.This is the rather flimsy basis of his conversion.  Separated from everyone he begins to realise that he has been fed a lie and vows to distance himself from his former gang lifestyle.It is all-well and good seeing that Derek is no longer a racist thug...but what about all of the white-power ideas?  All of the social problems that Derek points out still exist in society.  Nothing he says throughout the movie is rebutted.  So neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.Another interesting point was the cinema dynamics.  I can't remember any other movie where I have squirmed in my seat, practically ashamed to be white.  Half way through the movie I was praying that all would turn out good lest I be lynched outside...it really is that powerful.  However as both black and white exchanged words onscreen I squirmed as 'my race' demonstrated their racism toward the blacks, yet the black members of the audience felt it acceptable to laugh out loud as the onscreen blacks were racist toward the whites...So I would like to finish by saying that not only was I practically ashamed of being white, I am proud to say that at least I was ashamed.

I do admit this movie had an adequate enough plot; after all a daughter moving back home to take care of her mother is quite alright.  Renee Zelwegger, Meryl Streep, William Hurt, and Tom Everett Scott star in a film that was supposed to be one of the heart and togetherness. Instead, I saw a mother who relied on her daughter for everything, a father that was stubborn and wanted to see things done his way, a daughter who had a life of her own, and a brother who is off doing his own thing in college. This is definitely a well meaning movie with a plot that I can tell needs definite work. It also brings together a fine group of actors. The one thing I would add is the development of family coming together and rally around each other for support as their mother's condition worstened. If there was one part in the whole film that I really liked it was the interview with the district attorney; my opinion was that if the director just had this in the film instead of the acting portion, I could get a mental picture of what she was saying very easily. I can only give this film a weak, marginal thumbs up for this film because it is like reading a severely undeveloped essay that has good ideas but no real thought to it.

Enrolling in a course discussing about the nuts and bolts of modern folklore...Natalie is about to receive a life long lesson in hardship...A series of grisly murders have been reported at Pendleton University. What's even more taunting, these murders seem to be centering around Natalie's life.  Many of these real life murders that Natalie encounters are eerily copied from these notorious legends.  They include a death by hanging, a graphic torture scene, a hooded ax-wielding murderer hiding in the back seat of a car zeroing in on the kill, and the infamous charred poodle...Who is the killer?  Well, the probable suspects are either an overzealous student journalist (Jared Leto), Professor Wexler (Robert Englund) a renowned expert on modern folklore, Natalie's *jealous* best friend (Rebecca Gayheart), the college prankster (Joshua Jackson), or the college dean (John Neville).  Or could the murderer be someone closer to Natalie...The ultimate urban legend is about to unfold...I enjoyed URBAN LEGEND  a lot because it takes advantage of the same ingredients utilized in other recent stalk and slash hit features such as SCREAM (1996) and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997).  URBAN LEGEND manages to maintain high-octane suspense along with some dry black humor. The cast in URBAN LEGEND  is wonderful.  Alicia Witt in particular is great as a tough heroine who must unravel the clues in order to unmask the psychotic killer roaming around the campus.  Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson also provide a macabre sense of humor which is appropriate to the film's ominous tones.  Robert Englund also has a nice cameo as a college professor who is skeptical towards Natalie's allegations of these urban legends coming true.  Rebecca Gayheart is attractive as Natalie's seductive cohort.  The cast has a terrific time in this movie.URBAN LEGEND  is a tautly made horror film with plenty of scares, thrills, and gore.  Be forewarned, for the first 40 minutes of URBAN LEGEND  are deadly lame.  Be patient though, the film picks up the pace as the story progresses.  Although this film is not explicitly gory, it is sanguinary enough to please bloodhounds and to keep the squeamish screaming for their lives.As a slasher flick, URBAN LEGEND  is above average.  Your heart will beat faster and blood will rush down your body as you try to admonish the characters on screen to take certain precautions.  URBAN LEGEND  is surprisingly lightweight on the sauce department, but some efficient plot twists will keep most people captivated to the story.  Altogether, URBAN LEGEND  is a creative turn from the traditional killer goes on murder spree type sub-genre for the horror film category.   A substantively established fright show will keep you shrieking for more!  Ghoulish fun for fans.  Certainly better than your average psycho on the loose film.
