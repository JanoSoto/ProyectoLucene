Suffice it to say that it is far-fetched that a rich, handsome man like Edward would not find the right woman until he met Vivian, a streetwalker who is so perfect that she even likes the opera. Perfect for him, that is, not for me. My perfect woman likes watching movies, and I leave the ones that like going to the opera to men like Edward.Though this movie made no pretense about being realistic, yet there is one reality too stark to be ignored, and that is disease. Once upon a time, a man in a movie could marry a prostitute, and the audience would accept this without thinking about her having some kind of sexually transmitted disease. For example, we never worried while watching Stagecoach (1939) when the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) decided to marry Dallas (Claire Trevor), who was a whore with a heart of gold. Because venereal disease was something people rarely spoke of, especially in the movies, they rarely thought about it either.But today, we live in a world where it is impossible to think about sex without also thinking about getting an STD, especially if it is sex with prostitutes. And therefore, it was necessary for this movie to assure the audience that Vivian was in good health. So we are not surprised when Vivian says to Edward, when they first meet, that she is safe Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer. Maybe prostitutes normally say that sort of thing to their customers, maybe not. I wouldn't know. But if it sounds a little forced and artificial, we accept this bit of dialogue as necessary to keep us from thinking about disease when they have eventually have sex. The movie could not afford to rest content with this one reference to condoms, however. To drive the point home, Vivian later produces her rainbow assortment of condoms for Edward to pick from.But still, they are not quite ready for sex. That is, we in the audience are not quite ready for them to have sex. Apparently we need a few more assurances. Therefore, in a subsequent scene, Vivian tells Edward that she does not kiss on the mouth. She says this is for emotional reasons Kit's always saying to me, 'Don't get emotional when you turn tricks.' That's why no kissing. It's too personal. So, later in the movie, when they do start kissing, we know that they are getting emotionally involved. But the real reason for her having this restriction on kissing is so that we know there has been absolutely no exchange of bodily fluids, not even saliva, with any of her past customers.In a movie about sex, we are not surprised if there is a bathtub scene, especially one in which both the man and the woman are in the tub together. But as there are two bathtub scenes in this movie, we have to wonder if the purpose is more than just erotic, if they are meant to make us think of Vivian as clean. This is not to say that taking a bath would act as a prophylactic against the transmission of disease. This is more about the association of ideas than logic. The cleanliness associated with bathing is supposed to support our belief that Vivian is sexually clean as well.But the scene that really shows the extent to which this movie wants to assure the audience that she is safe to have sex with is the dental floss scene. Let's face it. Most people do not floss during a date. I suppose a woman might, because she can carry the floss around in her purse. But even so, there is normally no need to have a scene involving personal hygiene in a movie, unless, of course, personal hygiene is important for some reason. As with the bathing, flossing will do nothing to prevent the transmission of venereal disease, but the movie is trying to suggest to us that any woman who flosses during a date must be so clean she could not possibly have AIDS, herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, or crabs.Still, under normal circumstances, if a woman decided to floss her teeth on a date, she would close the bathroom door, and her date would not dream of just walking in. But if he did interrupt her while flossing, she would simply stop what she was doing to see what he wanted. She would not hide the floss as if it were something shameful or embarrassing. But the purpose of Vivian's hiding the floss is so that there can be a big dramatic scene and discussion about it, one which cannot escape the attention of the audience, much in the way that her display of condoms for Edward to pick from drove home the point in a way that could not be missed either.So, with the condoms, the free clinic, a ban on kissing, a couple of baths, and some dental floss, the audience can finally relax and quit worrying about whether Vivian has a disease, even if the opera she and Edward went to see was La Traviata, a story about a courtesan who dies of tuberculosis.

This was one of the first times this director stepped out of his comfort zone to do something different and this to me is his only hit in that area.Yeah it's another horror film involving teens but what makes this different is that it's not a slasher; instead it's alien invasion. Which I think is a cool idea and a change of pace; instead of having the standard of having teens deal with some killer on the loose they have to deal with alien invasion and save the world which I think is awesome; it's pretty much The Breakfast Club mixed with Invasion of the Body Snatchers which I think is a great combo.I really like the high school atmosphere they create which doesn't feel like another positive stylized high school you'd see on any teen TV drama, but actually felt like a real high school as you see it's almost a cesspool of dysfunction. This I feel increases the realatablity factor because things like this do happen in high schools.The effects on the creatures are solid, it's a slight mix of both CGI and practical. The designs of the aliens are solid if not the greatest aliens, their pretty much nasty parasites or slugs that you just want to pour a big bottle of salt to.But to me it's not really the aliens that make the film it's more the characters and suspense that to me drive the film. I really like how the characters interact with one another, each of them at first are wearing psychological social masks to protect and hide themselves. But once crap goes down, they all take them off and be what they should be to win the war, themselves.Two of my favorites are Casey played well by Elijah Wood (TV's Over the Garden Wall) whom is an actor I really like. His character is great because he is a bit like myself. He's shy, a bit of a loner, ill confidant but not short of courage, but the guy is a real underdog. He doesn't have much luck with ladies, he's a target for bullies, doesn't have any friends or at least any we know about which is all the more reason we really route for this guy to win. Even like the chemistry he has with Deliah there's a bit of a Mary Jane and Peter Parker like vibe going on with both of them.Though my favorite is Stokely (Clea Duvall) whom I thought was kinda cute, she is a goth almost. She has a lot of attitude but what I love is that she is kinda a geek at heart since she's a big sci-fi fan as she reads lots of sci-fi books which makes her relatable since I'm also a fan of the genre and love to read the books in it. But also that deep down she is really possess a lot of warmth. I really like her interaction with Stan to me their the one couple in this film that stand out, I really like how both slowly open up and warm up to one another.I really like how there is a blend of both teen agust drama and the alien invasion suspense. And of course the film is light hearted fun as well, it doesn't take itself too seriously but has it's heart in the right place all the same.One of the dramatic moments that stand out is when Stan talks to Stokely about quiting athletics because he wants more and focus on academics to find himself. Which I though was a very humane moment and pertains to the theme of the film. Part of being a teen is about finding out who you are and figuring out what you can do, and sports careers aren't forever.It's true there not really much in action which is a bit of a first for Rob's films. But that's because this is more of a suspense thriller which I think is great and makes the protagonists and the actions they have to take more believable because their all just ordinary people; and the pacing is great there really isn't a slow moment or any time to really relax much. There is the sense of isolation but also at the same time community with the protagonists.One sequence which to me is one of my favorite one's of all time is seeing all of the character take the drug test which is reminiscent of the blood test scene in John Carpenter's The Thing. That scene was also really funny as we see afterward their all kinda tripping. And of course yes they use drugs as a weapon against the aliens which I like because their using a non cleche weapon.I really like how the film tackles the issues of alienation and isolation that teens go though. But I also think on the fear on being pressured to conform to certain standards and norms that are constantly imposed on us and how it will turn us into something we don't want to be. And the film I feel has a good message which is to simply be yourself, determine your own identity don't let anyone or any system do it for you, it's your life you decide.Overall, The Faculty gets a pass.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The strange think about high school is despite everyone in close proximity with each other we don't really know the person we pass by because where never really ourselves.This film I feel is an under the radar gem, I may'be in the minority on this but this is one of my favorite alien invasion films and it's also one of my favorite films from the director Robert Rodregiez.

And the film I feel has a good message which is to simply be yourself, determine your own identity don't let anyone or any system do it for you, it's your life you decide.Overall, The Faculty gets a pass.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"23 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" i saw star wars trilogy before 1 year and half and when I finished the fifth one i haven't seen the sixth one immediately , i delayed it for about 2 months , because when i asked my bro and my pals How is the sixth star wars ?

It has since sat on my media shelf accumulating dust, as well as a couple additional I'll watch them later's, atop it. With Inherent Vice on the horizon, I decided to watch the very film I've been neglecting for six months, and as some would say, my life. I figured, I've more or less enjoyed everything that PTA has put his hands on, so I'll make some time to watch Magnolia tomorrow. Three hours after pressing play, I am left happy and genuinely affected by this film. Let me tell you why.Marked by outstanding performances and extraordinary cinematography, Magnolia is one of the last film-making punches delivered by the '90's. Robert Elswit (Nightcrawler, Michael Clayton) brings his coveted expertise to the production. It's no wonder that Anderson has worked with him on most (all but one) of his features. The framing of shots is impeccable and lends itself well into the context of the film. Some of Elswit's shots were so perfect that they felt, to me, otherworldly. That level of attention to detail in a film like this is what sets it far apart from any similar in scale. At 188 minutes, not a shot outstays its welcome. Anderson and his crew have created a water-tight film in many respects, but none more than his cast.This film is one about human beings; people who are trying to make a connection, and the happenstances that bind them to one another, whether they are aware of it or not. There are no weak or one-note performances in this film. The story does not unfold, it is commanded, transition by transition through the performances. Particularly John C. Reilly in his role as Officer Jim, William H. Macy as Donnie Smith, a former child genius, Julianne Moore as Linda Partridge and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Phil. I believed these actors in their respective roles; each seeking something entirely dependent on their connection with another human being. The juxtaposition of Donnie Smith and Stanley Spector is my favorite character oriented decision made creatively for this film. William H. Macy provides something of a window into latter's dismal future, as it would be, were it not to change course. Some proving to be more successful in their quests than others.What I was not expecting when endeavoring into Magnolia was the visual poetry and eloquent little flourishes that pepper this film. I constantly found myself relishing in the genius of some of Anderson's touches throughout the film. Even the most intimately sized scenes in this film, such as Donnie Smith's conversation with Thurston Howell (Henry Gibson) feel organic to the nature of the film's scale and serve the over-arching premise. When other films try their luck at letting small occurrences and scenarios serve to usher the plot forward delicately, it most always comes off as too quick, heavy-handed, or unnecessary, but here, such touches as BUT IT DID HAPPEN on the painting in the apartment do more for the story than any human words possibly could. Or perhaps the sequence in which all of the characters, in each of their states of life, sing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. It caters to an almost euphoric tone, which perfectly stages the remainder of the film for the masterful execution it receives.Forgiveness, acceptance, and love take center stage in this somber tale, and culminates in a more than satisfying ending. Paul Thomas Anderson is quoted as saying that Magnolia is for better or worse, the best movie he'll ever make. I think he set the bar pretty high with his sophomore film, but continues to create great works. All said, Magnolia can be most concisely described as a master stroke on the canvas of cinematic art.

Well all I can say is that there was plenty of dumb and not enough fun and that's the big problem with this film.The premise of transporting an elephant from Florida to Texas already had me worried as I felt that this plot line overstepped the fine line between being a fun premise and being a dumb premise and sadly that's exactly what happened; far too much time was spent on the protagonists fussing over the elephant and bonding with it was just dumb and not particularly funny. I knew I was really in trouble when I realised the best they could do from this was to get the elephant to form an emotional attachment to the Bandit - simply put it wasn't funny and didn't work.On a lesser note I found the Bandit's transition from his care-free persona in the first film to him being a depressed alcoholic at the start of this film(all because he misses Carrie or 'Frog') to be a bit too much of a stretch in credibility. I just found it hard to believe that he'd go to pieces like that.The biggest problem this film has is that for the most part it quite simply lacks fun; the best thing about the first film is that it felt like one long car chase, it was exciting and fun. Sure it was dumb, but it always leaves a big smile on my face every time I watch it. This didn't. As mentioned, the transportation of an animal gave it an emotional core that it simply didn't need and it suffers badly as a result.Thank goodness then for Gleason & Henry who do at least try to salvage something from this wreckage; their interplay was superb as it was in the first film and they both share the best scenes in the film. In fact, I don't remember there being one scene in this film involving Gleason & Henry that wasn't funny.The demolition derby style finale was a little over the top and embarrassing, but at least it brought some much needed excitement to the table. The somewhat sugar coated ending didn't leave a particularly good taste in my mouth and it did make me wonder at times if the writers kept forgetting what type of film they're supposed to be making.This is a pretty poor film that is ultimately saved by the excellent performances by Gleason & Henry. Although there's a lot of tedium in this film, the scenes involving Gleason & Henry are so good that it actually makes it worth your while sitting through all the weaker aspects.

I knew I was really in trouble when I realised the best they could do from this was to get the elephant to form an emotional attachment to the Bandit - simply put it wasn't funny and didn't work.On a lesser note I found the Bandit's transition from his care-free persona in the first film to him being a depressed alcoholic at the start of this film(all because he misses Carrie or 'Frog') to be a bit too much of a stretch in credibility. I just found it hard to believe that he'd go to pieces like that.The biggest problem this film has is that for the most part it quite simply lacks fun; the best thing about the first film is that it felt like one long car chase, it was exciting and fun. Sure it was dumb, but it always leaves a big smile on my face every time I watch it. This didn't. As mentioned, the transportation of an animal gave it an emotional core that it simply didn't need and it suffers badly as a result.Thank goodness then for Gleason & Henry who do at least try to salvage something from this wreckage; their interplay was superb as it was in the first film and they both share the best scenes in the film. In fact, I don't remember there being one scene in this film involving Gleason & Henry that wasn't funny.The demolition derby style finale was a little over the top and embarrassing, but at least it brought some much needed excitement to the table. The somewhat sugar coated ending didn't leave a particularly good taste in my mouth and it did make me wonder at times if the writers kept forgetting what type of film they're supposed to be making.This is a pretty poor film that is ultimately saved by the excellent performances by Gleason & Henry.

There's nothing wrong with that, per se, except that those types of films tend to go for the easy emotional hook rather than dealing with harsher realities that might be more true to life. However, this film rises above that, to a degree, thanks to some good work by the reliable William Hurt and an eye-opening performance by deaf actress Marlee Matlin. Her presence was critical to making it work, and its success mostly rests on her shoulders.The story concerns a teacher, James Leeds (William Hurt), who is a new addition to the faculty at Kittredge School for the Deaf. He is an idealistic person with unconventional teaching methods who quickly earns the trust and admiration of his students. However an employee, Sarah (Marlee Matlin), and also a former student, proves more of a challenge. Despite her resistance to him trying to help, a romance blossoms between the two and sets the stage for a clash of wills.Aside from the outstanding performances (including a small, but affecting turn by Piper Laurie as Sarah's mother), one thing I thought was really well-done was the intimate moments of conflict between James and Sarah after the point in the story where they fall in love. Those dialogue exchanges were key to what I felt was the central struggle in the film. Nominally, it was about a man in love trying to get through to a deaf woman, but it can also be generalized to any relationship where communication can be difficult. Men and women often enter a relationship hoping that the other person will meet them on their own terms, but the reality is that it's best if they meet each other halfway. This is something I thought was beautifully explored in the film. I also enjoyed the many scenes where James interacts with his students, as these provided some comic relief.Still, not everything was so admirable. For one, I thought that the film took a rather patriarchal attitude towards women. Marlee Matlin, strong as her performance may have been, is still playing a strong-willed woman who finds herself in being with a man, just shy of being domesticated. At one point during the obligatory separation part of any romantic drama, she moves back in with her mother and gets a job, but doesn't find fulfillment in it. I understand that this film was made close to 30 years ago (and the play it was based on) so it's a product of its time, but things like that have a detrimental effect on how well a film ages. And with respect to its attitudes towards women, this film has not aged well in my opinion. They also took a rather pedestrian and cliché approach to the typical romantic elements of the story.Overall, this was a well-acted and (seemingly) well-meaning look at love in a unique relationship\/circumstance. Some of the music was a little too on-the-nose, but generally was fitting. I also enjoyed the 80's pop songs they included in the soundtrack. What the film does best is explore the difficulties inherent in a relationship between a hearing and deaf person, which can be generalized to the difficulty in any relationship. Still, it's retrograde (at least, now) attitude towards women makes it a little lesser of a film than it could have been.

The animation was perfect, the storyline was perfect, the characters were perfect, music was perfect, everything about the movie was perfect. Every time I watch this movie growing up, I couldn't help but sing along with the characters and crank up the TV to drown out my horrible singing. Also, every time the movie got to the credits, I would always cry because the music was so heart-warming and beautiful to listen to. The characters were also hilarious. My favorite character(s) would have to be Lumiere and Cogsworth. There bond is so funny to watch. Among all the classic Disney movies out there, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wanna watch a really good Disney movie. If I was to rate this movie, I would definitely give it ten out of ten for best music, best animation, best storyline, and best characters.

When I started to watch this movie, I thought that it might be a comedy type movie. But gradually my thoughts became false. I was just praying at that time, not to cry. But i just couldn't control my tears. When the lead actor died I felt very bad. And the pretty boy just acted like a professional actor. I just loved that movies. Thanks for creating such a movie. I want to see such movie again and again. And also thanks to the director for such twist at the end of the movie. By fulfilling boy's request. Life is beautiful.

What I think of The Great Mouse Detective is that it is very underrated (like most other people say) and extremely hilarious. I always laugh out loud when Basil, Dawson and Olivia are in the toy store and Basil gets hit by toy cymbals. It's also funny when Bartholomew calls Ratigan a rat and then gets eaten by Ratigan's cat, Felicia during the song The World's Greatest Criminal Mind. I highly recommend this film for anyone who has seen the live-action series Sherlock Holmes because I say this is my Sherlock Holmes. This movie isn't as good as An American Tail and An American Tail Fievel Goes West, but I I think this movie is way better than The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under which were awful. If you loved Fantasia or Bambi, you'll love this one too.
