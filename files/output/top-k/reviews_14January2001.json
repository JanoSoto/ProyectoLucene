In a brilliant way, Stone shows us how the Americans were rather fighting among themselves than against the 'real' enemy out there.  He also points out that this must have been one of the main reasons why America didn't win the war.  This piece of information is what the film is all about.  Besides the actual Vietnam War you can see the development of another 'personal' war that starts with a stupid incident but becomes just as strong and dangerous as the real war.  Good men were killed when they could have been saved.In this film, Charlie Sheen is a young soldier who's just started out in Vietnam.  He's caught between two superiors who (as he said so himself) fight for the possession of their souls.  There's the morally corrupt, merciless 'killer machine' Sgt. Barnes and the much more humane Sgt. Elias who wants to teach his men a sense of compassion and responsibility.Platoon is a great film, in particular because Oliver Stone creates such a thrilling and realistic atmosphere throughout the entire picture.  The camerawork is excellent and original too, since Stone becomes a part of his own film by acting as if he were one of those soldiers.  Most of the film takes place in the jungle, but this so-called lack of variation is never boring.  The scenes in the jungle are really nerve-wracking, as you never know what could happen next.  A brilliant thing about these jungle-scenes is the piece and quiet at one moment where you can literally hear the birds singing and the ear-deafening noise of gunfire and grenades that (to anyone's surprise) follows in the scene hereafter. Because of an interesting story with great acting performances and wonderful camerawork Oliver Stone will keep you attached to the screen for the whole time being.  It's a good thing that the film doesn't last any longer than two hours, because after this time you've had it with Vietnam, despite the fact that you've really seen a great film!  The acting of both Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger are good, but it's Willem Dafoe who is simply wonderful as Sgt. Elias.  He received an Oscar nomination for his performance, but not an award.  Back to Charlie Sheen for a moment like father like son.  His father was in a Vietnam-film as well and he did the voice-over in that film.  Well, his son Charlie Sheen does exactly the same as his father did many years ago.  Charlie Sheen plays in a Vietnam-film as well and takes care of the voice-over in Platoon.  Both do a great job, but father Martin's voice-over in Apocalypse now! is still somewhat better.All in all, Platoon is a very good film that gives the viewer an insightful representation of how the Americans (sorry to say) lost the Vietnam War.

No Movie has ever made me feel like this one has, I was physically sick and exhausted afterwards.Bjork plays Selma Yeskova, a struggling single Mother that has emigrated from Eastern Europe to America, she works day and night in a harsh factory saving all of her money to pay for an operation that will prevent her son from loosing his sight, tragically for her it is to late as her sight continues to deteriorate throughout the Movie. Selmas only real escape from her cruel disease and her inhuman working hours is her passion for musicals.Although this Movie starts off quite slow, it does manage to grip you from the begining and the musical pieces of the film although quite simple are passionately effective.Everybody loves Selma and Bjork played her extremely convincingly, Bjork is incredibly cute and quite possibly the nicest person in the world in this film, all you want is the best for her but unfortunately her life just keeps getting worse and worse, Fate keeps handing her very cruel situations that will undoubtedly leave you fumbling for your tissues and grasping at your chest as you literally feel your heart being ripped out of your chest in sympathy for what this poor woman has to go through.The final scene will leave you breathless\/speechless and in a state of emotional agony, I can't help thinking how drained and tired Bjork must have been after filming wrapped on this movie.A fantastic cast made this Movie what it was and as usual Catherine Deneuve bought power and dignity to her role, what a beautiful actress she is.Peter Storemore who plays Selmas would-be boyfriend is absolutely wonderful as the shy, sensitive, somewhat reserved gentle giant. They make a beautiful couple because they are so cute.Speaking of cute, I do think this movie relies on the Bjork being as cute as she possibly can to gain as much pity and encite as much emotion as she can from her audience, there is nothing wrong with this and it was successful in this Movie but anymore and it would have ruined it.Her accent also needed some work and was very unconvincing but she can be forgiven, she is not an actress and was far better on the silver screen than most Hollywood actors we have today especially for her first film.In conclusion This film is full of good music, great acting and the kind of tragedy that you wouldn't believe possible (The scene where Bjork sings These are my favorite things will leave you experiencing empathy to the degree that wouldn't think possible for the human phyche to achieve, you may also find it quite confronting for that reason) This is an extremely important film and one of the most convincing that I have seen and I highly doubt that anyone would want to see it again, not because it is not brilliant just because I don't think anyone would want to ride such an extreme emotional rollercoaster by choice again.I guess I would recommend this film to everybody to watch as I feel it is important to see this Movie, but take your tissues and don't see it if you are in a fragile state of mind.Who was it that said Nothing bad ever happens in musicals?

It speaks volumes about the succession of Brit gangster flicks that only now we see the first character in the genre who is convincingly evil and genuinely fits the feared reputation which precedes him.Kingsley is cold and instantly loathesome, but compulsive viewing for his brilliant dialogue; short and sharp in speaking his mind yet at the same time mixed up in over verbalising and confusing what he actually says.The silent pauses which also accompany the permanently awkward interaction Kingsley has with other characters are also brilliantly timed and portrayed to evoke the real tension which exists throughout, and adds power to the moments when his temperament gets the better of him.What makes this all the more convincing and watchable is the contrasting but equally impressive surroundings in which Kingsley appears.The life of retired crooks on the Spanish coast is made impossibly inviting, comfortable and cosy without being cheaply glamourised, Winstone as Gal leading a set of strong performances as an endearing and essentially harmless ex-pat taking things easy and minding his own business along with refreshingly un-hollow wife and best friends.The scene is set for the psychological battle of minds between the amiable Winstone and the relentless Kingsley, but also with a string of ultimately irrelevant but all the more entertaining scenes which add to the solidity of the film - the swimming pool, the hunting, the aeroplane.When events switch to a purposely contrasting London the turn of plot sees the pace of the film increase as the movie explodes into full-blown and for the most part familiar - although understated - gangster style.The director makes things so much more viewable and impressive with his occasional jumps back and forth between separate scenes as well as returning to already used themes and settings.It says so much about the quality of the film that the actual crime is almost unimportant and unneccessary for the viewers enjoyment, yet it is still carried out with intelligent direction, capturing the ruthless workmanlike approach of the gang and linking events to the more important storylines involved.In London the quiet calculating kingpin Teddy Bass picks up the well acted battle of wits with Winstone from Kingsley, and once again the timing and conciseness of interaction add to the film, what is not said as important as what is said.By the end the characters have depth, hold our attention and are genuinelymemorable - so much more so than the endless stream of stereotypical cockney wise guys throughout the genre who in many cases are forgettable but for their comedy value.In other words, 'Sexy Beast' has to all intents and purposes reinvented the Brit Gangster flick genre with a movie that stands out from the crowd with good reason.Sadly, it doesn't seem to have made it to many cinemas, which is a tragedy as it deserves a wider audience - a production which is brilliant for the right reasons a *film* should succeed the acting, direction and scenery, not just the storyline.Superb acting throughout - Winstone is exceptional and Kingsley simply unmissable - as well as clever direction, and 'Sexy Beast' adds up to a real gem. Everything is done in moderation, there are no shortcuts taken to increase entertainment value or obligatory excessive violence or neverending visual humour; it doesn't try to make you like it, you just will like it.

Kennedy, RFK and his cabinet ultimately prevented WWIII with a brilliant mix of Cold War toughness and true human diplomacy. The story touches on the importance of JFKs presidency and his unique blend of intelligence, compassion and faith. Kevin Costner is positioned as a central figure in the film and does a fine job... partly as a headliner to draw you in to the film. Robert Culp and Bruce Greenwood capture enough of the Kennedy magic to help us all understand and believe that we are lucky they were elected and we may never see such an uncommon blend of real thoughtful decision-making and diplomacy in the modern era. For those who see Kennedy as a popular and maybe even lightweight politico, this film shows why he is often regarded as one of the best US Presidents. The musical score, historic re-enactments and actors are great. The story is engrossing and the direction makes a taut political and international drama come to life for any viewer.Everyone with a curiosity about Kennedy, the presidency or the Cold War will enjoy this well crafted film. Wow. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2001","score":"","review":" This is a fantastic and enlightening film.

This movie was one of those pleasant little gems that you are happy to have stumbled upon because whatever starring (enter blockbuster name here) was sold out. The acting was brilliant and I honestly feel that both Linney and Ruffalo deserve nominations for their performances. Especially Ruffalo. He played the vagabond, aimless brother to a tee but at the same time made the character someone you could relate to and admire. Wonderful story and message. A must see indeed!

I think the screenplay is amazing.  It is searing, gentle, brave, and brilliant.  I just won Best Director for a short film called CHOICES in the NY International Independent Film Festival.  CHOICES will be shown at Sundance.  And I am so impressed and inspired by the screenplay and direction of An Affair of Love. I hope it gets a major release.  It certainly deserves great attention.
