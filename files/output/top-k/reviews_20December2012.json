Gladiator shows the things that pushed an innocent hero to the point that death seemed like a relief from all that the world has taken from him. Maximus the main protagonist of the movie was portrayed by Russell Crowe in such a talented yet distinctive fashion that you do nothing but bow to the way Maximus handled his trials and tests to come out victorious at the end.Filming took place between January and May of1999 and the locations used were Bourne Woods, near Farnham Surrey in England, Ouarzazate Morocco and Fort Ricasoli Malta.The movie plot is about a loyal Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is betrayed when the Emperor's son, Commodus, murders his father to become Emperor of Rome himself, and burns down and kills Maximus family. After everything is lost Maximus is reduced to slavery and he having one determination, revenge, rose through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena, all in the hope of getting back at the man who killed his family and Emperor. Based squarely on a pitch by David Franzoni, who worked with Spielberg in Amistad, Ridley Scott was approached to make a movie from Franzoni's original final draft but he had the whole script re-written by John Logan who was the person that added the death of Maximus family, to create a lonely soldier with nothing to lose, but Franzoni was brought back as problems start to erupt in the re-writes, Frazoni did all he could to get the script back to the original draft. More issues sprung up, when Russell Crowe almost caused a total re-write of the script, whenever he asked questions he demanded answers and if the answers were not favourable, the script had to be re-worked.The movie can be said to have drawn plot from two older movies, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus both of which were done in the 60s. A lot of the plot foundation, like the murder of the emperor by his son who wanted to marry his sister, who (Sister) was in love with a General can be said to be taken from the movie The Fall of the Roman Empire.

Tarantino's dream of making the movie look bigger than it actually is was achieved. Made with 8.5 million dollars, the movie looked like it was made with more. The story arc although it curves around 3 main and distinctive people and 3 main distinctive stories, it still has a way of reeling you in and keeping you attentive without losing you along the way.Meant to be a trilogy of three shorts, rather than a full length feature, it was first written by Roger Avary in the fall of 1990, while Tarantino worked on the script development 2 years after, the movie was then picked up for production by Columbia TriStar, who later dropped the movie because they felt the movie was too long, out of place and it was too low budgeted, before the producer Bender shipped it off to Miramax.The movie is depicted in a nonlinear tale also the narrative is presented out of sequence it is about three main characters. We have first a mob hit-man Vincent Vega (John Travolta) who was hired to kill Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). Then we have a prizefighter Butch Coolidge, who double crossed a mobster by winning a bout that he took money for throwing. And the last main cast Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is Vincent's partner who felt he has heard a calling from God to leave the hit-man life, when he was shot and the shooter misses.Each story is interwoven and intersects at various parts; if well put together the movie makes one whole complete picture.Before this, John Travolta was losing his edge in his movies and Willis was finding it hard to make a good movie after many big budget flops, after this flick they both got their edge back.

Another unexpected accident came years later when legendary Warner Bros. animator Tex Avery told the story of how he came up with the idea for Bugs Bunny by watching Clark Gable eat carrots in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT! A sound man on the film later told Capra the story of how he over-heard Colbert complaining to Gable about making the film (she thought it her worst) and Gable defended Capra saying he Gable was having a blast and that Capra was on to something. Well they finished the film on time and it opened at Radio City Music Hall where it only played for one week. The reviews were good but mixed and the box office not as strong as Capra's previous movie LADY FOR A DAY. Then &#x96; it happened. Happened all over the country &#x96; not in one night, but within a month. People took longer to find the film, in the Midwest, in small towns, the word of mouth spread and surprise it was funnier, much funnier than usual. But, the biggest surprise of all, they could remember in detail a good deal of what went on in the film and they found everybody else did and that it was great fun talking about this and that scene. And let's go see it again and take the neighbors. The quietness burst into the proverbial prairie fire. Theaters sold out for weeks and weeks. Critics went back for a second look, a third, a fourth.Astonishingly enough, the news about It Happened One Night was not that it made Classic status but that it got made at all. Oh and buy the way it, was the first film to sweep all five of the major Academy Awards and the only one for 48 years! Colbert did not want to even attend the Oscars so she went in travelling clothes, seems she was leaving that night to go on that vacation she missed. So when her name was called she ran up grabbed the award, said thanks and dashed out the door only to STOP. Turn around.

The fans need to let that go. Sure it wasn't the best idea, but it certainly wasn't the worst idea. I'm probably letting nostalgia get in the way, but the Ewoks never bothered me. I can see why people don't like them, and I know that the idea of teddy bears using bolas and sticks to defeat highly trained soldiers is ridiculous. But hey, at least it wasn't Jar Jar and I'll take the Ewoks over Jar-Jar any day of the week. All in all, I love Return of the Jedi just like I love the other two films in the trilogy.Story After rescuing Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt, Luke Skywalker and Leia rejoin the Rebel Alliance to destroy the 2nd Death Star while Luke prepares for his final challenge to confront his father, Darth Vader and the Emperor.What makes this movie great? Like I said in my review of the first Star Wars movie the characters and the story are the main focus and not the spectacle. The acting once again delivers 100% with Mark Hamill giving in my opinion probably his best performance as Luke Skywalker in the entire trilogy. Luke has matured at this point in the trilogy, more patient and the scene where he first uses his new green light saber at the Sarlaac pit is so awesome. Harrison Ford once again is great as Han Solo with the character being more mature in this one than the first two outings. Carrie Fisher once again is great, and I remember the first time I was watching this and the revelation of Leia being Luke's sister really surprised me. Billy Dee Williams once again brings his own charm as Lando, and Ian McDiarmid is really great at playing Emperor Palpatine.There are so many other things that work in this movie the Sarlaac Pit sequence, Yoda telling Luke there is another Skywalker which Luke learns through the spirit of Obi Wan that it's Leia, the speeder bike chase on Endor and the space battle where Lando destroys the 2nd Death Star. But most of all the final confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader with the Emperor relentlessly taunting Luke with lines such as Use your aggressive feelings boy! Let the hate flow through you! Luke of course has learned to use the discipline that he learned from Yoda and Obi Wan and not give in, and tries to get Darth Vader to come back from the dark side. But Luke nearly falls into the dark side when Darth Vader threatens to turn Leia to the dark side and Luke loses it and cuts off Vader's hand. Luke stops himself and refuses to give into the dark side, and the Emperor responds by shooting lighting out of his hands at Luke. Then comes in probably my favorite scene in the entire movie while the Emperor is electrocuting Luke, the camera pans up to Darth Vader's mask showing Vader looking back to the Emperor and back to Luke, and all of a sudden he lifts the Emperor and throws him down the reactor pit and the Emperor dies. The reason why I love this part so much is that the way the camera focuses on Darth Vader with the music playing in the background, the audience gets the impression that Vader's conflicted and then without saying a word, he decides that he will not let Palpatine kill his son, and is redeemed (Whatever you say, don't even get me started about the change George Lucas made in this scene). I have to admit, the scene where Luke removes Vader's mask gets me a bit emotional, especially when Vader says You were right about me.Watching this again recently made me realize how great and underrated this movie is despite the common complaint about the Ewoks. Again, the Ewoks don't really bother me and the Yub Nub song (the one before came another change I'd rather not talk about) makes me feel like a little kid again. This film works terrifically as the final chapter in the original trilogy with the character arcs ending on a positive note for the main characters and all is right with the galaxy. Return of the Jedi, along with the other two will always have a special place in my heart. This set of movies shaped my life in so many ways and gave me so many great experiences with my friends who also loved Star Wars, and my Dad who saw them in theaters back in the 70's and 80's and even my Mom (though she isn't really into Star Wars, even after she watched them with me. But it was worth a try). Regardless of how much hate George Lucas gets these days because of the prequels and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, people need to watch this and the other two original films again to be reminded of how great a saga George Lucas gave to the world. This is in my opinion one of the best conclusions in any trilogy, and like I said about the Ewoks, the fans need to let that go. In light of the recent news of Episode 7 currently in the works, let's hope whoever decides to direct the new trilogy in the future can bring back the spirit of Star Wars that was missing from the prequel trilogy.

Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead.She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government.At her husband's wake are just three Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept.The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees.

Perhaps the greatest of these movies is Frank Capra's timeless film Its A Wonderful Life staring the late, great James Stewart as everyday man George Bailey in small town America, Bedford Falls. George has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, longing to see the outside world but never able to get past the confines of the small savings and loans that he is in charge of. Then, one Christmas Eve, George's Uncle, Billy (played by the memorable character actor Thomas Mitchell) makes a terrible mistake that could ruin them both forever and George begins to think that everything would be better without him. It just so happens that heaven hears his and others' prays and sends an angel named Clarence (played by the understated but talented Henry Travers) to show him how wrong he is. In a Scrooge like role, we also have the great Lionel Barrymore in an excellent performance of Henry Potter, the richest and meanest man in town and in her most famous role, Donna Reed as George's loving and devoted wife. This is a movie that will make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and leave you with a sense that no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. Its A Wonderful Life is by far the greatest Christmas movie that has ever been produced and for that matter, will ever have been produced due to the time that it was made in and its message of how we all affect our fellow man, often times without even realizing it.

He has used it &#x96; or shall we say ripped it off &#x96; from Bradbury (and others) and turned it into countless formulaic stories and novels. Satan comes to a small town to wreck havoc, and it's always the same shticks, over and over, at least when it comes to his drivel. There are, however, worlds between how an intelligent, skillful writer such as Bradbury treated this idea and how a commercial, fluff-for-the-masses mediocrity such as King does. SWTWC is a moody, subtle, enjoyable take on the subject. King treats this type of story (his favourite story) with much more pomp, clichés, and very exaggerated and annoying small-town stereotypes &#x96; most of which reveal this left-winger's barely hidden resentment towards small-town folk (and people in general; perhaps he's just frustrated that nearly all of us are much prettier than him). King wrote these kinds of stories with the primary intention of dragging small-town America through the mud, because - as every good Marxist - he detests the success of democracy and Capitalism, and nothing annoys him more than religious folk. (I am an atheist myself, and yet I do not hate believers the way King does.) No such pathetic, sociopathic, misanthropic tendencies are to be found in SWTWC.The movie has an excellent visual quality; the photography, the look of the movie is reason enough to watch it. Most of the special effects stand up very well to today's CGI; there is very little of that miserable cheesy quality or hoakeyness that some 80s fantasy movies have. It's a Disney flick, but it strikes a fairly decent balance between a kid's movie and adult horror, although obviously leaning more toward the former. Nowadays, the Disney conglomerate would be hard-pressed to squeeze anything of quality out of its ravaged\/fruitless Mickey Mouse butt, let alone make a movie that either kids (with taste) or adults (with brains) can like. (I do not count Pixar's movies as Disney produce.)The only beef I have with SWTWC centers around Jason Robards. No, not the actor himself; he is excellent, as always (one of the very few top-notch nepotists in Hollywood). I am referring first-and-foremost to the age difference between him and his wife, played by a useless nepotist that goes by the name of Ellen Geer; she was 42 at the time of filming, he was 61, which is simply ludicrous. Far from make-up reducing the difference between them, they actually look as if there's 30 years between them - though this is by no means intended as a compliment to the homely Geer. Robards looks like the kid's grandpa, not his father. The other thing that I found silly was Mr. Halloway's unlikely\/exaggerated obsession with his failure to save his son from drowning a few years earlier. It would make perfect sense had his son drowned - but he didn't. Halloway (Robards) even states that he harbors ill-feelings toward the man who saved his son &#x96; which I find highly far-fetched and a bit of a leap; it would imply that the life of his son takes a backseat to his own Ego, i.e. the issue of whether he is a real man and brave father. Still, I guess the story needed some kind of inner conflict in order to make the all pieces fall together in the movie's evil-snuffs-it finale.For other film versions of Bradbury's material, I highly recommend Fahrenheit 451, and especially the lesser-known, fairly ignored gem The Illustrated Man.

Nowadays, the Disney conglomerate would be hard-pressed to squeeze anything of quality out of its ravaged\/fruitless Mickey Mouse butt, let alone make a movie that either kids (with taste) or adults (with brains) can like. (I do not count Pixar's movies as Disney produce.)The only beef I have with SWTWC centers around Jason Robards. No, not the actor himself; he is excellent, as always (one of the very few top-notch nepotists in Hollywood). I am referring first-and-foremost to the age difference between him and his wife, played by a useless nepotist that goes by the name of Ellen Geer; she was 42 at the time of filming, he was 61, which is simply ludicrous. Far from make-up reducing the difference between them, they actually look as if there's 30 years between them - though this is by no means intended as a compliment to the homely Geer. Robards looks like the kid's grandpa, not his father. The other thing that I found silly was Mr. Halloway's unlikely\/exaggerated obsession with his failure to save his son from drowning a few years earlier. It would make perfect sense had his son drowned - but he didn't. Halloway (Robards) even states that he harbors ill-feelings toward the man who saved his son &#x96; which I find highly far-fetched and a bit of a leap; it would imply that the life of his son takes a backseat to his own Ego, i.e. the issue of whether he is a real man and brave father. Still, I guess the story needed some kind of inner conflict in order to make the all pieces fall together in the movie's evil-snuffs-it finale.For other film versions of Bradbury's material, I highly recommend Fahrenheit 451, and especially the lesser-known, fairly ignored gem The Illustrated Man. ","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 December 2012","score":"","review":" The devil-comes-to-town premise is one that Stephen King has practically built half his smelly career on. He has used it &#x96; or shall we say ripped it off &#x96; from Bradbury (and others) and turned it into countless formulaic stories and novels. Satan comes to a small town to wreck havoc, and it's always the same shticks, over and over, at least when it comes to his drivel. There are, however, worlds between how an intelligent, skillful writer such as Bradbury treated this idea and how a commercial, fluff-for-the-masses mediocrity such as King does. SWTWC is a moody, subtle, enjoyable take on the subject. King treats this type of story (his favourite story) with much more pomp, clichés, and very exaggerated and annoying small-town stereotypes &#x96; most of which reveal this left-winger's barely hidden resentment towards small-town folk (and people in general; perhaps he's just frustrated that nearly all of us are much prettier than him). King wrote these kinds of stories with the primary intention of dragging small-town America through the mud, because - as every good Marxist - he detests the success of democracy and Capitalism, and nothing annoys him more than religious folk. (I am an atheist myself, and yet I do not hate believers the way King does.) No such pathetic, sociopathic, misanthropic tendencies are to be found in SWTWC.The movie has an excellent visual quality; the photography, the look of the movie is reason enough to watch it.

The reasons for that explanation is because of the stars and similar story lines of each movie. With Goodfellas and Casino, both movies starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and were directed by Martin Scorsese. When it comes to both Scarface and Carlito's Way, both movies star Al Pacino and were directed by Brian De Palma. And even actors that played minor roles in one movie appear in some capacity in their counterparts. Also in the past, there were weekends were I would watch both sets of movies together but on separate days from each other. But of course, there are differences between Tony Montana and Carlito Brigante. Tony Montana was basically a Cuban refugee hoodlum who along with other Cuban refugees, arrives in Miami, Florida during the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980 and within a few years becomes the top drug lord in Miami and uses cocaine as a source of power. But that particular drug also contributes to his downfall in the end. With Carlito Brigante, he's a Nuyorican(Puerto Rican New Yorker) ex drug lord who returns to the streets of New York City in 1975 after serving 5 years of a 30 year prison sentence. Now planning to live a legitimate crime free life, he also tries to rekindle his relationship with Gail(Penelope Ann Miller) that he had before his imprisonment. But there are two causes to Carlito's downfall. The first is his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)who not only has a very bad cocaine addiction but is corrupt and is also a retaliatory target of incarcerated Italian mob boss, Tony Tony T Taglialucci(Frank Minucci), another one of his clients. Carlito's second downfall is Benny Blanco who is a young, inexperienced punk who is trying to rise up in the drug trade by trying to surpass Carlito and is played by actor\/comedian John Leguizamo, respectively. But in the end, is it Carlito himself that contributes to his downfall just for having a loyal trust in Kleinfeld and Pachanga(Luis Guzman), an old friend from his past. Carlito's Way was released in 1993 for which it was 10 years apart from Scarface(which was released in 1983). And another difference between each movie is the musical score. With Scarface, the score was conducted by Giorgio Moroder and was synthesizer based. With Carlito's Way, the score was conducted by Patrick Doyle and was more symphonic\/orchestra based. But the soundtrack also consisted of songs from 1970's Disco groups such as KC and the Sunshine Band, The O Jays, The Hues Corporation, The Bee Gees, LaBelle, etc. that fit the time period of the movie(1975). And the soundtrack also consisted of songs from Latin music artists such as Celia Cruz, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, and Santana as well. And besides the other aforementioned actors, the other actors that comprised the cast such as James Rebhorn, Viggo Mortensen, Adrian Pasdar, Joseph Siravo, Richard Foronjy, John Ortiz, Ingrid Rogers and the late Argentinian comedic actor, Jorge Porcel(in his only American acting appearance) also put in good performances in this movie. And besides Al Pacino, other Scarface alumni such as Al Israel(Hector), Angel Salazar(Chi Chi), Cesar Cordova(Cuban cook), and Mike Moran(Nick the Pig)also make brief cameos in Carlito's Way. Just like he perfected the Cuban accent for Tony Montana in Scarface, Pacino perfects the Nuyorican accent for Carlito Brigante in Carlito's Way, even if he is an Italian-American actor. Although Carlito's Way Rise to Power was, in my opinion, a good prequel starring Jay Hernandez as a young Carlito in his early years, it will never compare to the original film from 1993. Carlito's Way, in my opinion, is another great gangster film that should be included in the ranks with The Godfather trilogy, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Casino, A Bronx Tale, and of course, Scarface(both versions from 1932 and 1983\/Al Pacino respectively). Also, look out for a director's trademark that director Brian De Palma left in both movies that involves a gun that includes a silencer and an arm in a sling. Of course, both Scarface and Carlito's Way have to be watched together side by side to find that director's trademark along with its symbolism.

I must admit that I enjoyed the previous two films more than this one but there's still enough laughs here to make this one well worth seeing. I think the film certainly has some flaws in it but when there are so many laughs you really can't complain too much. I think Chase is in fine form as he goes more over-the-top here than in the previous installments. He's so wild here that at times he seems like he's playing a cartoon character. This certainly isn't a bad thing as Chase can handle this type of comedy but there were a few too many slapstick scenes early on. I think what really makes this film so memorable is the terrific supporting cast. Beverly D'Angelo is just fine as the supporting wife but we get terrific work from Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Juliette Lewis, John Randolph, William Hickey, Brian Doyle-Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Mae Questel. The stand out however has to be Randy Quaid returning as Cousin Eddie. The actor really does a terrific job bringing this character to life and the comic timing is just flawless no matter what he's doing. There are so many classic scenes here that it's hard to pick out the best but some of the highlights include the cat sequence, the walk through Wal Mart, the hilarious dog-under-the-table and of course the first appearance of Eddie.

It is awful in almost every aspect with very few positives you will be able to accumulate. However - strangely I agree - Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane (Schwarzenegger, Thurman, Swenson) are able to claw Joel Schumacher's dreadful efforts some bizarre credibility in my eyes. Why? Has he lost his mind (me)? Well perhaps, though I find the performances from the villainous trio so corny and over exaggerated its quite simply hilarious! Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Freeze is so obviously humorous due to the amount of clichéd puns and one liners that Schumacher managed to cram into his script; this on top of the fact that Schwarzenegger's acting abilities are aren't the best paves way for some enjoyable comedic parody moments.Meanwhile, Uma Thurman, who we now all know for her astounding performances in Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' and 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' was so false as the evil temptress she made accusations that the World was going to end on 21\/12\/2012 seem possible! Again, full of woefully out of place dialogue, she proves to be another bizarrely entertaining highlight.Also, lets not forget Jeep Swenson's humiliation at the hands of Schumacher with the way he was forced to portray the brainless Bane. He appears in comparison to a cross between a bear and an idiot which may lose the character's credibility, but will raise an eyebrow or perhaps a chuckle.The narrative - does it need explanation? Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) must try to protect Gotham citizens from the hands of the high profile lunatics Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and Bane (Joel Swenson).In some cases, some decent battles are fought between O'Donnell and Clooney against their nemesis' but for the most part, highlights are only present because the movie is so abysmally awful!

Roadhouse is a lot of bad fun from a director who knows how to make films, coupled with a screenwriter who knows how to write them. Offered a chance to clean up this really bad nightclub, The Double Deuce, in a town owned by a really bad man Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) Dalton (Swayze) freely gives over his sports car (he doesn't like to fly) and takes his merc. Before he makes it to the door, of this redneck establishment, a guy comes flying out of this bar. Put in charge, Dalton (you could say he sets the bar straight) ha ha, fires a few bouncers, and a barmaid for selling drugs, before he gives a lecture on how this show is to run from now on, re-itering his point on being nice, to the point of not being nice. You should see what happens if you come at Swayze with a knife. After all he's majored in philosophy, and obviously by his I knew it smile, he's had his car tires slashed more than once. He's also a charmer, and has a such a way with words, especially to one of Gazzara's goon's hottie girlfriends. Also pain doesn't bother Dalton. Why? He doesn't let it. I never heard anything so stupid. Unfortunately the people he sacked, and he sacks a few more, one skimming the till, the other, a stud type, doing a hot bimbo in a backroom, are associate's of Wesley's, so you know what this means. Roadhouse is violent in other parts, an exaggeration of bar fights, and their bouncers where this one is more like a zoo. He requests his old bouncer friend come down (Sam Elliot) who he recommended to the Double's Deuces owner (Kevin Tighe from that hit t.v. series, Emergency, remember) at the start. They make a hell of a team too. Swayze falls in love with a medic, (Kelly Lynch) who compliments his stitch work, from a wound he took at the Deuce. And guess what? She was also once involved with Wesley. We finally come to a point in the movie where we've taken enough of Gazzara, who really is CRAZY! and realize Swayze has to end him. Though a bit overly violent, Roadhouse is good fun, but again falls to lame brainer status. Swayze, the avenger in the end, with his support, provide an almost stereotypical climax killing off Wesley's goons, before getting Wesley, one chubby fella having a stuffed polar bear fall on top of him in his trophy room. Swayze adds a comic line to end this shot, very much the same way, Seagal would. Actually this long climactic part, ran similar rivers as in that Burt Reynold's flop, Malone. Roadhouse ends happily with a great sound track, and may a new day begin at the Double Deuce until the next trouble maker walks through the door.
