Sean Connery could have been OK as Arthur but he delivers a very weak performance, mostly due to the horrid script I believe. Perhaps he realised the kind of crap they were creating and lost interest.The story in itself is an unforgivable rape of the Arthur mythology - the idea to take a minor villain from an obscure medieval romance and turn him into the one that overthrows Arthur's reign is simply atrocious. Arthur's realm is portrayed as a weak little kingdom that topples over at first sight of trouble, and Arthur himself comes across as a jealous despot. The Arthur story - especially the love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot - contains a lot more depth than this movie shows you.Also, the fight scenes are seem a little meek and the knights' armour seem more like something from Star Trek than any kind of actual medieval protective gear.If you want to see a good Arthur movie, I'd recommend Excalibur, Merlin or even the latest installment; King Arthur.

After Tim Burton was released as director...due to the sexuality and violence of Returns not being marketable enough for big sponsors like McDonalds, Joel Schumacher of The Client and The Lost Boys was given a shot at the directors chair. Schumacher was hired primarily for his unique style and ability to balance the light and dark in a film. Michael Keaton decided not to take the reigns as star for a 3rd time around, so he was replaced by Val Iceman Kilmer. And Robin finally gets his first appearance as batman's sidekick. Here played by Chris O'Donnell, respectively. While the film may be flawed in terms of a few plot holes and a bit of overacting, it stresses a larger point to the Batman legacy, as did Batman Begins. Begins teaches us why Batman is, and Forever teaches why Batman will always be.The film begins with our hero (Val Kilmer) hunting after his prison-escaped nemesis, Harvey Two-Face (Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones), the once crime fighting D.A. Harvey Dent. After failing to bring Two-Face to justice, Batman faces another challenge in the forms of Dr. Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is week in the knees for bad boys, and Edward Nygma, a maniacal employee of Wayne Enterprises. After Nygma proposes a new device that can allow the viewer of any television program to become one with the show, Wayne refuses, denouncing the idea of mind manipulation. Nygma, now rejected, vows vengeance. After receiving several disturbing letters in the form of riddles, Bruce Wayne engages the help of Dr. Meridian. Bruce, infatuated by Chase, asks her to join him at a Grand Circus, featuring all of Gotham's well-to-do. Whilst there, Two-Face crashes the party, armed with 200 sticks of TNT. Threatening to leave the place in ruins unless Batman's identity is given up, the acrobatic stars of the circus, the Graysons, attempt to stop the bomb. In their gallant attempt, Two-Face executes them. The only surviving son, Dick Grayson, managed to escape that very fate to dismantle the T.N.T. Dick, now alone and orphaned, is taken in by Bruce. Having gone through a similar situation with the murder of his parents, Bruce takes Dick under his wing (forgive the pun). Eventually, Nygma transforms into an alter ego known as The Riddler, and joins forces with Two-Face. After establishing himself as a brilliant tycoon as Edward Nygma with the release of his 3-D Box, he takes advantage of all the images and information being sucked out of Gotham's brainwaves. He would eventually devise a way to read men's minds. Between the Riddler and Two-Face discovering his identity, Chase's infatuation with Batman, Bruce's true love for Chase, and Dick Grayson's wanting to exact vengeance on Two-Face, Batman has his hands full. These conflicts all culminate in a raid on Wayne Manor and then a final battle on the Riddler's Claw island fortress, in which Robin makes his first venture in heroism.Between the dazzling special effects, the newly written musical score by Elliott Goldenthal (no where near as effective as Danny Elfman's haunting score, but still damn good), and the new and fresh performance as the Dark Knight\/Bruce Wayne by Val Kilmer, this film is sure to please anyone who was disappointed with Batman & Robin or Batman Returns. My final comments will go to the cast. While Kilmer was effective as Batman, giving us something both new and something we have seen in Michael Keaton's portrayal, I was surprised to see how well he fit into the role. His voice, his body movements, and especially his billionaire, corporate C.E.O. version of Bruce Wayne that Keaton had not shown us, are all pluses for his performance. Tommy Lee Jones was only given one side of the personality of Two-Face. Thus giving us a wildly over the top, hot headed, but ultimately cool Two-Face. From the first shot we see him to the final confrontation between he and the dynamic duo; Jones gives to Two-Face what Nicholson gave to the Joker, an unrelenting dose of delicious evil. Jim Carrey was the ultimate choice for the Riddler. His tall, thin structure and extraordinarily comical body movements gave the Riddler what Frank Gorshin had done in the 60s with the same character. From the twirling of his golden , question-mark-topped-cane, and the skin tight green suit encumbered with jet black question marks, Carrey proves one of the best of Batman's on screen adversaries. Kidman was sexy and refreshing. But, if people think Two-Face is over the top, try a criminal psychiatrist who is turned on by the wrong kind of man. I kind of buy it, but over all I thought the best part of her character was when she decided to grow up and fall for a normal man (if you consider Bruce normal). Chris O'Donnell did hear what he should have followed up in Batman & Robin. And that is to keep the bad boy image going, and abandon any Burt Ward impersonation. Luckily enough, Burt Ward is no where to be found in this film. This film shows us why Batman will always be, as Batman Begins showed us why he is. Wayne in Begins confronts what he must become, as Wayne in this, must confront why he must continue.

Army didn't scare me, but i loved it all the same. i don't know what to expect from a fourth one....scarier than hell or campy fun, or both? i say, bring it on! he wont have any trouble getting real money for #4, which he didn't need in the first three to make them so truly great. so, trust me on this. if you love horror films, check out Evil Dead 2, dead by dawn. i wouldn't watch it alone either. i don't care how macho you are. it's an engaging roller-coaster,fun ride. not for the uninitiated and not for Sleepless in Seattle-type fans. this is pure, classic, camp with a great ending.

Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey convey the story and portray their roles to perfection. Midler also shines with her musical talent much of the time, especially with the theme song Wind Beneath My Wings. All things considered, the movie is great.Midler is Ceceila Carol C.C. Bloom, a New York aspiring entertainer with attitude and a drive to be successful in show business no matter what it takes (which she does). Hershey is Hillary Whitney, a rich kid from San Francisco with little experience beyond her posh and privileged upbringing. She and C.C. meet by chance on a beach in Atlantic City when they are 11 years old. They instantly become friends, and keep in touch with each other over 25 to 30 years through thick and thin (i.e. distance, career challenges, marriage and divorce, fights, jealousy, competition for the same man, etc). Fate and choice bring them together when they need each other most. Ultimately, their bond will be tested in a way they never imagined. How they deal with this challenge is what will determine their destiny as friends.Midler and Hershey round out the film with believable character development. They have their moments (C.C. can get on your nerves with her ego, and Hillary has her ways), but they prove that friendship weathers the most difficult of circumstances. The small supporting cast is nice as well, including Lainie Kazan as Leona Bloom (C.C.'s mother), John Heard as John Pierce, C.C.'s theater director husband, James Reed as Michael Essex, Hillary's husband, Spalding Gray as Dr. Richard Milstein who Midler takes interest in while living with Hillary in San Francisco, Mayim Bialik and Marcie Leeds as young C.C. and Hillary, and Grace Johnston as Victoria, Hillary's daughter in the latter half of the film. The Wind Beneath My Wings montage toward the end will make more than a few emotional. I highly recommend Beaches because it will make you truly appreciate and strive for the meaning of friendship and those most important to you!

It is, perhaps, among his best because of how modest, how quiet and how emotionally and psychologically affecting it is. Surprisingly so.It is the story of a classic introvert, played with magnificent discipline by Gena Rowlands, who has constructed a very tight shell around herself she never realized she lived behind. But from the moment we see her and hear her narrative voice in the opening frame, we see it. We feel it. And we relate to it while we also scoff at it.And bit by bit, in her small corner of life in Manhattan's old, stoney, by-the-park world where the film is set, Marion's shell is cracked and peeled by the inevitable twists of life, even for people like her. And the funny, coincidental shocks -- most penetratingly through a device Allen uses -- end up stirring Marion's self-doubt and self-awareness for the first time in her life. She whirrs to life, finally. She feels real pity, real humiliation, real regret, and real girlish passion under a Central Park bridge in the middle of a rainstorm.Indeed, much like a classic introvert, all of Marion's turning points happen when she is alone (except, of course, the romantic one -- but alas, it only is realized as she relives it alone in a room). And if you've ever hopelessly loved an introvert like Marion, you'll applaud Allen's insight into the way such people operate. Perhaps it's the only film of his in which Allen really communicates the hell and the loneliness of such a personality without any tonic of humor.But this is not a dreary film, far from it. It has a golden beauty to it despite the beigey-ness. When Marion's real warmth and humanity pulses to life in Another Woman, it has a hopefulness and naivety that redeems all of her blathery intellectualism, much like we must forgive some of Allen's dialogue which must read better in subtitles overseas than it sounds to us (much less so in this film than of its butterscotchy predecessor, September).Indeed, in Another Woman -- much like in the small-and-golden films that followed like Crimes and Misdemeanors, Shadows and Fog, Alice, and finally, with a gush of fully re-realized wonderful sentimentality in Everybody Says I Love You -- Allen doesn't hide so much behind his shtick and comes right out and says how he feels.Added in are some really fantastic cameo performances. Mia Farrow's whiny, hormonal character has a humanity to it that leaves just the right kind of taste in your mouth by the end. Blythe Danner is wonderful as the best friend who ends up being more (or perhaps less) complex than you initially realize, and Ian Holm is pitch-perfect as the moral match for Marion's cranially-steeled self. Martha Plimpton does the young, rich prep-school girl justice without making her a cartoon. Sandy Dennis' two scenes are riveting -- her character's emotionality clearly something Marion had an intense jealously toward (and Dennis hits it out of the park so well in a way that you imagine the main scene was done in one take). And John Houseman, in his last moments on screen, brings a sort of brave, memorable rawness to his speech about the end of life -- Allen owes a great debt to him for this.If you have someone like Marion in your life, someone intelligent whom you love yet you find maddeningly introverted and remote -- go onto Amazon and quietly send them Another Woman with a very sparing note. And while you probably shouldn't expect a very revealing note back a week or so after it arrives, be content to know that it will likely have quite an effect. A small and golden one.

It actually started out as a fairly uneventful evening before i flipped the channel to CBC where I found myself captivated by the stunning imagery and personal associations of this film. It was twenty five minutes into the movie but I decided to watch it anyways. I got comfortable and concentrated on the sequence of events and their portrayal. Sooner or later a commercial came and went, each one making me more eager to get me back into the storyline of the movie. As the last commercial ends and the movie comes back on, the story takes setting in a game show arena where I notice a sign in the audience stating Exodus 82. Being somewhat of a religious man I decided to look into it.

According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichés. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot &#150; as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface &#150; Jack's resentment as regards his wife, his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it, a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling, when Jack loses the plot completely, that he spouts lines from TV Honey, I'm home and Here's Johnny. Just watch some television, Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted mid-flow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality, it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be &#150; Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise (as if you hadn't noticed earlier) that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination, for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact, everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky, Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean, as much as I like Jack in the film, he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances, so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting &#150; just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene, one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene, into a comment on Jack's marriage &#150; his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blow-job from a ghost in a bear suit&#133; Man, I love absolutely everything about this film. It's horror for people who know that true horror isn't being stalked by a man in a mask, but being trapped alone with your family.

According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichés. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot &#150; as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there.

As a sequel, it's almost a remake, like was the case with the first two Terminator films; only a few things are changed, to make it seem like a new film. The fugitive in this film also claims to be innocent, and much of the film is similar to the first. The stakes are a tad higher, and there may be a bit more action that in the first. Apart from that, it's virtually the same film, albeit with worse direction. The plot is pretty good, the way it develops works well. The pacing is fairly good, at least early on. The acting is pretty good, with both Pantoliano and Jones again giving good performances, both returning to their respective roles from the first film. Neither are as funny as they were in the first, though. Wesley Snipes is a good choice for the new fugitive. The characters are well-written and credible. The action is pretty good and quite intense, but I think there may be too little of it... I found my mind drifting for most of the time I saw it, and it never really grabbed me the way it seems like it should have. Decent enough film, just not something worth going out of your way to see.

Fred then sees a tape where he kills Renee, and is arrested and sentenced to death. But he disappears from his cell and is replaced by Pete, a young auto-mechanic. Pete is released and starts having an affair with Alice, the mistress of a local mobster. Alice looks identical to Renee, and reveals that she was once a starlet in the mobster's porno film racket. Pete and Alice elope to the desert, where Alice disappears and Pete turns back into Fred. Fred finds the mobster in a motel with Renee (apparently alive), takes him out to the desert and kills him.

I don't really think I understood the story but I'm pretty sure I wasn't really supposed to either - once you get rid of cinema conventions like someone can only be in one place at a time, there's a lot of creative enjoyment to be had messing with both the characters and the audience. It's a great fever dream of a film (like Performance or Fitzcarraldo), where the slightly surreal ambiance creates a hypnotic echoing effect that sucks you into the movie. It's also a fabulous cinematic treatment, almost an exercise in clever and rarely-used techniques - daringly underexposed and overexposed shots, grainy video footage, image mosaics, reversed scenes, etc, all accompanied by stunning sound design which frequently crashes from whispered dialogue into deafening music cues. The cast have great fun with their roles, particularly Arquette (frequently in some state of undress), Loggia as the nasty gangster and Blake as the truly bizarre Mystery Man. My only criticism of this movie is the ending, which is okay, but doesn't really begin to answer any of the questions (are Fred and Pete one and the same, are Renee and Alice one and the same, who sends the videotapes, does Fred die, does Renee die, and most importantly, why is anyone doing what they are doing). A mystifying but marvellous picture from the unique David Lynch. And remember - never tailgate Robert Loggia !
