The first two movies were made before this event, in which Hollywood allowed ambitious directors to go after making the next big American movie. But The Godfather Part III was released post-Star Wars, from which the movie industry has yet to escape, in which the sole concern is making the next big American hit. Nevertheless, even though it is a lackluster companion piece to its predecessors, The Godfather Part III does work as a crime drama. Its dicey and uneven, but it does work.Quite some time has passed since the end of the second movie. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, still great) is now an old man, his family's empire has lost a lot of power, many of his old friends have gone, and a lot of his own family has distanced themselves from him. As he attempts to mend fences in his personal life, Michael also tries to control his temperamental nephew (Andy Garcia) and prevent another mafia war from erupting.The strongest aspect of The Godfather Part III, I think its general function as a nostalgia trip. It almost seems as if Coppola realized that he wasn't going to be able to make a third masterpiece and the best way to preserve as much of the original power is to remind us of the first two movies, but in a way that isn't shoddy or consumed by (too many) flashbacks. It is fascinating to see how the remaining principal characters have changed since the last two movies. How Michael has become worn down by his age and personal life. How his sister Connie (Talia Shire, very good in this movie) is still attempting to maintain a good relationship with the brother she once hated. We see some of the supporting faces, such as Al Neri (Richard Bright) and it becomes very fascinating, even though it is really more of like a history lesson than a character study.There are also some good story elements, too. For example, the relationship between Michael and his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton). First of all, seeing how they've changed physically and psychically is fascinating and uncovering the fact that they still love each other is a powerful element. Most interesting however is the doomed relationship between Andy Garcia as the aspiring new don and Sofia Coppola as Michael's spunky, independent daughter. Director Coppola and his two young performers take a relationship that is, without giving too much away, sort of taboo or unnerving, and makes it quite moving in its own unique way. They are interesting. Much more interesting than the villains.That is the core flaw of this movie, I think. There are no interesting antagonists. Nobody here is quite menacing or developed enough to really leave an impact. Great as Eli Wallach is in the movie (and let's admit, he was destined to be in one of the Godfather movies sooner or later) he frankly doesn't have much material to work with. Joe Mantegna, who overacts his part, is also dull. It does sound paradoxical for a movie that clocks around three hours in length to seem rushed. But it does. There is even a moment where Coppola's craft breaks in a scene where Michael suffers a stroke and we get a horrendous jump cut that stands out quite painfully, like a sore thumb. And a massacre scene in the middle of the story only reminds us how much better the climaxes of the first two movies were. Whereas those seemed brutal and terrifying, this one really seems staged with an overuse of cartoonishly-lit blood and rapid cuts between camera angles.And then there comes the problem with the ending. The emotional climax of the movie works quite well. Without giving it away, I'll just say it reminded me of a great scene from an Alfred Hitchcock movie from 1956 in terms of dramatic tension and suspense. At this point, I was almost willing to forgive the movie for all of its flaws. It was going to be a great ending to a magnificent saga. Then came those two final, unforgivably awful shots and a poor decision to finalize the story with a cut to black as opposed to a slow, dramatic fade.Yes, it does feel more like a coda to a big musical orchestra rather than a third act to one of the grandest stories ever told, but The Godfather Part III does work as a whole. There are some great dynamics here, even if they aren't fully realized, and the movie does, again work primarily as a nostalgia trip. No, lightning did not strike a third time. This time it just brushed it and some sparks made contact. Well, those sparks were strong enough. The Godfather Part III takes a while to get started, but it did leave me satisfied, if a little empty.

I didn't know how great an actress she was. I figured there must be some reason she was so highly regarded apart from her charity work. I had always intended to watch some of her early work in order to educate myself as to how the legend of Liz Taylor came to be, and with her recent passing, I decided to check out one of the first films in which she was allowed to show off the full-range of her acting abilities, A Place In The Sun. I'd already seen Montgomery Clift in a couple of films including Who Shot Liberty Valance? and found him a very evocative actor, my opinion of which was not changed by his performance in this role.The story is about George Eastman (Clift), the poorer relative of a blue-blood family. He comes to their town where his uncle, family patriarch Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes) sets him up with a lower-level job as a favor to his sister Hannah (Anna Revere, very steely and stiff-upper-lipped as a Salvation Army worker in the Midwest). George works hard and becomes involved in a relationship with his fellow factory worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). All seems to be going on quite normally in his life until he meets local luminary Alice Vickers (Taylor). Vickers is wealthy but her demeanor does not demean. She is warm and open and Eastman falls hard for her. This sets about a series of events which build the film gradually to a boil, as would a pot left over a roaring fire.As mentioned, the acting, by Taylor and Clift, but also by Winters, is excellent. The movie is apparently based on quite a famous novel and reading some comments, the general conclusion is that it is quite an impressive adaptation. Since I am not familiar with the novel, I will have to defer to the opinions of those wiser on the topic than myself. I found the plot and the progression of the story to be very compelling and if the novel is as compelling as other commenters indicate, surely the screenplay must be very good. Liz Taylor was 17 when she filmed this. There are not many other young actresses who could aspire to this level of acting sophistication at that age-Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and actresses such as the star of Kickass and Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider possibly spring to mind, but Taylor shows herself to be a natural and probably much better than the alluded actresses in this film. Clift is incredibly evocative. The comparisons to James Dean are not unwarranted and they are not demeaning either. Clift can depict an incredible amount of emotion simply with an arch of his eyebrows. He can steal scenes when he does not say a line.

I didn't know how great an actress she was. I figured there must be some reason she was so highly regarded apart from her charity work. I had always intended to watch some of her early work in order to educate myself as to how the legend of Liz Taylor came to be, and with her recent passing, I decided to check out one of the first films in which she was allowed to show off the full-range of her acting abilities, A Place In The Sun. I'd already seen Montgomery Clift in a couple of films including Who Shot Liberty Valance? and found him a very evocative actor, my opinion of which was not changed by his performance in this role.The story is about George Eastman (Clift), the poorer relative of a blue-blood family. He comes to their town where his uncle, family patriarch Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes) sets him up with a lower-level job as a favor to his sister Hannah (Anna Revere, very steely and stiff-upper-lipped as a Salvation Army worker in the Midwest). George works hard and becomes involved in a relationship with his fellow factory worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). All seems to be going on quite normally in his life until he meets local luminary Alice Vickers (Taylor). Vickers is wealthy but her demeanor does not demean. She is warm and open and Eastman falls hard for her. This sets about a series of events which build the film gradually to a boil, as would a pot left over a roaring fire.As mentioned, the acting, by Taylor and Clift, but also by Winters, is excellent. The movie is apparently based on quite a famous novel and reading some comments, the general conclusion is that it is quite an impressive adaptation. Since I am not familiar with the novel, I will have to defer to the opinions of those wiser on the topic than myself. I found the plot and the progression of the story to be very compelling and if the novel is as compelling as other commenters indicate, surely the screenplay must be very good. Liz Taylor was 17 when she filmed this. There are not many other young actresses who could aspire to this level of acting sophistication at that age-Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and actresses such as the star of Kickass and Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider possibly spring to mind, but Taylor shows herself to be a natural and probably much better than the alluded actresses in this film. Clift is incredibly evocative. The comparisons to James Dean are not unwarranted and they are not demeaning either. Clift can depict an incredible amount of emotion simply with an arch of his eyebrows. He can steal scenes when he does not say a line.

Horror films can be very good. John Carpenter's iconic 1978 thriller Halloween was good. Horror films can even be art. That's what I would categorize Jonathen Demme's The Silence of the Lambs and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho under. But it's kind of obviously why the genre is so heavily lambasted. When people see a bad action movie, they dismiss it and move on without giving it too much thought. When they see a bad horror movie, it sort of sets a trademark for the entire genre. Especially when it gives birth to a franchise and a remake, as Friday the 13th did.Having seen the original 1980 Friday the 13th directed by Sean S. Cunningham and having given it an unbiased critique, I must confess something I did not see anything - anything at all - that would make me believe that anybody would have liked it so much to have wanted to see an entire saga grow out of it. I'm told the movie hasn't aged well and its quote-unquote power has been run down by its imitators and followers, but I can't imagine it having had much at all to begin with. It's just so incredibly dull and derivative.We all know the story. Some horny, cigarette-chugging teenagers are hired to be summer counselors at Crystal Lake, where a little boy drowned some time before and a bunch of people were brutally murdered afterward. They show up and do their shtick. The shtick being what teenagers are required to do in cheap horror flicks. Then, slowly, one by one, would-be thrills ensue and fake blood splatters over the walls as we come to realize they are not alone in the middle of nowhere.What I think disturbed me the most about Friday the 13th was its incredibly dehumanizing, amoral outlook toward young people. When I mentioned these teenagers do their shtick, I was meaning they smoke cigarettes and who-knows-what-else, swear without purpose, and have sex in the cabins where little children are supposed to sleep. Keep in mind, these are supposed to be camp counselors, who are chosen for being respectable, good-mannered, and intelligent. There is a little extra hatred poured on toward the female half of the human race, with the the first victim of the new lot being an ambitious young lady wanting to fulfill her dreams. And then there's the ending, which I shall not give away out of decency for those who, heaven forbid, want to see this movie. But the outlook toward the male half of the human race is particularly immoral and unpleasant as well.And then comes the movie's empty-headed method of putting the audience in the place of the killer, with the camera oftentimes taking the murderer's point-of-view. That means clumsy hand-held cinema techniques, cheesy close-ups of screaming kids, and blood splattering in the background. Now when Steven Spielberg made Jaws or when John Carpenter made Halloween, a similar technique was used but it generated horror and apathy toward the killer. Here, it almost seems to imply respect, as if these kids deserve what they have coming. I don't buy it.Its morality-depraved nature aside, Friday the 13th is just an ambitious mess whose blatantly obvious knock-offs of its betters only makes it suffer worse. The craft is imperfect, with too many hand-held shots being blended with static locked-down ones. Intended to generate suspense as to when the killer is about to pop out, it instead left me tired. And keep in mind, I'm not particularly familiar with the killer-chasing-teens genre. The musical score by Harry Manfredini, particularly the murderer's theme, is a cheap knock-off of Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho and sometimes we even hear a thump-thump-thump on the soundtrack that left me looking around for a great white shark instead of a creep holding a hatchet. A lot of shots also resemble shots in Halloween, furthering my reminder of just how much better that movie was. It almost seems as if the director had never seen any other movies besides the three that I've mentioned several times and was completely unaware of a new way to tell a story. He even uses a cheap rip-off from Psycho for his twist of an ending, where the killer is revealed. Again, just reminding the audience of how infinitely better that movie was than this one.I'll now answer the question I'm sure that's being asked. Did it scare me? No. As a measure of my boredom, I will refer to a scene in the third act. One teenager is still alive and, of course, is being stalked. Instead of biting my nails or sweating or watching out for the killer, I found myself thinking about my computer science class, a subject which bores the living daylights out of me, and how I could solve my next assignment. Because that was more interesting than what I saw on the screen.The performances by the cast, save for one actress, who also detests the movie and received a lot of infamy for this picture, are good enough, but they belong in better movies. Halloween was a picture that dealt with similar material but did it in a way that was artistic, respectful toward humanity, and did not try to make us identify with a sicko and condemn the victims. Friday the 13th is suffer-able; it can be endured. I sat through it without too much difficulty. But it is a very empty, thrill-deprived horror film and the fact that it spawned an entire franchise only makes me like it less.

It was the film that begun the Summer blockbuster. Something Corman was quick to pick up on.Roger Corman was infamous for producing movies that were veiled imitations of more successful films. Jaws inspired several imitators. And Piranha is probably one of the most blatant. It has a very similar plot. Instead of a shark, mutant piranha fish escape into the river and head for a crowded tourist resort. The owners refuse to shut down because its Summer season, and it isn't long before all hell breaks loose. Piranha is at least to be commended for not trying to hide that its a ripoff. One of the opening sequences even has the heroine playing a Jaws arcade game!Piranha was the sole directing debut of genre regular Joe Dante. Dante is a hardcore horror\/SF fan, and every one of his films is jam-packed with affectionate references and cameos from the era. After enjoying some success with Piranha and then The Howling, Dante fell into the company of Steven Spielberg (luckily he saw the funny side of Piranha), who produced for him the runaway success of Gremlins. (Piranha is in many ways a warm-up to that film.) Sadly time has not been kind to Joe Dante. Since the big hit of Gremlins, none of his other films have attracted the same attention. With an increasingly sporadic career, Dante has almost disappeared completely as a key genre figure.Dante was brought on as a hired gun for Piranha, but many of his trademarks are there. Occasional cutaways to horror movies in the background. Horror icons Kevin McCarthy and Barbara Steele make up part of the cast, and Dante regular Dick Miller makes his customary appearance. But first and foremost, Piranha is exploitation cinema. That demands a certain amount of killings, suspense and lots and lots of blood and gore. So it doesn't have the same personal imprint Dante has on his subsequent films.For what was intended as a quickie rip-off of a far more successful monster movie, Piranha emerges far better than one expects. Its no classic (a surprising number of people say it is) but as B-movies go, its better than most. Joe Dante knows his stuff and handles things like an old pro. And he's working from a decent script too, courtesy of John Sayles. Sayles writes two amusing heroes for the film, Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) and Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies).Paul is a cynical misanthrope with a drinking problem and a daughter he hardly sees. Maggie is a sunny skip-tracer, looking for two teenagers lost on the mountain where Paul lives a hermetic existence. The two teens stumbled across an abandoned military base and went for a midnight swim in a pool. They had no way to know it was filled with mutant piranha. When Maggie forces a reluctant Paul to lead her there she drains the pool, unknowingly throwing out the piranhas with the bath water. Now its a race against time to stop the piranha before they reach the resort and the summer camp where Paul's daughter is.Although working from one of Roger Corman's typical cheapskate production budgets, Joe Dante economises it as much as he can and produces a taut, suspenseful chase\/chomp adventure. They can't really show us the piranhas (except for fleeting glimpses) because they just didn't have the money for that. But compared to a lot of the other ripoffs of Jaws, Dante uses the same thinking that Spielberg did. Make the budget restrictions work for you. If you can't show the monster, imply one. Most of the time, all Dante has to do is show people paddling in the lake and that's enough to imply the piranhas as a presence.Dante proves he's capable of generating fine suspense when he wants to. Like when Paul and Maggie are on a raft heading for dry land and the piranhas start chewing away at the lashings. Or the end sequence when Paul tries to kill the piranhas with pollution from a submerged smelting tank (with some excellent underwater photography) and they start attacking him from all sides.Like any Dante film, even when making a horror movie, Piranha has a constant sense of humour. The film never takes itself too seriously, and John Sayles' script comes with lots of snarky one-liners. When Maggie asks Paul for a cigarette, he grumbles I had to quit that. It interfered with my drinking. Or the blackly funny scene when Paul and Maggie are arrested and Maggie stages a jail break. She knocks out the guard with a piece of the toilet lid but the keys are chained to his pants. So she has to take them off! When she moves too slowly for Paul's liking he whines I would have thought you could get a man's pants off quicker than that!All the cast give good performances. The grumpy Paul and the cheery Maggie are a fun double act. The kiddie scenes come with a tolerable degree of sentiment. And Barbara Steele outshines everyone with her icy stare. Piranha manages to deliver the goods on all counts. It isn't quite the classic creature feature some people like to call it. That is putting it on too high a pedestal. But its a fun, breezy B-movie with a delightfully dark twist in the tale. And who couldn't love a film with lines like The piranhas are eating the guests Sir!

But compared to a lot of the other ripoffs of Jaws, Dante uses the same thinking that Spielberg did. Make the budget restrictions work for you. If you can't show the monster, imply one. Most of the time, all Dante has to do is show people paddling in the lake and that's enough to imply the piranhas as a presence.Dante proves he's capable of generating fine suspense when he wants to. Like when Paul and Maggie are on a raft heading for dry land and the piranhas start chewing away at the lashings. Or the end sequence when Paul tries to kill the piranhas with pollution from a submerged smelting tank (with some excellent underwater photography) and they start attacking him from all sides.Like any Dante film, even when making a horror movie, Piranha has a constant sense of humour. The film never takes itself too seriously, and John Sayles' script comes with lots of snarky one-liners. When Maggie asks Paul for a cigarette, he grumbles I had to quit that. It interfered with my drinking. Or the blackly funny scene when Paul and Maggie are arrested and Maggie stages a jail break. She knocks out the guard with a piece of the toilet lid but the keys are chained to his pants. So she has to take them off! When she moves too slowly for Paul's liking he whines I would have thought you could get a man's pants off quicker than that!All the cast give good performances. The grumpy Paul and the cheery Maggie are a fun double act. The kiddie scenes come with a tolerable degree of sentiment. And Barbara Steele outshines everyone with her icy stare. Piranha manages to deliver the goods on all counts. It isn't quite the classic creature feature some people like to call it. That is putting it on too high a pedestal.

In the case of Roger Corman, the man was a virtual bloodhound. When Jaws became the monster hit of 1975, its success was something the likes of which even Hollywood had never seen before. It was the film that begun the Summer blockbuster. Something Corman was quick to pick up on.Roger Corman was infamous for producing movies that were veiled imitations of more successful films. Jaws inspired several imitators. And Piranha is probably one of the most blatant. It has a very similar plot. Instead of a shark, mutant piranha fish escape into the river and head for a crowded tourist resort. The owners refuse to shut down because its Summer season, and it isn't long before all hell breaks loose. Piranha is at least to be commended for not trying to hide that its a ripoff. One of the opening sequences even has the heroine playing a Jaws arcade game!Piranha was the sole directing debut of genre regular Joe Dante. Dante is a hardcore horror\/SF fan, and every one of his films is jam-packed with affectionate references and cameos from the era. After enjoying some success with Piranha and then The Howling, Dante fell into the company of Steven Spielberg (luckily he saw the funny side of Piranha), who produced for him the runaway success of Gremlins. (Piranha is in many ways a warm-up to that film.) Sadly time has not been kind to Joe Dante. Since the big hit of Gremlins, none of his other films have attracted the same attention. With an increasingly sporadic career, Dante has almost disappeared completely as a key genre figure.Dante was brought on as a hired gun for Piranha, but many of his trademarks are there. Occasional cutaways to horror movies in the background. Horror icons Kevin McCarthy and Barbara Steele make up part of the cast, and Dante regular Dick Miller makes his customary appearance. But first and foremost, Piranha is exploitation cinema. That demands a certain amount of killings, suspense and lots and lots of blood and gore. So it doesn't have the same personal imprint Dante has on his subsequent films.For what was intended as a quickie rip-off of a far more successful monster movie, Piranha emerges far better than one expects. Its no classic (a surprising number of people say it is) but as B-movies go, its better than most. Joe Dante knows his stuff and handles things like an old pro. And he's working from a decent script too, courtesy of John Sayles. Sayles writes two amusing heroes for the film, Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) and Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies).Paul is a cynical misanthrope with a drinking problem and a daughter he hardly sees. Maggie is a sunny skip-tracer, looking for two teenagers lost on the mountain where Paul lives a hermetic existence. The two teens stumbled across an abandoned military base and went for a midnight swim in a pool. They had no way to know it was filled with mutant piranha. When Maggie forces a reluctant Paul to lead her there she drains the pool, unknowingly throwing out the piranhas with the bath water. Now its a race against time to stop the piranha before they reach the resort and the summer camp where Paul's daughter is.Although working from one of Roger Corman's typical cheapskate production budgets, Joe Dante economises it as much as he can and produces a taut, suspenseful chase\/chomp adventure.

Drew Barrymore's character displays the perfect diagnostic criteria for a Borderline. She is reactive to certain situations and rapidly changes moods with overwhelming emotions, she is exactly like me.*Contains Spoilers* A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. In the beginning Drew Barrymore is exciting, interesting, wild, and intense. She falls completely in love with Chis O'Donnell's character and obsessed with him. When he refuses to leave class after she pulls the alarm she doesn't talk to him for days. Their relationship becomes very intense and leads to concern from their parents. Chris really shines in this movie because he plays the perfect responsible and care-giving individual that would be attracted to and give care to Drew. He is innocent and naive which is the type of person a borderline would desire.Impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving). This is the most obvious in the movie. She pulls the fire alarm, she takes a trip with Chris to a waterfall during school hours. She jumps into the lake after she and her parents have a fight. She runs away from home with O'Donnell in fear that their parents will send her away and have her leave Chris. She drives recklessly while turning the last minute only to wreck the car. She attacks the driver that picks her up and steals his car. Drives off after she catches Chris talking to her mother in fear that he is trying to abandon her. Smokes cigarettes. I believe because it was a PG rated movie they did not have her do drugs or have sex with many partners.Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself. She pulls a gun to both of their heads, and attempts suicide. She talks about her parents and her father which makes her upset and she goes into the bathroom and starts crying and having an anxiety attack. Threatens to kill herself and holds a gun to her head. I believe they didn't make her a cutter because of the PG rating.Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). She pastes pictures of dozens of faces from magazines in an insane sort of of way. The episode in the bathroom also.Chronic feelings of emptiness Her behavior is an example of her feelings of emptiness. When she calls late at night because she just needed to hear from him. It's hard to explain this but as a borderline myself i did the same thing. It's like you fear the person doesn't love you anymore and you need reassurance constantly.Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights). She burns the guy in the car with her cigarette.Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms. When Chris is selling his telescope for cash she spaces out and experiences a dissociative moment as if she is seeing the world out of herself. This is a good example because of the camera work and score. She believes he doesn't want her anymore just because he calls her parents.Identity disturbance markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. This as with feelings of emptiness, is seen throughout the movie by her behavior in general. I think an example of this is when she posts all of the pictures of women from magazines so they can 'look at her' makes her feel a sense of identity.Over all this movie perfectly shows the personality of a Borderline Personality Disorder sufferer. Medications can't really help other than treating symptoms like depression or anxiety.

Drew Barrymore's character displays the perfect diagnostic criteria for a Borderline. She is reactive to certain situations and rapidly changes moods with overwhelming emotions, she is exactly like me.*Contains Spoilers* A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. In the beginning Drew Barrymore is exciting, interesting, wild, and intense. She falls completely in love with Chis O'Donnell's character and obsessed with him. When he refuses to leave class after she pulls the alarm she doesn't talk to him for days. Their relationship becomes very intense and leads to concern from their parents. Chris really shines in this movie because he plays the perfect responsible and care-giving individual that would be attracted to and give care to Drew. He is innocent and naive which is the type of person a borderline would desire.Impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving). This is the most obvious in the movie. She pulls the fire alarm, she takes a trip with Chris to a waterfall during school hours. She jumps into the lake after she and her parents have a fight. She runs away from home with O'Donnell in fear that their parents will send her away and have her leave Chris. She drives recklessly while turning the last minute only to wreck the car. She attacks the driver that picks her up and steals his car. Drives off after she catches Chris talking to her mother in fear that he is trying to abandon her. Smokes cigarettes. I believe because it was a PG rated movie they did not have her do drugs or have sex with many partners.Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself. She pulls a gun to both of their heads, and attempts suicide. She talks about her parents and her father which makes her upset and she goes into the bathroom and starts crying and having an anxiety attack. Threatens to kill herself and holds a gun to her head. I believe they didn't make her a cutter because of the PG rating.Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). She pastes pictures of dozens of faces from magazines in an insane sort of of way. The episode in the bathroom also.Chronic feelings of emptiness Her behavior is an example of her feelings of emptiness. When she calls late at night because she just needed to hear from him. It's hard to explain this but as a borderline myself i did the same thing. It's like you fear the person doesn't love you anymore and you need reassurance constantly.Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights). She burns the guy in the car with her cigarette.Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms. When Chris is selling his telescope for cash she spaces out and experiences a dissociative moment as if she is seeing the world out of herself. This is a good example because of the camera work and score. She believes he doesn't want her anymore just because he calls her parents.Identity disturbance markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. This as with feelings of emptiness, is seen throughout the movie by her behavior in general. I think an example of this is when she posts all of the pictures of women from magazines so they can 'look at her' makes her feel a sense of identity.Over all this movie perfectly shows the personality of a Borderline Personality Disorder sufferer.

Unfortunately, they are wasted on Lee's loosey goosey directing. Jungle Fever opens with Spike Lee's favorite character of all time, New York. After a plethora of images of street signs, subways, Harlem, and the words Spike Lee we open on a slow motion shot of a newspaper flying through the air...which seems to have no other significance than presenting the words The New York Times! After which we see a sex scene with Flipper played by Wesley Snipes loudly making love with his black wife. Why mention black? Because this is a movie about race, and since Jungle Fever is not gonna put in the effort to tactfully express its theme neither will I. Flipper is an upper-middle class architect working at a firm controlled by two white men. Although putting it in pen and paper that he requests a black secretary instead he is given a young Italian American woman named Angie. Angie lives at home providing the motherly stand in for her very Italian father and brothers. Flipper and Angie, never having been intimate with anyone outside their race (except for Flipper's half Caucasian wife) work late into the evenings and eventually build an attraction to each other which Spike Lee calls Jungle Fever. Thus, their interracial affair begins causing tension to build and explode between a multitude of characters. In addition Flipper also has a crack head brother played by Samuel L Jackson who runs around with his crackhead girlfriend played by Halle Berry looking to score cash from all his bloodlines including his poor mother who can't help but give into her 1st son when he does a little dance. The film's time is split between an assortment of characters who make up a collection of stories on interracial relationships and the ethnic hardships of New York Blacks and Italians. To give an example of how over handed and disjointed the racism is portrayed there is a scene where Flipper and Angie are pretend boxing. Flipper grabs Angie pinning her onto a car when Police officers show up forcing Flipper in a submissive position shoving a gun into his face. Obviously they had misread the situation but with Flipper screaming I'm gonna kill you! with his hands on her neck its understandable why the officers jumped to that conclusion. There's also a scene where Angie's father beats her for having relations with a nigger. Perhaps it's the age of the film and people back then needed racism to be spelled out in a very overt and sensational manner. Jungle Fever is without a center jumping all over the place with extremely poor editing. The editor Samuel Pollard has edited mainly documentaries since, which is fantastic. The further he stays away from narratives the better. I'm trying to figure out how these scenes possibly transitioned into one another in script. I know that Lee likes to do harsh transitions but this film is just ridiculous. Jungle Fever is littered with ueven pacing and scenes that lose their punch because people need to walk in and out of frame. Example Flipper and Angie are being ignored at a restruant because they're interracial then at the end of the scene when Queen Latifah, playing the waitress, walks off there's a 3 second cutaway where two bystanders say She's White!? Mhmm Hmm Jungle Fever is a film that indulgently satisfies itself. You feel ever bit of Lee's directorial manipulation while be beats you over the head with dialogue after dialogue about people's opinion on race & society. In fact there is a four minute scene of 5-6 black women just talking in a room about how about how they are disenfranchised. What is the point of a camera if you're just going to film taking heads? The camera angles and techniques in this film are all over the place in this film. In a scene where Flipper is asking for partner the camera just spins around them for about 3 minutes. I'm sure it was hard technique to film but why do these obtrusive techniques show up randomly throughout the film. I'm wondering if Lee showed up on set and rolled a dice every day. OH look It's a 3, that means today I wanna put me and Wesley on a dolly and we are just gonna do this scene like we're drifting like ghosts. Strange camera techniques like these make me believe that Spike Lee wanted to make an experimental film. On the plus note all the actors are amazing and Spike Lee has a great eye for talent. Samuel Jackson STEALS this movie! Every scene with Jackson is a treasure and I'm sure when he's given his life time achievement award and there showing clips of his work, Jungle Fever will be contained in that reel. This movie is fun to watch to watch for the acting but I would recommend a more contemporary film such as Everday People 2004 if you wanted to see a New York film dealing with race.

But in Scream's case this rule is broken. Scream 2 is not only better than the original film but it's also got a better group to back the original leads Sidney, Dewey, and Gale up. Jerry O'Connell, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, and Marisol Nichols all take part in this great sequel and whether their roles are short or long, they are appreciated.Scream did however mess with one thing in it's years; the self aware aspect. It works in this film, and it's good because the film, like I said, knows when to be scary and knows when to be witty. The sad thing is Scream did so well that now it makes other horror films like newer installments of Friday the 13th and I Know What You Did Last Summer feel like they need to be self aware to be good. Not the case.Scream has the right writing and direction to accomplish such a goal. The characters know they are in a real life sequel. Wes Craven knew what he wanted to do and screenwriter Kevin Williamson knew how to be good with references without going too overboard.

For example, in the lottery scene, when Al and some others prevent him from chewing any more tickets, Al could've looked at his colleague and cracked a smile at the ludicrousness of the situation, since the scene was meant to be humorous. But Pacino has tremendous control in the final few scenes e.g. the outburst at the court and at his friend and colleague.Al subtly takes most of the credit, even when other established actors take up quite some screen space. An unknown face, Ralph Christian steals the spotlight apart from Al, as the transgender accused of a petty crime. All he had to convey was fear of being embarrassed and horror of being sent to the callous prison, which he did efficiently. Scene 1humiliation was tragic and the effect of the successive encounters and ignominies was etched on his face. Another hapless convict unfairly incarcerated is portrayed delicately by Thomas G.

Like films such as Chinatown and The Killing, the laborious depiction of a fervent human intensity catches the attention of copious movie critics. Aware of the prevailing rigmarole for judging powerfully unprecedented productions, such as Touch of Evil, (Based on the spellbinding novel by Whit Masterson, Badge of Evil)this criteria became the determining factor which made world renown intellectual director, Orson Welles, so intrepid with regards to his directorial modus operandi! The procurement of this picture had to garner a professional gratification in order for Welles' aesthetic resolve to be auspiciously saturated! As a result, Welles became incredibly hair trigger while in the process of consummating the production of this film. The acute assessment to the revised version of Touch of Evil addressed the alterations of the rudimentary framework of the picture. While some modifications of Orson Welles merely suggested a pragmatic restructuring to many scenes in Touch of Evil, Welles' overall intention was to emphasize the agitated feelings, as well as the vitriolic intransigence which were crucial to his version of this film. Orson Welles' major bone of contention with the new version of his film was that a great deal of the scenes had become too derivative. Now enters a 58 page memoir submitted by Welles which served as a scathing diatribe to the final cut of the picture. Orson Welles admonished the production companies for homogenizing the detailed upheaval with this movie, and, in so doing, the production conglomerate purported an ambiguously glamorized and stilted insanity to the direction of this film. Such a callous generalization of the apathetic and contemptuous feelings in which Orson Welles worked so painstakingly hard on to expedite properly, eventually fell prey to mundane Hollywood theatrics. It was Welles' intention that Touch of Evil be nurtured, not hacked out! In these 58 pages of disapproving notations in which Orson Welles comprised, he used some very poignant and caricatured expletives to evoke a confident acrimony about all of this film's dubiously resurrected agenda. Amidst the myriad of ersatz techniques which the film company implemented was that many scenes wound up seeming inconclusive instead of curious! Welles elaborates on the misuse of climax with the edited version of Touch of Evil. The essential lamentations about detached intimacy with Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, gave way for the film to desecrate the credible motivation with these two in their roles as husband and wife! Orson Welles expounds on the fact that the timing to the emotional isolation in this picture was undauntedly compromised as well. It was Orson Welles' vehemently innovative proclivities which spurred on a lengthy specification as to what he thought was a hindrance to this film! These perceived bastardizations are what made Orson Welles so forthright and vociferous. The creative ambitions with which a film aficionado such as Orson Welles covets and orchestrates, became a key ingredient to establishing cinematic excellence in the paramount world of Hollywood film making. Eventually, the necessary commiseration between Orson Welles and the producers later surfaced itself by way of a revised version which came out in 1998. Despite all of these ideological complications, Touch of Evil is a fabulous major motion picture! This movie exacts a frightful cogency regarding the protracted misery that all of the main characters in the film are afflicted with. Orson Welles carries off an intentional temerity with his role, he does this to underline exactly how utterly despicable his character is suppose to be. Janet Leigh and Charlton Heston became the targets for sabotage, and their increased awareness of the catastrophic and prevalent conditions became their personal undoing! Perrenial spawns of an upper middle class tedium as a married couple, they must now jump head on into the deadliest of snake pits and combat these circumstances with a vigilante crusade! The infuriating corruption which excoriates all of humanity through the recklessness of some pork barrel politicians was a lethal characteristic to this film which was not commonly depicted with movies back in 1958. Terrorism, bribery and collusion were mesmerizing substances for the scruple less officials who possessed a tyrannical stranglehold on the very existence of a select handful of Mexican boarder towns. The destruction that these scoundrels for the law engaged in was ameliorated with a disdainful self-righteousness! The pitfall of avaricious greed, and indignant megalomania, is so repugnant with this film, that you as the movie viewer hope and pray that there is a foreseeable after life for our world's culture to fall back on! Seemingly, tenacious perdition is the only rational alternative for the aggregate vindication of human behavior, this pertains to the abhorrent human behavior that a film like Touch of Evil so vividly portrays!. This website ranks Touch of Evil 124th out of the top 250 films ever made! The acting, the directing and the camera angles to Touch of Evil are all prescient trend setters in the volatile paradigm for movies. The list of actors and actresses is amazing in this picture Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joe Calleia, Dennis Weaver, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor and many others. I highly recommend this major motion picture. The music by Henry Mancini is spectacular in this movie, the Latin incorporation to this music accommodates the kind of progressive jazz which was very indicative of the 1950's. Whatever the demeanor to a film may be, the severity with regards to conveying the intended attitudes and effective spontaneity to a movie are what separate a specific motion picture from the general fray, and, establish it as an absolutely stunning and creative masterpiece.

Like films such as Chinatown and The Killing, the laborious depiction of a fervent human intensity catches the attention of copious movie critics. Aware of the prevailing rigmarole for judging powerfully unprecedented productions, such as Touch of Evil, (Based on the spellbinding novel by Whit Masterson, Badge of Evil)this criteria became the determining factor which made world renown intellectual director, Orson Welles, so intrepid with regards to his directorial modus operandi! The procurement of this picture had to garner a professional gratification in order for Welles' aesthetic resolve to be auspiciously saturated! As a result, Welles became incredibly hair trigger while in the process of consummating the production of this film. The acute assessment to the revised version of Touch of Evil addressed the alterations of the rudimentary framework of the picture. While some modifications of Orson Welles merely suggested a pragmatic restructuring to many scenes in Touch of Evil, Welles' overall intention was to emphasize the agitated feelings, as well as the vitriolic intransigence which were crucial to his version of this film. Orson Welles' major bone of contention with the new version of his film was that a great deal of the scenes had become too derivative. Now enters a 58 page memoir submitted by Welles which served as a scathing diatribe to the final cut of the picture. Orson Welles admonished the production companies for homogenizing the detailed upheaval with this movie, and, in so doing, the production conglomerate purported an ambiguously glamorized and stilted insanity to the direction of this film. Such a callous generalization of the apathetic and contemptuous feelings in which Orson Welles worked so painstakingly hard on to expedite properly, eventually fell prey to mundane Hollywood theatrics. It was Welles' intention that Touch of Evil be nurtured, not hacked out! In these 58 pages of disapproving notations in which Orson Welles comprised, he used some very poignant and caricatured expletives to evoke a confident acrimony about all of this film's dubiously resurrected agenda. Amidst the myriad of ersatz techniques which the film company implemented was that many scenes wound up seeming inconclusive instead of curious! Welles elaborates on the misuse of climax with the edited version of Touch of Evil. The essential lamentations about detached intimacy with Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, gave way for the film to desecrate the credible motivation with these two in their roles as husband and wife! Orson Welles expounds on the fact that the timing to the emotional isolation in this picture was undauntedly compromised as well. It was Orson Welles' vehemently innovative proclivities which spurred on a lengthy specification as to what he thought was a hindrance to this film! These perceived bastardizations are what made Orson Welles so forthright and vociferous. The creative ambitions with which a film aficionado such as Orson Welles covets and orchestrates, became a key ingredient to establishing cinematic excellence in the paramount world of Hollywood film making. Eventually, the necessary commiseration between Orson Welles and the producers later surfaced itself by way of a revised version which came out in 1998. Despite all of these ideological complications, Touch of Evil is a fabulous major motion picture! This movie exacts a frightful cogency regarding the protracted misery that all of the main characters in the film are afflicted with. Orson Welles carries off an intentional temerity with his role, he does this to underline exactly how utterly despicable his character is suppose to be. Janet Leigh and Charlton Heston became the targets for sabotage, and their increased awareness of the catastrophic and prevalent conditions became their personal undoing! Perrenial spawns of an upper middle class tedium as a married couple, they must now jump head on into the deadliest of snake pits and combat these circumstances with a vigilante crusade! The infuriating corruption which excoriates all of humanity through the recklessness of some pork barrel politicians was a lethal characteristic to this film which was not commonly depicted with movies back in 1958. Terrorism, bribery and collusion were mesmerizing substances for the scruple less officials who possessed a tyrannical stranglehold on the very existence of a select handful of Mexican boarder towns. The destruction that these scoundrels for the law engaged in was ameliorated with a disdainful self-righteousness! The pitfall of avaricious greed, and indignant megalomania, is so repugnant with this film, that you as the movie viewer hope and pray that there is a foreseeable after life for our world's culture to fall back on! Seemingly, tenacious perdition is the only rational alternative for the aggregate vindication of human behavior, this pertains to the abhorrent human behavior that a film like Touch of Evil so vividly portrays!. This website ranks Touch of Evil 124th out of the top 250 films ever made! The acting, the directing and the camera angles to Touch of Evil are all prescient trend setters in the volatile paradigm for movies. The list of actors and actresses is amazing in this picture Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joe Calleia, Dennis Weaver, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor and many others. I highly recommend this major motion picture. The music by Henry Mancini is spectacular in this movie, the Latin incorporation to this music accommodates the kind of progressive jazz which was very indicative of the 1950's. Whatever the demeanor to a film may be, the severity with regards to conveying the intended attitudes and effective spontaneity to a movie are what separate a specific motion picture from the general fray, and, establish it as an absolutely stunning and creative masterpiece. These notations were most assuredly worth Welles' effort in order for him to ascertain a charismatic enmity to the unique dynamic of the film. I wholeheartedly endorse this entirely superb production as being one of the most successfully esoteric within the realm of the movie industry!
