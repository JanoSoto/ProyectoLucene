In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others.

This film was almost a dream come true to me because it was one based on the world of gaming. This is an underrated gem (in my book anyway)that I really like and still do to this day. It's also one of the only sports films I really like\/love (I personally am not a fan of the sub genre)and there aren't many like it.There is just a lot I really like about the film, watching it again now is more interesting because now it's sort of a time capsule of the 89-90's era. The fashions, video games at the time, the Universial Studio locale when it was young, music you name it. Speaking of the music, I feel this film has one of the best soundtracks which no doubt brew 90's, my favorite is the end credit theme song which is one of my personal favorites called I Found My Way, it's just a beautiful and inspiring song in my book anyway.The highlight no doubt in the visual aspect was the Video Armegenon contest, just the amount of energy and showmanship it had, really makes me which most other video game\/PC game tournaments today had that again. But of course it was when the new game at the time was revealed Super Mario Bros 3 I remember seeing that in the film and thought OMG, I never even knew the franchise was even developing a third volume so you can imagine how much it blew my mind. Some would say that the film is a bit dated, personally I think that's an unfair argument to make, if it was some other video game in a film say Halo 7 same thing would happen. You have to understand in 89-90 the video game counterculture was on the rise, not just was it becoming more popular and accessible but also video game technology itself was rapidly developing. However I don't just like this film because it has video games\/gaming, but I honestly felt the film has a bit of a heart as well. Like any sports film I really like the characters and there motives.The antagonist that stands out for me despite not being in the film that long is Lucas, he's a villain you love to dislike because we've all seen people like that, whom think their hot stuff, egocentric, have more things than you and like to show off.However the best characters were the three protagonists whom I thought were the best dynamic of the bunch. All three acted and felt like real kids, they weren't stereotypical all smiles annoying kids. Each of these protagonists I thought were sympathetic have suffered loss in a sense and all three wanted some sort of change, I wouldn't say just change in their life but just something good again in their lives, which is something they've never had in a long time. Fred Savage was great as Cory Woods (on a side note, yes I remember the TV show The Wonder Years thats one of my favorite shows). He's a typical adolescent a little rebellious, a gamer he does know his games, he's not too smooth he has a sort of dry witticism to him. But most importantly he does care about his young brother Jimmy Woods (Luke Edwards) whom is the video game wizard. Cory's motive is he simply wants both he and his brother to be a family again and going on this journey with him is the only way to do it.Jenny Lewis I thought was great as Haley, it's a shame this actress didn't have more because I thought she was a capable actress. She sort of reminds me, heck even physically looks a bit like actress Emma Watson. Anyway her character is my favorite, she's fiery, feisty, smart, she has some of the best moments and lines to say. But what I really like is that she has warmth even though she doesn't also show it, she does care about Jimmy and has a bit of a crush on Cory. But there is a bit of sadness to her character, because her character is alone in a way. Doesn't really have many close friends, so Cory is probably the only one she's ever been closest to.The chemistry between both Cory and Haley to me is the other highlight of the movie. Both have just a great back and forth, where at times both give each other intentional or unintentional grief. And yet their relationship develops both care and bond with each other more as the film goes on.But it's true this film isn't perfect I have at least a couple of glitches. I wished in the Video Armeganon elimination sequence it was a montage, where I would of liked to of seen Jimmy play different Nintendo games and knocking down numerous competitors, the fact this didn't happen I thought was a lost opportunity. Certain hiccups in the script, for example 50,000 in Double Dragon which in reality isn't possible (I played and own the game so I know) though I don't feel that was so much a case of bad writing just bad research. Overall I think this is a fun and surprisingly touching sports movie and personally I like to see more sports movies based on the video game subculture. For me it's a fun nolstagia trip I like to take every once in a while, for new viewers it could be a fun history lesson but most importantly a fun movie. The Wizard scores.Rating 3 and a half stars.
