People all to often watch a film and then want to analyse its every nuance.This is not always good for several reasons - it spoils your enjoyment of the film, the director often didn't intend there to be hidden meanings, and most notably, when you pass these thought trains on, you yourself become analysed and are frequently found more wanting than the film your criticising.I have read many many of the reviews of this film, and like many I have a personal opinion. However, unlike many others I will point out that these opinions are mine, they are what I believe and should form no reflection on what you may end up thinking.However, I am forever hopeful that they will make you watch this movie, because I believe it's a masterpiece. If it makes ten people watch it, then I will grateful if just one of them agrees with me and if watching it leaves them with the same astonished feeling it leaves me with then that was worth it.This film interlaces a number of stories on the pretext that many, if not all things, are cause an effects of other completely unrelated things that eventually bind them together.The actors here are giving career best performances. Tom Cruise (certainly not one of my favourite actors) gives a completely believable performance that by its end leaves a lump in your throat.The performance of Jason Robards as the dying man is accurate to say the least and his performance should have been an award winner. Perhaps made even more ironic by the fact that he did just 18 months later die of the same thing he portrayed in the film.Philip Seymore Hoffman is a great actor and in this he is at the top of his form, and that is a fine recommendation as one can give.William H Macy excels as a man with love to give, but with nowhere for it to reside.John C Reilly gives his all as a lonely cop who above all is a decent a person as you could wish to meet, and you will for something good to finally happen to him.Julianne Moore is the Prozac engulfed wife of the dying man close to the ragged edge, and finally, Melora Walters as the drugged up messed up daughter, who nearly falls off the edge of the world but may yet be saved.This is by no means a definitive list of the great performances of this film, because everyone in it performs superbly.The story line is impossible to list in a short brief such as this, and certainly would give away far to much. But these entwined stories all form separate parts of a whole, that gel together at the end in a way that few other films can muster.Oh, and the soundtrack, it's wonderful. Its placement throughout the film is pin perfect, and the singing of the track near the end totally shouldn't work, but it does so brilliantly.I once showed this to some friends and as it finished they looked at me and said what the hell was that about? and that sums up peoples reactions. People don't seem to think it was OK or not bad. They either think it was a confusion of over the top egotistical clap trap or a work of true genius. I obviously form one of the much smaller latter group.So watch it, I cannot guarantee you'll love it, and the risk is you may feel you've wasted three hours, but for a small portion of you you'll believe that it was three hours that were incredibly well spent.In a time when many films are simply re-hashes of older movies with a new glint of computer generated effects, this stands as an epic of story telling and one that I feel privileged to have seen.Thanks for reading ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2008","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" People all to often watch a film and then want to analyse its every nuance.This is not always good for several reasons - it spoils your enjoyment of the film, the director often didn't intend there to be hidden meanings, and most notably, when you pass these thought trains on, you yourself become analysed and are frequently found more wanting than the film your criticising.I have read many many of the reviews of this film, and like many I have a personal opinion.

Now that may seem like a statement of the obvious, yet directors consistently forget. 'Deep Impact' had the potential to be an 'intelligent' interpretation of a cometary impact upon Earth. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek space-hokum that starred Bruce Willis, it could have been the real McCoy. All the right elements were there. The science, the terminology, and the blockbuster special-effects. There was a sly, almost sinister build-up, with 'men in black' kidnapping a troublesome nosey-parker (female) journalist, and confusion over what 'ELE' actually meant. It had shades of 'Pelican Brief', and handled more vigorously could really have emphasised the conspiracy of silence. As the plot moved forward and the truth became clear, tension built extremely well. There was some fine acting at times, with Robert Duvall giving one of his best and most understated performances ever. But the directors just couldn't do the do. They had to turn it into a schmaltz-fest. They had to cast a kid as the hero. There had to be innumerable complex and fractured relationships with endless tearful soul-searching and chest-bearing. On and on it went. By the time the first piece of debris arrived it was almost incidental to the 90 minutes of soap-opera that preceded it. Every time there was an opportunity to ratchet-up tension, the directors copped-out and threw us back into the deep-end of maudlin schmaltz. Even the special-effects were interrupted so that we could witness a last goodbye, a final tear. And then there was the unexplained technical incongruity. Why would they risk the safety of the spacecraft by approaching the comet through its tail? Just one piece of ejecta striking the vessel would have ended the mission there and then. Why did the demolition crew walk about half a mile from the vessel in order to place the bomb? Why not do it under the ship and save themselves a lengthy walk, and also have the shadow of the ship over the top of them to protect them from the rising sun if they got delayed? Why bother returning to Earth when it's gonna be destroyed anyway? The OBVIOUS thing was a suicide attack on the comet. It was a no-brainer.Every time Hollwood makes a disaster epic, it's the same old story. The thing is served up as a basically decent meal, only to be drowned in emotional gravy. It happened at 'Jurassic Park'; it happened in 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It happened in the lamentable British 'Flood'.It seems to me that what has occurred in modern cinema is a blurring of what constitutes an 'adult' and a 'juvenile' movie. In order to get as many bums on seats and therefore as many bucks in the bank; the movie is released with the most child-friendly certification possible (this has a '12' rating). That way families can go and watch it, instead of just adults (who might otherwise not even bother turning-out as it will be available for rental within a few weeks). As a result, the 'adult' theme is dumbed-down in order that it can appeal to kids - hence the child-hero. But what these mogul-dummies don't seem to realise is that that's exactly why adults WON'T bother going to the cinema by themselves any more. Who wants to watch a 2-hour juvenile movie to see 5-minutes of adult special-effects?I got this movie as a 'special edition' from the local supermarket bran-tub. It was £3, and that was quite enough. I've watched it once. If it had been an adult movie I'd have awarded it 8-stars and watched it several times by now. 'When Worlds Collide', is a much more intelligent piece of theatre, despite dating from 1951. The director had the brains to keep the story moving, and not get bogged-down in endless personal dramas; there was enough and that was all. It's much more watchable despite the primitive special effects.Here's the blurb Oceans Rise, Cities Fall, Hope Survives. Yeah - and clichés never end.

On and on it went. By the time the first piece of debris arrived it was almost incidental to the 90 minutes of soap-opera that preceded it. Every time there was an opportunity to ratchet-up tension, the directors copped-out and threw us back into the deep-end of maudlin schmaltz. Even the special-effects were interrupted so that we could witness a last goodbye, a final tear. And then there was the unexplained technical incongruity. Why would they risk the safety of the spacecraft by approaching the comet through its tail? Just one piece of ejecta striking the vessel would have ended the mission there and then. Why did the demolition crew walk about half a mile from the vessel in order to place the bomb? Why not do it under the ship and save themselves a lengthy walk, and also have the shadow of the ship over the top of them to protect them from the rising sun if they got delayed? Why bother returning to Earth when it's gonna be destroyed anyway? The OBVIOUS thing was a suicide attack on the comet. It was a no-brainer.Every time Hollwood makes a disaster epic, it's the same old story. The thing is served up as a basically decent meal, only to be drowned in emotional gravy. It happened at 'Jurassic Park'; it happened in 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It happened in the lamentable British 'Flood'.It seems to me that what has occurred in modern cinema is a blurring of what constitutes an 'adult' and a 'juvenile' movie. In order to get as many bums on seats and therefore as many bucks in the bank; the movie is released with the most child-friendly certification possible (this has a '12' rating). That way families can go and watch it, instead of just adults (who might otherwise not even bother turning-out as it will be available for rental within a few weeks). As a result, the 'adult' theme is dumbed-down in order that it can appeal to kids - hence the child-hero. But what these mogul-dummies don't seem to realise is that that's exactly why adults WON'T bother going to the cinema by themselves any more. Who wants to watch a 2-hour juvenile movie to see 5-minutes of adult special-effects?I got this movie as a 'special edition' from the local supermarket bran-tub. It was £3, and that was quite enough. I've watched it once. If it had been an adult movie I'd have awarded it 8-stars and watched it several times by now. 'When Worlds Collide', is a much more intelligent piece of theatre, despite dating from 1951. The director had the brains to keep the story moving, and not get bogged-down in endless personal dramas; there was enough and that was all. It's much more watchable despite the primitive special effects.Here's the blurb Oceans Rise, Cities Fall, Hope Survives. Yeah - and clichés never end.

Death appears, and the knight bargains with him for some more time to make sense of his life and his sorely tested faith in God. They play a game of chess, with his life as the stakes &#133;Perhaps Bergman's most famous film, Det Sjunde Inseglet is inaccurately thought of as a terminally gloomy and depressing piece, when in fact it seems to me to be quite a funny, almost life affirming film. It has some dreary moments (the flagellants' procession) and the central conflict between the pious Block and the atheistic Jöns is a little heavy going, but there are also many humorous observations and some outright comic scenes, like the one where Death cuts down the tree Skat is hiding in. As with all of Bergman's work, it deals with love, regret, relationships, a search for meaning and the absurdities of human nature. Each character is profound in its own way, such as the mute girl who can only summon the courage to speak when she knows her life is about to end. Björnstrand is terrific, as he is in so much of Bergman's work, and both Von Sydow (who was only in his mid-twenties) and Ekerot are hypnotically iconic, their chess game surely one of the most powerful and enduring visual metaphors in all of cinema. What impresses me most about the movie though is its seamless atmosphere. Much of it is cold and foreboding, but a lot of it is also sunlit and optimistic, such as the strawberry picnic scene. There are about fifteen main characters, each following a little plot thread of their own. It should all fall to bits and be disjointed, but it's not; under this gifted director's hand it all flows together beautifully, leaving a profound impression. This is one of those World Cinema classics which is essential viewing, and is never dull or a chore to sit through. Note the appearance of the medieval hymn Dies Irae, used to great gloomy effect in many fine movies (for example, Metropolis, Obsession, The Shining).

It takes a standard, conventional plot from those movies and turns it on its ear. The same plot can be seen for example in the Paramount movie from 1931, Up Pops the Devil, with Carole Lombard and Norman Foster (who coincidentally was Claudette Colbert's first husband). In that movie, a wife who still loves her husband wants to divorce him for his own good; she thinks she's just a noose around his neck, and once rid of her, he'll become a success. It's set in the same upper crust of society as The Palm Beach Story, with a millionaire suitor for the wife and a nymphomaniac girl for the husband. Here, everything is played straight, with as much pathos and melodrama being milked out of the situation as can be. In The Palm Beach Story though, the same basic plot and characters are used, but it's the comedic potential and wackiness of the situation that's emphasized, to marvelous effect.The subplot with the twins, glanced at in the beginning and end of the picture, is another conscious lampooning of conventional movies, here a lampooning of the structure of movies themselves, of their conventional beginnings and endings. It's not meant to be taken seriously; as McCrea's character casually says at the end, it's all stuff for another movie. No words can be found to adequately praise Claudette Colbert's performance. Joel McCrea is good too, as the prototypical wooden 1930s leading man. Rudy Vallee is absolutely hilarious as a momma's boy version of John D. Rockefeller, as is Mary Astor as his rich nymphomaniac sister. Her eunuch, Toto, played by Sig Arno, seems straight out of an Ernst Lubitch picture, perhaps a Sturges nod to the master. Quite a few scenes of the film, in their settings and atmosphere, pay homage to Lubitsch. Sturges does the Lubitsch touch proud, especially in those two scenes when Colbert sits on McCrea's lap so that he can undo the back of her dress, with the two of them both times melting into a kiss, and the scene ending with a fade out, leaving little doubt as to what will happen next. The second scene is particularly romantic, done as Rudy Vallee sings Good Night Sweet Heart, itself a standard of the 1930s. Vallee also sings a line of Isn't It Romantic, a song introduced in the luminous 1932 film Love Me Tonight, directed by Rouben Mamoulian. The music in the film itself hearkens back to those great romantic comedies of the 1930s.It's nice to see Sturges's stock company of actors popping up here as well. I noticed William Demarest say his name was Bill Docker, the same name his character had in Preston Sturges's Christmas in July.In short, The Palm Beach Story is a wonderful film, whose richness can really be appreciated when seen in context, in the context of those old 1930s Paramount films, both the melodramatic ones like Up Pops the Devil, that it lampoons, and the comedic, romantic ones like Love Me Tonight and One Hour with You, that it pays homage to.

And just as Bladerunner no later movie has built on the BladeRunner, Johny Mnemonic or Total Recall, or Operation Outland and so on, simply because their stories didn't allow any sequel. But still, they could have been built upon but it has not happened.I don't plan to go through all reviews, but to not give this movie more than a seven .... it just proves how lost some people are and that they don't get that jolt, kick, or whatever that tells them this movie is special. In fact the movie is very special, innovative, and just glimmers there all alone by itself on the movie star sky .....Also, some people don't like Reeves acting. Well, I think it worked well even if he was into this movie or not. Johny had to remove a chunk of long term memory ... a chunk of what? .... my childhood ... your childhood?!? ... what a weird ass thing to do!... I needed the space for the job.... Simply, Johnny is depressed. Removing such a big part of your identity, the foundation of your identity should make your soul hollow, should cause psychological problems. And the mess he ends up in this movie he is simply very frustrated. He is also a very intelligent very focused computer hacker and that is probably why he don't break down completely and sit down crying. The frustration and the anger is whats left that drives him. In any way he is easily irritated.He probably is paid extremely well, but because of the psychological problems, and even social problems (since he don't remember his family,childhood, friends, just a big hole there), make him addicted to drugs which is often the case. And drugs can be of any type, alcohol, narcotics, shopping, distract you with computer games, gambling, hookers, clothes. So he earn a lot but probably burns the money just as fast.So I am sorry for those who didn't get a character to identify with, or someone who is pretty and glowing and vibrant. Instead you got this angry introvert shallow self absorbed depressed character on screen. Reeves acting, intensional or not, and the story, worked well together.It may be low budget, I don't know, but it sure is special. I am a Johny Mnemonic Junkie .... if that has escaped anybody .....Also I don't rate movies after their budget or visual effects, I always look between the lines and fill in the gaps myself ... and that is why books are the best and why you usually get irritated when you watch movies made from books. If the book was great the movie can only fail. But by working on the story and make changes you can make bad books great as movies. movies are for people who are lazy and I am lazy.

With perhaps the best cast of any of the original four Batman films (we're talking the Burton\/Schumacher fare) and improved confidence by it's director, Returns is a rare occasion of a sequel one-upping it's predecessor. Sure, audiences failed to embrace it at the time in the way that they ate up 1989's Batman, but time has revealed this one to be the better film.As Burton states in the commentary track for the film, Batman Returns is less a sequel than it is another chapter in the Batman saga. And visually, the film reflects that. To match it's decidedly darker tone, Burton gives a much grimmer, much more realistic look for Gotham City than the comic-book look he gave the first. He immerses his characters in gritty darkness, whether it's The Penguin lurking in the murky sewers, or Bruce Wayne sitting alone in a darkened Wayne Manor waiting for the Bat-signal. Everything about the movie is much more adult, more mature and meaner than before, which played a big part of it's initial backlash. Afterall, it's hard to sell Happy Meals and action figures when a certain character in the film bites noses, feasts on raw fish and barfs black sludge. Therefore, it must be said that it takes a more adult audience to appreciate this film, and it's not something for children to be watching -- although I surely got my fill of this movie at the tender age of eight years old.The story, about about a deformed baby outcast from society by his own parents, who takes refuge in the sewers only to re-emerge as iconic villain\/urban-legend, The Penguin is almost as depressing as the story of the meek bachelorette Selina Kyle who, after being pushed over-the-edge by her boss, is re-incarnated as the sexed-up, merciless Catwoman. Truth be told, Batman Returns feels more like a movie about the two villains than it does it's title character, as Batman (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) takes a back-seat role. Danny DeVito is natural as The Penguin, and not just in body-shape. This is a rare case of an actor disappearing into his role, and DeVito has hardly had a more interesting part since. Michelle Pfeiffer, on the other side of the coin, seems to be having fun with her character, and watching her in Catwoman makes one think that maybe she was more deserving of her own spin-off film, instead of the 2004 abomination that is Catwoman. Christopher Walken has a role as b-villain Max Shreck, and really, what can be said about the guy? He's great in everything he does, and his portrayal of the heartless megalomaniac that drives the motivation of each respective villain is spot on.Overall, Batman Returns is a much more complicated film than the first. Those looking for a typical comic-book or superhero movie may find themselves disappointed in what they find here. However, like another, more popular Batman sequel in recent memory, it's a film that proves that Batman can be taken to extreme lengths and out of the context of his original format. It may feel more like a Tim Burton film than your average Batman flick, but it's also one of the best pieces of celluloid to feature the character. It's a movie that has gradually found it's audience over time, and surely, it's better than the two films that follow. This is, in my opinion, the only film prior to 2005 that gets the spirit of The Caped Crusader right.

People often forget just how experimental The Master could be and here he prefigures future exercises like the long takes of Rope and Under Capricorn, the single fixed point setting for Rear Window and the B & W shock-horror of Psycho with a psychological drama set entirely at sea in a lifeboat. The difficulties of involving the audience with such a static setting are obvious but with a combination of an imaginative screenplay, first rate ensemble acting and of course Hitch's own masterly direction, this movie grips from start to finish. There are fewer than usual of the director's customary flourishes, instead we get that Hitchcock rarity, an actors' showcase, with fine performances coaxed from all aboard. The writing is subtle yet profound, making its point that the German enemy at large, (remember the film was made midway through the Second World War) isn't an obvious goose-stepping monster but instead a highly intelligent, multi-lingual, individual who for most of the movie deftly manipulates his co-passengers for his own ends. The film also makes telling points about the differing reactions of humans in an extreme situation in war-time but does so by avoiding obvious stereotyping and makes well its united we stand, divided we fall message. With heavyweight writers like Steinbeck and an uncredited Ben Hecht contributing, the dialogue is gritty and realistic, even risqué at times and only occasionally guilty of big-word incomprehensibility. All the actors deserve praise for their natural acting, reacting on the whole truly to their desperate situation, despite being deluged with an ocean's worth of water. Talullah Bankhead in particular shines as we see her lose all her personal belongings right down to her Cartier bracelet and make-up at the film's conclusion. Only a few of the process shots jar as unrealistic with Hitch's shot selection on the whole correct and intuitive. Of course the film falters a little from the enforced inaction and episodic progress of the narrative but I was engrossed throughout by the taut direction and unravelling of the passengers' ethics and morals as their plight continues. Hardly grace under pressure!

Time Out calls the film 'an epic cine-poem', and that is as good a description as anyone can come up with. Trying to describe the philosophy of this movie, or attempting to dissect it from an intellectual point of view, are tasks that are quite beyond me, but on viewing the movie again last night, I have a few remarks to make about the way the film works as an ensemble drama.To the casual viewer, the one really striking aspect of The Thin Red Line is its awesome cast. Clearly persuaded to take part in the film by the chance of getting to work with a 'genius' like Terrence Malick, the entire cast plainly shot much larger individual roles, many have which have been edited down to almost nothing, whilst some actors' roles were reportedly removed entirely.The nearest thing the film has to a lead character, Jim Caviezel's Private Witt has a Zen-like presence that perfectly encapsulates the movie's entire mood; it is obvious that Mel Gibson's decision to cast him in The Passion of the Christ was based largely on the thoughtful performance he gives as Witt. The character most obviously based in traditional war movies of the past must be Ben Chaplin's Private Bell, who, aided by a haunting voice-over and some truly stunning flashbacks of the transcendently beautiful Miranda Otto, takes the character of the soldier desperately in love, and makes it devastatingly effective; even when the very obvious twist comes near the end, we feel Bell's pain right along with him. The only issue with Chaplin's performance is his somewhat dodgy American accent; it wobbles especially badly when he speaks the line 'there's a bunker up there'. And the most impressive performance in the film comes from Elias Koteas as the noble Captain Staros, the sensitive, protective officer too full of human goodness to see his men meaninglessly slaughtered. Several other actors, who one would usually expect to see in leading roles, have parts that have been so heavily trimmed down they are easily missed by those not paying close attention. Both Thomas Jane and John C. Reilly have just one short speaking scene each, whilst Adrien Brody doesn't have a single meaningful line, and just seems to spend the entire film with a worried look on his face.Further up the poster, many of the movie's bigger names are also ill-served by the sheer volume of characters in the movie. At the start of the film, Sean Penn's Sergeant Welsh appears as though he is going to be a leading character in the film, but he quickly fades into the background, only to re-appear towards the end. He does have some of the film's more memorable lines (when Witt asks him if he ever feels lonely, Welsh replies 'only around people'), but the character has almost no relevance at all to the events that unfold. Woody Harrelson, as the doomed Sergeant Keck, has one memorable scene, whilst John Cusack takes centre stage in a short action scene when his Captain Gaff leads half-a-dozen men in a successful assault on a Japanese bunker, then has a memorably potent exchange of views with Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall.Nolte is, of course, as good as always, and aided, no doubt, by his greater age than the rest of the cast, and playing of the one senior officer who appears in the main body of the film, he manages to leave a lasting impression of powerhouse movie star charisma. If one actor was short-changed in terms of the amount of screen time he was given, it must be poor George Clooney, who turns up for less than a minute, five minutes from the end of the nearly three-hour movie, in a role that any extra could have adequately filled.All this highlights what makes The Thin Red Line such a frustrating experience for casual viewers, and why this excellent (for it is truly wonderful) film does not enjoy a better reputation. At first glance, the film appears to have everything going its way in order to draw in film fans; so many must have seen it on the shelf in Blockbuster and, attracted by the promise of an all-action war epic with an all-star cast headed by Sean Penn, George Clooney, and John Cusack, decided to give it a go. But those viewers are invariably disappointed, and I have lost count of the number of times I have heard the film described as 'boring' by those who think The Shawshank Redemption is as clever as movies can get. If further evidence were needed, check out some of the ludicrous one-star comments on the IMDb (not enough explosions, not enough slants getting iced, not enough John Travolta claims Clay Numbnuts of Pig's Pecker, Arkansas). But despite its (conventionally speaking) odd use of the most impressive movie cast assembled in the 1990s, The Thin Red Line deserves to be watched by every human being on this planet. I didn't go to see this film at the cinema because I am a big follower of auteur Terrence Malick, or because I am a big brain able to grasp every facet of the movie's complex philosophy; I went because I'm a John Cusack fan. But I came away from the film as more than that. And that is the point; The Thin Red Line has the power to show viewers of Hollywood blockbusters that a film can be about more than the stars in front of the camera; if you can appreciate that, you will find The Thin Red Line a magical, life-changing experience. And if you can't&#133;well, don't switch the movie off half-way through. George Clooney turns up in a bit.
