In my opinion there was no real clear and concise ending. A classic love story filled with classic jealously and rage, and a depressing outcome once the truth is revealed. During the time in which he is dreaming, many things happen that reality could not explain. For example, when he smothered who he thought was Nuria but was in fact Sofia makes the viewer think that Cesar is clearly delusional. This is when I began to question what was taking place and I began to have an inkling that this may not be reality. Abre los Ojos reminded me of the film The Matrix in that it felt like Cesar was living in a fantasy world that was controlled by something beyond his control, in this case it was his mind. I felt as if it was a bit predictable if you stopped to question the events that were occurring.One of the themes of the movie is that there are more to people than appearance and to never judge a book by its cover. This comes into play when Sofia did not want to be with Cesar anymore after his accident and this induced the whole series of tragic events that were yet to come. If Sofia had not been so superficial and saw past his deformed face that he acquired in the tragic car accident, then nothing bad would have come. In addition, love is a prominent theme in that he loved Sofia and he wanted her to love him in return and an ex lover became jealous because she loved Cesar and this love that she had for him led to his tragic fate. Overall, I feel as if this movie was a bit predictable and could have gone in a different direction with a little reworking but overall it was a solid plot that was enjoyable if watching strictly for entertainment purposes instead of with the intent to analyze.
