I guess I liked it because despite all these negative people in his life, he still overcame all the obstacles and got to go to college. On top of telling a great story, it was hilarious in the process.  Jack Black definitely made the movie for me.  His comedy is so bizarre!  I also liked Colin Hanks' comedy a lot as well.  There are just certain things that Colin said that weren't necessarily that funny, but the way he said them was hilarious to me.I also liked all the cameo's in the film Ben Stiller, Kevin Kline, Chevy Chase, Garry Marshall, Harold Ramis and I should probably mention Lily Tomlin (even though I'm not a huge fan, not that she's a bad actress, I'm just not a fan).

English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into the trap of the picturesque, but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.THIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it's cut altogether - you won't catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it's about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don't.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick's musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert's name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I'd been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he's responsible for Spartacus (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) 2001 (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and Barry Lyndon.

The main characters in the story happen to be teenagers, but I'll be damned if Ghost World were to be put in the same category as Drive Me Crazy and Can't Hardly Wait.The story focuses on Enid and Rebecca, two outcasts who fancy themselves on criticizing others.  I can relate to these characters.  I was an outcast myself.  I couldn't relate--and still can't--to most of my fellow young people.  If this were the standard teen fluff, the story would focus on ditsy cheerleaders and dumb jocks.  I, personally, can't relate to those types of characters.  So the fact that Terry Zwigoff decided to focus on the outsiders really fascinated me.This movie reminded me of a much lighter Todd Solondz film.  Solondz also focuses on the outsiders, only there's no perverts or child rapists in this film.  No offense to Solondz, his films are great, but this is a much more pleasant film to watch.Thora Birch is adorable in this movie, and very well cast.  I love the way she delivers her dialogue.  In the scene where she's faced with an ecstatic senior who can't believe she just graduated, she responds (paraphrasing) We graduated high school.  How shocking.  I don't think anybody could've given better deadpan delivery than her.  The other actress--her name slips my mind--is also great, as her other half.  Steve Buscemi is great--when is he not?--in a much more unusual role.  He doesn't play the villain or the talkative, obnoxious creep.  He actually plays a decent person.  Even though this is a comedy, this is one of his more dramatic roles.  He has some funny lines (What are ya, hypnotized???  Have some more kids, why don't you!!), but basically he plays the straight man.  And I really loved his character, because it's one I can most relate to.  I don't listen to blues or country or collect vintage records, but I tend to be a loner and many people just disgust me.  He says a great line  I can't relate to 99 % of humanity. That's the way I feel.  Some may consider his character cranky and cynical, but I think he's just a laid-back, peaceful, average Joe who just wants to live his life without the annoyances of everyday people.  Illeana Douglas has some funny moments as the wacky art teacher who makes a short film about parts of a baby doll getting tossed into a toilet and considers that art. I've known some of these arthouse geeks, and they can be just as wacky. Also keep a lookout for Brian George, who played Babu on Seinfeld.  He pretty much plays the same character, only this time he's Greek and owns a convenience store.  David Cross, who some may remember as the wheelchair-bound creep in Scary Movie 2, also has a cameo.Ghost World is funny, but not in a hysterical fashion.  Because it's not meant to be in the tradition of The Naked Gun movies.  There are elements of farce here and there, but all in all it's a human comedy.  One that makes you laugh and think at the same time.  Some of the characters are exaggerated, but its morals are honest and truthful.  I can't really say it's a satire--Heathers is more in that territory--and to be honest, this movie can be classified in several genres, because it's a film about life. And as Lasse Halstrom said, Life doesn't have any genres.  It can be comical, dramatic, suspenseful...As a final reminder  this is not a teen movie!

So JACKSON is basically letting us know that yes, this movie was also intended for little kids. Great. I just love corny\/kiddy humor in my fantasy movie. Just great.

(loading) That may be a dumb analogy, but the beginning was just awful. WAY TO IN-DEPTH on the hobbits lifestyles. I found myself often dozing off then waking up because of the incredibly annoying music rises. So in other words, i could've chopped about 15 minutes out of the hobbit scenes.Another thing that got to me was the comic relief. GOD i hate that crap. So JACKSON is basically letting us know that yes, this movie was also intended for little kids. Great. I just love corny\/kiddy humor in my fantasy movie. Just great. Examples Hitting heads on ceilings, the axeman, the stupid hobbit kids, etc. The only other thing that i can say is at least JACKSON didn't stoop as low as LUCAS.One thing i think this movie definetly needed was complete script editing. not only for what i have mentioned, but for other things as well. I also noticed that in some of the points of the movie, the speech is a little scrambled. So a note to the writer You had good material, but you obviously had so many things you wanted to put down that you wrote it to fast making some of it not make sense because of it's place.Now, about my comments on the music, the music was ok. Well, no, i really didn't like it. The only song i really like is THE COUCIL OF ELROND, because all of the others have to many annoying rises and it just sucks. It is good music to kill by though.The acting was good. Some of the characters were good, though, some of them sucked. Special effects were good.Like all movies, had really moronic points, like when the 'demon' or whatever is coming in the mine and they just wait till it gets really close to run like hell. Just completely stupid. Stupid 'NIGHT RIDERS' who don't know how to stab FRODO in the heart, even when they\/he had a clean shot.I could go on, but i will exceed my 1000 word limit.So yes, the movie is good. But it's not 'razor.' DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE #2 ON THE IMDB TOP 250. ALSO DOESN'T DESERVE ALL IF ANY OF THE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS.Go rent EXCALIBUR.

It turns out I was up for the challenge!  I kind of knew what I was getting myself into, but... whew!  This one wasn't even laughable.  It left me with a dark and unsettling fear of my bathroom and death may present itself to me in the form of a leaky toilet.  Or the fear that my computer will violently explode if I spill a small amount of liquor on the monitor.  Plus, I'm now afraid that ever time I hear a John Denver tune, the bell of death tolls for thee.

For those of you who have, you may now hopefully begin to see the downright silliness in this film.  People in this movie are killed in the same fashion as the villians in The Naked Gun series.  But at least in those movies it was meant to be funny.  But, in Final D (as its fans call it) death comes to some cast members in a long and complicated manner.

I'm absolutly sick of the new current horror genre that stars hot, young stars of the WB.  Horror movies went from being bad and knowing that they're bad, to be being bad and pretending to be whitty.

HA!HA!HA!HA!)  One is Clear Waters,  which is just too darn goofy.  (Is she related to Muddy Waters? HA!HA!  I'm on fire!)  There is a William and a Valerie in the film, and Billy and Val are credited as their nicknames. Did they really need to explain THAT?  It's not like I was sitting though the whole movie going, Now are Valerie and Val the same person?  How can that be?Another problem I had was the title.  It's redundant.  Is there any kind of destinations other than final ones?  (Oh!  What a minute.  That's back to the dark ironic twist thing again, isn't it?  Wow! Zing!  That went way over my head!)I won't waste our time going into the plot of even bother rating this move... I loathe it too much.

Then he suffers a terrible tragedy and tries to undo what happened by inventing a time machine to bring his love back to life. Doesn't work, so he travels to future for answers but due to an accident the machine takes him to 802,701 where he meets a beautiful Eloi girl and her brother who take care of him and nurse him to health.

Awesome effects made for some fine visual entertainment. Check out the beautiful New York scenes. There's a outstanding scene of the terrible effects of man messing with the moon. You will gasp at the beauty and terror of it, believe me. Good job here. Give an award to the person who created the Victorian era scenes and the Eloi dwellings. Gorgeous.

Tell the kids before you take them to prepare them for some edge of your seat jarring scenes here. The ending scene where they blend two dimensions of time in one shot and you see a scene from the past and from the 802,701 time consecutively. That was very well done! All of these outstanding things and others pretty much enabled me to enjoy this movie immensely. I realize critics don't like remakes and slam all of them but this one is one for our time.

May contain spoilers!My wife and I found this version of The Time Machine to be entertaining, imaginative, and thought provoking. If I had only one criticism, it would be that the film felt as if it's makers were trying to fit too much into too little time (no pun intended). Each major plot twist or future was only flirted with and not expanded upon as I had hoped for or expected. This is not to mention the fact that nothing was explored in the 20th century as in the '60's film. Our time traveler made not a pit stop in even our own time, let alone other key periods prior to 2040, and that one barely elicited a blink in the scheme of things. His extended stop in the distant future could also have been explored with more detail, if only to allow for some additional character development.In spite of all this, I found the film engrossing enough to keep my attention and interest for it's entire duration, if only leaving me wanting more. Unlike other users I've read, I was very impressed with the special effects and felt them to be done in a way to enhance an imaginative story line rather than being over done as a means to make up for a flimsy script or plot as in so many other movies made these days. I was also very impressed (as was my wife) with the sets and artwork; the 19th century scenes felt like something out of a Currier and Ives painting, and the time machine and scenes surrounding it during it's travels were just short of astounding.As for the Elois, I was struck by the simple, yet seemingly spiritual and passive culture represented in the film. (Loved the festive music added as a ambiance to create the mood and setting.) And the Morlocks were truly ominous and scary enough to get some cardio-vascular response. It is a shame more was not done with the Jeremy Irons character, although in this case I suppose less is more and was certainly a major highlight in the film.Not only have I seen the original Time Machine, but own it on VHS, as it warrants repeated viewing time and again. But I would not make the mistake of comparing this entry with the original....more like apples and oranges. That being said, I must say that overall I am partial to the 60's version if only by virtue of it's comprehensiveness and focus. It has a better flow to it not to mention the fact that Rod Taylor was (in my opinion) in another league as an actor compared with Guy Pearce. And where the original may fall short a tad on special effects by comparison, it certainly makes up for that shortcoming with a killer script and impeccable direction. (I saw the original in the theater as a child when it came out but have yet to read H.G.Wells' book.)I definitely recommend this film and would rate it slightly higher than a 7. Sci-fi\/fantasy fans should enjoy it especially. And I commend the producers and director for avoiding the commercial pitfalls plagued by most movies these days. This Time Machine felt like more of a creative effort and less Hollywood and hi-tech. It does take you in, and leaves you with the viewpoint that although we cannot change the past, we can definately make a difference in the creation of a better future.

That being said, I must say that overall I am partial to the 60's version if only by virtue of it's comprehensiveness and focus. It has a better flow to it not to mention the fact that Rod Taylor was (in my opinion) in another league as an actor compared with Guy Pearce. And where the original may fall short a tad on special effects by comparison, it certainly makes up for that shortcoming with a killer script and impeccable direction. (I saw the original in the theater as a child when it came out but have yet to read H.G.Wells' book.)I definitely recommend this film and would rate it slightly higher than a 7. Sci-fi\/fantasy fans should enjoy it especially. And I commend the producers and director for avoiding the commercial pitfalls plagued by most movies these days. This Time Machine felt like more of a creative effort and less Hollywood and hi-tech. It does take you in, and leaves you with the viewpoint that although we cannot change the past, we can definately make a difference in the creation of a better future.

May contain spoilers!My wife and I found this version of The Time Machine to be entertaining, imaginative, and thought provoking. If I had only one criticism, it would be that the film felt as if it's makers were trying to fit too much into too little time (no pun intended). Each major plot twist or future was only flirted with and not expanded upon as I had hoped for or expected. This is not to mention the fact that nothing was explored in the 20th century as in the '60's film. Our time traveler made not a pit stop in even our own time, let alone other key periods prior to 2040, and that one barely elicited a blink in the scheme of things. His extended stop in the distant future could also have been explored with more detail, if only to allow for some additional character development.In spite of all this, I found the film engrossing enough to keep my attention and interest for it's entire duration, if only leaving me wanting more. Unlike other users I've read, I was very impressed with the special effects and felt them to be done in a way to enhance an imaginative story line rather than being over done as a means to make up for a flimsy script or plot as in so many other movies made these days. I was also very impressed (as was my wife) with the sets and artwork; the 19th century scenes felt like something out of a Currier and Ives painting, and the time machine and scenes surrounding it during it's travels were just short of astounding.As for the Elois, I was struck by the simple, yet seemingly spiritual and passive culture represented in the film. (Loved the festive music added as a ambiance to create the mood and setting.) And the Morlocks were truly ominous and scary enough to get some cardio-vascular response. It is a shame more was not done with the Jeremy Irons character, although in this case I suppose less is more and was certainly a major highlight in the film.Not only have I seen the original Time Machine, but own it on VHS, as it warrants repeated viewing time and again.

I do like stylish Sleepy hollow and amusing Mars attacks! and I think Planet of the apes is quite watchable too but maybe I just expect miracles from him nowadays. Only thing that's always spectacular in Burton's movies are the outstanding settings.His movies have always been extremely visual, every last one contains a fantastic world created for the screen - that's a guarantee. (Who could forget for example Beetlejuice or Batman?) Like Tim Burton himself said this is not a remake of 1968 Planet of the apes - this is just his version of the story. I read Pierre Boulle's book when I was a kid and I have to say that this film really doesn't remind me of it.I think Franklin J. Schaffner's 1968 version was better in every way. Of course it looks lame from today's point of view but that's just part of the fun of it. Burton's film contains lots of thrilling action and make-up's are simply phenomenal work of art but still - something highly important is missing. That glamour of the old film is gone. Outwardly Burton's version is truly an impressive movie but there's nothing inside of it.Funny detail about the cast I read Tim Roth's interview from a Finnish newspaper couple of years ago and he explained how enormously he hates Charlton Heston and declared that he will never appear in a same movie with him. And look what happened, here he's playing Thade - Heston's loyal son. Maybe Roth didn't recognize him behind his ape mask...Well, I loved him anyway. Roth is magnificent in his entertaining role as a furious ape general. Other actors are great too but no doubt especially Roth. Mark Wahlberg played his role splendidly even though I got the feeling like it's only a routine to him. He's an excellent actor but I wonder if he's ever gonna get another chance to really show it like he did in Boogie nights.Helena Bonham Carter isn't bad either but why didn't they give her role of Ari to Michael Jackson - there would have been great savings in a make-up department since she looks a lot like Jackson with her ape mask on. At one point I read somewhere (that was way before they started the production of Planet of the apes) that they planned the role of Leo Davison for Arnold Scwarzenegger. Then, of course, this would have been a totally different film because Schwarzennegger's movies are always pretty much written for him.But maybe they realized that they can't put a man with such an ape-like features to represent a human in a film like this. (No disrespect to Arnie!) A useful suggestion to everyone who didn't like Planet of the apes (and maybe for the ones who liked it too) forget this movie, go to your nearest library and read one of my favorite novels - Will Self's The Great apes. It deals with the same apes rule the earth\/humans are the primitive race -idea but with much more intelligence and profundity.

Today it's best known for being the basis for the spoof film Airplane!. Heck, more people have probably seen Airplane II the Sequel than have seen Airport, probably more than even know Airport exists. The film has become a joke, and that's unfortunate. It's no great masterpiece, it may not have deserved 10 Oscar nominations, it may not have deserved to make so much money and spawn several sequels, but it's certainly an engaging 140 minutes. The film mixes personal melodrama with a suspense film. There are a dozen or so characters and several big actors on the bill. Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin are the most immediately recognizable. Lancaster plays the manager of the airport, and he is quite good (although he was better in umpteen other roles in his career). Dean Martin plays a pilot. Now, he probably wouldn't be my first pick to play an airplane pilot. Rumor has it that Dino has a bit of a drinking problem. But he is quite good in the role. Jean Seberg has a pretty thankless role as Lancaster's second in command. It's petty, but her hair is awful in this film. I didn't even recognize her until she put on a parka, when she began to look more like her Breathless days. Jacqueline Bisset plays Lancaster's whiny wife. She's got to be one of the least understanding spouses in cinema history. Helen Hayes plays an old woman who is able to make her way around the country by stowing away in planes. She's sure that they won't bust her - no airline wants that kind of bad publicity. The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and she was its only winner, for Best Supporting Actress. The film probably deserved any of the other awards before it deserved that one - she's annoying. Perhaps people found her funny in 1970, but I was quite hoping that she would get her butt sucked out of the plane. Airport definitely suffers from some major dating, which is why hardly anyone ever mentions it anymore unless as a camp reference. Dino has knocked up a stewardess, and they have a cheesy (but not unaffecting) dialogue about what they should do. The film never does resolve the fact that he loves both his wife and his mistress. In his first scene in the film, Dino's dropped off at the airport by his wife who tells Lancaster confidently Some day he'll come home and find a reason to stay. And it seems like he loves her back. But the end leaves us with little doubt as to whether he'll stay with the stewardess (and be father to her child). A lot of the personal melodramatics seem too abundant, especially the stuff between Lancaster and Bisset. Fortunately, the suspense is much more successful.Some people may scoff at the use of split screen and similar techniques that are used to depict two separate settings, such as the cockpit and the control station. Sometimes the head of the control tower will appear in between Dino and the other pilot in a little bubble with a thick, black outline - it almost looks like the little squares in which the members of the Brady family appear at the beginning of each episode of the Brady Bunch. However, that technique works quite well. I think, if anything, the film may have deserved an Oscar for Best Editing (I don't even know offhand if that was one of the categories in which it was nominated - nor do I know what other films were up against it in that category, although I assume MASH was, which would be an even more deserving nominee). 8\/10.
