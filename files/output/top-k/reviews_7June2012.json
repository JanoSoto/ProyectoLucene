[{"date":"7 June 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore is one of those rare movie experiences for me where I absolutely don't know what to make of it. I've seen my share of indie comedies, quirky films with cleverly subtle nuances, and an intricate focus, but this one has me truly baffled. For the first time in a long time, the screen I was facing and I, myself, had no connection. It was showing me a movie I particularly wasn't following, and I was desperately trying to comprehend why the events were happening, how and for what significance.The movie is not by any means confusing, for that matter, it is fairly simple, but I was trying to search for the comedy in its material, the delivery in its dialog, and the wit in its nuances. This is director Wes Anderson's second feature film after the dismissed Bottle Rocket, and both films share my current view of the man himself; he makes films with a certain whimsicality to them, but overall, they're not that funny and simply not that interesting as a whole. It's a tad harsh to say that, but I was not truly lifted into the zone of appreciation watching either picture. I smiled a lot, chuckled solemnly, but afterwards I felt dry and unfulfilled.In Rushmore, we follow Max Fischer (Schwartzman), a precocious Sophomore who earned himself a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore Academy. Despite the high expectations of the boy, Max is a slacker when it comes to schoolwork, but is more than willing to start up a new club or write an offbeat play. He grabs the attention of Rushmore alumni Herman Blume (Murray), and winds up becoming close with the man. It isn't long before their friendship deteriorates into nothing when Herman starts crushing on first grade school teacher, Rosemary Cross (Williams), also Max's crush.Meanwhile, while all this is in the mix, Max learns from his principal (Brian Cox) that he is will be given one more chance, but if he fails another test, he is gone, expelled from the Academy. I have no doubt that all of this could have been incorporated in a funny comedy or a relatively steady drama. I envision a drama focusing on the aspect of failing and trying your hardest only to not succeed because of an albatross or limitations to be a rather poignant subject a film could explore, yet still keep the whimsicality Anderson loves to work with.Sadly, none of that is explored, and the film feels the whole concept is one big joke. Its protagonist, to begin with, is an unlikable manipulator of epic proportions, can't give the audience a reason to side with him, and his crush on his first grade teacher is odd and unfitting to the story. What I believe Rushmore is truly trying to be is a tough slice of life, yet it is taken in such a peculiar manner that even that becomes questionable.Now there are elements that are nicely incorporated into the film. The warmth of Bottle Rocket has been traded for a rather crisp look in Rushmore, where the film occupies a very deep widescreen (also called letterbox). It's unusual, yet while the movie is shown in a smaller frame than normal, it appears with more clarity and distinction. It's also safe to say that Jason Schwartzman clearly tried all he possibly good so that the Max character rubs the audience the right way. He is a quirky character, although an acquired taste. Some will see him as a nuance, I see him as an annoyance. But that's not to say Schwartzman's performance isn't very likable. The same goes for Bill Murray, who plays the role of a disillusioned man in search of a home quite nicely.Yet Rushmore still feels a tad underdeveloped and rather vacuous. I guess I lack the proper eccentricities to enjoy such a picture.Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, and Brian Cox. Directed by Wes Anderson.
