While there are some films that are so bad, it seems they never should have been started, this one probably shouldn't have been left on the scrap heap and never finished. Imagine the money they would have saved on visual effects, which are awesome, and have some serious sound design to go along with them. Everything else (acting and storytelling), unfortunately, is treated as secondary. It's as if director Brian DePalma were trying to beat an impossible deadline set by the studio.A committee of writers wrote this thing but, despite this, the story is promising. It's the year 2020 (a bit optimistic, I'd say) and we've managed to open an orbiting, multi-nation mission control station. From there, the first manned mission to the planet's surface is launched, led by Luke Graham (Don Cheadle). I was disappointed that they skipped past Man's First Steps on Mars and picked up the mission a few days in. Guess they figured we'd see the real thing soon enough. Before long, the crew meets disaster when they are attacked by a really cool special effect. Mission control has no idea what happened to the crew of four, but they have reason to believe someone may have survived. Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise), was supposed to be the first man to Mars but was forced out when his wife became ill, will now finally get his chance.DePalma is very dependable when it comes to staging action sequences and incorporating special effects (the only factors that saved Snake Eyes and Mission Impossible, his last two films). Too bad he can't always get David Mamet (DePalma's The Untouchables) to write his scripts for him. This one seems thrown together, having been either written on the fly or ignored. Just about every cliche' ever used in movie dialogue is dusted off and incorporated somewhere in this script. I felt sorry for this seasoned crew of actors (Tim Robbins, Jerry O'Connell, Kim Delaney, Connie Nielsen, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Sinise, Cheadle) who did the best they could delivering their stupid lines. At times, I just wanted to cover my ears because I couldn't take it any more. Speaking of covering my ears, I could have done without Ennio Morricone's score. When he composed this music, was he watching the wrong film? The inappropriate, distracting score actually ruins some well-executed action sequences.My conclusion about Mission To Mars is that this could have been a decent sci-fi film if it weren't ruined by amateurish oversights. The finished product, a curious melding of two genres, the realistic space mission movie, ala Apollo 13, and science fiction, is a mere shadow of what it could have been.

Alas, the same is not true for the storyteller.Repetition in story telling is a death knell.  I'm very familiar  with the Star Wars universe as a setting.  I don't have a problem with that.  Once you create a fictional universe, you must operate within the confines of your creation to tell other stories which reside in that universe.  However, you don't have to tell the same story with different characters.I was absolutely shocked to see young Skywalker blowing up the Trade Federation ship by destroying its power supply with a lucky shot from the inside.  Echoes of the past passed through my mind.  Luke, what's wrong, you turned off your targeting computer?  See my point?  Well, at least Anakin had the help of a friendly droid named, R2D2.

Do they have little midichlorians running around in their non cells?Did you also notice that in The Phantom Menace we have a young royal in trouble.  I think I've seen that one before with Princess Leia.  Well this time it is Queen Amidalia, approximately the same age as Leia was in Star Wars IV.  I also found it odd that Queen Amidalia was the elected leader of Naboo.  A seventeen year old elected queen?  Hmmmm.  This just doesn't make sense.  Who elected her?The absolute worst aspect of this film is with Anakin himself.  Acting is a serious profession.  I've never seen an eight or nine year old pull it off with any sense of believability.  To be sure, the script doomed Anakin even further.  The attack on the Droid control ship contains three separate instances within ten minutes in which Anakin's lines include an elongated, Ooooops.  This is both sloppy writing and horrendous editing.  It doesn't get much better though.  When the ship spins or rocks, Lucas gives us a comic shot of Anakin yelling, whoooooaaa.  Once might be forgiven, but he does it again and again.Don't ask me how Anakin penetrates the shield.  This is never explained.  To be sure, the grown up pilots couldn't do it.There are good points to this movie, however.  Ewan McGregor did  an outstanding job mastering the accent and mannerisms of Alec Guinnes' Obi Wan Kenobi.  In addition, Liam Neeson delivers well  as the individualistic and somewhat weary defender of the universe, Qui Gon Jinn.In addition, I thought the supporting cast performed well.

In fact, I'll bet he becomes Boba Fett.  Ian McDiarmid is probably the most memorable of all of the supporting roles.  He plays Palpatine remarkably.And finally, the shining triumph of the film;  the swashbuckling at the climax.  Simply, it is the finest sword fight scene ever to make it to the screen.  Darth Maul was played to perfection through facial expressions.  How unique to give life to a character without lines.  Bottom line is that it worked.  Ray Park is not a physically imposing fellow.  Darth Maul was.  Unfortunately, three different action sequences are occurring during the Sith v.
