Thankfully it hasn't died but it is unfortunately not resorted to that often anymore. During the early 1990s, this classic and unique animation technique began getting dropped from film projects because of its next best replacement - CGI. With the demonstration of Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991), that CGI could be controlled and used correctly, many movie studios want it to be in their upcoming projects. For that reason alone, stop-motion animation was left behind when it came to live-action films. But there were others who thought differently. Also in the early 1990s The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) was released to the public and became one of the greatest holiday films of its decade. Behind the wheel of this vehicle was a small time filmmaker named Henry Selick. Since then his filmography has been quite small but to this day has made sure his films contained stop-motion in it. His second feature would be just as memorable to kids who grew up during this time and that was this.Based on a children's book by Roald Dahl, the story is about a English youth named James (Paul Terry) who looks to visit New York City but lives under the strict rule of his aunts Sponge and Spiker (Miriam Margolyes & Joanna Lumley) after the death of his parents. Then, unbeknownst to him, a stranger (Pete Postlethwaite) appears and gives him magical trinkets that'll help make his dreams come true. This arrives in the form of a giant peach that harbors future insect friends. These characters are Mr. Grasshopper (Simon Callow), Mr. Centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), Mrs. Ladybug (Jane Leeves), Ms. Spider (Susan Sarandon) and Mr. Worm (David Thewlis). The adaptation of Dahl's book was written by Karey Kirkpatrick (Chicken Run (2000)), Jonathan Roberts (The Lion King (1994)) and Steve Bloom (Jack Frost (1998)) and for the majority of the film, it's practically the same. Plus, the character development and overall message of the story is well thought out and optimistic.The character development focuses on learning to accept one's differences and understand how each individual brings unique benefits to certain situations. The overall message in the story is to never stop believing and always look on the positive side of things. These are life lessons that everyone needs to know about no matter how old you are when viewing this film. For acting, although Paul Terry quit the profession not long after this film, for a child actor he's not bad (or annoying). His appearance is innocent and feels genuine in physical form and voice work. Miriam Margolyes and Joanna Lumley as James' aunts are quite the opposite and they do it well. Being gross and greedy is their shtick. The supporting cast of voice actors who bring James' bug friends to life are enjoyable too. Simon Callow as Mr. Grasshopper plays quite the upperclassmen that isn't snooty enough to talk to someone below his level. Richard Dreyfuss as the wisecracking centipede has a number of funny lines either when it comes to himself or certain situations he's in.Jane Leeves as Mrs. Ladybug is sweet and also shows feminine strength when called for. David Thewlis as Mr. Worm plays with a Scottish accent and sometimes fears the worst but too learns to cope. Lastly Susan Sarandon as Ms. Spider uses a Russian accent and although she's a bit colder than her counterparts, she too has a charming attitude. However even with these positives the writing isn't perfect. One of the screenplays biggest blunders is its continuity. There were moments where claims are made about certain dangers and yet a minute later, the labeled danger will no longer be a threat for unexplained reasons. Another example is how James and co. weren't able to find their way to NYC without a compass, yet a map that James has clearly shows them which direction they are traveling as they move. Seems a little pointless to go find something that'll help you when you already have what you need. The other problem is that the way this story was written is the strange reality that James' lives in feels illogical.For this, there are certain things that should have an expected facial reaction but the exact opposite is portrayed. It just doesn't look right. For animation, as mentioned before stop-motion was used and it looks great. The jagged and tangible like edges to the characters give them a likable visual appeal. The live-action is also well done too. This also goes hand-in-hand with both live-action and animated cinematography provided by Hiro Narita and Pete Kozachik respectively. Narita's work efficiently shows the contrast between James' past and current life and how all the fun was sucked out of it. Kozachik on the other hand effectively conceals the illusion of various matte painting backdrops to help make the animated world feel bigger than life. Lastly Randy Newman composed the film score a year after the massive success of his work on Disney's Toy Story (1995). Here Newman's music feels like his, but also has bits that sound like Danny Elfman got in on a few areas too. Either way it is fun to listen to and with its catchy songs.The script has decent character development and has important life lessons for people to reacquaint themselves with despite it having some noticeable continuity errors. Also some characters react oddly to certain implausible situations as if they were entirely acceptable. This aside, the characters are charming, the music is enjoyable and the visuals are delightfully engaging with the help of stop-motion animation.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"23 December 2015","score":"","review":" Roald Dahl is one of my favorite fantasy writers because what I loved about his stories was how he brought fairy tales to our modern era and existence, which to me showed that fantasy stories don't have to just be confined to the medieval era but can be in our time frame. Which also further show that in the fantasy genre anything truly is possible and anything can go. This film is another one of my favorite fantasy films of all time and it's also another childhood relic, I've seen this film when I was about seven.I really love the production value, everything is practical they successfully create a great look of the factory, the factory is sort of like the Tardis in Doctor Who it's literally a hidden world where you see all sorts of things from the Candy Land which as a kid I wanted to go to because I wanted to chomp on most of that candy. Down to the machines that look like something out of Rub Goldburg cartoons, my favorite machine is that gum machine, which is strange from what it has like crushing tomatoes and a bee hive. The writing is excellent, the dialog is just clever and at times really funny, there are so many memorable lines that it would take more than one watch to hear and get them all.Though like in Brothers Grimm fashion the film can also be kinda dark and a bit scary. From each of the life and death situations the kids stupidly get themselves into. Down to that infamous boat ride from hell scene, that scene is one of the most bizarre and scariest scene I've ever seen really scared me when I was a kid. It's like some trippy experimental film that some doped up film student cooked up as you are just seeing random nasty images.The music is great as there are plenty of memorable songs. Two of my favorites are of course Pure Imagination sung beautifully by Gene Wilder. And my second one is I Want it Now, that song is just fun and really hilarious as the song is the expression of the epitome of Veruka's greed and vanity.The characters are great, really like protagonist Charlie whom is the everyday kid you've probably passed by or were. He's good natured, never selfish he's selfless as he loves his family and does his best to help them out. He's sympathetic as he really has not much to anything going for his life. I wouldn't say he's so much a kid with dreams but more like a kid whom is looking for something great in life, a chance to taste it may'be be part of it.I really like how you see a parallel contrast between him and the rest of the kids in the group. All of the other kids have been in rich or high class existences which means they had practically every advantage in life but as we see have turned out kinda rotten. Where we see Charlie he's lived on the low end of things but he turned out to be alright as he's smart and kind. It just shows that just because you grew up on the wrong side of the tracks doesn't mean a person will turn out bad; and just because someone grew up on the right side doesn't always mean they'll be good.Veruka Salt she is a kid you just love to dislike. To me she is just the absolute worst of the bunch because she is just spoiled rotten to the core. Her constant bad case of the gimmies can make you both laugh and grown at the same time. But seeing her just goes to show that giving your kid everything he or she asks for is bad parenting at best because your teaching your kid a bad lesson that they get everything handed to them. As Lincoln Hawk once said Life don't go one way for nobody, Veruka is going to learn that saying the hard way.And of course my favorite character is Willy Wonka played by one of my favorite comedic actors Gene Wilder. This is my favorite role from him, he has some of the best lines ever but he just has just this great amount of energy both physically and comedically, to me Gene really is Willy Wonka. In a way he's kinda like Doctor Who as his character has this three dimensional enigmatic quality to him. At times he can be truthful but then he's not, he can also flip on his persona. There's a bit of a good back and forth between both Charlie and him, it's almost a father and son like dynamic as Willy fills in that father figure role that Charlie is sorely missing.One of my favorite moments with Willy is the cream room where it's literally both verbal and visual humor at work. As he is just saying something and then putting his play on words to practice, when he puts some random things in each cream mixture. I always wonder what else does he put into the mixtures.And of course like with most fairy tales this film has a sense of morality, there are a lot of underlying messages without being preachy or heavy handed. Like how it's OK for kids to indulge in the sweets of life but it's more important they get what they need in order to grow healthy and happy. But also about bad parenting, why we need to be better teachers for kids, teach them and give them what's more important in life, to not spoil and indulge them all the time which is practically the equivalent of giving them nothing.This fantasy is full of rich goodness.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"23 December 2015","score":"","review":" Roald Dahl is one of my favorite fantasy writers because what I loved about his stories was how he brought fairy tales to our modern era and existence, which to me showed that fantasy stories don't have to just be confined to the medieval era but can be in our time frame.

It's like some trippy experimental film that some doped up film student cooked up as you are just seeing random nasty images.The music is great as there are plenty of memorable songs. Two of my favorites are of course Pure Imagination sung beautifully by Gene Wilder. And my second one is I Want it Now, that song is just fun and really hilarious as the song is the expression of the epitome of Veruka's greed and vanity.The characters are great, really like protagonist Charlie whom is the everyday kid you've probably passed by or were. He's good natured, never selfish he's selfless as he loves his family and does his best to help them out. He's sympathetic as he really has not much to anything going for his life. I wouldn't say he's so much a kid with dreams but more like a kid whom is looking for something great in life, a chance to taste it may'be be part of it.I really like how you see a parallel contrast between him and the rest of the kids in the group. All of the other kids have been in rich or high class existences which means they had practically every advantage in life but as we see have turned out kinda rotten. Where we see Charlie he's lived on the low end of things but he turned out to be alright as he's smart and kind. It just shows that just because you grew up on the wrong side of the tracks doesn't mean a person will turn out bad; and just because someone grew up on the right side doesn't always mean they'll be good.Veruka Salt she is a kid you just love to dislike. To me she is just the absolute worst of the bunch because she is just spoiled rotten to the core. Her constant bad case of the gimmies can make you both laugh and grown at the same time. But seeing her just goes to show that giving your kid everything he or she asks for is bad parenting at best because your teaching your kid a bad lesson that they get everything handed to them. As Lincoln Hawk once said Life don't go one way for nobody, Veruka is going to learn that saying the hard way.And of course my favorite character is Willy Wonka played by one of my favorite comedic actors Gene Wilder. This is my favorite role from him, he has some of the best lines ever but he just has just this great amount of energy both physically and comedically, to me Gene really is Willy Wonka. In a way he's kinda like Doctor Who as his character has this three dimensional enigmatic quality to him. At times he can be truthful but then he's not, he can also flip on his persona. There's a bit of a good back and forth between both Charlie and him, it's almost a father and son like dynamic as Willy fills in that father figure role that Charlie is sorely missing.One of my favorite moments with Willy is the cream room where it's literally both verbal and visual humor at work. As he is just saying something and then putting his play on words to practice, when he puts some random things in each cream mixture. I always wonder what else does he put into the mixtures.And of course like with most fairy tales this film has a sense of morality, there are a lot of underlying messages without being preachy or heavy handed. Like how it's OK for kids to indulge in the sweets of life but it's more important they get what they need in order to grow healthy and happy. But also about bad parenting, why we need to be better teachers for kids, teach them and give them what's more important in life, to not spoil and indulge them all the time which is practically the equivalent of giving them nothing.This fantasy is full of rich goodness.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Family, Fantasy, Musical"},{"date":"23 December 2015","score":"","review":" Roald Dahl is one of my favorite fantasy writers because what I loved about his stories was how he brought fairy tales to our modern era and existence, which to me showed that fantasy stories don't have to just be confined to the medieval era but can be in our time frame. Which also further show that in the fantasy genre anything truly is possible and anything can go. This film is another one of my favorite fantasy films of all time and it's also another childhood relic, I've seen this film when I was about seven.I really love the production value, everything is practical they successfully create a great look of the factory, the factory is sort of like the Tardis in Doctor Who it's literally a hidden world where you see all sorts of things from the Candy Land which as a kid I wanted to go to because I wanted to chomp on most of that candy. Down to the machines that look like something out of Rub Goldburg cartoons, my favorite machine is that gum machine, which is strange from what it has like crushing tomatoes and a bee hive. The writing is excellent, the dialog is just clever and at times really funny, there are so many memorable lines that it would take more than one watch to hear and get them all.Though like in Brothers Grimm fashion the film can also be kinda dark and a bit scary. From each of the life and death situations the kids stupidly get themselves into.

Dispensing with an original plot, this plays more like a generic monster movie, with lots of people getting eaten and a sinister government conspiracy acting as the catalyst for all the evil. The only way to actually enjoy this movie is to laugh at it, just like I did. Take it seriously and you'll be in for a rough time. A cast of nobodies and a couple of B-movie old-timers are picked off one by one by some vicious raptor-like dinosaur. The explanation for all this is some kind of silly, confused rubbish, about genetically modifying chickens or something.Throughout this film we see women giving birth to dinosaur eggs...Excuse me while credibility flies out of the window. Towards the end of the film the chief scientist gets to talk for 20 WHOLE MINUTES about why she's doing what she is, and it gets boring very quickly. I can't emphasise how totally dumb and mindless this film is. The leads act in stupid ways, people hang around and wait to be killed, and nobody has a very plausible death scene - instead, they all sit or stand around waiting for the dinosaurs to show up and munch on them. Some silly dialogue (it carved him up like a Christmas turkey!) and some really annoying subtitles also help to spoil things.The male lead, played by some non-entity going by the name of Raphael Sbarge, is totally wooden and far too young to have any authority. Diane Ladd, who plays the misguided scientist, is usually far too superior to appear in rubbish like this and looks mightily out of place. Clint Howard is wasted in a tiny role which fails to make use of his creepy talents, while only Harrison Page (A.W.O.L.) lends any credibility to the proceedings as the old-time sheriff. The best part of this film has to be the unexpected, out-of-nowhere ending which had me in stitches. Oh, and the excessive violence.The producers obviously saw fit to add in as much unpleasant, comic book gore as they possibly could here, and the results are splashed (often vividly) across the screen. Countless non-actors and actresses are eaten by the dinosaurs, having their chests and stomachs torn open. Faces and legs are also chewed off. Other hapless souls lose their hands and arms to the monsters.Don't watch this movie expecting any fun special effects. The dinosaurs are extremely poorly animated, some of the worst I have ever seen in fact. Forget CGI, forget stop-motion, even forget the men in rubber suits; these clunky models beat everything in terms of sheer nerve and hopelessness when it comes down to the special effects. When standing still, they look fine, but as soon as they move, the film loses it. Sometimes they're obviously being carried along just off camera. This is bad enough, but then a giant T-Rex goes on the rampage and things get worse. I'm speechless as to how poor these effects were - they have to be seen for yourself. Things made more sense as the credits rolled and I saw that half of the actors were also crew members, and it all begins to fall into place when you see that Roger Corman's production company were responsible for this outrage. It only gets an extra star for the bloody violence. This is bad, bad, bad, so please don't bother watching it!

I played the Nintendo game for more hours than I can count, so for nostalgia alone I can't outright dislike this movie. It's great looking for sure. The lush environments and set designs are excellent, as is the appearance of Darth Maul - possibly the most underused character in the entire franchise. But the actual meat of the movie - the plot, the characters, the flow - is an absolute mess. It's like a McDonald's meal. It gives you temporary satisfaction and looks appealing at first, but there's no substance and ultimately leaves you feeling guilty and disappointed. First of all, the movie has no right to be so damn long. Half the dialogue is platitudes and political jargon, the other half is Jar Jar. And I can't even blame Jar Jar for his idiocy, because it's Qui-Gon who thinks it's a good idea to bring this stupid creature along for the ride. Like, why on earth would a wise Jedi Knight like Qui-Gon trust in a random Gungan to do... what did he want from Jar Jar again? It was a total coincidence that there was a Gungan army, and Jar Jar was a total nuisance during their mission on Naboo, so why the hell did Qui-Gon keep him around? It makes no sense. And I can go on and on about what doesn't make sense about this movie. For the sake of time, I'll just name the second biggest offender and that's young Anakin. Aside from the fact that the last thing we needed was to see Darth Vader as a bratty child, Anakin is one of the most annoying characters in the franchise. Everything he does works out perfectly. How do the Jedi succeed? Because Anakin saves the planet from the droid army! How? He accidentally flew into space and destroyed the federation ship, also by accident! Yay, for one of the most ridiculous and frustrating deus ex machinas in movie history.Every other character is a cardboard cutout. Qui-Gon has no personality, neither does Yoda, or Mace Windu, or Padmé. The only likable character is Obi-Wan and even he gets whiny at times. The plot is just horrendous. I mean, who wants to learn about politics and intergalactic taxation laws in the Star Wars universe? I sure as hell don't.What saves this movie is the lightsaber duel at the end. Seriously, if not for the battle with Darth Maul this movie would be borderline unwatchable. Duel of the Fates is one of the best John Williams pieces ever, and the fight itself is epic. Sure, they look like they're dancing, but who cares? The choreography is awesome and it just looks amazing. It's how you'd expect a fight with a Sith Lord to go down. It also has suspense, which was completely absent from the movie before then. The only issue with it is that it cuts from the saber fight to the Gungan battle with Jar Jar (who was promoted to general for some dumbass reason) acting like an idiot and only managing to stay alive by accident, and Anakin flying around in space also only staying alive by accident. But the saber fight is so great I'll let it slide. That still doesn't account for the first hour and a half of the movie.The Phantom Menace is a bloated mess with a couple promising aspects and one incredible fight to keep you entertained.

Suspended from his functions, and now a drunk with a terrible hangover, McClane will have to accomplish different tasks throughout the day to prevent other bombs from exploding while the man who apparently placed the bombs instructs him what he has to do next.This third film from the Die Hard franchise is arguably my personal favourite (a tie with the first one). The action is relentless, the dialogue is sharp and hilarious, the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson is palpable, a proper amount of dark humour is cleverly used to lighten up the tone and even bring social commentary on racial tensions without ever being sanctimonious. There are plenty of over-the-top moments, and the realism of the script's chronology is definitely questionable. However, it's all honest entertainment, set in the beautiful NYC that you really get to see and feel, thanks to John MacTiernan's talent at establishing geography in his scenes, and the events depicted in the film all happen within the same day, which, to me, is one of the key elements that make the Die Hard films so great, and feel like such a rush of adrenaline.Bruce Willis offers a great physical performance, and you can bet the house his character is drenched in blood, sweat and oil by the time the credits roll. Samuel L. Jackson is a great addition as John McClane's ally and turns this into a memorable cop buddy movie more than anything else. Jeremy Irons is excellent as the antagonist. The ending is a bit flawed and feels like it was a tad rushed, but the overall spectacle is so much fun and entertainment, you can't do anything but kick back, relax, and enjoy the show.Die Hard With a Vengeance is a clever mix of nail-biting situations (the scene when McClane has to walk in Harlem wearing nothing but a sign with a racial slur written on it comes to mind), classic 90's type action (the scene in the subway), and comedy (one scene in which Johnny comes marching home will get you smiling), all wrapped up in a competently photographed, dynamically directed, tremendously paced package.Highly recommended.

Dr Frankenstein is initially sceptical about taking residence in his late great-grandfather's castle, but soon becomes interested when he discovers his great-grandfather's private library. Armed with a book from this library and a corpse Frankenstein begins 'experimenting' with potentially disastrous consequences.I tried watching this film in its entirety on two occasions - first time I fell asleep halfway through and being the sort of person who can't pick up on a film the next day from the halfway point I started the film again the following day. The second time I made it to about 15 minutes from the end and gave up again. I decided not to start again and just watched the last 15 minutes just so that I can say that I watched it all. That just goes to show how bored I was when watching this film....The problem I had with this film is that the story for me was very weak and rather repetitive. I also found large portions of the film unfunny simply because very little was done with the character of The Monster - I mean he's got an abnormal brain so why not make the film funnier by showing him being crazy all the time and doing made things? Poor Peter Boyle was just left grunting and snarling and whilst this perhaps is more of an accurate reflection of how The Monster behaves it doesn't make for a very good comedy film in my opinion.Wilder gives a rather Marmite performance here; infectious and amusing in the early stages, but his overacting gets worse and worse as the film progresses and he started to become tiresome towards the end. Many of the other performances are OK, but it's clear that Brooks' approach here was the louder the better - there is lots of shouting and noise which is unbearable and irritating at times.This isn't an out and out failure and there are certainly some amusing moments; the bookcase scene was brilliant and I also found it funny when Frankenstein and his creation were both singing and dancing to the song 'Putting On The Ritz'. However I only laughed twice in the 100 minute running time and I'm somewhat puzzled by the high ratings that it's getting on IMDb. I haven't seen the Frankenstein films of old so perhaps that's part of the problem. However, given the fact that this is billed as a Comedy and due to its high rating I expected to be laughing consistently and in that respect I can't help but feel a little short-changed.

It effected me even more because of the death of amazing actor Brandon Lee on the set of the movie. After his death his fiancée and others decided to finish the movie, and dedicate it to Brandon and his Fiancée, Eliza Hutton.

Deke DaSilva (Stallone playing a Police Officer for the first time in his career) and Matthew Fox (Billy Dee Williams) are two New York City cops who get transferred to an elite anti-terrorism squad. About this same time, an infamous international terrorist called Wulfar (Rutgar Hauer) shows up in New York City.I'm not to sure why audiences stayed away from this movie, as it is a really good cop movie, with Sly (looking very much like Al Pacino in Serpico) putting in a good performance, alongside Billy Dee Williams and Rutgar Hauer. If anything it was ahead of its time. According to Hauer, Stallone was very egoistic and he constantly interfered with filming of the movie, even writing and adding some new scenes for his character because he was jealous that Hauer's character was doing more cool stuff in the movie. Two test screenings of the movie were shown, one with more Stallone's scenes and other with more Hauer's scenes. The version with more Hauer's scenes was better received by audience. This is why Stallone, known for his big ego, cut out some of the Hauer's scenes from the final version of the movie. The original cut of the movie was almost two and a half hours long. Stallone was said to be really disappointed with the way Universal studio reedited the movie (despite the fact that he did his share of reediting on the movie prior to the studio's interference). He was really upset because of the removal of his dramatic scenes with Lindsay Wagner, including an emotional scene between him and Wagner in a restaurant (only mentioned in the final version of the movie) where his character breaks down and cries after his wife refuses to remarry with him.Prior to its theatrical release, It was also severely cut for violence by both the MPAA. Amongst the scenes that were cut are the disco shootout which originally had Wufgar shooting and killing more people, and Wufgar's death scene in the ending which was almost completely cut out. An original uncut scene showed Wufgar getting shot five times (instead of twice) in slow-motion by DaSilva, and in the end, the final sixth shot hit him in the head blowing his brains out.

Similar to THE UNCANNY, you might think, and you'd be right; Milton Subotsky's name even finds itself in the closing credits (after purchasing rights to loads of Stephen King short stories). But the thing that differentiates CAT'S EYE from other typical American horror anthologies (I mean the likes of CREEPSHOW 2 and TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE THE MOVIE) is that for once, all of the stories are above average. Usually there's a couple of good ones, or one excellent, and the others being below average, but not in this case. The stories are taken from Stephen King shorts (apart from the last segment, which I can't really remember reading), and there are even a couple of gags for those in the know; a 1958 Plymouth Fury drives past in one scene, while another characters sees THE DEAD ZONE on television and asks who writes this crap?.The feel of the first story, with a terrified man trapped in a nightmare, desperate for a cigarette but unable to smoke for fear of harming his wife, is excellent, and James Woods is perfect in the role. Like all the best anthology segments, there's a twist in the tale and the episode really can't be bettered.The second story is almost as good, and the journey around the ledge makes for some very taut and terrifying moments that will truly make your palms sweat (and it's even more effective if you're scared of heights like I am). Just check out the pigeon moment! Once again there's a twist ending and the segment is very enjoyable, especially the scene where the men wager on the cat's ability to cross a busy road.The cat also features heavily in the final segment, coming off worst again before battling the nasty troll creature.

Despite having a number of flaws, CARLITO'S WAY is still a very good film, chronicling as it does so the life of Al Pacino's gangster as he is released from prison and determined to go straight. But we've all heard that before... Okay, so this film is behind SCARFACE, which was one of the best gangster films ever, but for the '90s it's very good and stands up on its own amongst all the junk filling the shelves these days. De Palma adds in all his trademark homages to Hitchcock (especially in the last twenty minutes) and stylistic touches which make this film interesting and sometimes exciting to watch.Where it falls apart somewhat is in the dialogue scenes, especially in the added romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller. The film's running time does feel excessive (2 hours 19 minutes) and a lot of these scenes are dragged out. Miller is miscast as Pacino's love interest, because she just isn't a very convincing actress. Thankfully these stodgy moments only account for a quarter of the film. For the rest of the time we're back in familiar territory. The cast is populated by seedy villains (John Leguizamo is a standout as a creep), and it's Sean Penn who really excels in an unrecognisable role as Pacino's crooked lawyer, a cokehead to boot. Penn is very good here, a real character you love to hate.Obviously, though, it's Pacino who stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, and he doesn't disappoint either. He portrays a character who is out of touch with the modern world, a romantic who is sometimes crooked, sometimes violent, but infinitely likable. The violent content to the film has been toned down a lot since SCARFACE, but there are still a couple of bloody moments to behold from de Palma's gory, glory days including a wince-inducing shot to the face. Where this film really excels is in the final twenty minutes, a lengthy chase scene. This sequence is taught, tense and totally thrilling, and easily the best part of the entire film.Okay, so there are numerous flaws; the voice-over seems unnecessary and intrusive, as if De Palma had watched GOODFELLAS one too many times, the whodunit aspect of the ending is easily guessable, and the running time is far too long and needs judicious trimming. But despite these factors, CARLITO'S WAY is still a cut above the rest, and prime viewing for gangster fans.
