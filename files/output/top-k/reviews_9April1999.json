Benigni's film is only mildly funny at its best and terribly offensive at its worst.Numerous reviews have compared Benigni to Chaplin, a grave disservice to Chaplin's memory. Benigni's pratfalls can be seen coming a mile away; at one point he even falls over a chair while carrying a loaded tray of food. How original!Worse, Benigni never, never stops talking. His rapid-fire delivery is funny for about 10 minutes, then it's simply annoying.After about an hour of this somewhat amusing comedy, Benigni and his family get carted off to a concentration camp and the film becomes an exercise in amazingly bad taste. Gee, that place is remarkably clean and safe for a concentration camp. Benigni doesn't have to worry about being shot when he casually walks out the door at one point, these German soldiers are so stupid that a little boy can evade them just by hiding on the top of a bunk bed and ducking anytime someone comes in.Benigni complains constantly when forced to do hard labor-- oh, those Nazis were so mean, weren't they, making him carry all those anvils? But look how they took that Jewish guy off to the infirmary and stitched up his arm when he got hurt. I guess all those stories about how troublesome Jews were dragged to one side and shot weren't true.In short, Benigni presents a camp with almost no horror, or horror extremely white-washed. We never see him deal with the fact that his father was gassed, along with many others he probably knew. He gets on the PA system to send a message to his wife at one point, a blatantly manipulative scene that is clearly meant to get the audience teary. Would anyone do that in real life, risking both his own life and that of his son? Ditto for the playing classical music so his wife can hear it nonsense.And the end, oh the end--I nearly screamed in anger and frustration--you can practically hear Benigni saying, now, that wasn't so bad, was it? as the inmates walk away from the camp.  A concentration camp's a breeze if you just grin and never stop talking.

I'm sorry, but you have missed the point entirely, and I feel sorry for you in that you could not see the tragic beauty encapsulated within this work. I bet you are the same people that complain that they could not understand 2001.The Thin Red Line is quite simply a poetic masterpiece. It is the story of many men, and of all of us, as we attempt to confront our mortality, and who and what we are. The Thin Red Line is a Story of War, not a War movie, but more than that, it looks at all of us, ordinary men, each unique in their own way, each struggling to find a sense of place and meaning in this life before the inevitable onset of death, sooner or later (or sooner in war). Men who attempt make sense of their lives, and what men are driven to confront in extreme circumstances.I cannot being to convey in words the sense of what I felt this film was attempting to say. I'm not talking in a religious sense, the monologues and the camera work seemed to allude to a universal oneness of all things, or a truth in all things, even in war, an impermanency set amidst a tremendous and universal permanency. War almost became an allegory for the flawed, frail and tragic beauty of human life and existence. How do we survive ourselves, how to we reconcile ourselves to ourselves, to each other, and to what it means to be human and to be mortal?The story was there, but the portrayal of war was probably more realistic than anything ever I have ever yet seen. In war, there were many moments where 'not a lot happened', many moments of stillness and inactivity, and when 'action' came, it wasn't necessarily on the large scale of a full assault with cannons blasting. It was 'matter of fact' as this film portrayed it. The very basic story was the taking of Quadacamal and the ultimate toll that the taking exerted on these men. The actor was Charlie company, and a collection of men who represent us all.In fact found the cast of leading actors a distraction, and I would have preferred a cast of unknowns. It was inevitable that you would end up saying, oh, there's John Travolta, or there's George Clooney, which on occasions, prevented you from being completely immersed in the film. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte to a lesser degree, I felt was the exceptions to this.Saving Private Ryan, because I cannot help make the comparison, despite having many moving moments, I found contrived and simplistic by comparison, a pre-digested account of the horror and inanity of war, replete with the standard references and hackneyed plot. A war movie for the Reebok generation. Spielberg could not help but delve into his Peter Pan style story telling. And despite his promise to look at the men of the war (and that war drives men on both sides to do terrible things), he could not help but delve into the standard all 'Germans are really bad and therefore deserved it' mantra. I didn't see that with Malick's portrayal of the Japanese. Sorry Saving Private Ryan was a disappointment, and the Stars and Stripes, replete with the attractive well-rounded blond-haired grand children was sickening to behold.Thin Red Line is quite simply a masterpiece (shot in North Queensland).

In high school she was the penultimate loser smart, unattractive, and teased incessantly (she was known Josie Grossie).  She is a hopeless romantic, and, as the title implies, has never been kissed.Josie is convinced that this time around things will be different, but becomes an instant pariah, avoided by everyone except the pretty smart girl who accepts her into the nerd fold.  She is only saved when her supercool brother enrolls in high school with her, and gets her accepted into the important cliques.The angst filled teen years have been fodder for many movies (Pretty In Pink, Can't Buy Me Love, etc), and will be for many more.  Everyone knew a Josie in high school, however when Barrymore plays her, you probably feel more empathy for her than you did the genuine article.  Barrymore is riding on the success of Ever After, and she's just so damn sweet it's hard not to like her. David Arquette  was great as Rob, Josie's over the top brother who sees his own salvation in Josie's quest.  Finally, Josie's boss -played by a manic Gary Marshall- was an excellent breath of fresh air ( taking us back to his days on  Murphy Brown where his erratic self serving egotist was always good for a laugh)I particularly enjoyed the subtle in-jokes scripted for the over twenties in the audience Josie is named after Josie, of the Pussycats fame, and the Village People at the couples dance, among others. Also, any movie with a band playing the theme from the Simpsons can't be all bad..I did find  however that the movie spent too much time in flashbacks  to show  Josie's tragic existence in high school.  And the depiction of the cliques was too black and white for my tastes  the geeks were all ugly, uncoordinated losers (save the leader played by Leelee Sobieski) , and all the cool kids were gorgeous buffoons.  Couldn't they just for once have a little more diversity?In summary, this movie is not the best of its kind, nor is it the worst. It is a good cheap Tuesday date movie, which I think most people will enjoy.

It gives you hope and paints a unique portrait of the afterlife and a reconciliation of father and son through America's pastime Baseball.  This is not strictly a baseball movie, however, I find it to be the best baseball film of all-time.  Phil Alden Robinson has captured the spirituality of a plain baseball field and the thousands of dreams that are based on it.  As soon as Ray Kinsella (Costner in a good performance) hears the voices of the netherworld, we are immediately intrigued and brought into the heavenly cornfield he stands in. Baseball is the symbol of stability that has always been around when human beings cease to exist on this earth.  The joy of the ghostly players is felt by us as well and Costner's family is obviously at the centerpoint of something incredible.This small, but poignant film is one of those rare gems that transcends conventionality and truly reaches for your heart.  Composer James Horner (TITANIC) helps immensely with a score that moves you on its own.  Amy Madigan is Costner's trusting wife and fellow free-spirit of the 60's.  The other performances are all fine as well.  James Earl Jones plays the reclusive writer Terence Mann, based on real life author of the 60's generation J.D. Salinger (Catcher in the Rye).  Lancaster is a heavenly presence as the good doctor seen by Costner in another dimension of place and time.  Burt plays old Doc Graham, an ex-ballplayer who never got to bat in the major leagues.  His part in the story is an important building block to the film's point.  A second chance at an unaccomplished pursuit of a dream and a chance for redemption.Ray Liotta is colorful and wise as legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson. (By the way, who cares that he really batted left and threw right).  Baseball purists may find this meaningless error deterrent to the picture as a whole, which is ridiculous.  Liotta's comments on the ghostly player's opinion of the difficult Ty Cobb is hilarious.  A commune of teamwork and love of the game exists between the ghosts and the Kinsellas are allowed to watch some great games between players long dead.  I know anyone reading this far who could give a hoot about baseball may be turned off, but you must see this motion picture to believe it.  It is a triumph of the human spirit, a triumph of forgiveness, and a realization of life after death.The whole sub-plot element of the 60's and James Earl Jones' reasons for being there are ambiguous at times, but can easily be overlooked.  FIELD OF DREAMS is like ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE or E.T.  We see something that takes place in the real world, but otherworldly events transpire to make us think and feel.  It is a tear-jerker like the latter films because it appeals so much to our emotions.  The purity of baseball and personal relationships are juxtaposed perfectly to create a stunning work of art.

I was also pleased that Demi Moore (JoAnne Galloway), and Tom Cruise (Daniel Kaffee) were not written into an unneccessary (and unrealistic) love plot, either.

After a line up like that, generally I would be getting bored of movies, but I loved this movie.  This movie held my attention all the way through its 2 hours+Plot  I cannot explain it.  You'll have to see it for yourself.  The concept is strange, and I liked it.  It explains a lot.  I could just barely follow the plot as the movie was flying by at breakneck speed (although the plot wasn't).  It is complicated, so pay attention.  If you like mind-numbing movies, wait for summer action flix to come out.Acting  It was decent.  I mean, Keanu Reeves sucks as an actor, but Fishburne rocks.  He is one of the hottest actors of current cinema.  Don't miss Pulp Fiction.  The actress is good, but good looking too.  Man was she hot in her clothes.  You can surpass the acting for the rest of the movie though.Action and EffectsOutstanding.  Easily the best effects for a long time. The bullets, and the staging were great.

The tidal wave occurs early on in the film, but not early enough to spare us from some horribly scripted, as well as badly acted, scenes introducing the main characters  a police detective whose wife, a former prostitute, is ashamed of her past and worries that every man she meets may be a former customer; a maverick reverend and his more traditionally minded colleague; a sexy blonde lounge singer; the old couple who spout cliches about life and love; the teenage girl and her brat sibling who knows more about the workings of the vessel than the captain; and, of course, the captain himself, who, as played by Leslie Nielson, is cut from the same cardboard as the characters he so memorably lampooned in Airplane and The Naked Gun years later.  Like a good captain, Nielson goes down with his ship, perhaps out of loyalty, perhaps because he read the script which bears the names of Stirling Silliphant, an Oscar winner for In the Heat of the Night, and Wendall Mayes, probably an Oscar winner for the only good film he wrote, too (I haven't a clue as to what film that would be).Gene Hackman, fresh from winning both stardom and an Oscar for The French Connection, may have seen this turkey for what it was  a means of solidifying his box-office clout with what looked to be a major commercial hit.  Today, I can't help but think he is embarrassed by the melodramatic proceedings and the atrocious dialogue.  Except for Carol Lynley, who, as the sexy blonde singer is both sexy and blonde though not a singer (she lip-synchs the Oscar winning song, The Morning After), Hackman provides the main reason for watching the Ronald Neame directed film.  As the maverick reverend who leads the survivors through the Poseidon's maze of corridors and plumbing as they make their way to the ship's bottom (which is now on top), he is so full of energy that it's surprising that any old tidal wave would have the nerve to topple a ship upon which he is travelling. Hackman may be our greatest film actor, but even he can't carry off some of the dialogue he spits out.  How many lives? he shouts, presumably addressing either God or the ship itself.  How many lives must be sacrificed?  Hackman could have substituted lives with talent, and directed the question to the producers who are so willing to misuse the abilities of Hollywood's finest for such drivel.Shelley Winters, an Oscar nominee for her role, gives her all, as do Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Red Buttons, Jack Albertson, and Pamela Sue Martin.

Most of Allen's later films bombed so badly that his 1980 effort, The Day the World Ended, was re-titled When Time Ran Out in the hope of deemphasizing its connection to the genre, but even that didn't help.

All in all, highly recommended. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"9 April 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I really liked this movie.
