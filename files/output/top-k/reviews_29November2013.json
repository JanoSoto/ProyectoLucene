Right in the middle of the film, I had to pee. I wasn't going anywhere. New York, Psychiatrist, Willis (he has acted better) who drove a patient (the great Kathleen Wilhotte) to jump out a window, has to get his mind back, where guilt has surged through him. He takes a vacation, flying to dunny L.A, to stay at an old colleague's (underused actor Bakula) place. He's also a psychiatrist, a more successful one thanks to a non fictional book he sold. He's pad is great. He also a short future, as someone does him, where Willis, hit with a double whammy you could say, takes over the group, while being a prime suspect. I loved Ruben Blades in this, as the cop, one of the better, if probably the best performances, that alongside Henricksen who plays one of the patients, who's carrying a lot of baggage. Now lets talk about the cooky, larger than life patients. No, lets not. Their just entertaining to watch. This movie really makes the patient group scenes fun, one of the best things I like about this movie. Willis also strikes up a hot relationship, with the so judged misjudged actress, March. You'll see why in it's shock revelation at the end, after all the nail gun shooting (Owlll, I felt that) and before the end credits come running too fast up the screen. Off the beaten track, like in other movies, with the credits running some fast, I don't know why they even bother. Back to the movie. Color Of Night, is a fun treat yourself psychological thriller, (you'll never guess the killer, unless your IQ is bloody high) which I never at anytime, got bored with. It's entertaining all the way through, my favourite BW film. The sex scenes are great, amidst some car chases, one I absolutely loved, the over the top violence, highly approving, plus the great co actors who give their patient's characters, spark, no more, than great character actor, Brad Douriff. These are the real actors, but for god sake, don't look overlook March, in both her acting and her beauty.

Surely, a trained and experienced actor would do a better job. So I haven't bothered with 'Dancer in the Dark' until now. What an idiot I was.Bjorks acting did seem a bit amateurish for the initial twenty minutes or so, but I urge you to bear with this. This may have been a directorial device to hook you into the simplicity of her character because as the plot develops she renders a character as strong as any. If you are not totally with Selma as the film build to its climax the you must be an unempathic & heartless person not to be touched by Bjorks powerful rendition of this character. A proper actor could have done as well but not by much. However, a proper actor however could not have done the songs, yep, you read right - this musical hater is about to praise the song & dance routines.For the first two songs I was thinking 'Oh no, get on with it' while waiting painfully for them to end. But during the third something had changed, I began to realise these song & dance routines weren't a break in the plot sequence but were a significant part of it. They were Selmas trips into 'Wonderland', how she managed to cope with a very tough life. I might say that Bjorks songs were more in the line of being arias than musical numbers except this is no opera. The 'musical numbers' definitely added to the films impact.Also, von Trier seems to have a penchant to throw shock 'gimmick's in his films, such as the hard core scene in 'The Idiots or the emasculation in 'Antichrist'. Thankfully, in this film he just lets the script, direction & Bjorks rendering of the lead character do all the work. The result of these three factors working together left me totally knocked out. After the last scene there was absolutely nothing I could do except sit through the credits in a state of gobsmacked-ness while Bjork sang me back to the real world.Other actors also put in very creditable performances. Catherine Deneuve did well and Siobhan Fallon came through very strongly while highlighting Bjorks character.So now I realise - my bigotry has had me missing what is possibly von Triers greatest film.

Well in Woody Allen's case, love can be described as many-handled theme.Indeed, whether portrayed as an inexhaustible source of intellectual torments, an unreachable holy grail or an emotional dead-end, love has always been in the core of Woody Allen's oeuvre. Even in his zaniest days, Allen featured romantic walks in a bucolic site or deep interactions in a well-chosen spot of New York or any place of the world. The seminal Take the Money and Run, had a very touching romantic subplot leading to much more magnitude in Manhattan and Hannah of Her Sisters before being treated in a skeptical and disillusioned way in Husbands and Wives from the light of Allen's separation with Mia Farrow.This brief preamble is to show that almost every facet of love has been depicted by Woody Allen. So, with such a title as Everyone Says I Love You, his twenty-something film, I didn't know how high to put my expectations. I guess Roger Ebert's enthusiastic endorsement made me expect fireworks of emotions, something on the same arousing level as Manhattan's opening sequence &#x85;. But what I got was a firecracker. The film is cute, charming, with sweet interactions between enamored characters, but nothing affected me like all the films I mentioned. Even the parts set in Venice and Paris, instead of enhancing the romance, irritated me with their superficial postcard quality.I understand that superficiality was intended to embody the lightheartedness and spontaneity of these characters struck by Cupid's arrow. I understand Allen didn't plan to preach or speak philosophical statements about love, but just let the hearts express through spontaneous outbursts of singing and dancing. But this is where we come to the main flaw, which alas is the reason-to-be of the film the music. I enjoyed the hospital sequence, the part where a bunch of ghosts from beyond the grave give the living some precious advice, and the surrealistic climax in Paris where Goldie Hawn, in a superbly executed sequence started floating in the air. But the rest of the music didn't touch me, and my heart is not made of stone.I've got to hand it though to Woody for the risk he took by letting the actors perform with their own voice, it startles in the beginning but we quickly get used to it. When the film opened with young Holden (Edward Norton) sining his love to Skylar, an upper-class girl of Manhattan (Drew Barrymore), I respected Allen's audacity for materializing this idea that we all sing when we're happy and how we sing hardly matters. But how greater would the surprise have been if the songs were really catchy and didn't seem randomly perturb the narrative structure. Maybe there weren't many musicals at that time so the film had a fresh quality but the soundtrack was not the highlight, which is saying a lot for a musical.A good point was the titular Everyone, which relied on a great ensemble. There is Goldie Hawn as Steffi, the guilty-ridden rich mother and Alan Alda as Bob, her husband, both the best friends of the neurotic Joe, Steffi-ex-husband, contemplating suicide after many failed romances and played by you-know-who. There is also a scene-stealing performance from Natasha Lyonne, as Steffi and Joe's daughter DJ, trying to get her father in touch with Von, Julia Roberts, a therapist whom she happens to know all her secrets and fantasies. There were also fine performances from Lukas Haas as the Republican son (the reasons of his political orientation was the kind of comedy gold the film needed in more quantity) and last, but not least, Tim Roth made a believable released prison mate falling in love with Skylar and causing her to breakup.The film had the same potential than Hannah and Her Sisters, but I was disappointed by the easy ways Allen chose to close his characters' arcs. The kind of emotionality provided by Dianne Weist' last line from Hannah was totally missing, which can be forgivable since it's a comedy, but the wit was frustratingly inexistent and only confined to some predictable gags such as a wedding ring, hidden in a cake and getting swallowed by the future bride. This also would have been forgettable if it wasn't for the central romance between Woody Allen and Julia Roberts. We know it's doomed from the beginning, because of the whole plotting, they had to break up so Joe would finally realize he's still in love with Steffi and can enjoy such good moments like a Groucho Marx party in Paris, one of these things that makes life worth living. But his separation was nowhere close to the level of poignancy or comedy reached by Manhattan.Just like Skylar who breaks up with Holden to eventually reconcile, Joe cheats with Von, she goes with him, until realizing that having fulfilled her fantasy of living with the perfect man, she's got nothing much to fantasize about, it was cynically anticlimactic, and convincing, but for a film that pretends to be a comedy, I expected more, at least, enough to give Julia Roberts a shining moment and not reduce her to the beautiful actress who stars in a Woody Allen film. That also was announcing another Allenian trend when he became Europe's darling, each film raising the big question about his casting. Allen has always been one of my favorite directors, but when he became a 'hip' phenomenon, something of his touch was kind of lost.Now, after watching his interview he gave to a French magazine in the DVD features, I started to look at his film with more indulgence, respecting his desire to make a personal tribute to old-fashioned musicals. But as much as I wanted to love Everyone Says I Love You, it was nowhere close to Allen's top 10 best films, not even to his next film, Deconstructing Harry, which I thought was perfect.

But his separation was nowhere close to the level of poignancy or comedy reached by Manhattan.Just like Skylar who breaks up with Holden to eventually reconcile, Joe cheats with Von, she goes with him, until realizing that having fulfilled her fantasy of living with the perfect man, she's got nothing much to fantasize about, it was cynically anticlimactic, and convincing, but for a film that pretends to be a comedy, I expected more, at least, enough to give Julia Roberts a shining moment and not reduce her to the beautiful actress who stars in a Woody Allen film. That also was announcing another Allenian trend when he became Europe's darling, each film raising the big question about his casting. Allen has always been one of my favorite directors, but when he became a 'hip' phenomenon, something of his touch was kind of lost.Now, after watching his interview he gave to a French magazine in the DVD features, I started to look at his film with more indulgence, respecting his desire to make a personal tribute to old-fashioned musicals. But as much as I wanted to love Everyone Says I Love You, it was nowhere close to Allen's top 10 best films, not even to his next film, Deconstructing Harry, which I thought was perfect.

(When the film was made in 1996, that conflict was simply known as the Gulf War as the Second did not occur until 2003). Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling, a US Army officer, is assigned to determine whether Captain Karen Walden should posthumously receive the Medal of Honor, making her the first woman to be given this award for valour in combat. Walden, the commander of a Medevac helicopter, was killed while attempting to rescue the crew of another helicopter that had been shot down.Serling goes about his task of interviewing the survivors of this incident, and at first everything seems to be straightforward, with the witnesses praising Walden's courage and coolness, but he begins to notice inconsistencies between their testimonies. Everything becomes much more complex when another survivor, Sergeant Monfriez, tells him in no uncertain terms that Walden was a coward and blatantly contradicts what the other witnesses have said. Serling then has to decide where the truth lies. A complicating factor is that he himself has been burdened by guilt ever since he was involved in a friendly fire incident during the war in which a friend was killed.The film was directed by Edward Zwick who was also responsible for Glory, one of the few great war films of the eighties. Courage under Fire represents an interesting development of the war film in the nineties. Although there are exceptions (such as Catch-22), most of the very large number of American films about World War II take an unashamedly heroic, patriotic view of that particular conflict. Most of the much smaller number of films about Vietnam take an equally unashamedly pacifist, anti-war position, The Green Berets being about the only exception. (Films about Korea tend to fall into both camps. Some, especially those made during or shortly after the war like The Hunters, take the standard patriotic line. Others take an anti-war stance, notably M*A*S*H*, which was made during the Vietnam War and has been seen as a disguised film about Vietnam). Courage under Fire, by contrast, belongs to that small group of films (The Red Badge of Courage about the American Civil War is another good example) which seek to illuminate the soldier's life in wartime without pushing either a strongly patriotic or strongly pacifist message. It also can be seen as belonging to another class of films, those which (like Kurosawa's Rashomon) attempt to tell a story from several viewpoints and show how the same events can be seen in very different ways by different people. The confusion of war, in which no person has access to more than a small part of the total picture, makes this method of storytelling seem particularly appropriate to a war film. It was this very confusion which led to Serling giving the order to fire on one of his own tanks in the heat of battle and which leads to some of the inconsistencies in the evidence about how Captain Walden was killed, although it must be said that some of the witnesses are deliberately lying to cover up their own less than honourable behaviour. When the truth finally emerges it becomes clear that Walden was far from being a coward, but also that not all the witnesses who praised her were giving a truthful account of events. Meg Ryan, Hollywood's official Girl Next Door of the nineties, might have seemed a strange choice to play a tough Army captain, but this was the film which finally showed there was more to Meg's acting talents than the ability to look pretty in romantic comedies. She had tried to show another side to herself in the neo-noir Flesh and Bone and the more serious romantic drama When a Man Loves a Woman, but neither is among her better films. Here, however, she gives a pitch-perfect performance, making Walden tough and determined, but never so much that she becomes unsympathetic. Denzel Washington is also very good as Serling, a very important role as the film is not just about Walden but also about the story of how Serling learns to forgive himself for his friend's death. Of the supporting cast, the best is Lou Diamond Phillips as Monfriez.Unlike the standard World War II film, Courage under Fire is not a gung-ho patriotic adventure story; it remains neutral about the rightness or wrongness of the First Gulf War. Unlike the standard Vietnam movie, however, it is not an anti-war diatribe either.

Dr No became the first film in the series, with Thunderball eventually being made as the fourth three years later. (This dispute was also the reason why Ian Fleming's novel was later filmed again as Never Say Never Again). The plot is a relatively simple one. The international terrorist organisation SPECTRE have stolen two atomic bombs from a British Vulcan bomber and are using them to hold the world to ransom, demanding £100 million as their price for not destroying a major city. Bond's task is to find and recover the bombs before SPECTRE can detonate them, a search which takes him to the Bahamas. Although the film involves SPECTRE, the main villain is not that organisation's leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld who was to feature in the next three Bond movies (in each case played by a different actor) but his Number Two Emilio Largo. Bond's main ally, apart from his American counterpart Felix Leiter, is Largo's mistress Dominique Derval, known as Domino. Domino's motive for changing sides (apart, of course, from Bond's irresistible charm) is her discovery that her lover was responsible for the death of her brother François, a French Air Force officer, who was murdered as part of the plot to steal the bombs. Bond's ability to turn the villain's female accomplices is a common plot point in the series; he had already made use of it in the previous film, Goldfinger (although there the relationship between Goldfinger and Pussy Galore was always about business rather than sex). Thunderball, however, also contains one of Bond's rare failures in this department when he tries, and fails, to convert Fiona Volpe, another glamorous Largo sidekick. In terms of Bond villains, the one-eyed Largo as played by Adolfo Celi falls somewhere between Gert Frobe's Goldfinger and Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence and Charles Gray. (Telly Savalas's interpretation was rather different). Largo lacks Goldfinger's crude thuggishness, looking quite at home wearing his tuxedo in a casino. (Goldfinger shares Largo's love of card-games, but in such a setting would stand out like a sore thumb). On the other hand he also lacks the suavity and surface polish of Blofeld, and his attempts to hide his menace beneath a veneer of icy politeness are never quite as successful. Celi spoke English with a strong Italian accent, so his lines were dubbed by an English actor. The same was done for the former Miss France Claudine Auger who plays Dominique, but this does not prevent them from making their own memorable contributions to the series. Claudine was possibly the loveliest Bond Girl of the sixties. (That's as in even lovelier than Ursula Andress).

Martine Beswick, who had previously appeared in From Russia with Love, reappears here in a minor role, making her the first Bond Girl to appear in two films in different roles. (Maud Adams was later to repeat this feat in The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy). Despite a strong villain and a beautiful leading lady, Thunderball has never really been my favourite Bond; I would not rate it as highly as its immediate predecessor Goldfinger, or as its immediate successor You Only Live Twice, or as Dr No. Part of the reason is that Sean Connery is not really on top form here; possibly disillusionment with the role, which was to lead to him quitting it (at least temporarily) after You Only Live Twice, was already starting to set in. (Oddly enough, Connery was actually better in the later film). A more important reason, however, is that the action tends to drag at times. Despite the simplicity of the plot, the film has a longer running time than any of its three predecessors. Too much time is taken up with those interminable underwater scenes, which do not make for exciting action. The final underwater showdown between the force of SPECTRE and the good guys, all trying to shoot one another with spear guns, is among the oddest finales of any Bond film, more like a ballet than a battle.

Too much time is taken up with those interminable underwater scenes, which do not make for exciting action. The final underwater showdown between the force of SPECTRE and the good guys, all trying to shoot one another with spear guns, is among the oddest finales of any Bond film, more like a ballet than a battle. Thunderball is not a bad film, but it's not first-rate Bond. 7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"29 November 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" San Francisco police detective Scottie Ferguson retires after suffering vertigo during a roof top chase.

Character depth is not a big thing, although the characters are quite likable and full of personality whether serious or humorous. The plot involves a ship called Event Horizon that lost all communication after orbiting past Neptune to have the ship reappear several years later. The crew, unknowing of the ship's past or the mission they are about to participate in, mus investigate the ship for survivors only to find a dark secret about the ship which takes the crew's lives one by one.

And it's really sad how far down movies have gone in the last sixty years. Watch TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH and compare it to modern movies like the HUNGER GAMES franchise. It's shot in black and white, with minimal special effects. (Indeed the combat footage is actual combat footage.) No poisonous fog or CGI baboons all hopped up on goofballs.This movie starts as a bomber group comes back from a run. They show no blood and guts, but the talk will literally make you sick to your stomach. It's that real, that wrenching. Instead of pretty tributes having their faces in the sky they talk about arms and legs being blown off in combat. And your imagination does the rest, if you're old enough to actually form mental pictures based on the tough, honest dialog.So then, the leader of the group begins to crack up. And it's not funny, it's not some weepy teen tantrum either. It's a grown man admitting that he can't cut it anymore. And then Gregory Peck comes in, determined to get the job done no matter what the cost in human lives. Imagine, a fully grown adult male in a leadership position! This movie is about war, and moral choices. But it's also about the nature of fatherhood. Gregory Peck seems to have specialized in exploring this theme, in films as strikingly different as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, and even THE OMEN. In all three films he is the father who has to make the tough choices, torn between protecting his children and forcing them to take on adult responsibilities. 12 O'CLOCK HIGH demonstrates the meaning of tough love long before the phrase became cheapened by popular media. Yet 12 O'CLOCK HIGH shows the price of tough love, just as THE OMEN shows what happens when tough love becomes too tough and becomes crazed brutality. (In a sense Damien was a deadbeat just like the boys in the Leper Colony in this film. Sometimes the bad seed cannot be redeemed.)This movie doesn't glorify war, but it does suggest that without role models, such as father figures who demand respect and insist on discipline, children are likely to remain children forever. It's no accident that in a movie like THE HUNGER GAMES or CATCHING FIRE, the adult authority figures are either villains or clowns. Whether it's the drunken Haymitch or the sinister President Snow or the campy Effie Trinket, only caricatures of adults are permitted in modern films. TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is the kind of movie they just don't make anymore.
