Sellers does a good job, but I still enjoy his Pink Panther role, as well as his roles in Dr. Sstrangelove.  Nevertheless, he does well as an Italian crook and flamboyant film director.The comedy isn't too slapstick, it is smart.  There are sight gags, there are setups and punchlines, there are one-liners, not to mention spoofed-themes, and pokes at other Italian film directors\/producers.I didn't exactly know what I would get with a De Sica comedy.  He did a fine job, though. Federico Fabrizi sometimes looks and seems to be just like Federico Fellini.  There are some moments where Fellini's 8 1\/2 comes to mind.A critic said that he didn't understand the ending.  At first, I didn't. Think, though!  Think!

The problem is the movie is mismarketed as a comedy. Humor in the movie is quite present though dark and dry (though still very funny). This movie is actually quite a bit better than spinal tap. It's not mocking a bad band of a genre, but exploring the problems of the scene by looking at what's viewed to be a good one. The only similarity between this film and spinal tap is the narrative framework, which is that of a documentary, though in this film, that device becomes less obtrusive, and in all honesty could have been removed. Also, this movie has much more of a human heart than a film like spinal tap or fear of a black hat (another movie that got lumped into the mockumentary genre). The big problem I think is that this movie is represented as a comedy, and it's as dramatic as it is humorous. Terrific ending too. Recommended to those who enjoy dark comedies and punk rock.

But it is enjoyable and fun. Though it is a bid dumb and as I have heard it is a bit different from the book. Oz was never a dream it was real but in this film it is supposed to be a dream. The actors were all good. I wonder why there wasn´t any of them who made it really big except of course for Judy.  Judy was also good. Some people are complaining that she was perhaps to old for the role. Judy was sixteen playing a ten year old. But this is sort of like a theatre. I remember watching a stage-production of Wizard Of Oz and there was a thirty year old playing Dorothy. MGM wanted Shirley Temple to be Dorothy but she was still with 20th century fox and they wouldn´t let her go. Thank God for that. Imagine Shirley Temple sing Over The Rainbow. I don´t think so. Anyway a good film I give it 7.

It is excellent, not only because it's plot is so unique but because it takes human emotions to a deeper level.  I personally enjoy the whole 'life's meaning' theme and the actual thought of having death take a vacation from it's dreaded routine to finding romance in an unexpected twist of fate. Both Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins's performance are brilliant, as they both go hand in hand in a secret of their own to their up-coming journey to that Next Place. When I watch this movie I seem to be confronted with a bundle of questions that unravel themselves as the movie continues-where do we go after we pass away?  what is the meaning of life? why are we here?  And I personally enjoy the dialogue between Joe and the Jamaican lady in the hospital as she explains child-like Joe that life is not all fun and games, and that he should take those colorful pictures that he was able to take through out his journey, before he takes unpleasant ones.  I fully recommend this film, and hope that you might find it as unique and touching as I did.

So much so that I had to pause the movie (i'm watching it for the second time in a row right now) to comment on it.i loved the book Jane Eyre.  it truly is a masterpiece, but everyone knows that.  It's really very hard to improve on great books like that, and so I think that movies shouldn't try.  Luckily, this movie didn't change much, but some things were changed alittle.  Joan Plowright,  who played Mrs. fairfax, did an excellent job, as did fiona shaw at mrs. reed.  But I must say I simply loved Charlotte Gainsbourg as jane Eyre.  I thought she was absolutely perfect, and much better than the woman who played opposite orson wells in an earlier verison (see?  she was so boring I can't even remember her name!)  Charlotte Gainsbourg was great.  I also thought William Hurt did a wonderful job also, even though the whole time we were watching my mother was saying that no one can beat orson wells.  well, that may be true, mom, but I'm thinking that every man that plays Mr. Rochester interprets his own character, and orson wells seemed to be much too full of himself when he was playing the part.  William Hurt did very well, and I would have fallen in love with him myself.All in all this is a great movie.  I would like to take the great cinematography and amazing actors, particularly the stars, and put it in a different version, one with a better screenplay.  yet, as far as jane Eyre goes, this is truly a great film, true to the book, and amazing cast.
