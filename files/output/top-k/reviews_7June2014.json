[{"date":"7 June 2014","score":"","review":" On Golden Pond works through the same themes that occupied many big-time play adaptations between the 1950s and the 1980s. Like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and The Lion in Winter (1968) it is about inter- generational family dysfunction, and it seems to want to embarrass or shock the audience through a frankness of discourse. It is the kind of script that purports to peel away the supposedly-artificial niceties of middle-class life to get to the meat of matters, which in the minds of these kinds of playwrights always seems to mean sex and death. Tennessee Williams and James Goldman made that format dance, and watching the great Hollywood versions of their works is thrilling because of the way they constantly try to set new records for speed and intensity and brutal honesty. On Golden Pond imitates these classics but with a lower degree of commitment. It's slower and gentler, and it never seems to let a barb stand unaccompanied by a sappy line or a nostalgic musical cue. It's a movie that's easy to like, because it's a suger-coated pill. As Williams and Goldman knew, there's nothing challenging about a sugar-coated pill. To them, the purpose of writing characters who speak in a forthright way about difficult issues was to make us face our fears and anxieties, and their genius was to do this while also being entertaining. On Golden Pond wants to do these things, but it wants to go down easy. That impulse is not altogether a bad one; compare it with another play adaptation, 1966's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which aims to scream the loudest and cut the deepest only to end up as thoroughly unlikable as its characters. Toward the beginning, On Golden Pond echoes Virginia Woolf as Henry Fonda's irascible old poop tries to discomfit a polite younger man with blunt sexual talk. By the middle of the movie, though, this riff on Edward Albee's hard-edged approach gives way to a much sweeter narrative about an unlikely friendship between Fonda's 80-year-old and a 13-year-old boy. It's nice, but it's predictable and safe and familiar and forgettable whereas its predecessors succeeded by being none of those things. Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda are believable, though, and Jane Fonda threatens to upstage both of them as their adult daughter whose eyes betray an inner mixture of depression and resentment and a certain flightiness born of self-doubt. If nothing else, what On Golden Pond shares in full measure with its more ambitious and significant forerunners is magnificent acting by a top-shelf cast.

I had intended to watch it for a while, but kept making excuses. My reasoning for this was that the description of this film and it's somewhat simple plot line put me off, even though the film did have the likes of Robin Williams and Matt Damon in it. Yes, the film follows a simple plot line and proceeds exactly how you'd expect it to, but there's a beauty to it; a simple beauty. It tackles psychology and the nature and feelings of the youth. And it does it perfectly.The writing of 'Good Will Hunting' was nigh perfect. I wasn't expecting something so thought provoking and intelligent from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's first screenplay. Again, it's simply done but has a unique beauty behind it. You can connect with the title character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), and understand how he's feeling throughout it from his discussions with his psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Damon and Affleck outdid themselves here.Gus Van Sant directs the masterpiece. This is the first of his works I have came across. The directing fits the film perfectly. It's nothing big or exciting, just simple. Without the directing, the film simply would not feel the way it does. It adds to calm, slow nature of 'Good Will Hunting' and everything feels at perfect pace with the writing. The emotion is hit spot on as well, with obvious help from the actors.I'd be lying if I said that I even noticed the music used in the film, which is a shame because I love Danny Elfman's other works. Everything was so focused on the raw emotion and I was so taken in by the characters. I cannot comment on the composition, but I will be able to eventually because I will definitely be watching this film again in the future. It's certainly a new one of my favourites.The acting is astoundingly good. I had never seen Robin Williams out of his usual romantic comedy role before now, so this was a surprising and refreshing change. He plays the role of the aged psychiatrist perfectly. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver created amazing chemistry as their respective characters and Damon shines in his role throughout, getting every scene spot on. Stellan Skarsgård and Ben Affleck got their roles spot on as well, as the rather egotistic professor who cares for his students and the loyal and loving best friend respectively.Overall this was a simple masterpiece, which I did not expect in the slightest. It wasn't cliché, as it was entirely unique in its own way, but it also had the simple plot line that you'd expect. 'Good Will Hunting' is a film I will certainly be watching again for its delightful and simple nature. If you haven't already seen this genius piece of work, I suggest that you make some time for it as soon as you can.

If one can overlook un-overlook-able eroticses in the film, one will definitely move along with it in its depiction of madness, lust of power and sex, and what not. Can't say again if incidents are real then how much honestly they are filmed but sure thing that such events are reality of human history not too old at various developing places.I wish this movie can tell about or show us about the extreme or limit of money, power, sex in human life. Some idea can sure be taken in as to what happen now when i have everything.

What do three young girls do for fun on a Friday night in 1965? Make prank phone calls, of course! But Libby and Kit's idea of innocent fun turns dangerous when they ring a psychopath who has just murdered his wife.I admittedly am not a fan of William Castle's earliest work (as much as I don't want to say it, I find his earlier ghost films House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts remarkably dull), but here Castle seems to have struck my fancy. I Saw What You Did is a straightforward suspense film that relies on crafty writing in order to really hold our attention, but the script pulls it off. The causal reactions that put Libby and Kit into such grave danger are extremely clever, and that is perhaps the film's greatest strength&#x97; the writing is inventive and smart. In terms of action, there is not a lot that happens over the course of the film, but it still manages to engage all the same, and running at 82 minutes, it packs its punch well.The film's black-and-white photography is gorgeous and drenches everything atmosphere, and its famous uxoricide scene cribs Hitchcock's Psycho but is arguably more brutal; it marks a pivotal point in the film as well that will have the audience shifting in their seat&#x97; even the film's hokey score is discredited by that scene alone. As lightweight as the film feels for much of its duration, the first murder is there to remind us that it's really not.The two leading young girls are remarkably likable in their roles, and Joan Crawford infamously pulls off the role of the psychopath's sultry mistress next-door. While Crawford is often credited for hamming things up in her later career, I found her performance here to be actually quite incredible and terrifying; her interrogation of Libby when the girls arrive at the madman's house was absolutely hair-raising&#x97; in fact, I'd go so far as to say she's scarier in that moment than John Ireland is throughout the entire film.Overall, I Saw What You Did is noteworthy as a thriller, but also as a cultural relic of a bygone era of rotary dials, and a world where prank calls could lead to murderous madmen peeking in your windows. It's a clever and suspenseful film that is tame by today's standards, but the maliciousness of its first murder scene does keep it floating above total kitsch. It's fun, short, and sweet, and Joan Crawford somehow manages to be at her scariest in a role that could have easily been very boring in the hands of another actress. It's a shame that it hasn't been re-released on DVD or Blu-ray for new generations to have availability to; the original Anchor Bay disc went out of print years ago and is inexplicably among the rarest horror DVDs out there. 9\/10.

Neither is the case here, thus the answer could only be that it is Academy's honeymoon period with Wiest, who has just won an Oscar 3 years earlier for Woody Allen's HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986, 8\/10) and would harvest her second trophy pretty soon in another Allen's satire BULLETS OVER Broadway (1994, 8\/10).However, skimming through the credits, it is a quite impressive ensemble here, besides Wiest, there are Oscar winners Steenburgen and Robards, the flash-in-the-pan Oscar nominee Tom Hulce with future leading man Keanu Reeves and Joaquin Phoenix, the burn-too-soon starlet Martha Plimpton, and it is directed by Ron Howard to boot, chances are the film might be more than a crowd-pleasing family fare, and again, I am so wrong!It is a big family, its patriarch Frank (Robards) has four children, the eldest Helen (Wiest), a divorcée with two children, the adolescent Julie (Plimpton) and the introvert teenager Garry (Phoenix); Gil (Martin) is the second, he and his wife Karen (Steenburgen) have 3 children, among whom Kevin (Fisher) is a school-kid has some mood issues and needs special treatment; Susan (Kozak) is the youngest daughter, married to Nathan (Moranis), they have one girl Patty (Schwan), who is under Nathan's unconventional upbringing method and on her fast lane to become a child prodigy; the most problematic one is the youngest son Larry (Hulce), a black sheep in the family, a ne'er-do-well addicts to gambling. Spoiler alert, this is not the end, the family is keeping expanding as if it is a blatant advertisement of unprotected sex. Not exactly an out-and-out comedy, the film sums up a menagerie of headaches of being a parent, all are laboriously entwined in a cumbersome plot, and even though, in the end, everyone is still fearlessly riding on the way to make babies, yeah, being a parent is sometimes irritating, but you know what, no one can escape that, 3 is never enough, 4 might be better, even though he or she may end up being a jerk like Larry. It might be edifying 25 years ago (low birth rate in the state I assume), but now, it seems shamelessly narrow-minded and self- pleasingly irresponsible, we don't buy that now, not everyone suits to be a parent, it is a demanding job and should need a certificate, paraphrasing the dimwitted Tod (Reeves) who expresses the most incisive remark which should be legitimized so that there will be far less lousy parents in the world. On a whole, the film doesn't age well, its content feels uneasily predictable, most of time it persists in stating the obvious and plugging a unified American lifestyle, the cast is inequitable, Martin, Steenburgen, Wiest and Robards all have their moments from time to time, but Hulce and Moranis are tainted by the crappy script. Even grandma's sensible credo (roller coaster Vs. merry-go-around) sounds jarringly self-important near the end, anyway, not my cup-of-tea, period.

The film's images look great and the story is well-paced. The design of the run down western town is perfect for the story.While the story, acting and setting are highly engaging and entertaining, the film's themes and sub-text slyly and mercilessly tear apart American stereotypes. While U Turn is not Blazing Saddles, it still delivers serious blows to goody-goody images and myths about America using the neo-noir genre as a delivery system. There isn't one character in the movie, not one, who isn't up to no good or who hasn't some serious flaws or failings that turn American myths upside down. The movie delivers tremendous sarcasm and irony at every turn.Chasing money, the importance of money, and the links between money and the American Dream are shown in all their hollowness. In this movie, sex is everywhere a basis for twisting people out of shape and for using people. American manlihood is shown to be a fake front, as in the blustering character played by Joaquin Phoenix. The female sex has no scruples, men are victims of females and their own sex drives, and gentlemanly behavior toward females is wasted effort. No one delivers a genuine service with a smile, neither a waitress not a mechanic. We see the opposite as in the case of Billy Bob Thornton's exploitative mechanic role. The local beggar (Jon Voight) tells lies, playing upon sympathy to veterans and Indians. Sean Penn's dream becomes simply to escape from this town and its nightmare, but he and Jennifer Lopez have dreams of California, Hawaii, and flying. In this movie, dreams fall apart on something as simple as a radiator hose that fails. American violence crops up all over the place. A convenience store is a site for armed robbery and two killings. Nick Nolte is a real estate agent who is halfway insane and hates loving Jennifer Lopez, who is cheating with Powers Boothe, the sheriff. At one point, his arrest of a Russian thug satirizes American police power. Penn, a small time opportunist, epitomizes American rootlessness. He is by no means trustworthy, but pitted against the perverse denizens of Superior (ironically named and looking the very opposite), he actually looks good and gains our sympathy. Jennifer Lopez is well cast as the woman who cannot be trusted ever to give her love and herself fully to any man. She's the unattainable.

It boasts a very good screenplay and subtle script. The direction by Oliver Stone doesn't miss a beat. He got great performances out of an excellent cast. The film's images look great and the story is well-paced. The design of the run down western town is perfect for the story.While the story, acting and setting are highly engaging and entertaining, the film's themes and sub-text slyly and mercilessly tear apart American stereotypes. While U Turn is not Blazing Saddles, it still delivers serious blows to goody-goody images and myths about America using the neo-noir genre as a delivery system. There isn't one character in the movie, not one, who isn't up to no good or who hasn't some serious flaws or failings that turn American myths upside down. The movie delivers tremendous sarcasm and irony at every turn.Chasing money, the importance of money, and the links between money and the American Dream are shown in all their hollowness. In this movie, sex is everywhere a basis for twisting people out of shape and for using people. American manlihood is shown to be a fake front, as in the blustering character played by Joaquin Phoenix. The female sex has no scruples, men are victims of females and their own sex drives, and gentlemanly behavior toward females is wasted effort. No one delivers a genuine service with a smile, neither a waitress not a mechanic. We see the opposite as in the case of Billy Bob Thornton's exploitative mechanic role. The local beggar (Jon Voight) tells lies, playing upon sympathy to veterans and Indians. Sean Penn's dream becomes simply to escape from this town and its nightmare, but he and Jennifer Lopez have dreams of California, Hawaii, and flying. In this movie, dreams fall apart on something as simple as a radiator hose that fails. American violence crops up all over the place. A convenience store is a site for armed robbery and two killings. Nick Nolte is a real estate agent who is halfway insane and hates loving Jennifer Lopez, who is cheating with Powers Boothe, the sheriff. At one point, his arrest of a Russian thug satirizes American police power. Penn, a small time opportunist, epitomizes American rootlessness. He is by no means trustworthy, but pitted against the perverse denizens of Superior (ironically named and looking the very opposite), he actually looks good and gains our sympathy. Jennifer Lopez is well cast as the woman who cannot be trusted ever to give her love and herself fully to any man. She's the unattainable. She's the dark skinned beauty of mixed blood that the white men would like to conquer and possess unequivocally but cannot.Sean Penn is taken for quite a ride in this picture. The story is actually about a lot more.

Concern that an out-of-control technocracy, armed with advanced tech tools, threatens our rights to privacy and freedom is misplaced concern.So Where *should* that concern be placed?It should be placed in a broad social regression to bland acceptance of the homogeneity of private media control into fewer hands, with less and less real reportage available to inform us in a way that serves the most important requisite of a sustainable republic; an informed polity.So EotS dangles a hi-tech boogieman red herring, putting people in danger of swallowing that herring whole and going to sleep.What's more dangerous; that a technocratic nomenclatura are going to reach out to intrude into our lives? Or that we're going to turn on our TVs and *invite* system-servile pr1cks into our homes to remind us that our political masters love us?; that Saddam Hussein was a real threat to the U.S.?; that implementation of a national system of health care risk pooling will necessarily drag death panels in its train?; that we must unceasingly feed the beast of overheated economic activity lest that ravenous beast turn on us to sate its bottomless hunger?Which is more dangerous?

Alien received critical acclaim. Critics loved it! And it also received box office success - meaning people loved it, worldwide. I, for one, love the set designs and visual effects, they're incredible. Bolaji Badejo plays the Alien, and he does a great job. Roy Scammell and Eddie Powell also portrayed the Alien in some scenes of the film. One thing that made the film better was it's pace. The build up towards the end was intriguing. This film had a huge impact on me - I grew up with it, alongside Aliens, Predator and Predator 2, and many more Sci- Fi\/Sci-Fi horror films. Alien is special, and it proves that finely. With genius, masterful directing, editing and casting, Alien is the master of all Science-Fiction films; it's ultimately and arguably one of the best films ever made, and was definitely ahead of its time - in one of the more good ways though, of course. I rate Alien a perfect, deserving 10\/10; it's one of my favourite films ever, and nothing changes that. Alien is unique, exquisite and compelling. I dedicate this review to Carlo Rambaldi, Hans Rudolf Ruedi Giger, Derek Vanlint and a few others who had anything to do with this amazing film. ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"}]
