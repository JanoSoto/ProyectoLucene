It's well stored in my memory I know it line by line and scene by scene the thrills, chills, suspense, and fun that happens with an all-star cast it has is unmatched in quality. And the fact that two masters of horror with George A. Romero directing and Stephen King writing the stories this tag team really scored a gem here that will live on as a classic.The film starts off with a nice little prologue actually King's real life son stars as a little boy who is just punished after his dad finds him with a Creepshow comic book, then the film shifts briefly to a colored live action cartoon when the comic book is thrown outside the pages are blown open by wind a cool stormy night and that introduces the viewer back to the stories in real color, yet it was a nice brief glimpse of some cool animation.First up the film starts off nice and neat with Father's Day a well paced and nicely timed story of revenge. It centers around a rich and spoiled family of wealth who have a hidden secret involving it's oldest living member Bedelia Grantham(Viveca Lindfors) who seven years earlier smashed her ungrateful father's head in with an ashtray just because he gave her problems over a father's day cake! Yet as you see in the story the real reason as a family member told was that Bedelia sought revenge after father Nathan had her beau killed. So upon Bedelia's arrival to join the family the unexpected happens at the cemetery visit and soon one by one her father is on his way to getting his father's day cake! Good revenge tale and look for Ed Harris who has a small part in this segment.Second segment is The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verill which stars the horror master novelist himself Stephen King. Here King plays Jordy Verill a lonely hillbilly and country farmer type who one night sees a flashing meteor hit his yard. Qucikly he thinks by examining and exploring this he can earn money by taking his find to a local college, yet after being to curious he finds that this object likes to grow and grow more and more green! Before you know it his whole farm and house is green including himself as he turns to a moss man and human weed! Sad and tragic ending for a lonely and likable guy.Next is my favorite segment Something to Tide You Over because of it's star power and setting at an oceanside beach involving a messy love triangle. Leslie Nielsen here is in an uncommonly cruel role yet it works as Richard Vickers who finds that his wife Becky has been cheating with a younger and more handsome man Harry(Ted Danson before his Cheers fame) so Richard decides to take matters into his own hands and not divorce court! By driving Harry out to the Jersey shore and burying up to his neck in sand, and then free of charge he gets to watch Becky soak in the tide while he must face the roaring tide current himself face first! The segment takes a twist in the end as Richard must face the sand and tide face first after he's visited by two sea monsters with revenge on mind. Well done my favorite.Then the longest and most drawn out segment The Crate had star power too with Hal Holbrook as a college professor who's married to a witch of a wife the cruel and outspoken Wilma(the sexy Adrienne Barbeau) who meets the new zoology professor Stanley(Fritz Weaver). At the dorm a new discovery is made of an old ancient type box that seems odd and mysterious. Yet the suspense turns to gore and blood as an ancient beast like creature comes out with a vengeance. Some funny moments are provided yet the beast attacks are the most bloody and probably make this the most gruesome segment.Last but not least They're Creeping Up On You stars legendary character actor E.G. Marshall. Marshall is Upson Pratt a cold and cruel hearted corporate company man who will do anything to get ahead no matter how many people he stabs in the back. Marshall does this role so well as his character is such a bigot and racist, yet one little problem he's got a bad phobia of germs and his apartment has a big problem of roaches! Remembering this episode from a kid it's comical as this segment had the most cursing and bad language yet it fit E.G.'s character so well. Finally this cold hearted guy meets his end as he's warmed up by an army of roaches! This episode could be the most realistic of the five as this incident could happen to anyone, but probably in a scaled down form.So that's it as you can tell by my in depth comment on each I know this film well and have seen it a lot from childhood to adulthood. One of my favorites that is staying a lasting classic. Creepshow is blended so well with comedy, suspense, revenge, and great acting with super stories it just worked so well when King and Romero teamed up in 1982 the wrap around even ends nicely with the little boy getting his revenge. I wish more movies today were made like this. Creepshow stills holds up today in the modern movie world as a classic.

One of those was the introduction of complex psychological themes and sexual overtones, inaugurating what is now known as psychological horror with movies like 1959's Horrors of the Black Museum and Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece, Psycho, which gave a human face to the monsters of horror movies (as previously most were of supernatural origin). Another of those significant movies that helped to change the genre in the 60s is without a doubt Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, a morbid tale of horror and suspense about voyeurism that follows that very same path of psychological horror and, like Psycho (released three months after Peeping Tom), elevates it to an art-form.Peeping Tom is the story of Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm), a young focus puller in a British film studio who aspires to become a filmmaker himself. A shy and lonely man, Lewis is not very social, and prefers to spend his time with his camera, working as a photographer of pornographic pictures of women. However, this young man has another secret, and that is that he is actually a serial killer who films and murders young women, the same that the police has been looking out for weeks. Things get complicated when he meets Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), a young woman who lives downstairs with her mother (Maxine Audley) in a room they rent to Mark. Soon, her friendship begins to mean a lot to Mark, as she offers him an honest understanding he had never had before. However, the shadow of Mark's traumas and obsessions is always present, and he'll have a hard time facing his demons.Written by former cryptographer Leo Marks (albeit Powell had a hand in the script as well), Peeping Tom is a deep and disturbing journey through the darkest sides of the mind as it's entirely focused on Mark as the main character. Unlike Hitchcock's Psycho (a movie often compared to Peeping Tom), the serial killer is not seen through the eyes of those around him, in this film we are living the story entirely from his perspective, discovering the person behind the psychopath personality as well as the reasons behind such a disturbed mind. In a way, it's a deeper humanization of the serial killer character, although interestingly, it doesn't attempt to glorify him or justify him (like posterior movies of the same type did), as the movie centers on his attempt to stop doing what he knows is wrong and his desire to have a normal life.Using a strikingly beautiful color cinematography (by Otto Heller) and a remarkably skillful use of the first person viewpoint, director Michael Powell conceives Peeping Tom as a bizarre chant to the voyeur we all have inside, and the pleasure we get from watching others. It's not for nothing that our central character is a filmmaker himself, as the concept of filming a person becomes one with the concept of killing one, as like some have done before (Buñuel for example), the camera is taken as an aggressive, almost physically violent entity that invades and steals the life essence of the person filmed. However, it's not only Powell's use of cinematography what shines in Peeping Tom, his overall use of suspense in the creation of his scenes plays a major role in this highly atmospheric movie where one can almost feel the tension that fills Mark's mind at every step.And this takes us to the cast, which under Powell's direction deliver for the most part excellent performances. Karlheinz Böhm is truly the highlight of the film, as his acting as Mark is instrumental for the success of the movie. Making a very real and believable character, Böhm transmits perfectly how insecure and vulnerable his character is deep inside, giving definitely one of the best performances in a horror movie ever done. As Helen, the young girl who befriends Mark, Anna Massey is simply perfect, as she perfectly portrays the naiveté of the character, as well as the innocence that leaves a profound effect on Mark's psyche. As Helen's mother, Maxine Audley is effective and has a couple of excellent scenes, although it must be said that the film ultimately belongs to Böhm and Massey, as its their relationship what becomes the central focus of the story.As one can imagine, this movie is not the typical horror movie, it's complex and dark, but also disturbingly very human; definitely not what people expected from director Michael Powell, whom along Emeric Pressburger made some of the most cherished British film of the 50s. This darkness of the subject that Peeping Tom handled was too much for the audiences used to Powell's previous work, and therefore the movie failed commercially and sent Powell's career to oblivion. However, it must be said that none of the problems Peeping Tom had during its release are due to poor film-making, quite the contrary, as this movie ranks easily amongst the most influential horror films ever done, and its commercial failure can only be blamed to the fact that it was ahead of its time. Despite the harsh bashing it received, Powell considered this movie his masterpiece, and I can only agree with him.One of the most interesting (and disturbing) movies about serial killers, Peeping Tom is easily one of the best too. The comparisons with Psycho are fair, albeit this is certainly a different kind of beast, as it's like a deeper, harsher version of the same subject but with less psychology and a lot more of heart. And it's probably this enormous humanity what makes the film so ultimately disturbing. A really influential classic of horror that should be better known in the future as the masterpiece that it is. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 October 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Without a doubt, 1960 was a year of numerous and important changes in the history of cinema, specially in the horror genre, as with the beginning of the end of the Production Code, new and different ideas began to be explored within the genre's conventions.

However, it's not only Powell's use of cinematography what shines in Peeping Tom, his overall use of suspense in the creation of his scenes plays a major role in this highly atmospheric movie where one can almost feel the tension that fills Mark's mind at every step.And this takes us to the cast, which under Powell's direction deliver for the most part excellent performances. Karlheinz Böhm is truly the highlight of the film, as his acting as Mark is instrumental for the success of the movie. Making a very real and believable character, Böhm transmits perfectly how insecure and vulnerable his character is deep inside, giving definitely one of the best performances in a horror movie ever done. As Helen, the young girl who befriends Mark, Anna Massey is simply perfect, as she perfectly portrays the naiveté of the character, as well as the innocence that leaves a profound effect on Mark's psyche. As Helen's mother, Maxine Audley is effective and has a couple of excellent scenes, although it must be said that the film ultimately belongs to Böhm and Massey, as its their relationship what becomes the central focus of the story.As one can imagine, this movie is not the typical horror movie, it's complex and dark, but also disturbingly very human; definitely not what people expected from director Michael Powell, whom along Emeric Pressburger made some of the most cherished British film of the 50s. This darkness of the subject that Peeping Tom handled was too much for the audiences used to Powell's previous work, and therefore the movie failed commercially and sent Powell's career to oblivion. However, it must be said that none of the problems Peeping Tom had during its release are due to poor film-making, quite the contrary, as this movie ranks easily amongst the most influential horror films ever done, and its commercial failure can only be blamed to the fact that it was ahead of its time. Despite the harsh bashing it received, Powell considered this movie his masterpiece, and I can only agree with him.One of the most interesting (and disturbing) movies about serial killers, Peeping Tom is easily one of the best too. The comparisons with Psycho are fair, albeit this is certainly a different kind of beast, as it's like a deeper, harsher version of the same subject but with less psychology and a lot more of heart. And it's probably this enormous humanity what makes the film so ultimately disturbing. A really influential classic of horror that should be better known in the future as the masterpiece that it is. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"30 October 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Without a doubt, 1960 was a year of numerous and important changes in the history of cinema, specially in the horror genre, as with the beginning of the end of the Production Code, new and different ideas began to be explored within the genre's conventions. One of those was the introduction of complex psychological themes and sexual overtones, inaugurating what is now known as psychological horror with movies like 1959's Horrors of the Black Museum and Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece, Psycho, which gave a human face to the monsters of horror movies (as previously most were of supernatural origin). Another of those significant movies that helped to change the genre in the 60s is without a doubt Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, a morbid tale of horror and suspense about voyeurism that follows that very same path of psychological horror and, like Psycho (released three months after Peeping Tom), elevates it to an art-form.Peeping Tom is the story of Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm), a young focus puller in a British film studio who aspires to become a filmmaker himself. A shy and lonely man, Lewis is not very social, and prefers to spend his time with his camera, working as a photographer of pornographic pictures of women. However, this young man has another secret, and that is that he is actually a serial killer who films and murders young women, the same that the police has been looking out for weeks. Things get complicated when he meets Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), a young woman who lives downstairs with her mother (Maxine Audley) in a room they rent to Mark. Soon, her friendship begins to mean a lot to Mark, as she offers him an honest understanding he had never had before. However, the shadow of Mark's traumas and obsessions is always present, and he'll have a hard time facing his demons.Written by former cryptographer Leo Marks (albeit Powell had a hand in the script as well), Peeping Tom is a deep and disturbing journey through the darkest sides of the mind as it's entirely focused on Mark as the main character. Unlike Hitchcock's Psycho (a movie often compared to Peeping Tom), the serial killer is not seen through the eyes of those around him, in this film we are living the story entirely from his perspective, discovering the person behind the psychopath personality as well as the reasons behind such a disturbed mind. In a way, it's a deeper humanization of the serial killer character, although interestingly, it doesn't attempt to glorify him or justify him (like posterior movies of the same type did), as the movie centers on his attempt to stop doing what he knows is wrong and his desire to have a normal life.Using a strikingly beautiful color cinematography (by Otto Heller) and a remarkably skillful use of the first person viewpoint, director Michael Powell conceives Peeping Tom as a bizarre chant to the voyeur we all have inside, and the pleasure we get from watching others.

For example, after the hero is done getting it on with one of the ladies, she says, wow you really are a hero! I mean c'mon how is that not funny? The hero tries the best he can to act, but you can tell he really has no idea what he's doing. Besides all the things wrong with this, it does have some pretty decent effects especially from 1997. The part where said hero shoots a certain part of his self, when it comes back that is pretty cool, even by today's standards. I would recommend this as maybe a drinking game.

Nothing can come close to the gleaming perfection of the first film but damn it, the sequel works in most places. It's chiefly because the movie is just so damn entertaining! It's still mostly watchable despite its flaws and misjudgments about what the filmmakers may have seen as an apparent mean-spiritedness in a lot of people during the late '80s.True, comedian and star Bill Murray still steals the show whenever he gets the chance and he also gets some of the best lines, and he's just so gosh-darn funny as a leading man. Screenwriter team\/co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are also in top form, and it shows in their wily and hilarious script. Unlike the first picture, though, it seems like they took the family-friendly route and didn't feel like building up to the oh-so-apocalyptic tone of the first film (even though Ghostbusters was still pretty funny aside from the occasional dark tone).And also, director Ivan Reitman knows their material and it looks like the filmmakers made the wise decision of bringing back everybody from the original film, including Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis. It's been five years since the first film (a title card confirms it), and it seems that most of New York City doesn't even remember who the Ghostbusters are and what they did for the city. Everyone in the city is miserable and the opening moments confirm that as well. After being almost bankrupted by countless lawsuits and being unable to practice their trade because of a judicial restraining order, the boys are reduced to moonlighting in other fields, such as catering to the needs of spoiled yuppie children at their birthday parties, a task that neither Ray Stanz (Aykroyd) or Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) take pride in.Egon Spengler (Ramis) is the only one of the original Ghostbusters who seems to have actually moved on with his life. Peter Venkman (Murray) hosts a television show called The World of the Psychic, a show that apparently draws in modest ratings but no respected psychic will appear on his show because they think he's a fraud. Anyway, things get underway when the boys discover that nasty pink slime of supernatural origin is discovered building up underneath the city, something that old friend and Venkman's old flame Dana Barrett (Weaver) realizes first hand when the slime attacks her infant son, and it's an investigation they have to do on the down-low because of their current legal situation.This slime, they learn, feeds off the misery and stress of a downtrodden New York City, and it's only getting stronger as the holidays are approaching. But because no one believes in ghosts anymore, their task is even more difficult. Well, after ghost-busting the two ghouls that crash in on their trial hearing, we have no choice but to be ready to believe them. They're back in business, all right - with cynical Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) answering the phones and Louis Tully (Moranis) on the books - tracing the source of their ghost-busting investigations to a 17th-century Moldavian tyrant named Vigo the Carpathian who wants in on the 20th century, and has possessed museum curator Janosz Poha (a hilarious Peter MacNicol) to go out and kidnap Dana's son so he can have a body so he can live again.One thing Ghostbusters II provides for the viewer is solid entertainment, which is what any good sequel should do. It would be impossible for this movie to any way live up to the original, so you can't blame the filmmakers for at least trying (trying is italicized). It would be pointless to say that the acting is good from our players, but my God, they're good and again in top form. The special effects are still pretty impressive, even from their early ghost-busting capers, to a finale where the boys are actually able to walk down the streets of the city in an animated - yes, animated! - Statue of Liberty (yes, Lady Liberty has sprung to life, and good thing she's on our side!).

In part this is because I have learned that the novel (of the same title) from which it was adapted, was written by a cultured black man (E.R. Braithwaite) who taught similar students in a similar East End London public school. In addition, the story is timeless as educational systems continue to pigeon-hole students at an early age, steering the least promising into dead-end programs where little is done to tap whatever potential they may have for learning. That's basically the film's story as out-of-work engineer Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier) takes what he hopes will be a temporary job at an East End school. His class is the one nobody wants, full of students who have no apparent aptitude or interest in anything academic. They are in their last year (British schools set this type of student loose on the world at age 15 but these students look several years older) and just killing time until they can leave school at the end of the term. These are not the JD's of Blackboard Jungle (a 1955 Poitier film) but a real socio-economic segment of British society.Thackeray quickly sizes up the situation and realizes that he can do nothing to make up for years of low expectations. So he starts teaching them basic manners, survival skills, and how to behave as responsible adults; things that will soon be useful to them. And they quickly recognize this and for the first time become really attentive to a teacher and his lessons. More importantly, he gives them a role model, a poor black man who worked hard, paid his dues, and transformed himself into someone they consider cultured and literate. They have been tagged as losers by the educational system but Thackeray opens their eyes to other possibilities. Of course Lulu sings the excellent title song, which is nicely connected to the actual story, and does a surprisingly good job of acting for the camera. The film's best moment is the field trip to the museum creatively illustrated by a montage of still photos accompanied by a version of the title song. The Mindbenders, a contemporary pop group (Groovy Kind of Love) contribute a couple songs and actually appear briefly at a dance gig. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.Those schoolgirl days, of telling tales and biting nails are gone, But in my mind, I know they will still live on and on, But how do you thank someone, who has taken you from crayons to perfume? It isn't easy, but I'll try,If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters, That would soar a thousand feet high, To Sir, with LoveThe time has come, For closing books and long last looks must end, And as I leave, I know that I am leaving my best friend, A friend who taught me right from wrong, And weak from strong, That's a lot to learn, What, what can I give you in return?If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start, But I, would rather you let me give my heart, To Sir, with Love ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"30 October 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a decent vampire flick that, unlike some of its 80's counterparts (Fright Night, Near Dark, The Lost Boys) has been long forgotten.

Hatcher retires & heads to the town of Lincoln heights in Chicago where he grew up & where is sister Kate (Bette Ford) & his niece Tracey (Danielle Harris) live. Hatcher also meets up with his old friend Max (Keith David), there is a big drug war taking place in Lincoln Heights as Columbian drug lord Tito Barco (Al Isreal) & Jamaican drug lord Screwface (Basil Wallace) fight for control. While in a pub a shoot-out between the Columbians & Jamaicans takes place & Hatcher steps in, he instantly becomes a target of the Jamaican dealers & not only do they make the mistake of shooting Hatcher's favourite bar up but they target his family & shoot his niece which makes Hatcher very, very angry...Originally shot under the title Screwface this early Steven Seagal action flick was directed by Dwight H. Little & comes from a time when Seagal films were actually entertaining. The script by co-producers Michael Grais & Mark Victor certainly won't win any prizes for originality, some ex cop\/secret service agent\/military soldier has to come out of retirement to avenge a family member\/friend\/injustice by killing everyone in sight. It's a fairly standard Hollywood action film plot which doesn't hold many surprises although the twist ending was quite unexpected even if the makers wasted the opportunity to do something truly different in favour of having it as another excuse for Seagal to kill people. The usual inappropriate message that violence needs to be fought with even more violence is present & although you know it's wrong you can't help but enjoy it in a satisfyingly macho sort of way as Seagal, the supposed hero, kills all the bad guy's in a variety of violent ways. The violence is extreme, some of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious like when Hatcher confronts a bad guy he eloquently & poetically notes 'I know your a scumbag & a puke, I don't mind that. You give me what I need & I leave here a nice guy. You don't, I'm gonna f*ck you up' & the cheese factor is entertainingly high. It passes 90 odd minutes with the minimum of pain & overall this is a good fast paced gratuitously violent foul mouthed action flick that even has a bit of Voodoo as well, would we have them any other way? Of course not.Director Little does a good job, some of the fights are very brutal which were a trademark of Seagal's films back in the 90's. There are some seriously painful looking injuries from broken arms, necks & backs, people beaten with mallets, knifes stuck through throats, shootings, table leg beatings, decapitations, eye gouging, hand severing, naked woman shooting, samurai sword fighting to head smashing fun. The fights & action scenes are well choreographed & there's even a decent car chase too which ends as a car crashes into a jewellery store although where the police are at this point I have no idea. Also, how does Seagal manage to smuggle all those weapons & ammunition into Jamaica? The montage showing Seagal making & testing the weapons was before the shot of the air-plane taking off from Chicago & landing in Jamaica so presumably took place in America, right? Security wasn't so tight back then but it wasn't that bad surely? Besides being very violent Marked for Death also has some fairly graphic gore in it including decapitations, an eye gouging & someone having their hand cut off.Technically the film is fine, it isn't going to win any awards for style but it's well made having been shot on location in Chicago & in Jamaica. Marked for Death was Seagal's third film coming after Above the Law (1988) & Hard to Kill (1990) & before his 'masterpiece' Out for Justice (1991), back then he wasn't as fat as these days & he actually looks impressive as he kicks the crap out of everyone in some well stage & excessively violent fights. Unfortuneatly Seagal can't act, either now or back in 1990 when this was made & I still think the pony tail looks gay. The rest of the cast are OK with Wallace as Screwface putting in a surprisingly effective over-the-top performance.Marked for Death is a throughly entertaining overblown unnecessarily violent & foul mouthed action film, the sort of film which Seagal was perfectly suited to star in.

The minstrel guy serves NO plot function whatsoever -- I hate Disney characters like that, even if they're funny!The plot, whatever its faults (including the fact that there's no background or context provided for most of it), was reasonably involving.

The first was a film titled Nattevagten, the brilliant Danish thriller of which Nightwatch is a remake of, and the second is a film called Diabolique; the 1995 remake of classic French thriller Les Diaboliques, which showed that remaking classic foreign films for an American audience is never a good idea. Nightwatch is directed by the same man that brought us Nattevagten three years earlier, Ole Bornedal, but the problem is that he's taken the plot that made his original film so great and changed the tone for an American audience; thus making it not so great. The plot is pretty much the same as it was in the Danish version, and we focus on Martin; a student given the task of watching the morgue at night. This happens around the same time that someone is going round bumping off prostitutes and gouging out their eyes. Naturally, the bodies are delivered to the morgue where Martin works, and it's not long before Martin begins getting involved in the investigation.The opening scene pretty much sums up why this film isn't going to work; while the original focused on the night watchman and the murders were almost a subplot, here we get a graphic murder right from the off. Most of the film is similar to the original, but with this different tone from the outset; it would seem that Bornedal didn't really know what to do, so he just re-directed the key scenes from the Danish version and the result is messy. The original had a lot of scenes that stand out in the memory, and this one features all those scenes; except unlike the original which flowed from one scene to the next, this time the scenes just basically come after one another and I would imagine it could get confusing for anyone who hasn't seen the original - not good considering that most people who see this probably wont have seen the original. The film features a few cult stars such as Brad Dourif, Nick Nolte and John C. Reilly (uncredited, apparently), and the lead is taken by Ewan McGregor; who is OK except for his American accent. Josh Brolin is not sleazy enough for the role he is given. I guess I might have liked this film more if I had not seen the original and thus already knew what was coming at the end; it's still a great finale even if the rest of the film isn't up to much. All in all, I really can't recommend anyone sees this - see the original if you can.

It is set in what might be described as the kitchen sink end of swinging London. The anti-hero, Alfie Elkins, is a young working-class Cockney who works as a mechanic and driver for a car-hire company. In some respects the film looks back to the social-realist school of the late fifties and early sixties. Alfie is in some ways a very traditional character. He lives in the sort of drab, seedy flat familiar from kitchen sink realist films and hangs out in old-fashioned East End pubs rather than discos. He dresses smartly but conservatively, at one stage even sporting an RAF blazer. Not for him the long hair, sideburns, bell-bottom jeans, loud shirt and kipper tie which constituted the uniform of the sixties trend-setter.In one respect, however, he is very different to the traditional social-realist hero. The angry young men from films such as Look Back in Anger, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner and Room at the Top were characterised by anger and resentment against the Establishment. Resentment is an emotion quite alien to the happy-go-lucky Alfie, whose main preoccupation is not settling scores with the system but rather scoring with women. He is a practised seducer, and the film introduces us to a number of his conquests. The nearest thing he has to a steady girlfriend is Gilda, the mother of his young son Malcolm, but even she tires of his infidelity and refusal to commit to her. Eventually she leaves him to marry her long-time admirer, bus conductor Humphrey. Humphrey is everything Alfie is not; he is far from handsome, but is caring, faithful and deeply in love with Gilda. Alfie suffers a setback when he is taken into hospital with a suspected lung infection, but he is soon well enough again to go back to his old ways, taking advantage of Lily, the wife of a fellow-patient. Among his other victims are unhappily-married Carla, home-loving Northerner Annie, and wealthy older woman Ruby.Halliwell's Film Guide describes the film as a garish sex comedy, which strikes me as a misconception. Despite a certain superficial similarity in plot to the likes of Confessions of a Window Cleaner, the film is actually a deeply serious one. Certainly, Alfie himself is a bit of a comedian who sees life as one big joke, always endeavouring to look on the bright side. Cheerfulness can in some cases be an admirable attribute, but in Alfie's case it goes hand-in-hand with a crass insensitivity to the problems and emotions of others. What he wants out of life is commitment-free relationships which will enable him to find sexual satisfaction with as many women as possible. Perhaps the most telling detail about his character is that he habitually refers to women as it rather than she.Only at the end of the film does it start to dawn on him that there might be more to life than a series of one-night stands, and he starts to ponder the question What's it all about? (The question is enshrined in the famous song which we hear at the end of the film as Alfie stands by the Thames pondering his future). There are three key moments in Alfie's gradual enlightenment. One comes when he wanders into a church where Gilda and Humphrey are having their first child baptised, and he realises that he is missing out on family life. Another comes when he discovers that Ruby has dumped him in favour of an even younger toyboy. For the first time he is being used in the way he uses others, and he doesn't like it. The most moving comes when, after Alfie has bullied Lily, whom he has got pregnant, into having an illegal abortion, he is shocked by the sight of his dead unborn child.Caine gives one of his best performances as the cheerfully immoral hero, and he receives good support from a number of others, especially Vivien Merchant as the tragic Lily, Alfie Bass as her invalid husband Harry and Denholm Elliott as the cynical abortionist.The film is firmly rooted in the working-class London of the mid-sixties, and reflects the Zeitgeist of that period. It was a time when the Pill was a recent invention, when the sexual revolution was just beginning but when older, conservative, attitudes towards sex were stronger than they are today. Although Alfie's conquests are played by some of the best-looking British actresses of the period, such as Shirley Anne Field, Julia Foster and Jane Asher, they are not mini-skirted dolly-birds, but basically old-fashioned girls, conservatively, even dowdily, dressed. All of them, except the sluttish Ruby, are looking for love rather than sex, and he is smart enough to know this and cynical enough to exploit it.In some respects the film was a progressive one for its period, both in its stylistic devices, such as having the hero speak direct to camera, and in its frankness about sexual matters, especially the highly controversial topic of abortion (still illegal in Britain in 1966, although it was to be legalised the following year). In its view of social matters, however, it is more conservative; its attitude towards abortion, for example, is more pro-life than pro-choice. The film can perhaps be seen as a critique of the sexual revolution, showing how greater sexual freedom was giving irresponsible philanderers like Alfie more opportunities to seduce women. The irony is that Alfie ends up ruining his own life as effectively as he has ruined theirs. Beneath its permissive surface, Alfie is a devastating exposure of the dark side of the sexual revolution. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 October 2007","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Michael Caine made several good films in the sixties and early seventies, such as Zulu, The Ipcress File and Get Carter, but in my opinion Alfie is his best from this period, and only equalled among his later films by Hannah and Her Sisters and Educating Rita.

We are quickly introduced to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She seems like a nobody (which she pretty much is for the most part - aside from birthing her son).The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) searches for her since there seems to be quite a few of Sarah Connor's. After finally finding the correct one, he goes on the chase and Sarah tries to hide figuring that she could be killed if found.Meanwhile, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) shows up from the future. He explains the Terminator is also from the future and is a cybernetic organism. He explains that Sarah's not-born-yet son John Connor is the leader of the rebel army to face the machines. Sarah and Kyle fall in love, somehow, quickly and show it by having sex. Sarah gets pregnant and survives the Terminator attack (this really isn't a spoiler since there is two sequels).Now, at this point you are probably wondering why I titled it as I did. Sure, it sounds interesting. But, Back To The Future makes sense. This is just ridiculous. A guy comes from the future and has a kid with a woman. Think about it. Doesn't that sound over the top? It will continue to happen the same way, thats how time traveling works.The story, however, is not the worst part of the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger says nearly zero lines. The make-up effects were just dreadful and then you have the special effects. I think for the most part the special effects were dormant. 1977, we saw some amazing special and visual effects from Star Wars. Seven years later, this trash comes out.It was tolerable up till the last 20 minutes. The skeleton was shown and instead of looking scary and realistic, it looked like stop frame animation from Nightmare Before Christmas. I laughed when I first saw this and I was thinking to myself 'Linda must have hated this part.' It's like running away from air, and screaming at nothing. Must have been difficult to portray. The sequel definitely beats the original by a long shot. The good news about this movie is James Cameron's career was not ruined by it, thankfully. Titanic, Terminator II, and Aliens all kept it alive.If you are a die-hard Terminator fan or Arnold fan, you'll watch this just for the fact of watching it. But if you're any fraction like me, you won't enjoy it and it will probably never grace your DVD\/VCR ever again - unless you have a Terminator marathon.

It could in fact be realising this that is the most important thing you need to know before seeing this film. Ask for the film to convince you and it will deliver in droves. From the simple but perfect use of The Aquarium (from The Carnival of the Animals) over sepia toned photographs in the opening credits to the last frame of 'magic hour' cinematography you will be astounded. The former high school football star and Harvard-Oxford educated philosopher recluse Terrence Malick maintains the dreamlike atmosphere which pervaded his 1973 debut Badlands. Telling a tale of early 20th Century workers in America, Days of Heaven focuses mainly on three characters. Richard Gere, who got the role after a long search and the likes of Pacino had turned it down, is miles from the rom-com robot he is now generally associated with. He plays the desperate Bill who struggles to keep a job in order to feed his girlfriend and little sister who tag along with him at all times. The beginning sees the trio head off to work the harvest in the fields of middle America and this is where the bulk of the story takes place. The thrust of the story being the love triangle which develops between Bill, his girlfriend and the farm's owner. The early harvest scenes are masterpieces in themselves. Determined to give the entire film an orange glow, Malick and his cinematographer, Nestor Almendros, would only film at the hours of dusk and dawn when the sun is lowest in the sky. The resulting footage of huge numbers of people working the fields and the insects which surround them has the majesty of a painting. Perhaps only Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) betters Days of Heaven in this respect. The scenery is as much a character as the humans themselves if not more so. Days of Heaven maintains this epic feel without having to become epic in length with a mere 90 minute running time. Improvisation is rife and a large majority of the scenes feature little to no dialogue. It is this that will either entrance or frustrate modern audiences. Accompanied by another classic Ennio Morricone score, Days of Heaven is a unique mediation on man's relationship with his environment and one of the most beautiful films ever made.

I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time. This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it. I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available.
