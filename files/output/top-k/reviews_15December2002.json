[{"date":"15 December 2002","score":"","review":"  Thomas A. Anderson is in trouble. Words appear on his computer screen, telling him to follow the white rabbit. He does, and a mysterious woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) tells him that they have been looking for him and says something about the Matrix, leaving Thomas very confused. In his work the next day, Thomas is chased by some guys. Not exactly good guys. He meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Morpheus tells him that once he goes into the real world, he can never go back. Thomas, who becomes Neo, does. And he finds out about the Matrix and everything.That may not make sense, but it does in the movie. Thomas A. Anderson\/Neo is played by Keanus Reeves, keeping his status as cool action dude real. He originally is skeptical, but soon learns the truth, and he begins, shall I say, enjoy it.The Matrix draws you in with special effects gadgets and weird things, but soon teeters away from that, making you glued to your seat because you're wating for the next one. While there are tremondous special effects (some were under-utilized, I'm assuming they'll be in the sequels), some of the characters came and went, and the script (by the directors, the Wachowski brothers) didn't really introduce them to us. Maybe if a little less of the fighting (which was very cool) and more of the basics had been there, it would have been easier.Of course, movies like this can't be without mumbo-jumbo. The mystical Morpheus does most of it-talking philosophically and not making sense at times. I got the rudimentary idea behind most of it (like that they actually didn't go the Matrix, etc.), but it tried to get oo in-depth.The Matrix was fun and enjoyable, with some heartpounding scenes and cool special effects (love that bullet-stopping). The acting was all very good-Reeves, as I've said before, was good and might be coming back. Fishburne is good as the guy who knows everything but cannot speak it (i.e. Dobby?), and I love Moss-she's great and a rising action star. I didn't really notice that Joe Pantoliano was there, but his voice sounded familiar. He looks a lot different than from Memento.The Matrix is a fun FX ridden piece that doesn't waste time on trivial aspects such as characters.My rating 7\/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language.

But Director Nick Gomez had difficulties in obtaining equilibrium and unity for his movie. Attempting to tell a rather sordid story with levity, he succeeds  as an aside ( or was it his true goal ?) in shedding a revealing light on a small rural American community( hence probably some harsh reviews). But for the opening scene, he chooses to show Mona  only in flashbacks, which is added difficulty to the film unity; at the same time, each  flashback permits to define aspects of Mona's  personality and life, i.e. pure evil mixed with unhappiness ( indifferent cheating husband,  love\/hate relationship with her no-good son, unattractive looks , resentment at the unfairness shown in the knife-throwing contest).. Compared to this complex part,  the other main characters remain sketchy or blurred, due to an underdeveloped script.There are also some attempts at pure slapstick some fail miserably ( the cowardice shown by the two cops, the ever-tipsy clergyman ); others fare better ( the mortician, the lesbian garage owner ) but remain small additions to the plot,  no parts of it. The casting shows similar discrepancies de Vito has had better parts in the past ( but is partly responsible thereof, as a producer of the film) ; Casey Affleck is not a worse actor than his brother    ( which is not saying much! ); and Neve Campbell tries hard, with mixed results. More positive aspects  Bette Midler is almost too convincing as the malevolent Mona ( but quite moving in the above knife-throwing contest scene );  Jamie Lee Curtis has composed with apparent delight the unglamorous part of the oversexed waitress; newcomer Marcus Thomas is rather good as the son, and William Fichtner really excellent as the husband. Will Ferell , as the mortician, has the best line of the film ( speaking of Mona's death  I have seen people more upset over losing change in a candy machine - in France they replaced change  by  10 cents , which is perhaps even slightly better ). The ever-reliable Tracey Walter, as the angler\/ murderer,is oddly serene and moving.While the scenery and music are quite satisfactory. In short, a not-too-bad movie where it could have been a very good one.
