Everything is bad, everything except for one thing, he keeps you constantly asking `why?What's bad?  Well among the things that suck are, the plot, the direction, getting the best work from good actors\/actresses, the discontinuity in what could be awesome visually relevant scenes, the subplots that do nothing except show their faces, the characters that seem interesting but aren't played out, etc.David Lynch has a talent, don't get me wrong.  He manages to get every single element of a good film together in one thing.  But he also manages to drop the ball on ALL of them, as in most of his works!If ANY other director could manage to collect even half of the elements in a David Lynch film into one movie, and make them work, it would be a blockbuster!  David Lynch has again triumphed in getting every possible good element of a project into one effort, and then making every single element fail.More crap.  If you want to study movies, study David Lynch.  He is a mast er at SOMETHING, and that is, defining and bringing the key elements, and many many of them into a project.  But, don't study what he does with them, just study what the elements are in the project.  He can't deliver on a `suspense', because there never is a climax and an ending.  He can't deliver on deep characters, because he just keeps trying to build them, but never makes them have significant meaning to the plot.  He can't deliver on the plot, because he brings a great plot to the table without ever bringing a `shocking' or `meaningful' conclusion to it.If there is anything Lynch is good at, it's this..  He is a mold breaker, and does away with the conventions of the typical Hollywood movie. Unfortunately, the parts he does away with are the best parts.  It's groundbreaking, no doubt.

It is not quite the classic that Silence of the Lambs is but is in some ways more interesting to watch and clearly antecedent to Jonathon Demme's effort. I have not read Red Dragon, though that is really irrelevant to a review of Manhunter, and cannot comment on the changes that Michael Mann made to the story told in the book. What Mann did do was construct a compelling and suspenseful account of a tortured man returning to the tasks that still torture him. Graham is in many ways a much more interesting character than Clarice Starling and one who gets by on his own abilities and not the bread crumbs dropped by a jailed psychopath. Cox is a wonderful Lector, cerebral, relaxed and humorous. The performance is not the same as Hopkins' but this is not the same Lector who we find in Silence. Mann's direction is stylized but successful in sliding you into the contest that is being played out between Graham and Dolarhyde. As with his other films, Michael Mann does a meticulous job of recreating a world in which his characters don't play out plot points but act out their lives.William Peterson and Tom Noonan, two relative unknowns, inhabit the two central characters, bringing to life the pain and the desire that drives these two characters who are more similar than either would like to admit. They also do so without the spoon feeding of flashbacks and explanatory back story that tells you exactly why Graham is so reluctant to come back and why Dolarhyde feels he must become something more than he is. Like Buffalo Bill in Silence, Dolarhyde is given motive but not explanation. He is a serial killer. He has murdered two families. Noonan gives the audience a glimpse of the humanity that lies underneath what Dolarhyde is becoming but does not ever let us feel that this man is not dangerous or that he can stop the killing.SPOILERS AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THE FILM ENDSThe ending seems to be a great point of contention with many other users. I think it suits the film. It may be very different from the book but I gather so is much of the rest of the film so perhaps the book's ending would not have worked. It may be a tad Hollywood but it is also realistic. Serial killers don't often get away with it. Eventually they are usually caught without ever even knowing the detective who will apprehend them, let alone threatening his or her family in any way.I have yet to see Red Dragon mostly because I feel it is pointless. I can go to the theater and watch a composite of Manhunter and Silence that faithfully retells the story of the book or I can stay home and watch to excellent, original films.

It is not quite the classic that Silence of the Lambs is but is in some ways more interesting to watch and clearly antecedent to Jonathon Demme's effort. I have not read Red Dragon, though that is really irrelevant to a review of Manhunter, and cannot comment on the changes that Michael Mann made to the story told in the book. What Mann did do was construct a compelling and suspenseful account of a tortured man returning to the tasks that still torture him. Graham is in many ways a much more interesting character than Clarice Starling and one who gets by on his own abilities and not the bread crumbs dropped by a jailed psychopath. Cox is a wonderful Lector, cerebral, relaxed and humorous. The performance is not the same as Hopkins' but this is not the same Lector who we find in Silence. Mann's direction is stylized but successful in sliding you into the contest that is being played out between Graham and Dolarhyde. As with his other films, Michael Mann does a meticulous job of recreating a world in which his characters don't play out plot points but act out their lives.William Peterson and Tom Noonan, two relative unknowns, inhabit the two central characters, bringing to life the pain and the desire that drives these two characters who are more similar than either would like to admit. They also do so without the spoon feeding of flashbacks and explanatory back story that tells you exactly why Graham is so reluctant to come back and why Dolarhyde feels he must become something more than he is. Like Buffalo Bill in Silence, Dolarhyde is given motive but not explanation. He is a serial killer. He has murdered two families. Noonan gives the audience a glimpse of the humanity that lies underneath what Dolarhyde is becoming but does not ever let us feel that this man is not dangerous or that he can stop the killing.SPOILERS AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THE FILM ENDSThe ending seems to be a great point of contention with many other users.

The teachers portrayed by Jackie Burroughs & Mimi Kuzyk were much more important to the core of the exuberance, inspiration, indignation, frustration, all in one fused mesh of adolescent quest for identity, of their young students, than the other comments have mentioned. The acting all the way down the credits was remarkable which means the director was exceptional. I am definitely going to see other movies by Lea Pool as suggested in these comments! I have not read Wives Of Bath by Susan Swan which the film was based on, so having said that, I confess that I still sense that the ending was not what most of us perceived it to be?!? I am the very witness to how real Lost & Delirious was... Although the poetry may have struck some viewers as dreamy &\/or excessive, it is nothing short of a radical dream when you are a Catholic 15 or so year old girl & in love with another girl. The more you both perceive yourselves to be young women, the more the world around you suspects all too keenly the real nature of your passion, the more they call you immature.

I don't like Hollywood movies much, and was sceptical about the film my GF wanted - no, needed - me to see, knowing not much more about it than that it had big stars and was quite successful and some kind of thriller-thing - and that she wanted, no, needed me to see it. I understand why now.From almost the moment it started I was sitting on the edge of my seat, in one of the most anxious and intense movie experiences I've had. The visual brilliance helped, of course. But The Matrix - that other movie she really wanted me to see - was also visually stunning while stretching your suspension of disbelief - but only scratched at surfaces where this movie just pulled you to it and dragged you right down, to the murkiest depths.I thought it was believable (I already saw that most other reviewers didn't) - not the possibility of dying in somebody else's dream bit, but the story so inventively told through the gimmick, that of the terrified boy within the sick man, one daring out for help while the other snaps out in anger. 'The serial killers sickness as a prolonged cry of pain' is not exactly a novel idea for a story line, but The Cell tells it in a way that grips you, and it does so through the technical-visual brilliance of its bizarre angle. This guy is so sick that no regular 'playing out' of the traumatised-kid-within story would have been credible - only in the very depths of his mind can that kid be found and that the director thus decided - OK - that's where we'll literally go in the movie, then - is pretty impressive. That they stayed an uncomprimising course, going beyond the thriller suspense but not giving in to the temptation to have her succeed in 'rescuing' him in some happy end either, is, too. The film never gets sappy about the tragedy hidden inside the serial killers head. He is truly and irredeemably rotten, to the core - his violence is beyond the hysteric violence of anger and frustration, it is the studious obsessed violence of a person who's been corrupted, corrupted by terror. The film shows where the terror stems from, adds the why and how come, but without ever excusing him. It's the nightmare of every victim - that his\/her assailant will succeed in corrupting him\/her to the point where s\/he isn't fit for life anymore. Spoilt goods. The films' serial killer is. The film stays consistent in this, refusing the viewer an easy exit into mercy or condemnation. She goes to her limits to where she understands him - but he still has to die.The cruelty of The Cell is no freak show. Nothing gratuitous about it, it's real enough - all over the place, in minds and lives transformed by pain. Some other reviewer lamented that, unlike The Matrix e.a., the film had nothing to say about the resilience and optimism of humanity. Well no, and if you go to the movies for your prescription of hope & belief, this is the wrong one to go see - it has something to say about damage, and how the inner world of terrorized kids turn into nightmare landscapes. Instead of telling that story, this film decided to just show those landscapes. Succeeded. Very disconcerting.

In this version Garner is a lawman policing a poker competition (hosted by James Coburn)in which Gibson and Foster intend to participate.  The point of the movie seems to be more for the viewers to locate and recognize country singers and other actors who appear briefly in cameo roles and catch other inside jokes (such as the appearance of Danny Glover reciting his catch line from the Lethal Weapon movies)than to actually follow the thinly strung together storyline.The film reaches its lowest point (among many such possibilities) with a plot foray involving some handy Sioux Indians, (led by Graham Green, no less, who is his generation's Chief Dan George, appearing whenever an American Indian is called for in a script). Here the smugness requires Indian Chief Green to speak English and generally carry on as any regular 20th Century (white)American might, with the requisite historically anachronistic politically correct wry observations on the plight and exploitation of the noble red man with his old pal and confederate Gibson.

That describes Maverick in a nutshell; (another more recent example would be the remake of Ocean's Eleven).In yet another tired remake of a once popular old television show, Maverick sports James Garner as its best gimmick Garner played the title role of the old TV Western Bret Maverick, in which the smugness and cleverness of the lead character were to take the place of the usual fistfights and gunplay of the standard westerns of the era.  In this version Garner is a lawman policing a poker competition (hosted by James Coburn)in which Gibson and Foster intend to participate.  The point of the movie seems to be more for the viewers to locate and recognize country singers and other actors who appear briefly in cameo roles and catch other inside jokes (such as the appearance of Danny Glover reciting his catch line from the Lethal Weapon movies)than to actually follow the thinly strung together storyline.The film reaches its lowest point (among many such possibilities) with a plot foray involving some handy Sioux Indians, (led by Graham Green, no less, who is his generation's Chief Dan George, appearing whenever an American Indian is called for in a script). Here the smugness requires Indian Chief Green to speak English and generally carry on as any regular 20th Century (white)American might, with the requisite historically anachronistic politically correct wry observations on the plight and exploitation of the noble red man with his old pal and confederate Gibson. It's not funny, and in fact is even more pathetic and insulting to the Sioux, and to Green himself when one considers Green's famous portrayal of a noble Lakota in Dances With Wolves.  (Is he parodying himself in advance?)The movie and script are dopey, but without charm.  It's a poker game with a stacked deck (metaphorically speaking) with everyone playing to the audience with a wink and a nod. It's as much a western as the old F-Troop TV series, but with Gibson's wild-eyed mugging for the camera instead of Larry Storch.  The climactic poker game itself lasts just one hand, as the double and triple crosses stumble over eachother long after after should care, and yet the film drags on until its final surprise.  Deal me out.  ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"}]
