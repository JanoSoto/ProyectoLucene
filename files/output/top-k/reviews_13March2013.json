I was a fan of cartoons like He-Man so seeing this film was like a dream come true. This believe or not is my favorite film from director Ron Howard, but most importantly it's one of my favorite fantasy films of all time.I really like the plot, it's simplistic it's not complicated which is something I personally feel the fantasy\/RPG genre is getting carried away with. To me simplicity was part of what made fantasies great because with a simple premise you have freedom to include and do whatever you want. And I feel the plot is good on a moralistic level, the fact that it's about a child's life in danger from this evil army just all the more make me want the good guys to win.The production value is great, it's one of those rare examples of a big budget used the right way and for the right reasons. I like the locales which really help bring out a time long gone and almost feel as if the fantasy world might have existed. The action is great, I really love the chirography on the swashbuckling action. And there are some memorable action\/battle sequences like two chase scenes one with a stage coach and another a sled sequence. Though my favorite battle is the siege in Tiers Lean, as I said before I always love sieges because the interior of a building structure gives you plenty of opportunities to prepare and stragize defenses against the opposition, but just the simple fun concept of few against the world.The effects are also great, there was no CGI which is why I feel they hold up now because their practical. The magic effects look great they don't look fake or cartoonish like most fantasy with CGI effects make the mistake of doing. But I also just like some of the creatures they have like the annoying disgusting trolls, the nasty rat dogs makes me want to get a giant mouse trap, but my favorite is the two headed fire breathing Hydra the stop motion and pupetering effects on the thing were just excellent, they way it moved and behaved.Music score I think is fantastic by one of my favorite composers James Horner, it has that epic adventurous quality that fits like a glove for the film.But of course I really like the characters. You've got some really good supporting characters like the doopleganger sorceress Fin Razel whom is wise but also kinda funny, I like the fact she uses whatever forms she has to her advantage. The two brownies, both aren't just comic relief but their actually useful in places, it just shows how much small size has it's advantages. Sorsha played well by Joanne Whalley whom I think is a solid actress; her character I think is hot not just on an external level but internally she's feisty and has some fire; let alone a female that's capable of kicking butt instead of being a stereotypical damsel in distress. She pretty much the good girl\/soldier that is playing for the wrong team, which makes you hope she'll get on the right track. And another good thing she's nothing like her mom.Queen Bamorda (Jean Marsh) she's a good opponent. She just such an unlikeable witch in ever sense of the word. And is also intimidating from how ruthless and heartless she is, as well as the extend of her magic, like one disturbing scene she turns everyone into pigs to both defeat her enemies and sick amusement. Though I really like the subordinate villain General Kale whom is really intimidating with that voice and that skull mask that makes him look like Skelator from He-Man.But of course it's the two main characters that drive the film Willow (Warwick Davis)a down to earth person whom gets the most grief but perfectly capable of doing what's right and my favorite Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) he's just great not just as a man of action but his charisma, brash, and unsmooth nature which give him some of the best lines. Both characters have their strengths and weakness. I really love the back and forth between both Madmartigan and Willow, it's pretty much a buddy cop dynamic since both characters are on the opposite side of the fence. Both at times cause intentional or unintentional grief toward one another. But I really like how both in a way do bond somewhat and really do work well together, without one another they wouldn't of survived or made it very far. But also both have one thing in common, they both want more out of their lives and to be more.Willow is a farmer that has an ambition to be a sorcerer that just needs a chance and confidence. Madmartigan has a lot of useful skills to be a great warrior but has been on the wrong path. I like how as both and others help them out on their quest both do grow to get them where they want to be, Willow becomes more aggressive steps up when he should despite his limitations because there's no one else that will. Same with Madmartigan he starts to go on the right path when he does the right thing whether he wants to or not.Big things can happen to the smallest of people, and the smallest can do the biggest things.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2013","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I was a kid from the 80's and fantasy was one of the first genres I was into.

I don't really know. I have only seen Pulp Fiction and this film as well as a few others that he has been involved in but not particularly directed. The thing with the two Tarrentino movies that I have seen is that he likes to have static conversations between two characters that don't really go anywhere. This was the case in Pulp-Fiction, with the scene in the restaurant being quite dull. In Jackie Brown, it was mostly with the conversations between DeNiro and Fonda that fell into this category.What sets this movie apart though is the way Tarrentino constructs a number of characters and brings them all together; this is what is similar between this movie, Pulp Fiction, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. In Jackie Brown, we have Ormond (Samuel L. Jackson), the gun dealer and his friend Mel (Bridgette Fonda). Then there is Robert DeNiro, who plays Ormond's friend that has just got out of gaol and is bunking with Mel. Jackie Brown is an airline hostess that brings money back from Mexico to Ormond, and there is Max, her bailbondsman. Finally there are the two cops that are trying to catch Ormond.At the beginning of the movie all of these characters are linked, so it is not that similar with Pulp Fiction and Lock Stock for the characters in those movie do not begin linked. The thing about this movie is the way each of the characters are trying to play each other to walk out with half a million dollars. Jackie Brown is facing gaol so she tells the cops everything, but because Ormond is likely to kill her, she tells him everything and arranges that he gets his money past all of the cops. Instead, Jackie and Max want the money for themselves so they plan to slip the money away under Ormond's and the police's nose. The police, even though tempted by the money, simply want to see Ormond in gaol.Ormond is an interesting character because we are shown many sides to him. At first he seems cool and confident and in control. He bails out one of his associates and kills him because he might leak information to the police. He does the killings himself so that he knows that the job is done, and he commits the murders so that he will not be found out. When talking about guns and selling them, he appears very knowledgeable. Yet Mel reveals a completely different side to him. She claims that Ormond is stupid and only repeats what he hears. He has no idea about guns and only repeats what other people tell him. Even though he deals with his associate, it is too late as his associate has already told the cops everything they need to know.Mel is a very unflattering character. I say this because all she does is smoke dope, watch television, and have sex. She has no sense of shame or responsibility nor does she respect other people. This is seen clearly when she constantly mouths off to DeNiro's character as they are walking out of the shopping centre. The thing that puts me off about this movie and about Mel in particular is she cheapens sex and cheapens women. She wonders around in shorts and a bikini, and sometimes doesn't even have shorts on. The guys she hangs around treat her as a slave, yet even though she resents it, she still welcomes it. The one thing about the character, and this comes from Ormond's mouth, is that she is consistent. He does not trust her, but he does trust her to be herself.Jackie Brown is a movie about playing people against each other. It is a movie that develops characters, though sometimes over excessively which drags the movie out to its length. There are certain points in which character development can go to, and I feel that Jackie Brown takes it a bit too far.

We get to see where everyone from the first film is and how their life ends up and it was well written and worthy. It didn't feel just like a cash in which it probably was. The first film was more of a comedy than this sequel. Certainly there are still some funny moments but this one has much more drama and romance than the first and that's okay. It works very well and we needed more character development from the three Dad's and from Sylvia who gets a full character in this one. I felt like with the first movie it was just full of 80's clichés and popular culture and I couldn't help but notice that this movie didn't have that vibe. Granted the movie was made in 1990 which is outside of the 80's window but somehow I didn't feel like it had quite the style the first one had. I suppose, they made the movie under the pretense that everyone already knew the characters and they didn't need to rehash who they were and what they did for a living and that is probably a wise choice on their part.Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson are back and in full swing in their old roles. The three of them still have great chemistry and are a little older, a little wiser and a little more mature this time around. Their personalities aren't quite as vibrant as the first film but they are who they were the first time around and that is a compliment. They don't outdo each other and they are great together. Nancy Travis returns as Sylvia but as a main character. I can't figure out why they chose to make her English. Travis' accent is okay at best and its distracting. There is really no reason to make her British other than her return to England which they could have done easily in another way. Still she is good and has good chemistry with everyone. Robin Weisman, who never did much of anything else, is downright terrific as Mary. She's appropriately adorable and does a great job. Christopher Cazenove is our pseudo-villain looking to break up the beloved foursome. Cazenove is the perfect 80's comedy villain and he carries out his role very well.Taking over from Leonard Nimoy at the directing duties is the amazing Emile Ardolino. I say amazing in particular because of his duties directing the classic (one of my favourites) Dirty Dancing but also classic comedy Sister Act.

The first film was more of a comedy than this sequel. Certainly there are still some funny moments but this one has much more drama and romance than the first and that's okay. It works very well and we needed more character development from the three Dad's and from Sylvia who gets a full character in this one. I felt like with the first movie it was just full of 80's clichés and popular culture and I couldn't help but notice that this movie didn't have that vibe. Granted the movie was made in 1990 which is outside of the 80's window but somehow I didn't feel like it had quite the style the first one had. I suppose, they made the movie under the pretense that everyone already knew the characters and they didn't need to rehash who they were and what they did for a living and that is probably a wise choice on their part.Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson are back and in full swing in their old roles. The three of them still have great chemistry and are a little older, a little wiser and a little more mature this time around. Their personalities aren't quite as vibrant as the first film but they are who they were the first time around and that is a compliment. They don't outdo each other and they are great together. Nancy Travis returns as Sylvia but as a main character. I can't figure out why they chose to make her English. Travis' accent is okay at best and its distracting. There is really no reason to make her British other than her return to England which they could have done easily in another way. Still she is good and has good chemistry with everyone. Robin Weisman, who never did much of anything else, is downright terrific as Mary. She's appropriately adorable and does a great job. Christopher Cazenove is our pseudo-villain looking to break up the beloved foursome. Cazenove is the perfect 80's comedy villain and he carries out his role very well.Taking over from Leonard Nimoy at the directing duties is the amazing Emile Ardolino.

The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a perfect movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

So naturally, my expectations weren't very high for this movie I love Al Pacino as an actor, especially in the Godfather, where both he and Marlon Brando just owned the first and he stole the show in the second with Robert de Niro.The story of 'Scarface' focuses around a Cuban refugee by the name of Tony Montana, and much like Godfather, focuses on the rise and corruption to greed and power of this man.The acting in the movie was mainly great but Al Pacino's legendary performance and what I believe is, his greatest yet, was totally deserving of an Academy Award for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor! That's how amazing that performance was. Some of the dialogue in the movie is awful like 'Say Hello to My little friend!' but under Al Pacino's amazing portrayal, these sound like bits of Quentin Tarantino's gold dialogue! The movie is over the top! Yes! However, it is pretty aware of itself and such acts throughout the film indicate this very clearly such as Tony Montana saying I'm still standing and so on. That brings to a MAJOR SPOILER, SO DON'T READ THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE! Tony Montana's death is one of the more disappointing conclusions to a movie I otherwise loved. I mean, the Mask comes up and just shoots him and he dies! I would've liked a bit of a duel before Tony was taken out. Also, the movie was quite predictable but I also just enjoyed it Critics have said the movie is slow paced and the last half of the movie isn't very good in comparison to the first half- I disagree. The movie for me, was paced perfectly and three hours went by quickly. The second half is the half I like more mainly due to the true corruption of Tony Montana. However, this movie did add two surprisingly touching scenes and I was surprised by it actually!

It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes.Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best.Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script.

The tale of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who saves well over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust through his cunning and selflessness, is a timeless exhibition of exactly why the very medium of filmmaking was invented. Approaching its 20th anniversary, Universal Sony has converted the original film into high-definition, allowing a new generation to experience its soaring story and visceral intensity.Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a man who considers himself a businessman first and a Nazi second. In the throes of WWII, he sees opportunity in hiring Jewish POWs to work in his enamel factory. With the help of trustworthy accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), he develops a godly reputation among the Jews despite originally being apathetic to their struggles. Naturally, his actions raise the curiosity of some high-ranking German officers, including the sadistic Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).The legacy of Schindler's List stands tall two decades after its theatrical release. The film took home seven Oscars at the 1994 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, while Neeson and Fiennes were bested in the Acting categories by Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) respectively. Today, Schindler and Goeth are considered arguably the finest moments of either man's distinguished career. The Blu-ray conversion is virtually faultless at every turn. It is one thing to infuse a visual sense of wonder to a screen already populated by giant sharks, prehistoric beasts or cuddly other-worlders; it is quite another to invoke that same awe to a sombre tale filmed in monochrome, but that is precisely what has been achieved with this restoration. The update beautifully renders some of the most harrowing shots ever put to celluloid, including the massacre set to Bach and the first glimpse of Auschwitz; its steaming, monstrous pillars resembling a most ironic monolith of human evolution. The famous Girl in Red- for many, the emotive highlight of the film- is given new and ironic life through touched-up footage keeping her dress from fading into its surroundings, as was the case with the original negative.For such a powerful piece of cinema, the mastery of Spielberg's direction is his ability to peel back as opposed to going for the jugular too early or too often. The film expertly traverses a near-impossible pitfall of melodrama. As he did with more contemporary histo-drama Lincoln, Spielberg's ability to blend the emotionally challenging and the humanistic is unmatched, in what remains not only his most personal project, but perhaps the most personal film of any A-list director ever.The end result is still a depressing and, at times, highly disturbing piece of art, but one that concurrently remains an absorbing character study of the highest order. Schindler is not a wholeheartedly compassionate man; for him, it's all about the Benjamins- or in this case, the Reichsmarks- and he is offended- nay, enraged- that his workers would have the audacity to call his factory a 'haven', until his perspective on the war is forever changed. Likewise, Goeth, the man who kills Jews from his balcony with the same indifference as a man reading the morning paper, is the same one that secretly lusts after his Jewish maid. Kingsley's Stern, then, just may be the most emotionally integral character, acting as the catalyst for Schindler's eventual change of heart while playing the role of the unshakeable moral compass and most accessible window for the audience into the lives of those persecuted. It is this story of flawed good versus flawed evil that humanises these once mythical creatures. Appropriately, it isn't until the final half-hour that the immensity of their actions are realised in one of the most memorable, heartfelt endings of all time, in which Spielberg breaks every rule of conventional narrative filmmaking at once in order to pay his final respects. The Blu-ray comes complete with a series of special features, including Voices from the List, a documentary featuring testimonies from some of the 'Schindler Jews' who survived the Holocaust, as well as a story on Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation. The intentions of Universal are salient here, as their features keep in line with the director's original intent to minimise publicity or self-servitude, to the point where he even refused payment for his work, citing 'blood money' as the deterrent. However, trivia buffs interested in some of the more allegorical tidbits of production (including the alleviation of on-set depression through Spielberg's screenings of Seinfeld and Robin Williams sketches, and the time a survivor trembled with terror at her first sight of Fiennes because he reminded her too much of the real Goeth) may be satiated by a 16-page companion booklet, featuring behind- the-scenes information on the incredible stories around an incredible composition.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It concerns Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) a well off, single man quite satisfied living alone and enjoying the carefree Bachelor's life. At the same time a young twelve-year-old boy named Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) who enjoys singing to himself, bullied at school, and is hard pressed living with a single, lonely, depressed and suicidal-prone mother. By themselves they are in desperate need of companionship, but once they discover each other, they realize their needs are similar. The answer to both their problems is met when they learn, Life is sharing and each has more to offer than they believe possible. The film is a delight to view as we watch both Characters trying desperately to solve their personal dilemmas without asking for help. Thus the quote 'No Man is an Island' becomes important.

Scott, uses to sum up why he thinks pool hustler Eddy Felson (Paul Newman) is a loser. He explains that although skillful, Eddy doesn't have the character to win, and has ready-made excuses for losing rather than face the flaws within himself.It is the theme that runs through this powerful film; the game of pool tests Eddy's character but so does his relationships with the people around him, and Eddy is found wanting. He has little loyalty to others and not much for himself; his one desire is to be the best pool player in the country. Although there are a number of pool games in the film, the one that stays in the memory is the first game against reigning champion, Minnesota Fats, with Jackie Gleason's portrayal just about stealing the movie. Filmed in a famous New York pool hall, Rossen takes us into a world that is almost separate from the life of the city around it. The duel with Minnesota Fats goes for nearly two days, and draws an audience of gamblers and pool devotees. Throughout the game, Eddy is strutting and voluble. He announces his thoughts almost as though they were Shakespearean soliloquies. He is so driven that it is a performance that rivals Hamlet for intensity. Paul Newman's performance goes close to being too much but it fits perfectly within the heightened atmosphere that Rossen has created. By contrast, Minnesota Fats is a model of restraint. He stays cool and goes about his game in a business-like manner. Both men drink but Minnesota Fats handles it better. He also refreshes himself from time to time while Eddy looks disheveled and beaten &#x96; the result is inevitable.Eddy meets Sarah Packard, played by Piper Laurie, who gives such a heart-felt performance that it is almost too painful to watch. But Eddy still has a difficult journey to make and it is not until tragedy takes him to his lowest point that he shows the character that Bert Gordon said he would never have.The Hustler is one of the best movies from a period, which I think was the most fertile for dramatic film in the history of cinema, the 10 years between 1955-1965. At the time, we took it for granted that those films would be challenging, passionate, thought provoking, and possibly even disturbing. Every era of cinema produces great movies but there just seemed to be so many good ones in the field of drama right then.Society was changing and so were films. Talented writers and directors were emerging who had cut their teeth on live television drama. Novels were adapted with subjects that challenged the established order. Plays by people such as William Inge, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller were translated from stage to screen. Hollywood was also heavily influenced by ideas coming from Europe &#x96; Italian Neorealism with the emphasis on real locations, the French New Wave, and a group of powerful dramas from Britain. Independent production was replacing the old studio system. And to see the impact Marlon Brando and 'The Method' was having on drama, look no further than Paul Newman's performance in The Hustler.But there were other forces. The McCarthy era had either exiled or embittered a large group of writers and directors, a number of whom started to re-emerge towards the end of the fifties and early sixties; their screenplays and films expressing some of the pain they had endured.The other strong force was the Motion Picture Production Code. Despite the fact that filmmakers railed against it, the parameters it set actually made them more resourceful &#x96; what couldn't be shown could be alluded to with symbolism and metaphor. These factors no longer exist but they did have an affect on Robert Rossen back then. Much of what happens in The Hustler was allegory for the ills he felt ailed society, and the meaning of real character permeates the film.Although there is a lot more to the movie, The Hustler, and especially Minnesota Fats have become synonymous with the game of pool.

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, F. Murray Abraham, Charles Dance, Tom Noonan, Austin O'Brien, Art Carney, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn and Bridgette Wilson. Music is by Micahel Kamen and cinematography by Dean Semler.Film within a film action parody that sees young Danny Madigan (O'Brien) magically transported into the parallel universe of an action film featuring his fictional hero, Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger). A financial failure and beaten relentlessly by the critics upon release (even McTiernan would condemn it down the line), Last Action Hero is viewed some what in better terms these days. Whilst the arguments that it was ahead of its time, misunderstood and released at the wrong time due to competition with Jurassic Park (the last one was Arnie himself, bless him) are weak and really not worth considering, it's a decent and intelligent film that could have been very good if cut by at least half an hour.Running at over two hours in length, the film's central concept of parodying action movies, with Arnold broadly laughing at himself, runs out of steam, the joke just becomes a millstone around its neck. You can see the drop in quality of the action in the last third as well, purely because so much is thrown at the audience, it gets tiresome for the director, which is such a shame given that it's McTiernan at the helm, the man who in Predator and Die Hard gave the 80s its two best American action movies.As it is, and I was helped enormously in my viewing of this because I watched it back to back with Hard Target, much of the parody and cineaste jokes strike a humorous chord. While the roll call of actors lining up to be in on the joke is impressive and often laugh out loud funny. Yet amongst all the satire and tongue in cheek wink winks, there is also some depth to the dizzying narrative that is worth appraising, particularly when the picture pitches up the real life of an actor to that of the character he plays, with one sequence as Arnie faces up to Arnie particularly brilliant.Better than you may have heard it is, but still a film that's difficult to recommend with confidence. Some self-examining depth and smart in- movie jokes ensure it's no dud, but entering the last third it becomes tiresome and routine and that leaves a disappointment that's hard to shake. 6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Last Action Hero is directed by John McTiernan and written by Shane Black and David Arnott.

A financial failure and beaten relentlessly by the critics upon release (even McTiernan would condemn it down the line), Last Action Hero is viewed some what in better terms these days. Whilst the arguments that it was ahead of its time, misunderstood and released at the wrong time due to competition with Jurassic Park (the last one was Arnie himself, bless him) are weak and really not worth considering, it's a decent and intelligent film that could have been very good if cut by at least half an hour.Running at over two hours in length, the film's central concept of parodying action movies, with Arnold broadly laughing at himself, runs out of steam, the joke just becomes a millstone around its neck. You can see the drop in quality of the action in the last third as well, purely because so much is thrown at the audience, it gets tiresome for the director, which is such a shame given that it's McTiernan at the helm, the man who in Predator and Die Hard gave the 80s its two best American action movies.As it is, and I was helped enormously in my viewing of this because I watched it back to back with Hard Target, much of the parody and cineaste jokes strike a humorous chord.
