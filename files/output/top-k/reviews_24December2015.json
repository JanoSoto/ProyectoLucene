[{"date":"24 December 2015","score":"","review":" The scale of bad movies is so vast it is sometimes difficult to keep a clear perspective. But I must say this film must be one of the worst, if not THE worst movie I ever saw. I bet even the Star Wars Christmas Special is hardly worse than this.What is truly enraging is that someone (or something) authorized to spend 65m$ on this crap. AND lots of big name actors (Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Reubens, Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, Eddie Izzard, Claire Forlani, Tom Waits, Ricky Jay and Lena Olin) committed to this 'project'. Why? Can someone explain that to me. It must be some sort of large scale blackmail operation where they had some incriminating stuff on all these actors, no-one in their right mind would willingly want to be in this film if they read the script.Everything is terrible the plot, the VFX are sh1t, the production design has horrendous colors and everything looks plastic and cardboard. The acting is so awful all the razzies handed out in the history of the razzies would still not be able to cover it. It is supposed to be a comedy, but there is NOTHING funny in this movie, nada. You probably don't believe me. Heck I thought 54.000 people gave it a 6\/10 on IMDb, it must be okay at least. Well it's not. The film lasts an incredibly long 2 hours during which you will feel like you're dying. I literally got a headache from this film. Some of these scenes you can't begin to describe. It's an insult to the art of filmmaking. I kept staring at the screen in disbelief! I wonder if kids would like this but I wouldn't recommend showing it to them. I'm sure it will cause some sort of long term brain damage.I challenge you to see it. It's not one of those 'it's so bad it's good' films. It's just bad through and through. There are no redeeming qualities, nothing. Look, if you seen it and liked it, leave me a PM and explain it to me. I really would like to know what there is to like. You've been warned! Save 2 precious hours of your life and enjoy your time on this planet instead of p1ssing it away on sh1t that should never have been.
