I remember when I first watched the film many years ago (on VHS) I didn't think much of it and years later I gave it another go because I am a Kids in the Hall fan. It turns out there are many who prefer the movie who have given it a second or more viewings. The movie is silly (which is one thing I love) and also quite brilliant. I have to say it has earned the title of being a cult classic and is up there with the Monty Python movies. Much of the dialogue itself is funny and the characters just add so much humour to the screen. The only real problem I have with the movie is the DVD. The DVD lacks completely of special features (and is now out of print). Where is the trailer? (which is totally worth seeing over and over again). Where are the deleted scenes? (There happens to be several deleted scenes). What about the alternate ending (Which is worth watching). Maybe the movie could have been funnier if some of the removed scenes had made it's way into the movie. But still the movie is fine the way it is but again the DVD should feature the removed content in order to appreciate this movie even more. I've seen the work print of the movie and of course the movie itself and yet the trailer has moments that is in neither. What is that all about?

If so, this is an opportunity for you to take a ride back to 1982, as a teenager and the account of it on the big screen. What do you reckon ? If you haven't, no worries, this is not another user comment claiming to not spoil the movie when I think (IMO) it does.... at least to some extent - not plot-wise per se. For example, I read user comments claiming it's not about special effects... you kidding' me ? The Thing's special effects (in 1982) didn't just shock, they truly terrorised (more below on that, stay tuned)!So, let's go back to 1982. All the masses were flocking to the theater to phone home (ET). A bunch of teenagers about 15-17 - my friends and myself included -wanted to see 'The Thing'. (I personally had no desire to see ET at that time, I'd read the book and that sufficed - for now). In hindsight, I'm glad we did. Sorry - correction, a couple of mates back then didn't, I think. One friend-of-a-friend (amongst the bunch of us) came out of the theater looking pale, he felt sick (well, he looked it -) because of the terror he just went through. Is that good ? Absolutely ! Now, let me digress briefly to the special effects. I've seen my share of horror movies. Some have great special effects, sure. But this is 2009. Terminator 2 presented a quantum leap in CGI. But James Cameron thought it through, as usual. He knew then that CGI is - or should be - the last resort, not the first. The team that ensured The Thing delivered its full impact beyond the nightmare story, using every resource available at that time (CGI wasn't one of them), succeeded too well it seemed. Rob Bottin's (yes, even Stan Winston) willingness to push the envelope - of course with the help and synergy of many other brilliant minds - did something I have\/had never seen in a story on the screen  I spent years, stumped ... speculating how on earth the movie's visual juggernaut was conceived and punched into my face... And I couldn't figure it out. (not until the fine day I got my hands on the special edition DVD).Now, again, consider this is 1982 ! I can't muster another movie title where I've wondered how it looked fake in other words, how it was done. All others are fake ; some take little effort to conjure up or accept the story's reality, many need a willing mind and some effort. That's not necessarily bad of course.Now back to the future, today. It's 27 years on and this movie still manages to either make you think you're human (you hope) when it picks you up and immerses you into the story of this frozen dozen characters. They're isolated, exhausted and too terrified to even consider sleeping. But one or several are hoping they're human - I think - but are probably not. Why ? Because something has infiltrated them, or should I write, 'some THING'.So, if you're still reading and you didn't see the movie then I urge one of 2 things. Rent the movie or buy the DVD movie (I did the latter). OK, now proceed with your favorite ritual (you can get popcorn, I'm not sure if you'll actually remember you have it while viewing-) and get ready to watch film making that is so brilliant that the audience wasn't fully ready for it in '82, sadly underscored by lack of box office success. I'm not even sure about 2009. I have flagged this Chef D'Oeuvre to a few younger friends asking to see a scary movie when thirsty for more of today's gore entertainment.... most have afterwards admitted they got too scared and didn't see it through -)So, are you game ? Ennio Moriconi will give you a taste with his introductory sound score, that this story will finally thrill you as you were promised. If you're anything like me, it'll do so much more. Every line of dialogue is great. The actors' performances are outstanding and utterly convincing. (perhaps save for a single line What do we do now by Donald Moffat). But Moffat and all other 11 are discerningly cast near perfection and clearly spilled their blood, sweat and tears, it seems, to bring these outstanding performances.To close, it's quite hard to fault The Thing when put in its context. The lighting is perfect, the sound and dialogue is, the score is. And a handful of dark humour will make you laugh, but I did it afterward - when I was able to - back in 1982 when I got every cent of my pocket money's worth paying my cinema ticket.I'm sure you will treasure The Thing's special DVD edition after you've added it to your collection... I did and still do. Finally, in my opinion John Carpenter brings you his best direction and breathtaking camera work in this movie.(DVD purchased in 2004, watched every 3-4 months or so since, the last viewing earlier tonight).

But I will say this fans of methodically paced, beautifully shot, existentially rooted, and purely experiential cinema will not be disappointed. Paris, Texas is virtually my favorite movie, and a movie that, whether you like it or not, will leave some impact on you. It is a journey, an experience, an odyssey. Yes, it is long. Yes, it is slow. Defined plot points? Please.But what this movie does do is place into the mind of it's lead character. Travis Henderson, an older man, gruff and worn out with age, wanders out of the Texas desert after missing from his family for four years. He is mute, and apparently unaware of who he is. His brother Walt finds him, and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. The film then covers Travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. He reunites with his son, his sister in-law, and eventually, in a scene which I tear up just thinking about, his wife.But that is all I will divulge about his wife. That is a scene which you really have to see to believe. While this film really doesn't rely on plot, it does have structure and tone. And what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. We see the world as it should be seen a starkly beautiful, but uncompromising, place. The use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at. And then we get to performances. Everyone's great, so I will focus on our two truly main characters. Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a gentle, kind man, that, despite having personal demons, is a great fatherly figure (fine, maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life). And seeing Stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. And then we have Natassja Kinski, who plays Jane, his wife. She doesn't show up until the third act, and 95% percent of her performance takes place in one room. But Kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet, yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god, it's unbelievable. Stanton and Kinski have some of the best chemistry ever, which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room (see the movie...you'll understand). In the end, these two carry the movie on their backs, and do an amazing job doing it.You may not cry, but you will think about crying. You will think about all the sad moments in your life. And it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. Believe me, I know this from personal experience. This movie is almost therapeutic in the way. Because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing Travis's. So. What's more to say about Paris, Texas? It's a beautiful movie, one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story, and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. And what do I mean by 'Anti-Romance'?

His brother Walt finds him, and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. The film then covers Travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. He reunites with his son, his sister in-law, and eventually, in a scene which I tear up just thinking about, his wife.But that is all I will divulge about his wife. That is a scene which you really have to see to believe. While this film really doesn't rely on plot, it does have structure and tone. And what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. We see the world as it should be seen a starkly beautiful, but uncompromising, place. The use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at. And then we get to performances. Everyone's great, so I will focus on our two truly main characters. Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a gentle, kind man, that, despite having personal demons, is a great fatherly figure (fine, maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life). And seeing Stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. And then we have Natassja Kinski, who plays Jane, his wife. She doesn't show up until the third act, and 95% percent of her performance takes place in one room. But Kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet, yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god, it's unbelievable. Stanton and Kinski have some of the best chemistry ever, which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room (see the movie...you'll understand). In the end, these two carry the movie on their backs, and do an amazing job doing it.You may not cry, but you will think about crying. You will think about all the sad moments in your life. And it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. Believe me, I know this from personal experience. This movie is almost therapeutic in the way. Because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing Travis's. So. What's more to say about Paris, Texas? It's a beautiful movie, one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story, and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. And what do I mean by 'Anti-Romance'? It's not worth explaining here. See the movie, you'll understand.

Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching 84 Charring Cross Road have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of Conan the Barbarian is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book One Who Walked Alone).Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not behave as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this little movie is a buy-to-own keeper.

This film, in my opinion, took a steady improvement from the prequel. There's more action, excitement and wonder to it which is fantastic! The characters were all brilliant. Stuart and the bird are so adorable! Snowball the cat, well, from wanting to eat Stuart in the 1st movie, to being best friends in this sequel, I have to say it's all good. Also, I think the chemistry between them is really sweet because they embark on the adventure together, with no one else but them and there's a lot of friendship going on. Also it's great to see that Snowball always has Stuart's back like when the other cat in the restaurant wanted to eat him, he just stuck up for him.Stuart's personality has widened. He's not only the sweet and adorable mouse but in this movie, it shows his heroic instincts. This mainly approaches at the end of the movie, where re-fixes his old aeroplane and flies around New York to stop the Falcon and save Margalo. Which purifies his bravery and cleverness.In terms of animation-wise, it was good. Stuart and the bird looked believably realistic. However, my only negative point is The Falcon, who could have looked more in-this-world, it looked so computer-animated that it somewhat gave away it's evil instincts.Like I said, this sequel took a good improvement from the prequel. In this movie, there's a lot more plot and excitement to it, which scores on the fun factor. Stuart embarks on a mission to save his bird friend, Margalo meeting adventure along the way, I mean that's the sort of genre that keeps me on the edge of my seat.Overall, I would love to watch this movie again.

I had read some reviews from other users, and all of them were very positive, and everyone seemed to love this film. I was skeptical, because the whole idea of a cyborg battling another cyborg to save a boy, his mother, and humanity alike simply didn't appeal to me. In all honesty, it sounded like the type of movie you hear characters talking about in a Saturday morning cartoon. The Wachowski Brothers' first Matrix film is one of my all-time favorites, and it was roughly the same genre with a different concept. So naturally, that gave me the incentive to give T2 a chance.When I watched it, I was blown away. It wasn't your stereotypical one-guy-against-another-guy with humanity's fate on the line film. Yes, it easily qualifies as action-packed, but it also contains an interesting, somewhat complex story. Because of this, everything that happens in the film occurs for a reason. This wasn't made by a director that decided he wanted to throw bigtime action scenes just to get a cheap thrill from the audience *cough Michael Bay ***COUGH COUGH*** Arnold Schwartzenegger (Did I spell that right? Doubt it) plays a very likable, well-developed character as The Terminator. There are a few actors in the history of film-making that are absolutely perfectly-cast for their respective roles (i.e. Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction or Eli Wallach as Tuco in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly), and I am going to say that Big Arnie has cemented a spot for himself in that league of actors. The only other option to play Terminator that I can fathom would be Jean Claude Van Damme, but even he simply would not be able to supply the same fire as Arnold.Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are great supporting actors, and their performances also deserve mention. But as far as supporting actors in the film go, Robert Patrick takes the throne easily. He showed great range as he played the emotionless, cold-hearted cyborg known simply as T-1000.Overall, this a film with little flaws to talk about. It has great writing, superb acting, a few scattered funny moments, and of course, pulse-pounding action. I would even go out on a limb and place it in a tied position with Fight Club as the greatest guy film of all time.HASTA LA VISTA, BABY! -The Terminator ","genre":null},{"date":"18 October 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When I went into watching Terminator 2, I wasn't sure how high my expectations should be.

Basically three best friends in childhood get together and bury a box to open for a pact, they will open it at midnight the day they have graduated high school. Of course when they have grown up and are attending high school, Lucy Wagner (Razzie winning Britney Spears), Kit (Zoë Saldana) and Mimi (Taryn Manning) have parted ways, but they do keep their pact, opening the box and striking up a conversation. One of the girls says she plans to go to a record contract singing audition, so they decide to all go on a road trip together to get there, with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount) driving, and not much money. They suspect Ben killed someone and went to prison for it, but he straightens things out, and they earn some much needed money with Lucy singing. On the way to the audition, Lucy also visits mother Caroline (Kim Cattrall) who she hadn't seen for years, only to be told she was an accidental and originally unwanted child. Of course Lucy's father Pete (Dan Aykroyd) isn't happy with everything she has been up to, and tries to make sure she is back home, but in the end he lets her get on with her own thing, and they do reach the audition in the end.

McQueen was the typical good looking lead while Hoffman was part of the new wave of serious actors. Frankly this was all fluff and this film stands out as a example of popular reputations polluting a interesting subject for a film.Devils Island had been used by Hollywood as a setting in melodramatic plots not much unlike other prison films. Although his story is based on fact and has tried to bring some more gritty reality to the story, it is still a Hollywood formula film where the looking for respect actor but really movie star McQueen is paired with the a new wave (for the time) respectable actor but really movie star wannabe Dustin Hoffman to give it commercial appeal.McQueen's casting works somewhat he having a tough guy image but Hoffman's casting, again I think meant to make McQueen look good, looks sillier every day. He is just too light to be doing this part, a part someone like Edward G. Robinson would have been perfect for in his prime. Time and social changes has betrayed the phoniness of the late 60's Auteur directing and method acting as some kind of a religion school of thought. McQueen's movie star charisma has held up much better because it was a integral part of him.

From the opening moments with haunting music by Vangelis playing as we a dark and sinister vision of a future Los Angeles till its ending which I won't spoil here the story is beautifully presented with great pre-CGI special effects.As I'm sure everybody knows there are several versions of the film, my comments are based on the original UK release. This is a prime example of neo-noir cinema with its consistently dark setting, lots of smoking and Harrison Ford's world-weary voice over. Ford plays Deckard, a Blade Runner who's job is to hunt down artificial people known as replicants who used as off world slave labour but aren't permitted on Earth. A group of them have returned and are trying to find their creator. Initially we don't know why they have returned but soon learn that they were built to last only four years and as their time is running out they seek a way to fix themselves.In his pursuit of them he is sent to see the head of the Tyrell corporation, who had designed the replicants. Here Deckard is introduced to Tyrell's assistant Rachael who unbeknownst to her is also a replicant who has been implanted with false memories. When she learns what she is she seeks Deckard again to discover what he knows.When the film starts we know that Deckard is clearly the hero of the film and the replicants, lead by Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer are the villains but as the film progresses that idea becomes less certain. After all all they want is a life that isn't artificially shortened.The acting from Ford and Sean Young, as Rachael is very good but it is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as the enigmatic Batty, his finally speech is one of the great film speeches. I'd recommend this to all fans of science fiction, especially for people who like them set in a dystopian future.

His take on the re-animated dead person coming back to seek human victims idea is the inspiration for many similar films, but nobody has equaled this movie. He creates a very believable scenario for these average folks struggling for their lives against an ever-increasing army of blood-thirsty ghouls.

Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director Jacques Audiard's subtle, yet inspirational love story. Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film, and while the loves overpowered, it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind. Read My Lips is a drama. To be more precise, is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work. Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items &#x96; but it is more&#x85;much, much more. As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named Carla, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty. Audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid, causing an immediate unrest, not only from the characters within the film, but to those watching. Without sound, the world is left open to any possibility, and that is frightening.As we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life, we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet Paul (played exquisitely by Vincent Cassel), a slicked-back hair, mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison, homeless, jobless, and forced by his parole officer to get a job. This is how Carla and Paul meet. There is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction. The one where we think she loves him, but he is dark (and here is where it gets even more fun) &#x96; and where we think he loves her, but she is dark. The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown. Who, as viewers, are we to feel the most sympathy for? Paul sleeps in the office, Carla helps him; Carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker, Paul helps her; Carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for Paul. The continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair, waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave. It never does. Audiard cannot just allow this story to take place, he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next. Even our rock, our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing &#x96; a subplot to this film that at first angered me, but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film. Yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters. Devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking, as she changes her image for Paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered. Paul, the wildcard in the film, continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame. Then, just as we assume one, Carla takes on one last shape.Audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters. Cassel and Devos could just play cards the entire time and I would still be sitting at the end of my chair. The story, probably the weakest part of this film, is at first random. The interwoven stories seem unconnected at first, but Audiard lets them connect bit by bit. Again, the entire parole officer segment was tangent, but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means. Not attempting to sound vague, but this complex (yet utterly simple) story is difficult to explain. There is plenty happening, but it is up to you to connect the pieces. A favorite scene is when Carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held. That use of sound and scene was brilliant. It was tense, it was dramatic, and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes.Overall, I initially though this was a mediocre French film that I could easily forget about when it was over &#x96; I was proved wrong. Read My Lips opens the floor for discussion, not just with the characters, but the situations. One will find themselves rooting for Carla in one scene, and Paul in the next. When a discovery is made in Paul's apartment by Carla, I found myself deeply angry.

Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director Jacques Audiard's subtle, yet inspirational love story. Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film, and while the loves overpowered, it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind. Read My Lips is a drama. To be more precise, is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work. Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items &#x96; but it is more&#x85;much, much more. As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named Carla, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty. Audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid, causing an immediate unrest, not only from the characters within the film, but to those watching. Without sound, the world is left open to any possibility, and that is frightening.As we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life, we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet Paul (played exquisitely by Vincent Cassel), a slicked-back hair, mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison, homeless, jobless, and forced by his parole officer to get a job. This is how Carla and Paul meet. There is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction. The one where we think she loves him, but he is dark (and here is where it gets even more fun) &#x96; and where we think he loves her, but she is dark. The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown. Who, as viewers, are we to feel the most sympathy for? Paul sleeps in the office, Carla helps him; Carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker, Paul helps her; Carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for Paul.

I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it  he pointed out for my benefit that you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film. At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea  the rationalizing of murder by calling it business, not personal, which is appalling.I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets  the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in.

But several persons try to profit from this accident, playing it up as a racist act. To prove it wrong both police and the district attorney, as well as the media, go after Sherman with a vengeance. Suddenly Sherman's life crumbles and everyone just seems to be out for themselves. No one really cares for either Sherman or the young man that got hit.Comments I guess the intent is to show that what really runs the society today (or the early nineties at least) is money, power and fame. All concern and compassion anyone shows is just that, a show to profit for themselves. This leads to a glossy and superficial society which leads to glossy and superficially acting. And it annoys me. It is too much, and far over the top. I think that the message had been more powerful, and the movie better, if this had been balanced and tuned down more.A stellar cast, maybe not so famous when it was released, but by today's standard. A cast spearheaded by Hanks, Willis and Freeman, supported by Griffith, Cattrall, Rubinek and Dunn is worth seeing in itself. But I don't think they act up to their ability. Hanks wasn't a proved serious actor then, and didn't accomplish much with this. Willis has a rather small (but for the story important) role but was mostly added to help the movie at the box office with his name. Griffith, and Rubinek only annoys me. The only actor that don't disappoint is Freeman, and his role is limited. Actually, there seem to be a more interesting story behind the casting of the movie than the movie itself. Check the trivia. For example Uma Thurman was considered for the character of Maria Ruskin, I wish they would have cast her instead.A interesting story that is driven over the top with a great but underachieving cast. What's most impressive perhaps is that many of the stars in this movie, made almost 20 years ago now, is still top names in the industry.
