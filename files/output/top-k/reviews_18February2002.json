It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the Baby Mine song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of awws in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it!

This movie never gets boring!  A few people I know say the movie was too long.  I told them there was no way to fit all the details into the movie.  The characters were wonderful; the studios really found a gem in Orlando Bloom.  They couldn't have picked a better person for Aragorn.  He has the kingly appearance, but also that of a loner, or ranger.  I love they way Aragorn was so mysterious.  I felt a little bad for Sean Astin.  In order for him to get the role for Sam, he had to gain thirty pounds. Frodo was well picked too.  I've always thought Elijah Wood was really cute, and he played his part so well.One of the things I like most was the scene with Frodo and Arwen when they're riding to Rivendell.  The way Tolkien had it, Frodo was alone on the horse and an elf was telling it what to do.  I ride horses, and it is very difficult to jump and dodge around things.  It is impossible if you're not feeling 110%.  I mean, Frodo was practically dying, and people expect him to ride a horse alone?I cried every time Boromir died except the first.  The first time I was like  Serves him right.  He was an idiot anyway.  But then I saw it a second time, and I realized he wasn't a horrible person, he was just mislead and he wanted the best for his people.  He only wanted to save Gondor.  It was so touching I just cried, and then my friends laughed at me.Here's some more Book vs. Movie  In the book, everything goes very slowly, and Tolkien makes a big deal about how Frodo often wandered about the countryside alone.  But my question is, why did Frodo have to ask how far the nearest crossing was?  Tolkien never mentioned anything about Merry wandering around.  In the book, Frodo's thirty-three when he gets the ring, and he doesn't go on his journey until he's fifty.  It wasn't a snap-snap quick job either, everything was planned out.  I think this is one of the only cases where I liked the movie better than the book.The only criticism I have about this whole Lord of the Rings thing isn't even about the movie, it's about the soundtrack.  I love the violins playing when the words The Lord of the Rings comes on.  It's really beautiful. That tune is throughout the movie, when the scene comes on with Bilbo finding the ring, when they're rowing down the great river, and in a scene after that.

This movie never gets boring!  A few people I know say the movie was too long.  I told them there was no way to fit all the details into the movie.  The characters were wonderful; the studios really found a gem in Orlando Bloom.  They couldn't have picked a better person for Aragorn.  He has the kingly appearance, but also that of a loner, or ranger.  I love they way Aragorn was so mysterious.  I felt a little bad for Sean Astin.  In order for him to get the role for Sam, he had to gain thirty pounds. Frodo was well picked too.  I've always thought Elijah Wood was really cute, and he played his part so well.One of the things I like most was the scene with Frodo and Arwen when they're riding to Rivendell.  The way Tolkien had it, Frodo was alone on the horse and an elf was telling it what to do.  I ride horses, and it is very difficult to jump and dodge around things.  It is impossible if you're not feeling 110%.  I mean, Frodo was practically dying, and people expect him to ride a horse alone?I cried every time Boromir died except the first.  The first time I was like  Serves him right.  He was an idiot anyway.  But then I saw it a second time, and I realized he wasn't a horrible person, he was just mislead and he wanted the best for his people.  He only wanted to save Gondor.  It was so touching I just cried, and then my friends laughed at me.Here's some more Book vs. Movie  In the book, everything goes very slowly, and Tolkien makes a big deal about how Frodo often wandered about the countryside alone.  But my question is, why did Frodo have to ask how far the nearest crossing was?  Tolkien never mentioned anything about Merry wandering around.  In the book, Frodo's thirty-three when he gets the ring, and he doesn't go on his journey until he's fifty.  It wasn't a snap-snap quick job either, everything was planned out.  I think this is one of the only cases where I liked the movie better than the book.The only criticism I have about this whole Lord of the Rings thing isn't even about the movie, it's about the soundtrack.  I love the violins playing when the words The Lord of the Rings comes on.  It's really beautiful. That tune is throughout the movie, when the scene comes on with Bilbo finding the ring, when they're rowing down the great river, and in a scene after that.

However, if you are not close-minded and enjoy watching GOOD films, then this is for you.  I give the film an 8.5\/10.

I caught it on TMN in 1996, about a year after it's initial release.  I must say it was a depressing portrayal of mid-90s youth.  It's the type of movie that keeps you watching, but that's just to see how much worse it can get. However, after you watch it, you feel that you just wasted your time, and subjected yourself to kiddie porn.  Watching a documentary about rat infestation in New York would have been more entertaining. I found the movie was not an accurate portrayal of youth. I heard from a friend that teachers and guidance councillors were advocating teens to see this movie, and I thought what cheap drugs were they on?!  Sure, we have all known people like this, regardless if you were a teen in the '90s, '80s, '70s, or '60s.  Anyone with any brains would steer clear of these losers, regardless whether you're a kid or not.  The movie tended to glorify these kids, and paint a picture that all teens are like this.  What I saw were a bunch of over indulged brats with nothing better to do than inflict themselves on one another, and society. There was no character development, it just seemed to be a bunch of moron-clones drinking, fighting and getting laid. It makes the viewer not really care what happens to these kids. Along with this, the gritty atmosphere and porno style music just made this a movie that should be thrown in the discontinued bin.  To make matters worse, it's available on DVD! In conclusion, if you don't have anything better to watch, don't even waste your time with this movie.

Mulholland Drive is so weird. I can even say that this is the weirdest movie I've ever seen. It's totally a dream. Probably a nightmare. But a fascinating one. I didn't want the movie to finish at all. There's no sign of logic in this film. Of course, MD in comparison to Lost highway is more colorful and believable. Sometimes you try to figure out something, but before you get the point, something strange happens and tears all your realization apart.In my opinion, this movie doesn't have only one point, but so many. At one point, I suppose, the movie tries to show the darkest part of the human soul. An innocence, which turns to madness. Naomi watts who plays as ambitious Diane, came to Hollywood to become a movie star. A sex symbol Just like Rita Heyworth. But, everything appears to be different. Hollywood is not a place she happen to know. And somehow, she become desperate. I think that she were fallen in love with the director, But someone else(Rita played by Laura Harring), wins his heart. So, Diane neither succeeds in becoming a star nor winning the director's heart(and so many other things). Well, all her complexes appears as a dream. Maybe Rita is Diane's other self. Her second character. She envies Rita and undeliberately makes her, her other character just to revenge her. In another way, she's revenging herself. At this time, Diane's envy to Rita leads Rita to have sexual relationship with her. As a matter of fact, it's Diane who's making love to herself. With this undeliberate act, Diane avoids Rita to fall in love with the director and on the other hand, she satisfies her complexes. Of course, these were what I got from parts of the movie. There are many characters in this film which remain unknown to us.MD is full of vague things. Even if you understand most of the events and make sense out of them, there's many other things left to understand.  As a conclusion, we're confronting with human psyche. Mulholland Dr. is a deep social and psychological movie. David Lynch presents one of the most colorful, mysterious, surrealistic and artistic film in cinema history. Despite its weirdness and unlogical atmosphere, you can not stop watching it. The sex scene of the film is one of the greatest sex scenes I've ever seen. This scene is so emotional. Just look at the way the kiss each other. As the last word, It's an impressive movie, don't miss it. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 February 2002","score":"","review":"  Wow!
