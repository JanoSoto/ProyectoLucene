The good is that  , well, first of all, the cinematography is nothing less than amazing, feeling like a series of cutting edge paintings. For example, all the dark passage ways utilized really do seem scary and mysterious, the extended shot of the pipework is art at its finest, and the dream sequences are some of the most disturbing ever committed to film. Otherwise, the film has all around excellent acting (Hopkins as Dr. Treves is especially memorable, presenting the character as a gentle but realistic hero with self conscious doubts about his own virtues) and no punches are pulled in presenting the deformed main character being abused or making others feel uneasy. Indeed, in most of the scenes where Merrick tries to interact with people in a normal way, you can just sense how awkward the normal characters feel in spite of trying to act like his deformity does not matter. And when he gets bullied, he REALLY gets bullied (you´ll probably cheer when Dr.  Treves gives the abusive hospital worker a serious a-kicking in return). Otherwise, though, the problem with the movie is that Merrick is not really a well fleshed out character (no pun intended). The basic recipe for him is take a deformed person and make him stereotypically innocent and slightly socially retarded to show how isolated he was. John Hurt conveys this quality well under a heavy makeup job but that´s pretty much the beginning and end of the character. Also, David Lynch, being David Lynch, usually focuses on getting the most violent shock value, absurdity, surrealist weirdness, or odd awkwardness out of most scenes. Plus, 1940s style melodrama and Eraserhead style surrealism, as good as they are on their own terms, are uncomfortably combined here. Hence, it sometimes even feels as if Lynch is making fun of the screenplay. All in all, though, it´s worth a look if you want to see something different.

And what a huge disappointment -  this coming from someone who really *liked* 'Snake Eyes'..  DTK is a film punctuated by bad acting and over blown gestures which, while striking in themselves, are left stranded by a plot as thin and with more holes in it than Bruce Willis' vest in 'Die Hard'. The Big Mystery of who, and what, the killer is, is telegraphed relentlessly. Each time psychiatrist Caine hears of another development in the case, it seems, he is prompted by inner demons (or directorial nervousness at the self-written plot) to pause ominously and glimpse his own reflection in a handy mirror, with dire anticipation. At one point he even bumps into the mirror before the requisite meaningful glimpse. This, together with a heavy handed play on the transexualism theme, is almost laughable by the end. De Palma's funereal pace sometimes hinders rather than helps the suspense, especially as sometimes his montage work and timing work against, rather than with, each other..  Angie Dickinson is fine, although a body double was obviously employed for the opening, over-salacious nude shower scene. (Soapy , ginger pubes do not of terror make.)  Her discovery of the worrying medical report immediately after enjoying guiltless sex is truly groan-worthy, but one presumes that, as usual, women who enjoy themselves should be be punished immediately afterwards. Even after the murderer is caught, and I thought it time to put the cat out, a pointless dream coda dragged out matters quite unconvincingly, set in a mental hospital like one I never imagined likely.Some good scenes; the art gallery encounter being a standout (although even here credulity was strained) as well as the stalking on the subway. And it is always great to see the rotascope used on the wide screen. A lot of the atmosphere is sabotaged by Donaggio's over emphatic music - a clear case of less being more, IMHO. Nancy Allen's acting is B-A-A-D, which leads one to suspect that De Palma was more concerned with camera placement at the time than with effective voice coaching. Caine affects to lose his well known accent, and sounds a tad mannered and bland because of it.  If there are those who doubt the skills of Argento in martialing similar material, of making the dreamlike and irrational something actually frightening, then this overrated film would be a prime exhibit in the case.

Particularly in the early sections where Turner has just been transported back. Back indeed to that staple era of American idealistic nostalgia; the 1950s... or more accurately, 1960, still effectively the 1950s in terms of culture and music, for example, but with Kennedy on the horizon.We are presented by Coppola (big time player in U.S. film, turned oddly to smaller fry since 1979...) with a view of the picket fence securities of this America nearly as tempered by nostalgia as so many other films depicting this era. A shame we don't perhaps get more of the music... doo-wop and the likes of Dion, as that stuff is sublime.Certain elements are glossed over and presented a little too easily and predictably; the 'beatnik' figure, Michael Fitzsimmons, played by Kevin J. O'Connor, is involved in some fair but overdone scenes with Turner; trying to convey the subculture with an archetype. It is almost played as comedy, which is a little smug with its 1980s hindsight (who wants that?).The acting is fairly competent overall; the problem of having the same performers playing both ages younger and older does arise. Principally with Ms. Turner's problematic central role of Peggy Sue. She does not really look 18 or 43, but in both parts pretty much the thirty she was when the film was made. There is little effort made with make-up to convey this; and there is thus a credibility problem with this rather mature 'teen' going around uncommented upon in the 1960 sequences. It may be a niggle, but it is a tangible one I feel. Kathleen Turner is very good however in portraying this difficult part; in conveying the emotions and mind set of such a person, thrust into a real _Twilight Zone_ situation. It's perhaps a shame there's not more depth given to the present-day part of the film, in able for one to get to know Peggy better. I've not seen many of Turner's films, but I gather she is one of the most impressive of 1980s leading ladies; there's certainly scope here to applaud her performance in a role that could have gone badly wrong. That brings me very nicely onto Nicolas Cage and his Charlie Boy character. Put simply; a misfiring piece of acting and conception. The part is farcically cliched; the wide-eyed, joking, common guy turned 'heart-throb' of small American towns in the mythologised, eulogized 1950s era. An air of total absurdity is added by Cage's adopting a grating, ludicrous voice; that itself should render the character a laughing stock. Turner is well and truly 'too good' for this buffoon; a teenager who is meant to be charming, folksy and endearing, yet who just plain annoys.Oh, and I didn't notice Jim Carrey at all; only found out he was in it through this site. _Peggy Sue Got Married_ is a very pleasant little film, but it is too little, one can't but help feel. The potential was there with this scenario to make a magnificent film, yet the 'fairly good' quality is settled for. Tricks are missed, gags are passed up... too much time focusing on that bloody Charlie character. Something more radical, with Turner really deciding to change her destiny would have interested me more. One hell of a dark film could have been made with the implications of this plot - time travel is so ill-served by films, generally. It's a shame Turner is never really tested and prone to major dramatic or comic conflict in the film. There are moments and scenes that are well thought of in this way - some of the stuff with the 'lovable nerd' type played by Barry Miller, the odd bit of Turner cheating with her foreknowledge of events - but really not enough stuff central to the film. Having the farcical (but not entirely played as such) scenes of the time travel 'lodge' end up in absurd failure and then black comedy, as Turner realises she is stuck in the time, to live out her life again, would have been *far better*.As I say, this film missed numerous tricks. But indeed as failures go, it is a very passable viewing experience, besides the cringeworthy nature of Cage. It is good to watch a mainstream film that has a non-usual plot (well, post-_Back to the Future_) and genre. Yet, the genre is too subordinated to the earnestly romantic comedic (I use that word very loosely). This film could do with less of the traditional and more of the surprising. _Peggy Sue_ is enjoyable, if predictable viewing, that leaves one in mind of its missed chances and yet there one is given to a lingering favourable impression of the thing.Rating- *** 1\/2\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2002","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I rather took to this film, in a way.

I don't know why Harry and Peter were hanging out together because in the movie I could clearly see that they really didn't like each other too much, but in the comic they were two peas in a pod. Peter's character should had been more like MTV's Daria\/Chandler on Friends.  He wasn't funny at all in this movie and that made Peter stand out as a character other than he being the only normal\/down to earth superhero in comicbook land (Standing Ovation to Stan Lee).

It's time to announce the Best Foreign Film of the Year. And the Oscar goes to... No Man's Land? I'm speechless. But, then again, I should have seen it coming a mile away. After all, almost every film on my top-ten list of the year -- Memento, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, and The Man Who Wasn't There -- had either been completely ignored by the Academy or over-shadowed by a more politically correct competitor. The same went for Amelie, which is undoubtedly the best foreign film in years and one of my all-time favorites. I skimmed over a review of Amelie on Amazon.com and, if I recall correctly, the author responsible for it had described it as a French cartoon. For some this may seem accurate. But in my humble opinion, Amelie is far more emotional than the over-hyped No Man's Land could ever dream of being. Perhaps I'm saying this because I can relate so well to the title character, or maybe it's because I can't stand to watch an actress as loveable as Audrey Tautou cry. But regardless what it is, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius (even though I'm still trying to figure out how he could have been the same guy responsible for Alien Resurrection). In Amelie he has crafted a beautiful, humorous, and extremely romantic story that truly qualified for its Best Screenplay nomination (although Memento was the only one good enough to actually deserve winning it). The acting is excellent -- as well as the direction -- but the real magic of Amelie lies in the soundtrack. Combining accordions, harmonicas, and strings, Yann Tiersen crafted one of the most unique and marvelous scores I've ever heard. As for the cinematography, while some may be irritated by the amount of green in the picture, I felt it was a perfect compliment to the film's mood. To sum it up in just a few words -- if this is at all possible -- I cannot describe how much I love this movie, except to say that I'm happy to love it as much as I do. And not many people can say that about anything.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's Oscar night I watch the television attentively, knowing that every award is going to be a disappointment, but praying for a miracle.
