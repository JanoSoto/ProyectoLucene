Was that her arm that she raised were her finger is cut off, and the cop gasps Terry, shes still alive...?For one, this movie doesnt evaluate its plot. Sure, it starts off well and good.

Jungle Fever is no different.  The film is multi-faceted and does not follow one story line but follows the lives of all kinds of different people who are related to each other or know each other somehow.Spike Lee plays Flipper Purify, a black architect who has a nice family and a good job living in Harlem.  He loves to his family and seems to have his like made for him.  Annabella Sciorra plays Angie Tucci, and Italian-American who is recently hired as Flipper's secretary against Flipper's wishes of hiring a white person when he wanted someone black to be his secretary.  She comes from working class Bensonhurst, in Brooklyn and is living with his father and two brothers.  She is under-appreciated for all the work she does around the house.Now here is where the major conflict of the film comes into play  The two people have an affair.  Nothing may have happened with their personal lives but then they told a friend or two and then their friends tell a friend or two and you know.SPOILERThe two families react differently.  The father of Angie attacks her violently.  The wife of Flipper throws all of her husband's stuff out of the window.  Both families make a scene where their neighborhoods know what happen.  What I like about this part of the movie is that there are people that do not approve of the relationship but not all of their friends and family reject them.  The movie shows a relatively open environment but with the standard racism prevalent in New York City.Now if you think this is a movie and that people in New York are not this racist, race is still an issue in New York City.  People will react exactly the way they do in this movie to the mere mention of interracial dating. And while this movie is older now not much has changed in the terms of racial issues.The supporting cast does an excellent job.  The two notable stars are Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry.  Jackson plays Flipper's drug addicted brother. Halle Berry plays his girlfriend.  This pair does an excellent job.  They are gritty and they are excellent in their parts.  They are extremely convincing.  I knew some people who had similar problems that acted a lot like these two characters.Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee will astound you in their parts.  Ossie Davis has an incredible monologue that is just too much for mainstream film, and his monologue makes a couple of interesting points.  Again what this movie talks about is too much for mainstream films.  Ossie plays The Good Reverend Doctor Purify, the father of Flipper.  He calls him The Good Reverend Doctor.  The Good Reverend Doctor is extremely religious and I emphasize the word extreme.  Ruby Dee is a caring but naïve mother who doesn't quite understand what Flipper's brother is doing to hurt him.  The final scene with the parents and the brother will shock the hell out of you.  The scene will also show you some of the extreme nature some people of faith take their religion.John Turturro does a standout job as the ex-boyfriend of Angie who is stuck in a bad job around a group of pricks that are racist, mean and very provincial.  Turturro plays a decent and laid back man who is a nice guy but is in a bad situation (like a lot of people I guess)  Turturro does an excellent job.  The people that play his 'friends' Michael Badalucco, (who plays a real a**hole) Joe D'Onofrio and others do a great job in their parts.  That is an excellent aspect of the movie as well.Legendary actor Anthony Quinn has an excellent role as well, but he should have been in the movie more.  That is the thing about this movie there are a lot of people in this movie that are fairly famous but have a small part. Tim Robbins and Brad Dourif are in this movie for a short time as well.SPOILER (rest of review)One of the best scenes in the movie is when Wesley Snipes looks for his mother's TV set after Samuel L. Jackson took it.  What ensues is Snipes going through the crime-ridden streets of New York City and ending up in the Bronx in the 'Taj Mahal.'  It is an amazing look into a world that few of us in middle class America know about.  However I know that if Snipes were that well dressed going through the areas that he did he would have been accosted.I also did not like Lee's message.  Lee essentially said that interracial marriages were results of curiosity and hinted strongly that two people of different races could not fall in love.  I wish Lee would be more optimistic.  I do realize however that interracial dating is still not accepted in supposedly progressive America.  This country has along way to go.The political conversation John Turturro has with the people that hang out in the ice cream shop is quite disturbing.  The conversations they have are quite disturbing but they give you an insight into American culture that few American films have.  They discuss quite a few topics and Lee manages to produce a realistic conversation without the conversation becoming stiff or preachy.It is amazing to see Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry, in what are perhaps their breakthrough roles.  They both do great jobs and they show their talents as thespians.  Also the opening credits are quite unique, an interesting way of showing the people involved in the film.  Also listen for Stevie Wonder's hit Jungle Fever, where the phrase was coined in popular culture.This is a great movie.  There are some interesting points this movie brings up.  Lee talks about the things many other films do not talk about.  Lee manages to write produce and star in a movie that is not great but definitely is very good and something I would recommend.  All around a good, disturbing, revealing and funny movie.  Here's to Spike Lee.

Jackson and Halle Berry, in what are perhaps their breakthrough roles.  They both do great jobs and they show their talents as thespians.  Also the opening credits are quite unique, an interesting way of showing the people involved in the film.  Also listen for Stevie Wonder's hit Jungle Fever, where the phrase was coined in popular culture.This is a great movie.  There are some interesting points this movie brings up.  Lee talks about the things many other films do not talk about.  Lee manages to write produce and star in a movie that is not great but definitely is very good and something I would recommend.  All around a good, disturbing, revealing and funny movie.  Here's to Spike Lee.

Hey, that's the impression the trailer left me with people running and screaming, boarding up the house, stalked by someone, flashlights flickering and strange signs in the crops... A perfect thriller, I thought!I couldn't be more wrong, it seems. The movie is NOTHING like the thriller. In fact, the thriller covers more or less the first half of the movie... The only half that is somewhat interesting. No spoilers here, really the trailer reveals that it is a movie about (probably) aliens making strange markings in the fields, and stalking people, who run away screaming. And yes, that's what the first half is... but then it only gets worse.All the suspense is lost, and the whole what are the aliens, if it's aliens, up to? affair is turned into a big pro-religious pile of moral issues. The main hero is an ex-priest, and the whole second half of the movie is about how he realizes that what happens around him cannot possibly be a pure concidence, and that perhaps he should return to the faith. AND THAT'S IT! The aliens cease to be important anymore; the mystery is gone, the suspense is gone, and the whole danger disappears within the last moments of the movie. The only thing that remains important is how the ex-priest questions his faith (or non-faith). Why put aliens in there? Why the cropsigns?? Okay, so he lost his wife in a car accident - this isn't much of a spoiler, it's shown in the first 10 minutes of the movie. So he lost his faith when she died, okay, a nice movie beginning. So something happens that makes him rethink his views... But why market it as a mystery thriller with aliens in it!?In a nutshell - plotholes big enough for the starship Enterprise to fly through. - storyline... WHAT storyline? Summarizeable in two-three sentences. And left completely unexplained (or very badly explained, for that matter). - religious messages cheap and cheesy. Good religious doubts were in End of Days, in Stigmata, NOT in here at all! Here, religion=good, atheism=bad, plain and simple. - acting... not bad, but only Gibson matters, the other actors are just in the background, far far away.*** BIG SPOILER  the movie summarized! ***First, we have strange cropsigns, all over the world, and radio appliances emit strange noises. Enter the aliens they come in ships and hover over cities. Part three, aliens come to hunt people, Gibson with his family hides in the basement. Part four, the invasion is aborted and the aliens leave, defeated with... water. So Gibson fights one horrifyingly stupid alien and returns to being a priest, deciding that it's all a sign from God, more or less. END OF MOVIE.*** Spoilers end ***I think I'm going to re-watch The Return of the Living Dead 2 tonight, for a change. Crap, low-budget and b-class, but better effects, better acting, less plotholes.
