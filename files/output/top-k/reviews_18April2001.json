Midichlorians? Jar Jar? Immaculate Conception of Anakin? Preposterous? While some people may find these things, as well as other minor things unacceptable in the Star Wars Universe, I beg to differ. Let me address some issues the best I can and tell TPM hatemongers why I think they ARE in fact acceptable in the Star Wars universe.1) Jar Jar Binks - Every Episode I review has something about Jar Jar in it, so here's my two sense(pun intended). Basically, people found Jar Jar to be annoying, stupid, a terrible addition to the Star Wars saga, etc. I agree that he's annoying and stupid, but not a terrible addition. Like I just said, I agree that he's annoying and stupid. But he's supposed to be. Haven't YOU met anyone like Jar Jar before? I certainly have. The personality of Jar Jar resides in most kids that I know. Kids can ALSO be annoying, stupid, clumsy, and get into trouble a lot. They're just like Jar Jar. But do we hate kids? Nope. We punish them for their actions sometimes, but we all get over it and love them for who they are. So no wonder kids can relate to him! Out of all of my kid cousins that live locally, they all liked Jar Jar. It's because they can relate. Jar Jar was supposed to have a child-like innocence to him. If you didn't catch that, watch the movie again.However, most people who are between the ages of 13 and 25 usually don't relate to him. I don't relate to him either. But yet, they like C-3P0. This has always puzzled me. But I think I've come to a sensible conclusion.Let's think about this a bit. 3P0 is annoying too. What about all those stupid statistics that he gave them, making the situations they were in much less hopeful? This makes everyone unhappy and annoyed with him. Or what about the time he wandered away from the group, and got shot?! Chewy had to repair him and carry him around on his back for half of the movie! Such an annoying inconvenience! And he was always whining about something. Now why don't people get annoyed by him? It's simply because they grew up with him, and he's apart of what started it all. He's nostalgic. Most people who complain about Jar Jar are the people who saw the trilogy as a kid. Guess what? When kids see 3P0, they see a cool robot. However, later on they see a whiny, annoying inconvenience. And yet, they still like him. Why? It's because he's apart of their treasured childhood. He's something they liked as a kid, and therefore they continue to like him, even though they realize the way he is. There's nothing wrong with this, it's just that these people don't realze that just as the kids of yesterday that grew up with 3P0 still like him despite his annoying antics, the kids of today that grow up liking Jar Jar will do the same thing for him.Lastly, Jar Jar served more of a purpose to this movie than 3P0 did to any of the movies. All 3P0 did was alert the gang of the Stormtroopers' presence(which was only because Chewy was in the process of repairing him when this blurb spirted out), and get the Ewoks to side with the good guys. Other then these two things, he did nothing but get in the way. Gee, doesn't this sound a lot like Jar Jar? Now, did Jar Jar not help the two separate societies on Naboo unite? Of course he did. Did he not become General of the Gungan army? Of course he did. So what if he's clumsy, annoying, and is always getting into trouble? These actions only help display why no one in the movie likes him, and why he was banished from Otoh Gunga(the underwater city). I mean, why would a society banish someone because they were clumsy? Because of all his stupid antics, I understood why.So what's the big deal? Jar Jar is just like little kids. Jar Jar is annoying like 3P0. It's just that the kids of yesterday still like 3P0 today because they grew up with him. He's nostalgic. Without R2-D2, 3P0 is nothing. However, Jar Jar was able to unite two societies without the help of a cool sidekick, and despite his clumsiness. I'd say this, as well as the fact that he's just like little kids, makes him someone we should accept and respect. Treat Jar Jar just as you would a kid, and things will take a turn for the better. Treat Jar Jar as you would 3P0 and the same will happen.2) Midi-chlorians - What's the big deal? They take away from the mysticism of the force? I think not. They only emphasize the mysticism. They are sentient beings that reside within us. WITHIN our cells. Now this may sound scientific, and it may very well be. But guess what? The Force CREATES the midis. Life cannot exist without them, and they cannot exist without life. They are not the force. They don't create the force. We are only symbionts with them, lifeforms living together for mutual advantage. They only tell us the will of the force. So what if they work together with the force? The force is still the same mystical entity that we've all come to know and love. It's just that now we know where life comes from - at least this is what the Jedi believe at this moment in time. They have yet to explain why the midi-chlorians aren't mentioned in the original trilogy. Perhaps because trying to explain their faith with science made it no longer a faith. Maybe trying to define their religion with science is what aided in bringing about their ultimate demise. There faith could've in fact be weakened because of their scientific reasoning. Who knows? The next two episodes have yet to elaborate on this, and so we don't fully know the story behind the midi-chlorians.  And this is why people shouldn't criticize this concept.3) The immaculate conception - Ok, a lot of people were bothered by this. While I will agree that this is somewhat of a poor explanation of why Anakin is so powerful with the force, I don't think that it's a bad idea. We saw that when Anakin destroyed the Neimoidian ship, it looked like an accident. When in fact, this was the will of the force that he blew it up. The force used him(I'll get back to this later). So it could be that because he's the chosen one, things work out to his advantage because he obviously has to bring balance to the force eventually(by doing away with Emperor Palpatine in ROTJ). So up until that time, he has to stay alive. And since the force is seeking balance, it's going to keep its chosen one alive. This means that most everything will work to his advantage. So it could be that he'll realize this, developing a big ego trip that aids in his turn to the dark side. This won't be the only reason he turns, but it could definitely have something to do with it.Also, people think that because the force used him, rather than him using the force, made it less dramatic. I agree that it's less dramatic. But it's also an important element of how Luke goes the other way and he uses the force. It's something that his dad(Anakin) didn't have enough experience in. His dad just assumed that the force would work to his advantage, therefore not concentrating enough on using the force. Luke redeems what his father should have redeemed. This only helps explain even better why Anakin turns to the dark side. Plus, Anakin wouldn't know where the Neimoidians main reactor was to begin with.So I don't think him being immaculately conceived is a bad idea. Many people in today's society, as well as societies long before us, believed that Jesus was immaculately conceived. So if people can accept His conception as reality, why can't people accept Anakin's conception in a make-believe universe?4) The will of the force - Ok, people are asking, What the heck is up with this will of the force thing? Let me tell you. Here's what I think. I think that the will of the force is ultimately good. It's seeking balance, right? Balance is good. Therefore the will of the force is good.But then, there's the dark side. So if there are two sides to the force, how can it have one will? It's because it's like the yin and the yang. It's an entity that's seeking balance, therefore it has one will. So why does the force allow the dark side to take over? Both sides are very powerful, but it's still seeking balance. It's for the same reason why God allows bad things to happen to good people. We don't quite know the answer, but Christians trust that it's God's will that it happened so that eventually things work out for the better in His eyes. One cannot fully comprehend something that's beyond our comprehension, like God for instance. So the same goes for the force. Don't try to fully comprehend something like this. That's ludicrous.So basically, I think that in the time of TPM, the force IS balanced. The good side and the dark side are both equally doing the same thing - coexisting. But then, the sith emerge, Palpatine becomes emperor and creates his evil empire, and the Jedi are pretty much eliminated. But then, by the end of ROTJ, Vader brings an end to the Emperor, turns back to the good side, and the empire is destroyed, bringing balance back to the force.5) How you become a Jedi - So we see from The Phantom Menace that the way you become a Jedi is if you have a high midi-chlorian count. People complain and complain about this, and yet it's totally plausible that this is really the only efficient way to have very young kids train to become Jedi.Let's play a little make-believe game. Imagine a kid of let's say 5 years old going up to his\/her mom and asking, Mommy, can I go off to the Jedi temple on Coruscant and train to become a Jedi? Do you really think that a parent would just let their kid leave the house at the age of 5 to train to become a Jedi Knight? Do you really think that a 5 year old kid is going to be able to make an intellegent decision about the rest of his\/her life? I don't think so. But because of the midi-chlorians, Jedi can identify the kids as jedi-potentials, and the kids' parents wouldn't question it. They'll accept it as destiny.I know I know, George Lucas didn't have to write the story this way. But we already know that even Luke was too old at his age in the trilogy to train as a Jedi. So if HE was too old, then before TPM cam out, we can conclude that you still had to be pretty young to train. So if you had to be younger than Luke was(Luke wasn't old at all), then we can feel safe to conclude that one even as young as around 16 or 17 can't make such an important decision about his\/her life intellegently. So the midi-chlorians make sense.But then this indicates genetic superiority like the arian race. No it doesn't. Think about it. What is genetics? It deals with DNA. The midi-chlorians are not DNA(life cannot exist without the midis, and the midis cannot exist without life), but are not the DNA itself. So yes, it's superiority, but not genetic superiority.  The midis are a blessing given by the Force to certain individuals. And the people of this galaxy far, far away accept this as inevitable. Only the people who are born to become Jedi are perhaps the only ones who really see this as something they'd want to do with their lives.It has always seemed to me that becoming a Jedi was all about destiny. If you take a look at all the movies, you can see that it was Luke's destiny that he was to become a Jedi. And why would Yoda say There is anotherhope for the alliance? It's because he already knew that Leia was a Jedi potential, or at least someone who has the potential to be strong enough with the force to be able to bring hope to the galaxy. How can one know this if midi-chlorians don't exist? It has been said that the force runs strong in the family of the Skywalkers. It can only run strong if it was the will of the force for it to make it so. And it all started with Anakin's immaculate conception by the midi-chlorians.6) The Plot - If anyone says that the plot was boring or stupid, they are only stupid themselves. If one doesn't realize that Senator Palpatine was the main character of this movie, then TPM went completely over their heads. Darth Sidious, Darth Maul's master, is the same person as Palpatine. Senator Palpatine is really the Sith Lord we see in the Old Trilogy who we all know as The Emperor.  If you figure this out, then suddenly the plot becomes much more interesting. What is going on is that Palpatine eventually becomes the Emperor and creates an evil Empire by rising up in political power. He does so by deceit and manipulation. And what a better way of doing this then by playing both the good side and the bad like pawns in a chess game, setting each piece where he wants in order to eventually be elected Chancellor, which in turn will enable him to backstab the Jedi and the Republic however he pleases. He then will declare himself Emperor and develop the evil Empire that we see in full effect in the original trilogy.So why is this a dumb plot? I think it's done well. All along, it's Palpatine who's manipulating everything that's going on in the movie, and no one knows it. And because of his manipulations, he becomes elected chancellor by the end of the movie. In The Phantom Menace, the bad guy wins, and no one knows it. I think that's awesome. And this is a perfect set up for what's yet to come.Oh, and for that idiot who said the Trade Federation was the Phantom Menace, think again. Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious is The Phantom Menace. Just look at all that he's done in the shadows. He's the biggest menace of them all, with all his deceit and manipulation that went completely over peoples' heads. And Lucasfilm has confirmed that he's The Phantom Menace anyways. The title of this movie was named after the main character - Palpatine\/Sidious(the future Emperor).7) Darth Maul - People thought that it was just stupid that he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes. I don't. He's a throw away character. Sure, Lucas could've written it some other way so that Maul had more screen time. But why is the way he wrote it a bad thing? I look at Maul as I do Boba Fett - a cool, but insignificant character. The fact that he got killed was only to stress the fact that the Sith work in pairs, and that because he's killed, Sidious will automatically search for another sith apprentice. In Episode II, he'll have another one, and then he\/she will be killed as well. So gee, can you guess who'll finally become Palpatine's apprentice?Sure, Lucas could've written it so that Maul lasts through Episode II, and had more screen time in Episode I, but it's not necessary. It works just as well, if not better, the way Lucas has written it. And in the end, it stresses that Sidious\/Palpatine really is the main villain.Conclusion -All in all, I think Lucas, and the people at Lucasfilm did a good job at making this beginning chapter of the Star Wars saga a good movie. I mean, when one opens a six chapter book, and reads the first chapter, and then reads the end, it makes the first chapter look dull. When people first saw the Old Trilogy, they were thrown into this galactic battle of a rebellion against a massive evil Empire. Everything is already established. However, with Episode I, these things haven't happened yet, therefore it makes it appear less exciting. But is any first chapter of a book more exciting than the climax(episodes IV-VI)? I don't think so.  Even so, The Phantom Menace still seemed as intriguing to me as any Old Trilogy movie.  It's just that it's the beginning, and so it's not just about good VS evil like the other ones, but HOW the good and evil came to be.  And THAT, to me was interesting. Episode I was only meant to set us up for the next two movies, and to introduce the characters. Nothing more.  And one should not expect anything more than that when watching this movie.As for the things like the special effects, the acting, etc., it's merely subjective. In fact, the whole subject of whether or not TPM was a good Star Wars movie depends on the individual. It's just that some things such as the things I listed above, are inexcusable. The people who have a problem with the 7 things I listed above just have a serious problem with themselves.No, I'm not a Lucas or Star Wars gusher. I merely think that in this case, Lucas did a good job with the introduction to the biggest Sci-fi saga of all time.

I'd say this, as well as the fact that he's just like little kids, makes him someone we should accept and respect. Treat Jar Jar just as you would a kid, and things will take a turn for the better. Treat Jar Jar as you would 3P0 and the same will happen.2) Midi-chlorians - What's the big deal? They take away from the mysticism of the force? I think not. They only emphasize the mysticism. They are sentient beings that reside within us. WITHIN our cells. Now this may sound scientific, and it may very well be. But guess what? The Force CREATES the midis. Life cannot exist without them, and they cannot exist without life. They are not the force. They don't create the force. We are only symbionts with them, lifeforms living together for mutual advantage. They only tell us the will of the force. So what if they work together with the force? The force is still the same mystical entity that we've all come to know and love. It's just that now we know where life comes from - at least this is what the Jedi believe at this moment in time. They have yet to explain why the midi-chlorians aren't mentioned in the original trilogy. Perhaps because trying to explain their faith with science made it no longer a faith. Maybe trying to define their religion with science is what aided in bringing about their ultimate demise. There faith could've in fact be weakened because of their scientific reasoning. Who knows? The next two episodes have yet to elaborate on this, and so we don't fully know the story behind the midi-chlorians.  And this is why people shouldn't criticize this concept.3) The immaculate conception - Ok, a lot of people were bothered by this. While I will agree that this is somewhat of a poor explanation of why Anakin is so powerful with the force, I don't think that it's a bad idea. We saw that when Anakin destroyed the Neimoidian ship, it looked like an accident. When in fact, this was the will of the force that he blew it up. The force used him(I'll get back to this later). So it could be that because he's the chosen one, things work out to his advantage because he obviously has to bring balance to the force eventually(by doing away with Emperor Palpatine in ROTJ). So up until that time, he has to stay alive. And since the force is seeking balance, it's going to keep its chosen one alive. This means that most everything will work to his advantage. So it could be that he'll realize this, developing a big ego trip that aids in his turn to the dark side. This won't be the only reason he turns, but it could definitely have something to do with it.Also, people think that because the force used him, rather than him using the force, made it less dramatic. I agree that it's less dramatic. But it's also an important element of how Luke goes the other way and he uses the force. It's something that his dad(Anakin) didn't have enough experience in. His dad just assumed that the force would work to his advantage, therefore not concentrating enough on using the force. Luke redeems what his father should have redeemed. This only helps explain even better why Anakin turns to the dark side. Plus, Anakin wouldn't know where the Neimoidians main reactor was to begin with.So I don't think him being immaculately conceived is a bad idea. Many people in today's society, as well as societies long before us, believed that Jesus was immaculately conceived. So if people can accept His conception as reality, why can't people accept Anakin's conception in a make-believe universe?4) The will of the force - Ok, people are asking, What the heck is up with this will of the force thing? Let me tell you. Here's what I think. I think that the will of the force is ultimately good. It's seeking balance, right? Balance is good. Therefore the will of the force is good.But then, there's the dark side. So if there are two sides to the force, how can it have one will? It's because it's like the yin and the yang. It's an entity that's seeking balance, therefore it has one will. So why does the force allow the dark side to take over? Both sides are very powerful, but it's still seeking balance. It's for the same reason why God allows bad things to happen to good people. We don't quite know the answer, but Christians trust that it's God's will that it happened so that eventually things work out for the better in His eyes. One cannot fully comprehend something that's beyond our comprehension, like God for instance. So the same goes for the force. Don't try to fully comprehend something like this. That's ludicrous.So basically, I think that in the time of TPM, the force IS balanced. The good side and the dark side are both equally doing the same thing - coexisting. But then, the sith emerge, Palpatine becomes emperor and creates his evil empire, and the Jedi are pretty much eliminated. But then, by the end of ROTJ, Vader brings an end to the Emperor, turns back to the good side, and the empire is destroyed, bringing balance back to the force.5) How you become a Jedi - So we see from The Phantom Menace that the way you become a Jedi is if you have a high midi-chlorian count. People complain and complain about this, and yet it's totally plausible that this is really the only efficient way to have very young kids train to become Jedi.Let's play a little make-believe game. Imagine a kid of let's say 5 years old going up to his\/her mom and asking, Mommy, can I go off to the Jedi temple on Coruscant and train to become a Jedi? Do you really think that a parent would just let their kid leave the house at the age of 5 to train to become a Jedi Knight? Do you really think that a 5 year old kid is going to be able to make an intellegent decision about the rest of his\/her life? I don't think so. But because of the midi-chlorians, Jedi can identify the kids as jedi-potentials, and the kids' parents wouldn't question it. They'll accept it as destiny.I know I know, George Lucas didn't have to write the story this way. But we already know that even Luke was too old at his age in the trilogy to train as a Jedi. So if HE was too old, then before TPM cam out, we can conclude that you still had to be pretty young to train. So if you had to be younger than Luke was(Luke wasn't old at all), then we can feel safe to conclude that one even as young as around 16 or 17 can't make such an important decision about his\/her life intellegently. So the midi-chlorians make sense.But then this indicates genetic superiority like the arian race. No it doesn't. Think about it. What is genetics? It deals with DNA. The midi-chlorians are not DNA(life cannot exist without the midis, and the midis cannot exist without life), but are not the DNA itself. So yes, it's superiority, but not genetic superiority.  The midis are a blessing given by the Force to certain individuals. And the people of this galaxy far, far away accept this as inevitable. Only the people who are born to become Jedi are perhaps the only ones who really see this as something they'd want to do with their lives.It has always seemed to me that becoming a Jedi was all about destiny. If you take a look at all the movies, you can see that it was Luke's destiny that he was to become a Jedi. And why would Yoda say There is anotherhope for the alliance? It's because he already knew that Leia was a Jedi potential, or at least someone who has the potential to be strong enough with the force to be able to bring hope to the galaxy. How can one know this if midi-chlorians don't exist? It has been said that the force runs strong in the family of the Skywalkers. It can only run strong if it was the will of the force for it to make it so. And it all started with Anakin's immaculate conception by the midi-chlorians.6) The Plot - If anyone says that the plot was boring or stupid, they are only stupid themselves. If one doesn't realize that Senator Palpatine was the main character of this movie, then TPM went completely over their heads. Darth Sidious, Darth Maul's master, is the same person as Palpatine. Senator Palpatine is really the Sith Lord we see in the Old Trilogy who we all know as The Emperor.  If you figure this out, then suddenly the plot becomes much more interesting. What is going on is that Palpatine eventually becomes the Emperor and creates an evil Empire by rising up in political power. He does so by deceit and manipulation. And what a better way of doing this then by playing both the good side and the bad like pawns in a chess game, setting each piece where he wants in order to eventually be elected Chancellor, which in turn will enable him to backstab the Jedi and the Republic however he pleases. He then will declare himself Emperor and develop the evil Empire that we see in full effect in the original trilogy.So why is this a dumb plot? I think it's done well. All along, it's Palpatine who's manipulating everything that's going on in the movie, and no one knows it. And because of his manipulations, he becomes elected chancellor by the end of the movie. In The Phantom Menace, the bad guy wins, and no one knows it. I think that's awesome. And this is a perfect set up for what's yet to come.Oh, and for that idiot who said the Trade Federation was the Phantom Menace, think again. Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious is The Phantom Menace. Just look at all that he's done in the shadows. He's the biggest menace of them all, with all his deceit and manipulation that went completely over peoples' heads. And Lucasfilm has confirmed that he's The Phantom Menace anyways. The title of this movie was named after the main character - Palpatine\/Sidious(the future Emperor).7) Darth Maul - People thought that it was just stupid that he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes. I don't. He's a throw away character. Sure, Lucas could've written it some other way so that Maul had more screen time. But why is the way he wrote it a bad thing? I look at Maul as I do Boba Fett - a cool, but insignificant character. The fact that he got killed was only to stress the fact that the Sith work in pairs, and that because he's killed, Sidious will automatically search for another sith apprentice. In Episode II, he'll have another one, and then he\/she will be killed as well. So gee, can you guess who'll finally become Palpatine's apprentice?Sure, Lucas could've written it so that Maul lasts through Episode II, and had more screen time in Episode I, but it's not necessary. It works just as well, if not better, the way Lucas has written it. And in the end, it stresses that Sidious\/Palpatine really is the main villain.Conclusion -All in all, I think Lucas, and the people at Lucasfilm did a good job at making this beginning chapter of the Star Wars saga a good movie. I mean, when one opens a six chapter book, and reads the first chapter, and then reads the end, it makes the first chapter look dull. When people first saw the Old Trilogy, they were thrown into this galactic battle of a rebellion against a massive evil Empire. Everything is already established. However, with Episode I, these things haven't happened yet, therefore it makes it appear less exciting. But is any first chapter of a book more exciting than the climax(episodes IV-VI)? I don't think so.  Even so, The Phantom Menace still seemed as intriguing to me as any Old Trilogy movie.  It's just that it's the beginning, and so it's not just about good VS evil like the other ones, but HOW the good and evil came to be.  And THAT, to me was interesting. Episode I was only meant to set us up for the next two movies, and to introduce the characters. Nothing more.  And one should not expect anything more than that when watching this movie.As for the things like the special effects, the acting, etc., it's merely subjective. In fact, the whole subject of whether or not TPM was a good Star Wars movie depends on the individual. It's just that some things such as the things I listed above, are inexcusable. The people who have a problem with the 7 things I listed above just have a serious problem with themselves.No, I'm not a Lucas or Star Wars gusher. I merely think that in this case, Lucas did a good job with the introduction to the biggest Sci-fi saga of all time.

Midichlorians? Jar Jar? Immaculate Conception of Anakin? Preposterous? While some people may find these things, as well as other minor things unacceptable in the Star Wars Universe, I beg to differ. Let me address some issues the best I can and tell TPM hatemongers why I think they ARE in fact acceptable in the Star Wars universe.1) Jar Jar Binks - Every Episode I review has something about Jar Jar in it, so here's my two sense(pun intended). Basically, people found Jar Jar to be annoying, stupid, a terrible addition to the Star Wars saga, etc. I agree that he's annoying and stupid, but not a terrible addition. Like I just said, I agree that he's annoying and stupid. But he's supposed to be. Haven't YOU met anyone like Jar Jar before? I certainly have. The personality of Jar Jar resides in most kids that I know. Kids can ALSO be annoying, stupid, clumsy, and get into trouble a lot. They're just like Jar Jar. But do we hate kids? Nope. We punish them for their actions sometimes, but we all get over it and love them for who they are. So no wonder kids can relate to him! Out of all of my kid cousins that live locally, they all liked Jar Jar. It's because they can relate. Jar Jar was supposed to have a child-like innocence to him. If you didn't catch that, watch the movie again.However, most people who are between the ages of 13 and 25 usually don't relate to him. I don't relate to him either. But yet, they like C-3P0. This has always puzzled me. But I think I've come to a sensible conclusion.Let's think about this a bit. 3P0 is annoying too. What about all those stupid statistics that he gave them, making the situations they were in much less hopeful? This makes everyone unhappy and annoyed with him. Or what about the time he wandered away from the group, and got shot?! Chewy had to repair him and carry him around on his back for half of the movie! Such an annoying inconvenience! And he was always whining about something. Now why don't people get annoyed by him? It's simply because they grew up with him, and he's apart of what started it all. He's nostalgic. Most people who complain about Jar Jar are the people who saw the trilogy as a kid. Guess what? When kids see 3P0, they see a cool robot. However, later on they see a whiny, annoying inconvenience. And yet, they still like him. Why? It's because he's apart of their treasured childhood. He's something they liked as a kid, and therefore they continue to like him, even though they realize the way he is. There's nothing wrong with this, it's just that these people don't realze that just as the kids of yesterday that grew up with 3P0 still like him despite his annoying antics, the kids of today that grow up liking Jar Jar will do the same thing for him.Lastly, Jar Jar served more of a purpose to this movie than 3P0 did to any of the movies. All 3P0 did was alert the gang of the Stormtroopers' presence(which was only because Chewy was in the process of repairing him when this blurb spirted out), and get the Ewoks to side with the good guys. Other then these two things, he did nothing but get in the way. Gee, doesn't this sound a lot like Jar Jar? Now, did Jar Jar not help the two separate societies on Naboo unite? Of course he did. Did he not become General of the Gungan army? Of course he did. So what if he's clumsy, annoying, and is always getting into trouble? These actions only help display why no one in the movie likes him, and why he was banished from Otoh Gunga(the underwater city). I mean, why would a society banish someone because they were clumsy? Because of all his stupid antics, I understood why.So what's the big deal? Jar Jar is just like little kids. Jar Jar is annoying like 3P0. It's just that the kids of yesterday still like 3P0 today because they grew up with him. He's nostalgic. Without R2-D2, 3P0 is nothing. However, Jar Jar was able to unite two societies without the help of a cool sidekick, and despite his clumsiness. I'd say this, as well as the fact that he's just like little kids, makes him someone we should accept and respect. Treat Jar Jar just as you would a kid, and things will take a turn for the better. Treat Jar Jar as you would 3P0 and the same will happen.2) Midi-chlorians - What's the big deal? They take away from the mysticism of the force? I think not. They only emphasize the mysticism.

Nominated for best picture, best screenplay, Julia Roberts won the academy for her portrayal of Brockovich?  I don't think so.  See, this is where the wonderful world of entertainment and myself have a little differ of opinion when it comes to good movies.  THIS was not one of them.I will never understand why celebrities are paid these big bucks just because they can memorize some lines.  You throw in some movie previews that you think the public should see in order to waste seven, eight dollars, and suddenly, you have a money making picture all because you had the brains to hire one of the biggest (and overrated) actors in the show business.Why did everybody, and when I say 'everybody' I mean the academy awards association, think that this picture was deserving to be nominated for an oscar?  I suppose I should have seen this one coming considering that they gave the lousy 'American Beauty' the gold statue the year before. I think that I am about the only person who doesn't like Roberts.  I don't like the roles she picks, her acting ability isn't exactly golden, and I hate how everyone thinks that she is the number one actress around nowadays.  Will somebody explain to me why she was exactly nominated for the best actress award?  You got her running around like a hooker for two+ hours.  I thought that we had already covered the whole hooker thing in 'Pretty Woman.'  She goes prancing around the town in heels that she can barely stand up in.  And the thing that made this story look bad was that no matter how tight the money was and whenever times got tough, we never see Brockovich wear the same outfit twice.  Here she is looking all over for a job and complaining that she's got three kids to feed but just how poor was she if her wonderful wardrobe of mini skirts and tank tops never came to a repeat?  There went the movie.  I can't really comment on the rest of the cast because there wasn't any!  Yeah, sure Masry was a good size part but scene after scene I had to put up with looking at Roberts' face.  Brockovich's snappy come backs and rude one liners began to run dry during the first twenty minutes of the film.  I'll admit that some evoked a slight laughter from me but not a whole lot.  I got a little tired of hearing f___ this and f___ that, but what can you do?  I'm just wondering that if another actress had portrayed Erin Brockovich, would this movie have gotten the same amount of publicity?  The story line, even though it was based on a true story, was very bland.  All you have here is a non-educated mother of three who is trying to support her family when she comes along a case of water contamination and decides to bring it to the surface.  She wins, the water drinkers get a pay off, she gets a pay off and we're all really happy.  The movie ended too quick and then I was forced to listen to that dumb song by Sheryl Crow.  Just some last comments  The problem the movie crew had here was that they tried to make a movie out of something that didn't need to be made.  There wasn't enough information given about the case and it more or less focussed on Roberts playing a half dressed lawyer-type.  The lack of music was another thing that annoyed me.  How could they possibly make a soundtrack?  And somebody want to tell me what they spent their $51 million budget on?  The most creative thing that this movie had was the real E.B. in a cameo named 'Julia.'  Oh, how do they come up with these things!?  Final words  This movie was given too much credit all because it had the overrated Julia Roberts in the lead\/only role.  Critics never know what they're talking about and I should never listen to the academy again.  Don't watch this!

You throw in some movie previews that you think the public should see in order to waste seven, eight dollars, and suddenly, you have a money making picture all because you had the brains to hire one of the biggest (and overrated) actors in the show business.Why did everybody, and when I say 'everybody' I mean the academy awards association, think that this picture was deserving to be nominated for an oscar?  I suppose I should have seen this one coming considering that they gave the lousy 'American Beauty' the gold statue the year before. I think that I am about the only person who doesn't like Roberts.  I don't like the roles she picks, her acting ability isn't exactly golden, and I hate how everyone thinks that she is the number one actress around nowadays.  Will somebody explain to me why she was exactly nominated for the best actress award?  You got her running around like a hooker for two+ hours.  I thought that we had already covered the whole hooker thing in 'Pretty Woman.'  She goes prancing around the town in heels that she can barely stand up in.  And the thing that made this story look bad was that no matter how tight the money was and whenever times got tough, we never see Brockovich wear the same outfit twice.  Here she is looking all over for a job and complaining that she's got three kids to feed but just how poor was she if her wonderful wardrobe of mini skirts and tank tops never came to a repeat?  There went the movie.  I can't really comment on the rest of the cast because there wasn't any!  Yeah, sure Masry was a good size part but scene after scene I had to put up with looking at Roberts' face.  Brockovich's snappy come backs and rude one liners began to run dry during the first twenty minutes of the film.  I'll admit that some evoked a slight laughter from me but not a whole lot.  I got a little tired of hearing f___ this and f___ that, but what can you do?  I'm just wondering that if another actress had portrayed Erin Brockovich, would this movie have gotten the same amount of publicity?  The story line, even though it was based on a true story, was very bland.  All you have here is a non-educated mother of three who is trying to support her family when she comes along a case of water contamination and decides to bring it to the surface.  She wins, the water drinkers get a pay off, she gets a pay off and we're all really happy.  The movie ended too quick and then I was forced to listen to that dumb song by Sheryl Crow.  Just some last comments  The problem the movie crew had here was that they tried to make a movie out of something that didn't need to be made.  There wasn't enough information given about the case and it more or less focussed on Roberts playing a half dressed lawyer-type.  The lack of music was another thing that annoyed me.  How could they possibly make a soundtrack?  And somebody want to tell me what they spent their $51 million budget on?  The most creative thing that this movie had was the real E.B. in a cameo named 'Julia.'  Oh, how do they come up with these things!?

Maybe a bit of my history with Tom Green - the Howard Stern of the comic set - will help put things in perspective.  I first saw Tom Green on MTV years ago and remember only that I turned the channel after a few seconds.  I next saw him in Road Trip where I shuffled uncomfortably in my seat every time he came on screen.   I did however find him mildly amusing in Charlie's Angels, so when a friend invited me to the premiere I decided to give Green one more chance.   Having endured an agonizing hour and a half (during which I checked my watch literally every ten minutes) watching Green's latest effort I can now state unequivocally that I dislike Tom Green more than any comedian I have ever seen past, present and probably future.Warning  possible spoilers ahead - not that anything could spoil this film...Gord is the ultimate slacker a 28 year old skateboard riding half-wit, he leaves the security of his parents' basement, to take a job in a cheese sandwich factory with aspirations of being a professional animator. When his dreams are dashed, Gord returns home in disgrace, moves back into the basement and endures his father's jibes.  Gord soon becomes involved with a beautiful woman, and sets out to prove his father wrong.Suffice it to say that scenes with Green shaking a horse's penis, swinging a baby around by the umbilical cord and jokes made at the expense of the handicapped are bad enough.

Billy Crystal could have a multiple personality disorder and think he's little red riding hood and alternatively, Ronnie Reagan... Maybe Madonna as a mafia boss... The mind boggles... Bottom line, I am disappointed, VERY disappointed.

I usually don't do this in IMDB reviews, but I was so impressed I wanted to in this case.If you want a short summary, here it is. Excellent movie, excellent DVD, excellent special features.First, the movie. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is probably one of the scariest movies ever made (and one of the best titles of all time). Man, they made some creepy movies in the 70's (Carrie, The Exorcist, Rabid). It was unique for its time, and there's still nothing quite like it today. The plot doesn't sound like much- 2 women and 3 men make a drive to rural Texas to check out a graveyard that has been 'defiled', and to also relax and enjoy themselves. This last part of their vacation plan doesn't go real smoothly, as they make the mistake of wandering into an area where an insane, backwoods, inbred, cannibalistic sociopathic family live. Things get more and more horrifying from there.I've heard people complain this movie isn't scary and not gory enough. Well, as far as the gore, it is fairly low-key by today's standards (though I'm sure my mother wouldn't want to watch it, and it couldn't be shown uncut on regular network TV). There's not a lot of blood till the end of the movie, but the acting is so good, and the screams of the victims so wrenching, your imagination fills in the rest and it actually is painful to watch. I will agree that the movie is kind of slow to get started- I admit the first time I saw it as a teenager I was getting impatient for some action. However, the last half of the movie more than makes up for it. But if you think this movie isn't scary, I seriously doubt you've watched alone, at home, at night, with all the lights off. The first time I saw it was in the daytime, and it still made my hair stand on end. When I got the Special Edition DVD (more on that later)I unwisely watched it after midnight with the lights off, after my husband went to bed. That night, I couldn't sleep until the sun came up. The opening scene of the rotting corpse in the cemetery wired to a headstone alone made my skin crawl. The scene where Pam first discovers Leatherface's room, with the furniture made of bones and the chickens in bird-cages, gets scarier each time I see it. The last 20 minutes, at the dinner table, has to be one of the most grueling and realistic scenes ever. The final few images-the crazy laughter and the spinning-well, over 10 years went by between the last time I saw the movie and the time I watched it on DVD a few weeks ago, and I *still* could remember those shots so vividly it was like I saw it yesterday.The DVD is incredible-the transfer is so crisp that it seems like the movie was filmed last year instead of in the early 70's. Since I'd only seen it on VHS, I never really appreciated how beautiful some shots of the rural setting are, and also how well-thought out and carefully put together most of the cinematography is. Breathtaking, actually. Until the commentary pointed it out, I never realized how perfect and effective the long, continuous shot of Pam hesitantly getting up off the porch swing to try to find out where her boyfriend has gotten to and slowly walking to the screen door is. This movie does not look at all amateurish, even though it was made on an extremely low budget.The DVD is packed with cool and interesting special features. First, the commentary by Tobe Hooper, Gunnar Hansen aka Leatherface, and director of photography Daniel Pearl is fascinating. There's lots of subtle but powerful elements in the movie I missed till now-for instance, the lack of almost any score or soundtrack that gives it a documentary feel, making it that much more disturbing. Hardcore fans of this movie know already this was NOT an easy shoot by any standards, but their accounts of how much energy and work it took to get certain things right, not to mention the really tortuous things many of the actors went through...well, if any actor deserves to be paid millions for a movie, this cast certainly earned it.  The dinner scene was the most horrendous- they could only do one take, since the actor playing Grandpa decided he would only give them one day, it went on for 20+ hours, and this was in 110 degree heat with no air conditioning. Gunnar Hansen said that by the end, he was so out of it he started to think he wasn't acting. Kind of gives the tagline Who will survive and what will be left of them? a whole new meaning.There's also some deleted and alternate scenes; nothing mind-blowing but still very interesting. With many of them, you can read the script excerpt of the scene first. There's a hilarious blooper reel-the quality isn't that great, but you'll laugh your butt off. There's lots of production notes and stills, along with shots of rare publicity material. A couple scenes are broken down shot by shot, with Hooper explaining why he made the directing and editing choices he did. There's even more, I just don't have room for it all. The menu is also pretty great-if you let it sit too long though, you'll get a brief surprise that'll make you jump. I was quietly paging through the booklet at the time and it scared the bejeezus outta me. I highly recommend the Special Edition to anyone who is a fan of TCM. You'll be able to spend hours enjoying it, and they couldn't have done a better job.

Perhaps a mixture of the three.The ending left me a little cold, but as a whole there was the sort of attempt to get inside the Alien (as opposed to the reverse) that the series really needs.Alien remains - by far - the best installment of the series with characterisations that seem very real, claustrophobia and hidden deaths that work better than any amount of snot-splattering explosive effects and a COMPLETE lack of corny one-liners or machoistic attitudes. What it will never be, is the favourite for those that prefer large firearms, big explosions, flashy CGI and largely two-dimensional characters.Resurrection had some good things going for it - not least Jeunet as director - but it's a pity that Dan O'Bannon (Who wrote Alien) did not have more of a direct input.

I think it was because I had gone into it expecting absolutely nothing. It's not the kind of movie that'll change your life, and you'll probably forget you had even seen it the next morning, but it's fun and lightweight, just as films in this genre should be.The last week, I've gone a movie watching spree, watching at least eleven films in seven days, and this is probably the biggest treasure out of the bunch, if only because it was so much better than I had hoped. Angela's Ashes, The Running Man, Blow, Memento, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Empire of the Sun, Paper Moon, Jacob's Ladder, Leaving Las Vegas, Along Came a Spider, The Stand, the list goes on and on, and, of all those films, this is the one that stands out... if you can believe that. Of course it had it's share of flaws, probably more than the rest of those movies combined, but hey, it just added to the fun instead of detract from it.I did see Look Who's Talking. I hated it. I hated it with a passion. That was a year ago. Why I hated it, I don't know. I just know that I didn't like it at all. The only reason I rented this movie, it's SECOND sequel, was to see how the series had deteriorated since the first film. Well, if nothing else, it's really improved. I haven't seen the second in the series, but I doubt it could even begin to match the third.One can guess that Travolta didn't want to be here. You've gotta feel sorry for the guy. Once one of Hollywood's biggest stars, through the eighties he was reduced to parts in TV movies and bland films like The Experts. He struck box office gold in 1989 with the first Look Who's Talking, and then made a few wrong moves and was right back down at the bottom of Hollywood, even appearing in both of the sequels. Well, if he was bored here, he sure didn't show it. Though his performance seemed to wane a bit towards the end, he was engaging all the way through, and obviously didn't feel as though the material was below him like many actors would've had they been in his position.Kirstie Alley, however, is entirely a different story. Never a particulary good actress, you have to wonder how she rose so high into Hollywood's elite, before plunging again after the first Look Who's Talking. Her screen presence here is non existent, and she is about as much fun to watch as this review probably is to read. Though she doesn't bring the whole film down with her, she comes pretty close at times, and for me at least, didn't garner a single laugh.As the voices of the two dogs, Rocks and Daphne, Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton fare a lot better than Alley. Given some of the best lines in the film, they add a certain flare to their characters, making us believe that dogs actually can communicate with each other as illustrated here, even if it is clearly not possible. It takes real talent to make the audience believe that. Even if it is just through voice work, chemistry between the two is clearly evident, and you wish they had been given more scenes together, or even seperately. The writers seemed to forget about the dogs for long periods of time and focusing instead of the family, even though the movie was supposed to revolve around the dogs, at least according to the advertising.Though she is third billed, Olympia Dukakis has little more than a cameo, given five or six lines at the absolute most. Rounding out the main cast was the two actors who played Travolta and Alley's kids, David Gallagher as Mikey and Tabitha Lupien as Julie. Lupien is funny at times, especially with her obsession with basketball star Charles Barkley, but it's clear that was too young to really know what was going on, and just following the orders of the director. She did have some good lines, and that wide eyed gaze she had is priceless. Gallagher, who was later cast as one of the leads on the television series 7th Heaven, is impressive here, turning in a surprisingly good performance for someone so young. Though his character was shallow and obviously wasn't drawn out much (strange considering he's on screen for most of the movie), he makes good use of the weak material given to him.Spread out through the movie were five or six dream sequences. There's only one word to describe them, downright hilarious. Wait, that's two words. Oh well, they were really funny though. I'm not going to go through describing them, you'll have to see them for yourselves, but take my word on it, it doesn't get much funnier than that folks.Well, I've spent long enough praising the movie, now to the flaws I mentioned earlier. For one, I don't know if this was the fault of the boom operator or if it was my particular cassette, but the on location audio was dreadful. The voices were muffled and hard to understand, and it weakened the impact of many of the dialogue based jokes. Any chemistry between Travolta and Alley that may have existed in the first Look Who's Talking has vanished. Though many may not agree with me, I put the majority of the blame on Alley, who probably took this role only because of the paycheck.The last third of the movie, especially the sappy happy ending, is contrived beyond belief and not the least bit funny. It's as if the producers hired a seperate writer for the ending, the style is that much different from the rest of the movie. The songs are unimaginably bad. Well, it's not so much the songs, but the obtrusive way they were edited in, with the audio levels at least 50% higher than the rest of the movie. I'm not going to drone on and on, like I already have, so I'll end this quick.Look Who's Talking Now is a surprisingly entertaining little movie, easily better than the lackluster first entry, just don't go in expecting too much (which shouldn't be too hard given the horrible reviews and low IMDb rating), because you're bound to be disappointed.7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 April 2001","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  I couldn't resist the temptation, and I found myself liking 'Look Who's Talking Now', even though I knew it wasn't really a... what's the word I'm looking for here... good movie?

It takes a semi genius to get both elements together and not go over the fine line that separates class from crass. When someone finally gets it right, it's no surprise that critics go ape-poopy over it. That's not to say Almost Famous didn't deserve being ape-pooped on.William Miller (closely based on the film's director, Cameron Crowe) is a kid with an overprotective mom (who bans butter, sugar, rock music and moves Christmas into September) and an older sister who doesn't act like her mother. William's sister leaves one day, not able to cope with her mom, to become a flight attendant. She leaves her record to William. William becomes entranced with rock music and a few years later, he meets Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of Creem magazine. Bangs becomes his mentor when William is assigned to write for Rolling Stone magazine. Miller is asked by editor Ben Fong-Torres (gotta love that name) to get an interview from Black Sabbath, playing in William's town. The doorman doesn't want to let William in, so he turns back and meets with a group of girls who he thinks are groupies. However, they refer to themselves as Band-Aids.

This movie is filled with small personal touches, stuff that Crowe noticed on the road, stuff that some people wouldn't see if it bit them on the ass. While watching Almost Famous, you know that you're watching something that wasn't even remotely made for success, but for personal growth and pleasure.

He underplays it and comes across extremely well as the outcast youngster. I really think that Fugit was forgotten at the time of the awards, but he did deserve a nomination. Billy Crudup plays the guitarist of Stillwater. He delivers a good but not flashy performance. Frances McDormand absolutely steals the show as William's overprotective mother. Everyone knew that McDormand was a gifted actress after she did Fargo, and she's no different here. Even though Kate Hudson stole her spotlight, she should've been the biggest contender for an acting award in Almost Famous. Kate Hudson, daughter of Goldie Hawn (even though she looks more like Drew Barrymore), got buzzes from all the press and was almost assured a Best Supporting actress Oscar.

More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in Sugar, the musical adaptation of Some Like It Hot which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s.  Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences.  I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with Sugar, and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.In the 1959 classic, Curtis and Lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping to make ends meet in Prohibition-era Chicago during the dead of winter who accidentally eyewitness a major gangland rubout (aka the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).  Barely escaping with their lives (their instruments aren't quite as lucky), our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam.  Scared out of their shoes (sorry), the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an all-girl orchestra tour headed for sunny Florida.  Killing two birds with one stone, they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob?  Once they hit the coast, they'll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits.  Enter a major detour in the form of  luscious Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane, given one of the sexiest (yet innocent) entrances ever afforded a star.  Snugly fit in flashy 'Jazz Age' threads, a blast from the locomotive's engine taunts her incredible hour-glass figure as she rushes to catch her train to Florida.  The boys, stopped dead in their high-heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision, decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all.  As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist\/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the girls when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze.  As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his Josephine guise to contend with, while Lemmon's Daphne has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire.  What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script.  Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together!  Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's  blue-ribbon closing line).  As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic Running Wild, the torchy I'm Through With Love, and her classic boop-boop-a-doop signature song, I Wanna Be Loved by You.The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.   Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of Father Knows Best fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the girls.For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called mild humor of Some Like It Hot is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day comedies.  There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value.  It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew Dice Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between I Love Lucy and Married With Children; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious engagement sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny.  Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props.  While Some Like It Hot bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's insult comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.

As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist\/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the girls when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze.  As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his Josephine guise to contend with, while Lemmon's Daphne has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire.  What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script.  Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together!  Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's  blue-ribbon closing line).  As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic Running Wild, the torchy I'm Through With Love, and her classic boop-boop-a-doop signature song, I Wanna Be Loved by You.The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.   Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of Father Knows Best fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the girls.For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called mild humor of Some Like It Hot is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day comedies.  There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value.  It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew Dice Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between I Love Lucy and Married With Children; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious engagement sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny.  Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props.  While Some Like It Hot bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's insult comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.  I still have hope...Having ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees, THAT is why Some Like It Hot will (and should be) considered one of THE screwball classics of all time, and why most of today's attempts will (and should be) yesterday's news.

Get it at Amazon.)This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution. Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commend for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be. To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart. Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment. An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep. Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her. She, however, is not so enamored. She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.Offbeat enough? Not yet. Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise. The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up. Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary. While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet. He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door. He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life. Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing. He is BEING John Malkovich!Okay, we have our strikingly original premise. Where the film goes from here is the tough part. It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel. I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz. I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality. The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985). But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph. But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens. See it for yourself.
