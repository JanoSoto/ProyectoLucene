Some believing it's a beefy and shallow action movie, glossed up with big sets and fancy costumes. Others believing it is a truly eye popping visual feast of a film with hidden depth. The film was panned on its original release but since then has been something of a critical favourite. While the film is too murky and turgid at times, it is still engaging, despite needing to lighten up a touch, because this is based on a comic book after all. The film is fantastical but at the same time the film doesn't go quite as fantastical as the comic books did. This seems to be more based in reality but it still features a snake-man, giant snakes and witches.The film follows Conan from childhood when his parents are killed and follows him through his early years as a slave to adulthood when he becomes a fighter and a thief. What drives Conan is pure bloodthirsty revenge on the man who killed his parents(James Earl Jones) and he is constantly spurred on by the belief he is doing his god's (Krom the god of steel) will. Conan constantly interprets important moments as messages from Krom.This film is so visual. The dialogue is minimal and yet meaningful. This gives the film a great atmosphere and really brings to mind two other fantasy action movies I really love, Crying Freeman and Highlander. They are all very similar in style. They all have the same strengths, in that they are both great looking, have a lead character driven by a spirit guide, controlled by his beliefs and a sense of destiny and all three have similar romantic subplot, all told with visuals, and little dialogue. They are all also blessed with unique and rousing scores. It's all very mythical and philosophical in each, with love at first site important. It is the love of the women that drive the men to their goals. In Freeman Dacascos wants to break away from his controlled regime, and take back his life when his love gives him the will to do so. In Highlander McLeod wants to lead a mortal life, to love and grow old with someone, to be human. Conan wants a life after he takes his revenge. The greatness of their romantic story and the purely visual way it is told is that during the movie he says only 5 words to her,and they all come in their first meeting. The film should not get away with something like that, yet it works well. The twist in Conan is that his lover sacrifices herself for him and in effect once he has achieved his goal the film is left with the feeling Conan has no further purpose in life. The cast are good. Arnold was made into a star here. He is physically the best shape he's ever been in a movie. He is smaller than his bodybuilding days yet as big as he's ever been on screen and at the same time fleet of foot and nimble. Lest we not forget by the time he hit mega stardom he was in his 40's, but Arnold is truly in his prime here. It is a performance though of glaring inconsistency which is the likes of which I have never seen. It is at once his best and his worst performance. For all that Schwarzenegger does with a depth and humanity not seen in his films since, he overplays and looks amateurish in others, because of course he was an amateur here. What really does work is the chemistry between Sandahl Bergman and Schwarzy. She gets the best out of him and their scenes together are generally his best. Bergman received a Golden Globe for this and had Arnie consistently been as good as his higher points here, who knows? You get the feeling the philosophical side might occasionally have gone over his head. At times he would bawl out Kraaoomm!!! without knowing why he was delivering the line. Bergman is good. She is enigmatic and quite sexy in a why is she sexy? kind of a way. Bergman kicks ass and her dance background shows as she moves with grace. The showstoppers though are the supporting cast with the legend Mako, excellent as the wizard and narrator. Max Von Sydow is superb as king Osric and he gets some of the best dialogue but it is the chilling James Earl Jones who is particularly excellent as Thulsa Doom.What makes this film great is the fact that it feels older than it is. It feels like a b-movie fantasy film from the golden ages of the 50's and 60's, with some of the charming elements of the legendarily cheap Italian fantasy films. The film even at times feels like it is dubbed. While all it lacks is a stand out Ray Harryhausen moment. The nearest we get is the giant snake. I would have loved to have seen more creatures and beasts in this movie with some HarryHausen effects but it come a tad too late really. Also Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic and old fashioned a big reason the film feels like it is from the golden age of this sword and sorcery quest movies. The score is the real standout part of the movie. It's very old fashioned, medieval and a bit baroque and works marvellously well with some rousing themes.The film is directed with visual flourish by John Milius, whose tragically lame career since makes you wonder what happened. In that sense it has another similarity with Highlander as the even more talented Russell Mulcahy was never matched the quality or success of Highlander since. This is a top notch film that fantasy enthusiasts will love. **** ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2004","score":"124 out of 152 people found the following review useful","review":" A cracking sword and sorcery yarn that has divided movie goer opinions since it's release.

And since I obviously hold the minority opinion on that, let me elaborate. First, I've seen only the first movie, not II or III. This review is about the first movie, and I was expecting it to stand up as its own movie, which it did not for me.(SPOILERS AHEAD)I'll start with the things I liked. The acting is pretty good, with the exception of a few scenes. Some of the scenery is good, notably the parts that take place in Italy. The portrayal of the different characters and the motivation behind their actions is well done in a fairly complex plot. So, overall, I can see how people would say it's a well-made movie. That's about it.So what did I not like? The Godfather simply did not entertain me.The biggest disappointment was that there really was no major character I could identify with. All the men were basically a bunch of lying, cheating, murderous sons of bees, and I'm not just talking about the family business. They treat their women TERRIBLY. Carlo abuses his wife (there's no excuse to take it to that level, even if it's business). Sonny, a married man with kids of his own, is seen with mistresses. Even Michael, who might have been the one character I could somewhat identify with, leaves for Italy, stays away more than a year without so much as a peep to his girlfriend Kay, gets married, watches his wife blown to pieces, then shows up in the States again one day and proposes to Kay out of the blue. (Did you miss me? Now that my secret wife exploded in flames, I guess that makes you #2 on my list, and oh by the way, I need you, I love you, ooh baby baby, please marry me. What total crap.) Then near the end, he refuses to answer her simple question, she (unbelievably) keeps asking, he relents, and with a dramatic pause, he finally lies to her. And she believes him, even just for a few seconds? You've got to be kidding. How can I like a movie when I really don't find myself sympathizing with any of the characters?The violence - not well done. Am I really to believe that a man sleeping on his bed wakes up and discover his horse's severed head placed under the sheet at his feet, with blood covering his own hands and arms? Yeah, that could happen while I sleep... NOT. And what terrible acting when the guy sees the horse head and keeps screaming! Also, the scene where Moe gets shot - look at the bullet hole in his eyeglasses - it's unbelievably small. Was he shot with a needle gun? People might view this as nit-picking, but it really jumped out at me while watching the movie, and it bothered me. And what about Sonny's murder? Is it really necessary to have his killers fire 300 bullets, and to show the whole thing? Look - when the whole premise of a movie is violence, it had better be well-done violence, especially when all the characters are such scoundrels and I don't care who lives and who dies.One of the best movies ever? Hardly. I'd put it in my top 300, because I've probably seen about 300 movies in my life.

You have been warned.***I watched it two nights in the row. After the first viewing I knew I'd missed a lot - but also knew I wanted to see it again. Whatever I understood was beautiful, whatever I did not understand was probably even more beautiful and I wanted to find it. What helped me to figure it out (or at least I think I did) were two films I kept thinking about when watching LH both times Bunuel's 'That Obscure Object of Desire' and Lynch's Mulholland Drive. In Bunuel's film the main character's object of desire is played by two very different actresses. In LH the man who desires is played by two actors (Bill Pullman as Fred, the musician - in the amazing performance and Balthazar Getty as Pete, the mechanic). The object of their desire is Patricia Arquette, gorgeous Renee the Brunette, Fred's wife and seductive Alice the Blonde, the fire of Pete's loins. Is this the same woman? Are they twins? Is she a dream? That's for us, viewers to figure out. And we are on our own - Lynch knows but he would not help. I also think that in LH Lynch tells the same story (if he ever tells the stories) or paints the same painting like in MD the story of gut-wrenching love, desire, obsession and jealousy. You can destroy the object of your desire but you will never be able to kill the love and longing for it. It will come back to you in your dreams; it will haunt you as long as you are able to feel. It will live in your soul and your head and torture you as long as you are alive. And you will never be able to have it.I think Lost Highway is Lynch's masterpiece, absolutely perfect film on all levels. It goes on the top of my list a little ahead of MD because the original idea belongs here. Quoting myself      One thing I don't understand why MD which is secondary to LH  is so universally praised and well known while LH is considered lesser movie or even the failure. For me, LH is a masterpiece, a perfect film where everything works visuals, sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. I never thought I'd say this I liked Marylyn Manson's version of I Put a Spell on You), acting - Patricia Arquette -there is some child like innocence in her that makes all men in the film completely mad about her.How  does Lynch do it? What is his magic touch? How does he make his actors do what they do? Who dictates to him how to arrange perfectly every single frame so nothing is missing and everything is on its place? In the film so claustrophobic, there is a breathtaking aerial shot of the highway with two cars racing - it is beauty itself. That's what he had to say about his enigmatic underrated gem      There's a human condition there - people in trouble, people led into situations that become increasingly dangerous. And it's also about mood and those kind of things that can only happen at night. You can just take that and run with it your own way.      There is a key in the film as to its meaning. But keys are weird. There are surface keys, and there are deeper keys. Intellectual thinking leaves you high and dry sometimes. Intuitive thinking where you get a marriage of feelings and intellect lets you feel the answers where you may not be able to articulate them. Those kinds of things are used in life a lot, but we don't use them too much in cinema. There are films that stay more on the surface, and there's no problem interpreting their meaning.       Death Valley is so beautiful. It just goes on forever. I like the idea of shooting in Death Valley - just the name. It made perfect sense for Lost Highway.On the lighter note - You actually can learn something very important and useful from Lost Highway - please be polite to the other drivers on the road - you never know who the guy you just fingered turned out to be. ) ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2004","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":"  ***Spoilers do follow for Lost Highway and  Mullholand Drive.

What helped me to figure it out (or at least I think I did) were two films I kept thinking about when watching LH both times Bunuel's 'That Obscure Object of Desire' and Lynch's Mulholland Drive. In Bunuel's film the main character's object of desire is played by two very different actresses. In LH the man who desires is played by two actors (Bill Pullman as Fred, the musician - in the amazing performance and Balthazar Getty as Pete, the mechanic). The object of their desire is Patricia Arquette, gorgeous Renee the Brunette, Fred's wife and seductive Alice the Blonde, the fire of Pete's loins. Is this the same woman? Are they twins? Is she a dream? That's for us, viewers to figure out. And we are on our own - Lynch knows but he would not help. I also think that in LH Lynch tells the same story (if he ever tells the stories) or paints the same painting like in MD the story of gut-wrenching love, desire, obsession and jealousy. You can destroy the object of your desire but you will never be able to kill the love and longing for it. It will come back to you in your dreams; it will haunt you as long as you are able to feel. It will live in your soul and your head and torture you as long as you are alive. And you will never be able to have it.I think Lost Highway is Lynch's masterpiece, absolutely perfect film on all levels. It goes on the top of my list a little ahead of MD because the original idea belongs here. Quoting myself      One thing I don't understand why MD which is secondary to LH  is so universally praised and well known while LH is considered lesser movie or even the failure. For me, LH is a masterpiece, a perfect film where everything works visuals, sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. I never thought I'd say this I liked Marylyn Manson's version of I Put a Spell on You), acting - Patricia Arquette -there is some child like innocence in her that makes all men in the film completely mad about her.How  does Lynch do it? What is his magic touch? How does he make his actors do what they do? Who dictates to him how to arrange perfectly every single frame so nothing is missing and everything is on its place? In the film so claustrophobic, there is a breathtaking aerial shot of the highway with two cars racing - it is beauty itself. That's what he had to say about his enigmatic underrated gem      There's a human condition there - people in trouble, people led into situations that become increasingly dangerous. And it's also about mood and those kind of things that can only happen at night. You can just take that and run with it your own way.      There is a key in the film as to its meaning. But keys are weird. There are surface keys, and there are deeper keys. Intellectual thinking leaves you high and dry sometimes. Intuitive thinking where you get a marriage of feelings and intellect lets you feel the answers where you may not be able to articulate them. Those kinds of things are used in life a lot, but we don't use them too much in cinema. There are films that stay more on the surface, and there's no problem interpreting their meaning.

Its Sci-Fi elements don't take too much focus which is good, and unlike Woo to do so anyway. The film has John Travolta and Nic Cage both playing opposite characters, Travolta playing a more refined and less showy role than usual and Cage playing his usual extravagant role, then the two roles are traded as their characters get their faces swapped. There is an interesting dynamic as both actors play both to their usual types (very theatrical) and against type (more refined). Not to mention the psychological elements of the character with both having to wear the face of their Nemesis who they despise. It is particularly interesting from Archers point of view because he begins to hate himself and almost can't take what is happening to him. Of course as you expect with Woo the action is first rate, albeit with mucho doubling for Cage and Travolta.

One big reason was the technological advancement of sound. Roughly three years old by 1930, the public embraced the talking picture wholeheartedly over silents. The other big reason for Dracula's success was that the star of the stage play had been cast as the star of the film. And movie history was made. Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula is now a eighty-one year old icon, outlasting all other interpretations before or since. The twist is that this Dracula looks nothing like Stoker's creation (read the book). Lugosi, either through his work with the playwrights or later at Universal with Browning, devised the most insidious form the character would ever take- a handsome, courtly, well-groomed, civilized aristocrat, so gracious and attractive that he projected an aura of well-being over the viewer. This was worlds away from the Murnau\/Max Schreck approach of head-on abomination in NOSFERATU. Sensibly, no one in their right mind would stay within viewing distance of Schreck (or Kinski in NOSFERATU, THE VAMPYRE and Dafoe in SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE) after the first glimpse. But Lugosi's Count would have you chatting and drinking wine- until he began to drink of you. That cape and those evening clothes are the perfect deception. Browning's Dracula is sometimes stagy and tentative in its continuity (it feels at times that the director was unsure where to go next in the progression of scenes). But Karl Freund's photography summons up a persistent mood of heavy gloom and enveloping dread. Two other assets in the film are Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Van Sloan was Universal's resident Learned Man, appearing as an Egyptologist in THE MUMMY (1933), and perhaps most famously as Dr. Waldman in FRANKENSTEIN (1931). A career-long character actor, Dwight Frye was an eccentric talent who appears to have worked exclusively at Universal. He had his best role as Renfield, producing a still blood-curdling, sneering laugh that seemed to come from the depths of a hellish insanity. If you haven't seen this Dracula please do so.

The family's surname probably has another connotation as well, i.e. the biblical proclamation that the meek shall inherit the earth, but obviously that connotation would refer more to Fenton's more righteous father and brother. As an aside, the youngest son is biblically named Adam.5) Also, while I'm at it, nice outdated, i.e. ultra-conservative, portrayal of women in this movie one was apparently being depicted as a tramp whom we are supposed to assume deserved to get the ax, presumably because Daddy Meiks' 'vision'\/flashback showed her sleeping with a guy wearing a dog collar (fundamentalists once again telling us what 'god' thinks people should and shouldn't do in the privacy of their own bedrooms); and the sheriff's dispatcher was depicted as nothing more than the subservient conspirator for the righteously murderous Adam, and the pregnant vessel for carrying the next generation of demon slayers (oh brother). To my recollection, there were only four other females shown, or alluded to in the male-dominated film the little girl who was the victim of one of the demons; the woman inside the house, to whom another demon\/victim shouted, shut up, bitch; the FBI agent's mother whom we later find out he had whacked years earlier, and whose photo sat lovingly on his desk; and Mama Meiks who died in childbirth and was conveniently out of the picture, along with any other shred of family that they had.

It's the Michael Jordan of cinema there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film. 'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character. That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.

The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film. 'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character. That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.

It's the Michael Jordan of cinema there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for.
