It's really unfortunate, because it could have been quite good had it been less graphic. Unfortunately Solendz hits the audience in the face with over-the-top scenes that can do nothing but revolt the viewer. For example, the films final scene, in which the son comes out, so to speak, is totally overpowered by its graphic nature, and the fact the dog (and then his mother)share in this victory.  Presumably that, and other scenes, were intended to be funny. I couldn't bring myself to laugh. However, he did manage to be more gross than just about any film you can think of (Something About Mary and all of the early John Waters films included). Congratulations, Mr. Director. Ironically, I've heard critics talk about the film's nuanced and subtle display of the depravity of American life. Please. This was subtle like Natural Born Killers was subtle. It was two hours of the Jerry Springer Show with better actors. When are critics going to grow up and stop giving out awards to people just because they push the envelope? When the envelope's empty, all that's left is is the shock value. And in this movie, 2 hours and 20 mins of shock is way too long.  At least I bonded with the rest of the theatre who were also uncomfortably squirming, coughing, and looking at their watches.

Judith (Holly Hunter) is trying to recover from a divorce.  Pat (Danny de Vito) is also recovering from hard blows.  He is the elevator operator in her building, she's a nurse who dreams of finishing medical school.And Judith's dreams are the core of the story.  She imagines events, and we see them staged as she would see them.  Sometimes things happen that we wonder is it real or imagined.  With her new friend Liz (Queen Latifah), Judith visits an after-hours club populated entirely by women.  Liz warns Judith that the dance floor may be more than she can handle.  Next thing we know, Judith has not only ventured onto the dance floor but is leading the other dancers in a number which in and of itself will make this worth buying when it comes out on video.  It's not Rockettes choreography it's a dance about loving music and the freedom of movement, and Hunter is a joy to behold as she dances.Is this just a product of Judith's overactive imagination?  What about her brief encounter with a man at a club?  Whatever.  One way or another, these things help to empower her to make the changes she desires in her life, and that's all that matters.Pat also needs to make changes in his life.  He's in debt from gambling and hates to ask his brother for more money.  He and Judith grow in a bond of friendship that is touching and warm.  He has a dream of starting an import business, but has let it be nothing but a dream for a long time.This is a great, great movie that I'd see again in a heartbeat.  The cast is excellent.  I already knew that Queen Latifah could act, and that she has been a success in the music business.  What a pleasant surprise to find out that she can sing quality material like Lush Life as if she had been singing jazz and blues all her life.Danny de Vito is wonderful, as always.  When we first see him he's walking along and sees a woman crying.  He tries to help her, offers her his handkerchief, and her husband or boyfriend comes along and shouts angrily at de Vito, angrily thinking that de Vito is the woman's new squeeze.I've been a fan of Holly Hunter's for many years.  I first noticed her in a horror movie called THE BURNING, and then BROADCAST NEWS solidified her position.  She's always a welcome sight.None of these characters are perfect.  All are fully developed and very, very human.  I could believe them.  These were people I would like to come to my home to visit the family.  And how many movies can you say that about?And, might I add that there is neither an asteroid nor a comet in sight. Nothing blows up.  Thank the Lord!Parents' note  This is an R and that should be observed.

It's a great combat film, very violent and often relentless, with battle scenes that lift the genre to  new heights. Saving Private Ryan is a classic shoot 'em up film, or should that be shoot 'em off film, one that will always be compared favourably, at least in terms of the fight scenes, to other modern American battle movies like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter.A squad of American infantrymen lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), having somehow survived the carnage of the D day landing on Omaha Beach in Northern France, are given the task of  finding Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who's three brothers have all been killed in action in other battles. The Army have decided to try to evacuate the last remaining brother.The squad have reservations about this mission, feeling that risking eight of them just for one private is a bit rich, but off they go searching for this lost paratrooper behind enemy lines in a very hot war. These men are battle hardened except for their translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has yet to fire a gun in anger. Along the way two are killed, raising the stakes considerably. Private Ryan, when and if they find him, had better be worth it.Saving Private Ryan is striking on a number of fronts. Overwhelming realism is forced on the audience in all of the battle scenes beginning with a whole landing craft full of soldiers slaughtered in seconds by machine gun bullets when the door of the craft drops, even before they hit the beach. And that's only the beginning. Throughout the film a hand held camera jerks and ducks with the soldiers as they try to just survive. Limbs and intestines are lost and maimed. The horror and bedlam of war has never been portrayed as graphically.Lots of new cinematic ground is broken. For a start the slaughter by Americans of prisoners of war in the heat of battle becomes justifiable, or at least understandable in this film. I can't remember American soldiers murdering unarmed assailants on film before, not like they do in Saving Private Ryan. I can see now that the viciousness of the situation, the deaths of comrades, makes a mockery of The Geneva Convention when the bullets are flying on a battle field. These things aren't right of course, but they are understandable.As such it's salient that this was a Second World War battle movie. It's hard to imagine this sort of  film being made about American soldiers in Vietnam or Iraq for example. It's still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in Europe in response to the invasion of the rest of Europe by Hitler's army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the U.S.A.'s more recent invasions.Steven Speilberg, the director of Saving Private Ryan, is steeped in the traditions of Hollywood and wasn't slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films. The multi-ethnic mix has been resurrected amongst the squad. The wise cracking Brooklynite (Edward Burns), the Jewish American (Adam Goldberg) the solid middle American Sergeant (Tom Sizemore) and the sharp shooting, (and unfortunately bible quoting) Southern boy (Barry Pepper) are hauled out yet again.Often war films are coming of age movies but Jeremy Davies as the aesthete translator is the only character in Saving Private Ryan who develops and grows, the rest are already established as warriors. Tom Hanks plays the Captain very effectively indeed, with a great deal of restraint, and I would imagine that he will be nominated for yet another Academy Award.The American Flag is unfurled and waved with more than a little enthusiasm in Saving Private Ryan, which is a tad trying for some non Americans, but again this seems irrelevant because Saving Private Ryan is essentially a battle movie, and an exciting one. But of course, the only traitorous individual in sight is a German.Perhaps it's a mistake to expect too much subtlety from Speilberg anyway. Steven Speilberg strengths lie with the visual. He's uncomfortable with character development, conversation and the variance of personalities. Schindler's List, another of his films and the one most likely to be compared with Saving Private Ryan, was devastating for its audience, but that was because of the slaughter, the heartlessness, of the huge massacre that was the holocaust. It was painted with a broad brush on an immense canvas.The same can be said of Saving Private Ryan. We care for the way that some of the characters die but there are just too many of them. This is Spielberg's triumph in Saving Private Ryan and also its weakness. If Spielberg had been able to make us care very much about whether Private Ryan was saved of not, then Saving Private Ryan would have been even more magnificent!

It's still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in Europe in response to the invasion of the rest of Europe by Hitler's army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the U.S.A.'s more recent invasions.Steven Speilberg, the director of Saving Private Ryan, is steeped in the traditions of Hollywood and wasn't slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films. The multi-ethnic mix has been resurrected amongst the squad. The wise cracking Brooklynite (Edward Burns), the Jewish American (Adam Goldberg) the solid middle American Sergeant (Tom Sizemore) and the sharp shooting, (and unfortunately bible quoting) Southern boy (Barry Pepper) are hauled out yet again.Often war films are coming of age movies but Jeremy Davies as the aesthete translator is the only character in Saving Private Ryan who develops and grows, the rest are already established as warriors. Tom Hanks plays the Captain very effectively indeed, with a great deal of restraint, and I would imagine that he will be nominated for yet another Academy Award.The American Flag is unfurled and waved with more than a little enthusiasm in Saving Private Ryan, which is a tad trying for some non Americans, but again this seems irrelevant because Saving Private Ryan is essentially a battle movie, and an exciting one. But of course, the only traitorous individual in sight is a German.Perhaps it's a mistake to expect too much subtlety from Speilberg anyway. Steven Speilberg strengths lie with the visual. He's uncomfortable with character development, conversation and the variance of personalities. Schindler's List, another of his films and the one most likely to be compared with Saving Private Ryan, was devastating for its audience, but that was because of the slaughter, the heartlessness, of the huge massacre that was the holocaust. It was painted with a broad brush on an immense canvas.The same can be said of Saving Private Ryan. We care for the way that some of the characters die but there are just too many of them. This is Spielberg's triumph in Saving Private Ryan and also its weakness. If Spielberg had been able to make us care very much about whether Private Ryan was saved of not, then Saving Private Ryan would have been even more magnificent!

It's a great combat film, very violent and often relentless, with battle scenes that lift the genre to  new heights. Saving Private Ryan is a classic shoot 'em up film, or should that be shoot 'em off film, one that will always be compared favourably, at least in terms of the fight scenes, to other modern American battle movies like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter.A squad of American infantrymen lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), having somehow survived the carnage of the D day landing on Omaha Beach in Northern France, are given the task of  finding Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who's three brothers have all been killed in action in other battles. The Army have decided to try to evacuate the last remaining brother.The squad have reservations about this mission, feeling that risking eight of them just for one private is a bit rich, but off they go searching for this lost paratrooper behind enemy lines in a very hot war. These men are battle hardened except for their translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has yet to fire a gun in anger. Along the way two are killed, raising the stakes considerably. Private Ryan, when and if they find him, had better be worth it.Saving Private Ryan is striking on a number of fronts. Overwhelming realism is forced on the audience in all of the battle scenes beginning with a whole landing craft full of soldiers slaughtered in seconds by machine gun bullets when the door of the craft drops, even before they hit the beach. And that's only the beginning. Throughout the film a hand held camera jerks and ducks with the soldiers as they try to just survive. Limbs and intestines are lost and maimed. The horror and bedlam of war has never been portrayed as graphically.Lots of new cinematic ground is broken. For a start the slaughter by Americans of prisoners of war in the heat of battle becomes justifiable, or at least understandable in this film. I can't remember American soldiers murdering unarmed assailants on film before, not like they do in Saving Private Ryan. I can see now that the viciousness of the situation, the deaths of comrades, makes a mockery of The Geneva Convention when the bullets are flying on a battle field. These things aren't right of course, but they are understandable.As such it's salient that this was a Second World War battle movie. It's hard to imagine this sort of  film being made about American soldiers in Vietnam or Iraq for example. It's still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in Europe in response to the invasion of the rest of Europe by Hitler's army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the U.S.A.'s more recent invasions.Steven Speilberg, the director of Saving Private Ryan, is steeped in the traditions of Hollywood and wasn't slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films.

This is not unlike the theme of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. I feel Newman could have done very well in that movie as well. I get a little something more from the plot each time I watch this movie, and enjoy it most when I am feeling lost. In the end, he is consumed by the others feeding on him. Until he got his mind right......boss. A failure to communicate goes way beyond words. The boss could see the trouble coming from the first time he looked at Luke, and we see a complex struggle thereafter... Now get that dirt out of my hole!

In my opinion, Toby Maguire, Reese Witherspoon,William Macy and Joan Allen should be up for Oscars next year. Jeff Daniels, Don Knotts and, the late, J.T.

He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.Bergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life's most important question &#150; that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn't exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It's a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss &#150; the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.In one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene &#150; only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures &#145;loss' on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.The imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman's own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black &#150; ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman's existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man &#150; as futile as Sisyphus' labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line `A doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness.'). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.').Izak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.The film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic &#150; a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film `Is there no mercy?' `Don't ask me.' I hope that all of us will fare better when confronted with the film's important question.

Thomas, still his gravelie voiced, smart-alecky, Home Improvement-type self,  just doesn't work with the material given to him. He's playing a smug pretty-boy with all the connections and all the answers, and he comes off more snotty than charming. Mainly because his one-liners just aren't funny. His smugness is un-amusing. There's no biting intelligent sarcasm, nor razor sharp wit or funny facial expressions. He's more like a spoiled 16-year old trying to be funny in front of dad's camcorder. Director Arlene Sanford, who's past efforts behind the camera have consisted mainly of tv sitcoms and hour-long dramas such as Ally McBeal and Caroline In The City, does manage to pull off a few heart-warming holiday moments (aided greatly by composer John Debney's trademark gooey scoring), and even manages to make Jennifer Biel of 7th Heaven fame interesting, mostly when she's in scenes without J.T.T. Kudos also to Sanford for casting Gary Cole in her film; even though his role is limited and largely unimportant, he's a talented actor who deserves more exposure than he gets. If it's Christmas Eve and you're in the mood to be pumped up for the holiday and sick of Its A Wonderful Life, than I'll Be Home For Christmas is for you. Otherwise, wait for the next theatrical Christmas vehicle...without good looking teenagers from tv in the lead.
