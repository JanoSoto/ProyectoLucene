In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role.That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot.

Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode?

This time the rampant splatter isn't that much fun; the constant barrage of blood, gore, goo, shouting and screaming quickly becomes tiresome, and only gets more annoying as this barmy racket rampages through its 84 minutes. There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

The first in a series of a hundred or so films, this is the only one I've seen with a coherent story. Shame it's told with dodgy acting and pretentious dialogue; this is the kind of movie whose pomposity and self-importance clash with scenes where a skinless love interest wanders around the place saying 'Come to daddy'.Andrew Robinson moves to London with his wife (Clare Higgins) and daughter (Ashley Laurence) and encounters all the usual problems of moving in to a new house the plumbing doesn't work, the bed won't fit up the stairs, his brother's corpse coerces his wife into bringing him victims so he can drain their blood and regenerate himself. It's all due to the memorably-designed puzzle box, a demented Rubik's Cube that, when solved, summons the hellish cenobites, who introduce you to all the delights of being strung up on hooks.The emphasis here is on gooey make-up and effects, but unfortunately they look exactly like make-up and effects, with a generous dollop of KY jelly. It's all very rubbery and fake, which is probably due to budgetary restrictions rather than a lack of skill, but whatever the reason it doesn't really work. For all its gory effects, the most horrific moments in 'Hellraiser' come courtesy of Higgins' painfully '80s hairdo. The scare factor isn't boosted by the bargain basement lightning effects that occur when the box is opened, as they were apparently achieved with animation cels and some felt-tip pens.The make-up on head cenobite Doug Bradley is an interesting visual, though, which is probably why he was promoted from the depths of the cast list here to the star of the sequels. The rest of the film's imagery is made up of chains, hooks, leather, nails and barbed wire, which means that various characters I didn't care about get pierced by sharp things in ways that had no effect on me. I didn't believe in any of it, and I especially didn't believe that Robinson could live in the same house as his blood-sucking brother without running into him on the way to the bathroom.This is a ramshackle ghost train of a movie, all the mechanisms showing as you trundle through it wondering why you bothered.

Why travel forward into the future to change things that didn't even happened yet IN THE FUTURE??? And from that a total failure followed with the almanac being stolen by old Biff who went back and changed the past.It just didn't had to be like that. And from that the movie and also more importantly the whole franchise went down and down, being followed by a third weird movie... without any plot(because the plot should have been explained in the second one) and a strange action that doesn't even come close to resolving all the things Marty changed in 1955.The best thing that they could have done with the series after the great first movie was to maybe extend it wisely into the future showing us what happened because of what Marty has changed back in 1955. And from there maybe another trip back to 1955 to settle the things back to where the were.Other bad thing How on earth did the old Biff knew how to drive a time machine? Could he knew that accelerating at 88 MPH would allow you to travel in time? And even so how could he know how to enable the time flux capacitor or set the time coordinates.And the last bad thing that really didn't suited the film was the doctor's fainting at the end. I mean REALLY? Is that what came of Back to the future? Show men doing women's scenes?

Needless to say, it's not the flu; pretty soon the corn cult raises its weary head, and the 'terror' begins. Not only is this instalment repetitious and clichéd - we're treated to numerous false scares, gory deaths and dream sequences - but the build up is completely redundant because any mystery surrounding what's going on has been made abundantly clear by the previous three films in the series.

Despite a dearth of decent performances, scares and atmosphere, and the inclusion of a chestnut as old as an unplugged TV that still works, this is probably the best one.Reporter Terry Farrell investigates a strange death in a hospital and comes across the puzzle box (still a great design) and of course Doug Bradley's Pinhead, who is trapped inside a plastic sculpture and using a nightclub owner to supply him with fresh victims. Bradley delivers his lines with conviction but there's nothing he can do about their poor quality; no, writers, nothing he says is deep and meaningful, it's just laughable. Director Anthony Hickox seems to think that Pinhead just standing there is effect enough, but he's wrong. It's all rather silly, and watching people screaming after their skin has been torn off or a spike has been driven into their head puts you off your popcorn a bit. It's one gory effect after another with no real impact beyond 'yuk'.
