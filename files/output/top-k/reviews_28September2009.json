Swashbuckling legend Errol Flynn gives possibly his best performance as the handsome, brave, gallant and charismatic Robin Hood, and Olivia De Havilland is lovely as ever as Maid Marian, and I felt their romance was very believable. I have to mention the villains, Prince John being played with real demeanour by Claude Rains and a more suave, haughty and charismatic Guy of Gisborne is played wonderfully by Basil Rathbone. The sword fights are energetic and fun, especially the climatic one between Robin and Sir Guy, the dialogue has plenty of wit to amuse kids and adults and Korngold's music score is absolutely superb.

The films are so, for lack of a better word striking. Sometimes artistically so like Metropolis and sometimes dramatically, like Lives of Others and Fitzcaraldo. Run Lola Run is striking too. It is hip, funny, clever and has incredible energy. Sometimes that is all a film needs.The plot begins with a phone call. A young man in a phone booth calls his girlfriend Lola, and tells her that he is gonna die in twenty minutes. He owes a hundred grand to some mafia guys, which he had earlier, but he lost it on the subway. Now he is considering robing the grocery store across the street, but Lola tells him to stay put. She drops everything, and takes off to try and get the money. What follows is three different story approaches to how she gets that money, and each time she encounters the same people in slightly different ways.The first film that came to mind when Run Lola Run ended, was Jackie Brown. Both are crime related stories which offer multiple points of view, but while Jackie Brown was slow, plotting and uninteresting, this one is strait forward, fluid and offers characters that you actually care about. One of the more important motifs of the film is the way that society runs on time. Here is an extreme case, because it presents a life or death situation, but that is why the film is so cleaver. Equally impressive is it's photography. The camera is always moving, and rarely stops, plus the director uses great angles. If there is a problem with Run Lola Run, I didn't catch it, with comedies, you tend to let plot holes pass by. Run Lola Run is highly improbable and sometimes impossible. But if it wasn't, then it may not have been such a great comedy. ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2009","score":"","review":" Personally, I love German cinema.

His friend Dennis (played by John Stockwell . . . imagine Kevin Bacon without his essence of Bacon) starts to see major changes and it soon becomes clear that the relationship between the car and it's driver has crossed into some seriously weird territory. As Arnie's bullies start to get picked off and other strange incidents occur (including the mistreatment of a girl that Arnie takes on a date) it's up to Dennis and others not enthralled to the automobile to sort out some kind of emergency stop.With a cast fleshed out by the likes of Harry Dean Stanton, Alexandra Paul, Kelly Preston and Robert Prosky (and with two capable actors in the lead roles) the movie gets by and skims over it's weaknesses by spreading out the quality. The actors playing the bullies may be possessing of little talent but, at the end of the day, they're only there to be car fodder. And the car? Well, the car's the star here. Lovingly filmed by the camera and given a stunningly effective special effects sequence it's easy to fall in love with Christine.

So, along came A Nightmare on Elm Street. To this day, Craven's masterpiece of modern horror is the movie that elevated the horror genre. Avoid the awful sequels that followed it. The first Nightmare on Elm Street movie is still the scariest and most effective movie in the series.The story revolves around four teens in the town of Springwood Nancy Thompson, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. All four have had horrifying dreams involving a terribly burnt boogeyman in a red and green sweater and a brown fedora on his head with extremely sharp blades for fingers. Sure, they're just dreams. But not until Tina is graphically murdered in her sleep. No weapon was found, but there were four long cuts in Tina's chest. The rest of the group soon finds out that it is the Springwood maniac Freddy Krueger that is haunting their dreams. None of them are safe. If they fall asleep, they will meet their gruesome demise. Now it's up to Nancy to stop Freddy once and for all. But how can she stop somebody that isn't supposed to be real?A Nightmare on Elm Street created a terrifying villain, a plot that is very original, and a group of characters that you care about. Everybody knows who Freddy is, just like everyone knows who Michael Myers is, or Jason Voorhees, or Leatherface. He is now one of the most iconic slashers in horror cinema.One of the things that I admire the most is the cast. Heather Langenkamp is an awesome heroine. Nancy is one of the girls in the genre that fought the villain and didn't run. Langenkamp creates a suburban teenage girl that is filled with pizazz and wit, which she has the most of out of all the characters. In a very brief performance, Tina is played by Amanda Wyss of the hit comedy Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Her character's death is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch. Craven shows no mercy during Tina's death, not having an ounce of the scene edited. He makes you watch all of it, and that creeps the viewer out even more. Nick Corri is a very good rebel. And you'll also notice Johnny Depp in his first big movie as Glen. His death is second best.Nancy's parents, Donald and Marge Thompson, are played by John Saxon of Black Christmas and Ronee Blakely of Nashville. They are the last of the parents on Elm Street to hold a very dark secret about Freddy, something that they aren't telling Nancy or the others. Not such a good idea, since Freddy never seems to leave them alone.I can't imagine anybody else playing Freddy other than Robert Englund. Englund is flawless in the role that made him a star. This is where Englund is scariest as Freddy. In the sequels, Freddy becomes a comedian with rather stale wisecracks. What makes Freddy so scary in the first Nightmare on Elm Street movie is how his dark, macabre sense of humor comes off as frightening. And he's always there, wherever you are. Since he's a dream figure, he can basically do anything, says critic Aviva Briefel. He can transform into anything. That's what makes him so scary. How can you resist sleep? He's everywhere. If horror movies got nominations, Englund would be first in line to win the award.Craven's direction is perfect. He films A Nightmare on Elm Street with a great amount of flair and he provides plenty of gore that will satisfy gore-hounds and enough scares to make you jump.The verdict A Nightmare on Elm Street still holds up as one of the scariest horror movies ever made. And people are always going to remember it. When kids are off to summer camp or they want their parents to tell them a scary story before bed, they most likely will hear about Freddy Krueger and his razor-blade glove. Nightmares are guaranteed. One, two, Freddy's coming for you...Three, four, better lock your door...Five, six grab your crucifix...Seven, eight, gonna stay up late...Nine, ten, never sleep again!

It's very slick, but it's also noisy, and clunky in spots, exploitative (did we really need to see the porn film the dead girl made?), overlong (with occasionally questionable editing choices), and it's dramatic moments are clearly intended to manipulate rather than arouse our emotions. This isn't even remarking the lack of realism regarding police procedure or the consequences of the behavior of the two heroes. Finally, as is apt for a B-movie, all the major players ham it up something fierce.But all this is entirely forgivable once one admits that, yeah, it's just a B-movie, after all, an amusing way to spend two hours when you have nothing better to do and want to watch good guys chase bad guys and blow things up.

The Americans are not lured at all, at least the police, but they are under strong pressure to provide these poor refugees with libertad. As soon as Scarface gets that freedom he starts his business, from scratch and from the bottom, but he knows how to climb fast and how to get rid of obstacles and his road is punctuated with bodies or parts of bodies. In no time at all he is the boss and he is able to realize his ambition millions from the opening Colombian route (cocaine of course) whereas those he eliminated to get in their place were only making a few grands. But the story of this man is the story of a paranoid and schizophrenic sociopath. He climbs to power and cannot see he has to share that power with newcomers. He defends his territory like a lion or a grizzly bear and his power becomes a war, a constant war in which everything and everyone is destroyed. That makes a perfect action film full of violence as if it were loaded with cocaine, but with a more human dimension in the character of Scarface himself who is impersonated marvelously by Al Pacino.

The hero in the story faces this enigmatic question from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep at night. Getting tired of the usual routine of parking tickets and arresting drunk drivers, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is young cop who has bigger aspirations into the police force. His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. The script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like American Gangster (another film Washington was in) proves my point. Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. For an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent Lethal Weapon. The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. Sure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind?
