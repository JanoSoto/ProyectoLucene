There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed.Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way!The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, The Full Monty never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that.But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything.I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing the full monty, but that's an apt description for the film.

Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating).This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either.My rating PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

It's the big honking sequel to a great little film that manages to be great itself.The great little film is one of the joys of watching movies . It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of money or star power behind it. It's just storytellers with an idea who makes it come alive on the big screen. Unfortunately, if someone makes a great little movie today, they oftentimes get a buttload of money thrown at them to make a sequel. And almost invariably, that sequel sucks.Terminator 2 is the exception to that rule. This isn't just a great movie, it's actually a more complex and sophisticated film than its predecessor. Ostensibly, it's a chase movie very much like The Terminator, just with the action and spectacle amped up by spending a lot more money. But there's a depth and craft to the story that goes beyond the first movie.Once again, two warriors have been sent back in time, one seeking to kill and one to save John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future savior of humanity from its machine enemies. John's now a budding juvenile delinquent living with foster parents in Los Angels, while his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is locked up in a mental institution after being caught trying to blow up a computer factory. Eventually, John hooks up with a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzengger) like the one from the first film, but this one has been programmed to obey his commands. The other future warrior (Robert Patrick) is a more advanced Terminator, made out of liquid metal that can shapeshift and imitate anything it touches. John and his pet Terminator break his mother out of the institution and come to realize they have a chance to change the future, to avoid the nuclear holocaust that allowed machines to begin hunting down and exterminating mankind. But to do so, they've got to overcome their seemingly unbeatable, unstoppable foe.Perhaps the best and most impressive thing about Terminator 2 is how well written it is. Exposition is one of the hardest things to do well in movies. Usually, there are some things that the audience needs to know and the only way you can tell them is to have a character just say those things out loud. The exposition dump is frequently the worst scene in any film. But there's no one big dump scene in Terminator 2. Instead, we get little bursts of exposition spaced throughout the first three-quarters of the story and every time it makes perfect sense for the characters to be saying the things they're saying. The story also does a tremendous job of establishing things in the audience's mind that later play a major role in the action. The worst sort of writing is when the only way you can resolve a problem or move the story forward is by pulling something out of thin air that's never been referenced or mentioned in the story before. There's never a point in Terminator 2 where you have to wonder Where did that come from? because it establishes everything you need to know so the next step in the story is surprising and compelling, but it still flows logically and naturally from what you've watched. There are also numerous moments in Terminator 2 where characters echo things from the first film but with completely different meanings and context, adding another level of enjoyment if you watched The Terminator.The writing also creates a world where things make sense, even in an outlandish sci-fi concept like this. Sarah Connor starts out the film as a deeply emotionally damaged woman, which is much more realistic than the idea a person could go through what she's gone through and came out smiling and happy on the other side. And even though one of the main characters is this action-adventure is a young boy, he's treated like an actual boy.

It's the big honking sequel to a great little film that manages to be great itself.The great little film is one of the joys of watching movies . It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of money or star power behind it. It's just storytellers with an idea who makes it come alive on the big screen. Unfortunately, if someone makes a great little movie today, they oftentimes get a buttload of money thrown at them to make a sequel. And almost invariably, that sequel sucks.Terminator 2 is the exception to that rule. This isn't just a great movie, it's actually a more complex and sophisticated film than its predecessor. Ostensibly, it's a chase movie very much like The Terminator, just with the action and spectacle amped up by spending a lot more money. But there's a depth and craft to the story that goes beyond the first movie.Once again, two warriors have been sent back in time, one seeking to kill and one to save John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future savior of humanity from its machine enemies. John's now a budding juvenile delinquent living with foster parents in Los Angels, while his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is locked up in a mental institution after being caught trying to blow up a computer factory. Eventually, John hooks up with a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzengger) like the one from the first film, but this one has been programmed to obey his commands. The other future warrior (Robert Patrick) is a more advanced Terminator, made out of liquid metal that can shapeshift and imitate anything it touches. John and his pet Terminator break his mother out of the institution and come to realize they have a chance to change the future, to avoid the nuclear holocaust that allowed machines to begin hunting down and exterminating mankind. But to do so, they've got to overcome their seemingly unbeatable, unstoppable foe.Perhaps the best and most impressive thing about Terminator 2 is how well written it is. Exposition is one of the hardest things to do well in movies. Usually, there are some things that the audience needs to know and the only way you can tell them is to have a character just say those things out loud. The exposition dump is frequently the worst scene in any film. But there's no one big dump scene in Terminator 2. Instead, we get little bursts of exposition spaced throughout the first three-quarters of the story and every time it makes perfect sense for the characters to be saying the things they're saying. The story also does a tremendous job of establishing things in the audience's mind that later play a major role in the action. The worst sort of writing is when the only way you can resolve a problem or move the story forward is by pulling something out of thin air that's never been referenced or mentioned in the story before. There's never a point in Terminator 2 where you have to wonder Where did that come from? because it establishes everything you need to know so the next step in the story is surprising and compelling, but it still flows logically and naturally from what you've watched. There are also numerous moments in Terminator 2 where characters echo things from the first film but with completely different meanings and context, adding another level of enjoyment if you watched The Terminator.The writing also creates a world where things make sense, even in an outlandish sci-fi concept like this. Sarah Connor starts out the film as a deeply emotionally damaged woman, which is much more realistic than the idea a person could go through what she's gone through and came out smiling and happy on the other side. And even though one of the main characters is this action-adventure is a young boy, he's treated like an actual boy. He doesn't pick up a gun and start blowing people away or turn into some incredible warrior. His mom and The Terminator take care of all that and John helps them in believable ways.

What do you say about a movie that's not just a great piece of entertainment, but is significant in the history of film? The Terminator tells us the story of Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton), an ordinary young woman who works as a waitress and lives with a roommate, who learns she's to give birth to the savior of humanity. That's what she hears from Reece (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent back from a post-apocalyptic future where machines and men are at war. Reece was sent back to protect her from a killer cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that also traveled from the future to kill Sara and erase her son from existence before he could lead Mankind is a successful war against their mechanical enemies.When you say a movie is about a killer cyborg from the future and a main character who has to discover her inner hero, that doesn't necessarily sound like a classic, does it? It sounds just like another mediocre-at-best sci-fi melodrama, just like a couple dozen other forgettable B movies made every year that fill up the space between the really good films at the theater and on cable, another fancy premise used to tie together a bunch of explosions and special effects. But The Terminator is sooooo much more than that.Virtually everything in this movie is better than it has any reason to be. Though it has a clever idea, at its core The Terminator is a fairly basic adventure story. It's not inherently deep or complex or profound. There's no real social commentary to it or any examination of essential human conflicts. It's a chase movie. One with a genuinely clever angle, but still a chase movie. That sort of film doesn't necessarily demand superior writing, acting or directing but all of those things are present in The Terminator.I think the best way to demonstrate how good this movie is, is too simply take note of the little things done well in this film that you wouldn't see in lesser works. The casting of Linda Hamilton is one of those things. For the most important female character in the story, most films would usually cast an actress a lot more attractive than Hamilton. She's really only a bit prettier than the other women in the film and she's really not even as pretty as her co-star, Michael Biehn. But the story of Sara Connor is about a normal, unexceptional woman becoming the sort of person who changes human history. If Sara is a stunning beauty, it undermines the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary.Take a look at the two cops played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen and the criminal psychologist played by Earl Boen. They're supporting characters whose purpose is to get the main characters from the first act into the third act. But even though they're not on screen for every long or have many lines, the actors make them into people just as real as Sara or Reece. And those three characters actually have some of the best and funniest lines of dialog in the whole movie.Consider the character of Reece. He has less than a handful of lines of dialog in the first third of the film, but we understand more about him than any other character through his actions and his memories. Or look at how the film handles the Inevitable Exposition Dump. In this sort of genre picture, whether it's sci-fi or horror or what have you, there's always a moment when some character has to explain what's going on to another character, and by extension to the audience. The Terminator has one of those scenes, but instead of it happening during a dead space when the story comes to a stop, most of it occurs in the middle of a car chase! You can also marvel as the visual sense Cameron brings to the entire film. From one of the earliest scenes where a naked Arnold Schwarzenegger stares down at nighttime Los Angeles to the final moment where Sara Connor drives down a lonely road as a storm approaches, Cameron is always reaching for something better than what you usually get from this sort of action flick.The Terminator didn't just help create one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history.

He started directing in the 70s and developed a good reputation, but it was Unforgiven that propelled Eastwood into category of a great director. He won his first best director Oscar and reinvented the Western genre.Eastwood plays William Munnay, a retired outlaw, living as a widower, father and a farmer. He sets out to live a peaceful live, but is struggling financially. He gets an offer from The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a young outlaw saying that in a small town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming there is the bounty of $1000 for two men who cut up a woman played by Anna Levine. Will and The Schofield Kid team up and bring in Will's former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and set off to claim the reward. But the town sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) claims the debt for the crime has already been settled and would violently uphold his law and keep peace in his town.Eastwood, along with John Warne is considered on of the greatest icons of the Western genre. With The Name with no Name Trilogy Sergio Leone and Eastwood were able to reinvent the genre by increasing the level of violence and bringing more adult tones. With Unforgiven Eastwood reinvented the genre once again, making the violence more realistic and gave the genre a more Earthy, gritty tone. Eastwood's direction was excellent, setting a sombre tone throughout with light music and with his cinematography Jack N. Green filmed in a darker tone, reflected the film. Eastwood set out to let the audience find out about the characters and sets out to make a film with depth. You could fill the dirt of the Old West. It was also interesting move that most of the characters, the outlaws and the sheriff being older men, showing that there was an old guard who were men of violence. But these were men who were also wanted to change themselves but still in their 50s and 60s.There is a great cast in this film Eastwood, Freeman and Hackman are all great actors and are on top form in this film. Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever in a film and Freeman is always good. Hackman really shows his ruthless side and talent throughout, and that he was one tough mother! But it wasn't just a show for the acting veterans, Woolvett showed that he was a promising acting, having a wide range as an actor. It was a shame that he did not get to live up to his potential. Levine too gives a powerful performance the scarred prostitute.David Peoples wrote an excellent screenplay. The story is simple and down-to-Earth, but he was able to bring about complex backstories to his characters and there are wider themes. The film looks at the issue of hero worship and that there was no glory in the world of violence. There is a dark morality throughout the film, but these were characters living in a violence world. Peoples shows his talent as a writer. Peoples also set out to show some historical details like the rise of pulp western fiction and how some outlaws became popular. But whilst the film was good, one small criticism was the inclusion of English Bob (Richard Harris). His character was really a stock character to show Little Bill's ruthless nation. It also felt artificial that the character was English, showing a stereotypical side of a posh English person. It would have been more realistic and had more impact if the character was from America, from a state like Texas or Arizona.Overall Unforgiven is an essential film to watch and was deserving of the awards it got.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"3 June 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Before Unforgiven Clint Eastwood was more famous as an actor, his most famous roles being the Man with No Name and Inspector Harry Callahan. He started directing in the 70s and developed a good reputation, but it was Unforgiven that propelled Eastwood into category of a great director. He won his first best director Oscar and reinvented the Western genre.Eastwood plays William Munnay, a retired outlaw, living as a widower, father and a farmer. He sets out to live a peaceful live, but is struggling financially. He gets an offer from The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a young outlaw saying that in a small town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming there is the bounty of $1000 for two men who cut up a woman played by Anna Levine. Will and The Schofield Kid team up and bring in Will's former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and set off to claim the reward. But the town sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) claims the debt for the crime has already been settled and would violently uphold his law and keep peace in his town.Eastwood, along with John Warne is considered on of the greatest icons of the Western genre. With The Name with no Name Trilogy Sergio Leone and Eastwood were able to reinvent the genre by increasing the level of violence and bringing more adult tones. With Unforgiven Eastwood reinvented the genre once again, making the violence more realistic and gave the genre a more Earthy, gritty tone. Eastwood's direction was excellent, setting a sombre tone throughout with light music and with his cinematography Jack N. Green filmed in a darker tone, reflected the film. Eastwood set out to let the audience find out about the characters and sets out to make a film with depth. You could fill the dirt of the Old West. It was also interesting move that most of the characters, the outlaws and the sheriff being older men, showing that there was an old guard who were men of violence. But these were men who were also wanted to change themselves but still in their 50s and 60s.There is a great cast in this film Eastwood, Freeman and Hackman are all great actors and are on top form in this film. Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever in a film and Freeman is always good. Hackman really shows his ruthless side and talent throughout, and that he was one tough mother! But it wasn't just a show for the acting veterans, Woolvett showed that he was a promising acting, having a wide range as an actor. It was a shame that he did not get to live up to his potential. Levine too gives a powerful performance the scarred prostitute.David Peoples wrote an excellent screenplay. The story is simple and down-to-Earth, but he was able to bring about complex backstories to his characters and there are wider themes. The film looks at the issue of hero worship and that there was no glory in the world of violence. There is a dark morality throughout the film, but these were characters living in a violence world. Peoples shows his talent as a writer. Peoples also set out to show some historical details like the rise of pulp western fiction and how some outlaws became popular. But whilst the film was good, one small criticism was the inclusion of English Bob (Richard Harris). His character was really a stock character to show Little Bill's ruthless nation. It also felt artificial that the character was English, showing a stereotypical side of a posh English person. It would have been more realistic and had more impact if the character was from America, from a state like Texas or Arizona.Overall Unforgiven is an essential film to watch and was deserving of the awards it got.

Soon a vicious monster threatens to take everything over so the group must destroy him while trying to get Howard back home. This was my first time watching this film since I was a kid and it really didn't shock me to see how bad the movie was. I remembered it being pretty bad and I remember seeing it in the theater and how the majority of the people either left or simply fell asleep. Seeing the film today, now somewhat of a cult item, is rather strange because of how rude and rather dirty this movie is and by the fact that it was marketed for kids. I'm not going to sit here and say this is the worst movie ever made because it's not even the worst film of 1986. I'm also not going to try and say there's nothing good here because there actually is. The main culprit here is the horrendous screenplay that takes an hour to get going and then makes an even bigger mistake by going on for another 50-minutes. Whoever thought this story deserved a 111-minute movie must have been off their rockers or perhaps they had some sadist desire to torture viewers. The film contains amazingly long sequences that should have and could have been cut down a lot more than they actually were. Just take a look at the incredibly bad sequence inside the diner as Howard starts getting picked up by some rednecks. This follows with an even longer sequence of Robbins and Howard flying around for what reason I'm still not sure. Perhaps they just wanted to run the budget up? The film is pretty confusing as well because it's meant to be a kids movie but we get all sorts of sexual humor and not to mention an early scene with one of the duck women appearing topless, which I'm sure will be a site for young kids. There's a rather vomit-inducing sequence with Howard and Thompson in bed where she's pretending to want to have sex with him. Speaking of Thompson, she's actually one of the good things here as she never comes off looking too bad and she does bring a sweetness to the role. Robbins, on the other hand, is pretty bad here but the screenplay really didn't give him anything to worth with. The same could be said for Jones who is also wasted. As for Howard, I admit that I like him. Sure, the dialogue and jokes are pretty poor but that's not his fault. I actually liked the costume and thought he was cute enough in a weird sort of way. With that said, this is still a very bad movie that should only be viewed by those brave enough to witness the terror.

I still remember vividly that sense of wonderment when Luke first meets and finds out about Yoda in «Empire» How could this quirky, cranky gnome have ever been a great warrior?, I mumbled to myself &#x96; well, turns out, he's just a hyperactive Muppet, that looks and acts in his younger years exactly the way your average dinosaur-and-action-figure-wielding four-year-old would've imagined it...

Schaffner's «Planet of the Apes (1968)» (an eight of out ten, in my book) is remarkable only in one regard Seldomly did a big-budget sequel with key people from the first outing still attached ever achieve such a dramatic distance in quality from its predecessor.Instead of a gripping drama, developed from smart philosophical speculation and posing some pretty big questions about the human condition (without making the mistake of biting off more than it could chew) &#x96; yes, that's what Schaffner's film was for me &#x96;, all we get here is a stupendously stupid parade of bad ideas¹.Recycle most of the plot points from the original, put in some cheap, forced Vietnam War allegories, add a bunch of funny, nuke-worshipping mutant-psychics (or whatever you wanna call those radioactively contaminated, amazingly unevolved clowns), throw in some hints of Wells' «The Time Machine» for good measure², make sure the overall story is ludicrous and no decent line is allowed into the script, execute everything in the most inane way imaginable, and Bob's your uncle!incompetent, crude, illogical, absurd, unimaginative, silly (no, strike that, that's too kind a word), boring, bland, void and plain dumb &#x96; those are just some of the attributes that come to mind when shudderingly thinking about that atrocity of a movie.It's no wonder Charlton Heston insisted on his character being killed off...You can see how little thought went into it all by the fact that it was here where an element was established that was to become a major part in the ongoing series and that seems to run counter to much of what parts 2 to 5 supposedly (and clumsily) were about, namely speciesism and racism. It is here where the singling out and defining of gorillas as an inherently, a temperamentally \/ racially \/ genetically bad subset, prone to aggression, violence, war, begins.James Franciscus does a decent job, in my opinion, making the best out of what he had to work with. His character, Brent, is a quasi-mirror image of George Taylor (Heston), protagonist from the previous tale who is mercifully relegated to a very minor rôle (just short of a cameo) this time.

In some ways doing so is rather like breaking wind at a wedding, but I must be honest. I'll admit it Unforgiven is a good Western and better than some, but in this reviewer's view it isn't the masterpiece some seem inclined to make of it. More than that, I can't quite even begin to understand why some people claim that it is. I have never thought Eastwood was much of an actor he has the Man With No Name down to a T, but over and above that, even in the fabled Dirty Harry films, I've often felt him to be one-dimensional at best, and here I remain unconvinced by his character, William Munny. Munny, we are told, was at one time the meanest, most cold-blooded and most ruthless killer in the West but who was then - handkerchiefs at the ready girls and boys - tamed by the love of a good women. She transformed him and made him see the error of his ways. So when he is recruited by a self-styled young killer - who, it turns out, has never killed anyone despite his boasting and is horribly short-sighted to boot - to murder two cowboys in revenge for what they did to a whore, he agrees to do one last job only very reluctantly because his hogs have caught swine flu and he needs the money. Yet a few years on after his Damascene conversion to righteousness he is now such a good egg that he has forgotten how to mount a horse and can't shoot straight for toffee. Well, pull the other one. Just why the young would-be killer would come to the back of beyond to seek out Munny to enlist him is never made clear and - call me cynical - but the young shaver has 'plot device' written all over him. Munny sends him off with a flea in his ear, but has second thoughts and seeks out Morgan Freeman, another reformed killer and his former partner in crime, and the two of them head off from Missouri to Wyoming to catch up with the would-be killer to do the deed and collect the money. Freeman is another problem. He is a great actor but far too avuncular to convince as a man who had previously killed in cold blood. So far so clichéd, so what's all this talk about Unforgiven actually undermining clichés? Eastwood continues to be utterly useless, catching pneumonia and allowing himself to be beaten up by Gene Hackman's rather unpleasant sheriff, until the Moment Of Truth his good friend and partner Morgan Freeman is caught and beaten to death by Hackman, so Eastwood Takes Revenge. Instantly, he is transformed from that wheezy old has-been into the ruthless gunman of yore, corners the sheriff and 20 of his deputies and sidekicks in the saloon and dispatches a great deal of them. Naturally, as is the way of films, he is lucky enough not to catch a bullet even though all 20 are shooting at him. Well, my response to all that is yet again pull the other one. OK, Unforgiven is nicely shot (although it includes that post-modern cliché that it rained almost all the time in the West despite what earlier films showed us) and generally does the business, but outstanding it ain't. Sorry. In many ways it is cobbled together what was the point of introducing English Bob, another notorious gunman who, presumably, also arrived in town to kill the cowboys and claim the reward? None as far as I can see except to introduce the unusual sight of an English gunman and give a turn to Richard Harris. Then there is the curious portrayal of the sheriff it seems we are supposed to regard him as the baddie, yet all he does is insist that everyone should observe the town ordinance that no guns should be carried in town. Admittedly, he enforces that ordinance rather ruthlessly, but then he isn't exactly dealing with choirboys, as the case of two cowboys cutting up a whore only because she laughed at how small he was in the man department surely demonstrates. Incidentally, Hackman provides one of the better performances of the film. Saul Rubinek's itinerant writer of dime novels is included to demonstrate how the old West's is passing and is already being mythologised, but little more comes of him. So forgive me if I don't join in the general chorus of 'what a masterpiece this is'. As I say, it's entertaining enough and better than some but don't get carried away.

Here's what I liked- The central heavy, Rufus Riker, was very well characterized. He presented credible arguments justifying the removal of the farmers from his ranch land.- Interesting supporting cast, with Van Heflin, Jack Palance, Ben Johnson, Edgar Buchanan and Elisha Cook.- Nice Civil War references with Elisha Cook's character.- I can see why Palance was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He saves this movie from being virtually unwatchable. The scene where Cook gets blown away into the muddy street saved the movie for me. This was done very realistically for its time.- Beautiful mountains, but I got tired of seeing the same shot over and over again.Here's what I didn't like- The little boy just drove me absolutely nuts. I would rather go to the dentist without Novocaine than watch this movie again.- Alan Ladd? Let's put it this way. John Wayne 6' 4, Clint Eastwood 6' 3, Jimmy Stewart 6' 3, Alan Ladd 5' 6. 'Nuff said. Sounds like I'm being too tough, but this was ranked the third best Western of all time by AFI. Sorry, not with that leading man.- How did Jean Arthur get co-billing with Alan Ladd? She was terrible.- Because of its predictability, there is little dramatic tension in the movie. In the opening scene, a group of heavies visit the ranch and Shane declares himself the protector of the Starret homestead. At that point a two year old could figure out that the farmers will prevail over the ranchers on the back of Shane's guns. The only question is which farmer will be murdered to provoke Shane's outrage, forcing him to abandon pacifism. And even this was telegraphed almost immediately by Elisha Cook's character. The only open question to ponder through this long, dreary, preachy affair is whether or not Starret will also be killed and whether or not Shane will take his place as the head of the family. - It's hard to imagine Shane marrying Marian Starret, because he seems so much more interested in a relationship with the little boy. Sorry, but this was one of the creepiest homosexual\/child molestation references I've ever seen in a movie. And Stevens lingers on it!!!! This is probably explains all the Oscar nominations. Stevens was sucking up to the gays in the Academy. That's the only explanation for how that boy got an Oscar nomination for one of the most annoying performances in the history of film.- Where are the Indians? I guess in Steven's history book, they had been completely exterminated from Wyoming by the time the movie takes place. They aren't even given respect in the many long boring speeches about who the land really belongs to. This is probably because Stevens doesn't really understand Westerns. This was just about the only one he made, after all. I've read that he set out to make a self consciously mythic Western, the last word. So, not even one Indian character in the last word in Westerns? Right. A real genius.- As to the much commented upon otherworldly or angelic qualities of Shane, this is just over-philosophizing by effete critics. Yes, Shane looks out of place in the movie, but only because of Ladd's $1,000 dollar Hollywood hairdo. He looks more like a maitre d' at a gay piano bar than a grizzled saddle tramp.- There is absolutely no comic relief.- Since the the ending of the movie is obvious right at the beginning, the proceedings just drag on and on for two long hours, although it feels like four. It needed some interesting subplots to move it along and some humor to lighten it up.- Overall, this movie was very well made in the sense that there were no plot holes and the characters were all plausible and consistent. However, there is a giant lapse at the end, when the little boy outruns Shane's horse all the way to town. If it was so easy to get to town by foot, then why didn't the father follow Shane too? He didn't look in that bad of shape to me after the knock on the head.

I would rather go to the dentist without Novocaine than watch this movie again.- Alan Ladd? Let's put it this way. John Wayne 6' 4, Clint Eastwood 6' 3, Jimmy Stewart 6' 3, Alan Ladd 5' 6. 'Nuff said. Sounds like I'm being too tough, but this was ranked the third best Western of all time by AFI. Sorry, not with that leading man.- How did Jean Arthur get co-billing with Alan Ladd? She was terrible.- Because of its predictability, there is little dramatic tension in the movie. In the opening scene, a group of heavies visit the ranch and Shane declares himself the protector of the Starret homestead. At that point a two year old could figure out that the farmers will prevail over the ranchers on the back of Shane's guns. The only question is which farmer will be murdered to provoke Shane's outrage, forcing him to abandon pacifism. And even this was telegraphed almost immediately by Elisha Cook's character. The only open question to ponder through this long, dreary, preachy affair is whether or not Starret will also be killed and whether or not Shane will take his place as the head of the family. - It's hard to imagine Shane marrying Marian Starret, because he seems so much more interested in a relationship with the little boy. Sorry, but this was one of the creepiest homosexual\/child molestation references I've ever seen in a movie. And Stevens lingers on it!!!! This is probably explains all the Oscar nominations. Stevens was sucking up to the gays in the Academy. That's the only explanation for how that boy got an Oscar nomination for one of the most annoying performances in the history of film.- Where are the Indians? I guess in Steven's history book, they had been completely exterminated from Wyoming by the time the movie takes place. They aren't even given respect in the many long boring speeches about who the land really belongs to. This is probably because Stevens doesn't really understand Westerns. This was just about the only one he made, after all. I've read that he set out to make a self consciously mythic Western, the last word. So, not even one Indian character in the last word in Westerns? Right. A real genius.- As to the much commented upon otherworldly or angelic qualities of Shane, this is just over-philosophizing by effete critics. Yes, Shane looks out of place in the movie, but only because of Ladd's $1,000 dollar Hollywood hairdo. He looks more like a maitre d' at a gay piano bar than a grizzled saddle tramp.- There is absolutely no comic relief.- Since the the ending of the movie is obvious right at the beginning, the proceedings just drag on and on for two long hours, although it feels like four. It needed some interesting subplots to move it along and some humor to lighten it up.- Overall, this movie was very well made in the sense that there were no plot holes and the characters were all plausible and consistent. However, there is a giant lapse at the end, when the little boy outruns Shane's horse all the way to town. If it was so easy to get to town by foot, then why didn't the father follow Shane too?

I found it exceedingly predictable and slow paced. The little kid was so annoying, he almost drove me to suicide. Overall, however, it's not a bad movie. Here's what I liked- The central heavy, Rufus Riker, was very well characterized. He presented credible arguments justifying the removal of the farmers from his ranch land.- Interesting supporting cast, with Van Heflin, Jack Palance, Ben Johnson, Edgar Buchanan and Elisha Cook.- Nice Civil War references with Elisha Cook's character.- I can see why Palance was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

But I really like the two kids that played Calogero (ages 9 and 17) I thought they both did the best. Too bad they really didn't do any other memorable work.This movie really should be on the Top 250 list. It's a shame that it's not. It is more worthy then plenty of films on there.
