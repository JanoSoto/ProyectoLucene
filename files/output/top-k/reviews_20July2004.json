I actually had trouble sitting through the whole thing, since it failed to accomplish the fairly simple task of impressing someone as entertainment-wise open-minded as myself for something as short as 90 minutes. I actually almost fell asleep, even though I watched this at about 5 PM. It fails to inspire anything other than excruciating boredom. I wasn't excited or entertained for a minute(or a second, for that matter) of this putrid garbage. It so testosterone-filled that it's ridiculous; every single scene has guns, cars, babes, alcohol or sex. Some have all of them. Every single female character is a slut or a victim, or both. Every single actor does a horrible job. Every single character is awfully written, and a cliché or a stereotype. Or both, if possible. The film is so cliché-ridden that you can't imagine it if you haven't seen it. A lot of it is also just blatant rip-off of far superior films, among others, The Matrix. The most obvious is the special effects and the hacking parts. But I also noticed that they copied the ultra-cool mobile phones from The Matrix. If you ask me, the directors just jealous of Matrix, as he obviously can't make action movies himself(I haven't seen 60 seconds, but I've heard nothing but bad things about it). And while I'm on the subject, the hacking; no one really knows exactly what hacking is, right? So how to show it... have someone explain it? Show someone operating a keyboard? Maybe show the screen as the text commands are written on it? No, I know, lets just show Hugh Jackman sitting at a set of 6-7 screens(I think, I wasn't paying attention), yelling variations of yes, yes, no, drinking, smoking and *occasionally* actually typing at the keyboard, while a horrible techno beat is pumping noisily in the background, and the gullible audience will think that he's hacking, since they don't know what hacking is. Not that the filmmakers have the slightest idea what hacking is, either, though. And about the soundtrack, why is it all just bad techno-beats, instead of something that actually evokes emotion, you know, apart from the unbearable pain in our ears. I guess they figured, hey, everything else in the film is so unbearably, unforgivably bad, why not make the soundtrack accordingly?. The dialog is some of the worst in modern cinema(hell, who am I kidding, in the history of cinema). I can only think of one or two movies containing worse lines and worse written dialog, and this one screws it up further, by having every single character crack jokes; in the immortal words of Bart Simpson Everybody's a comedian! Also, every single actor does such a lousy job that you'll yell out loud at the screen OH come on!. That is, unless you have an insane amount of self-control, in which case you might be able to keep yourself from mocking the film aloud. The clichés of this film is unbearable. You've got the FBI guy who doesn't play by the rules, you've got the boss who knows that every situation, especially a hostage situation, can be solved by uncoordinated violence, you've even got the hero who doesn't give a shit. Hell, you even get the mean bastard who is the villain's right hand but never actually does anything but spout one-liners that would make Arnold himself cringe and beg for mercy. The film has the most standard, boring and pointless action scenes you'll ever see in your entire life. I've seen commercials that were more exciting. No, actually, I've seen home-videos that were more entertaining, better filmed, more interesting and less boring. The action consists of a few chase scenes, that serve as an amazing sleeping aid, a single car-chase that was more pointless than just about every single other car-chase I've ever seen. I think a few scenes involved shooting, too, but I'm not entirely sure we ever saw more than guns being loaded and cocked, which, I guess, will fully satisfy some action-craving men, but definitely not me. I've seen the director of this pointless waste of film quoted as saying that this film would be better than The Matrix, and the sequels to it. What the hell was he on? Just another sign of the idiot not being able to cope with The Matrix's success. The special effects are decent, and obviously ripped from The Matrix(where they are much better made, as well). The plot is patched together from a bunch of much better action films, and is so full of holes that you have to wonder whether most of the crew was half asleep while making this film, since they apparently didn't notice. The point of the film is apparently, that you can do what you want, everything you want, as long as you're working for a good cause, and, of course, you're using misdirection so no one will know what you're up to. The way the film tries to justify terrorist acts committed by the villain by saying that they're saving other people's lives is complete bull. It's a common known fact that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. What good will it do to kill off other terrorists, if you're acting like a terrorist yourself? That is some of the most hypocritical bull that I've heard from Hollywood. The film is repetitive and predictable. All the way through, you know how it's going to end, unless you're not paying any attention, which I can't really blame you. The film is utterly pointless. The one high point it has, is that it does have Halle Berry topless, in one scene, for about five seconds(at best). Now, is that worth renting\/buying\/watching the film for? NO! Not at all. You want to see her breasts, go on-line, find a picture site. There's plenty of 'em. Don't waste your time on this piece of trash, under any circumstances. You want good action, look elsewhere. You want any sort of quality in a film, look elsewhere. You want to see Berry's breasts... look on the web, or one of the other films where she(apparently, I haven't seen them) also goes topless, but whatever you do, stay as far away from this crap as humanly possible. If you're going to watch this movie, watch it for free to make fun of it, watch it if you're going to make a movie yourself and you want to know what you're definitely *not* supposed to put in a movie, or simply watch it to see the decline in cinema. But don't watch it to see a good movie. I hope this review is read by as many as possible, and I hope that those who read it will heed my advice and don't watch it. I want to save as many people from this trash as I can. I don't recommend this film to anybody, unless they're dying to see Berry's breasts, and don't mind sitting through this garbage.

Film directors one and all want us to believe it's all doom and gloom what with asteroids zooming around haphazardly in space, aliens needing to ravage us and the planet, global warming screwing up the weather or some deadly virus escaping some government lab infecting mankind with a super flu. Thom Eberhardt doesn't quite find it such a dreary proposition, and in fact finds quite a bit of humor in the situation by way of telling the story of two of the survivors, teenagers Reggie Belmont (Catherine Mary Stuart) and her sister Sam (Kelli Maroney).Somewhere out there in the final frontier where no man has gone before, is a comet zipping around with nothing better to do but to pay all of us here on earth a quick friendly visit. No, it doesn't exactly have earth's name on it, but it does want to take a cue from Top Gun and do a major fly by just so it can get up close and personal. Of course since we're a partying kind of planet, we decide to have one big planet wide comet festival just to welcome it into our solar system. There are comet tee shirts, comet hats, people have comet barbecues, and everything is just one big comet celebration. One of these comet parties is being held by Doris Belmont, wicked step monster to Reggie and Sam. Reggie and Sam's father is off doing army duty, and it's left up to Doris to keep the two girls safe and out of trouble, or as in Doris's case be a first class bitch while screwing the next door neighbor on the side. After an argument with Doris, Reggie ends up in a projection room at a local theater, and Sam ends up&#133;.well more about that in a moment. Eventually the comet does pass overhead, and being the grateful kind of comet that knows how to treat its host, it leaves us all a present by turning the vast majority of the human population into orange pixie dust.Of course, if you happen to be one of the very lucky few, like Reggie and Sam, you may have survived. It turns out if you were in a dwelling of some sort completely encased by steel, then you also woke up the next morning to see the dawn's early light. Reggie, having spent the night in the theater projection room which just happens to be steel lined, does survive. Sam, who found herself somehow spending the night in a trash dumpster survives also. However, if you were only partially protected by a steel enclosure, then you only get to survive temporarily which also means you get to play zombie for a while before you disintegrate into a pile of dust bunnies. Then there are those scientists who were aware of the danger but instead of warning us all to momentarily hop into our Kenmore refrigerators, they built themselves a huge enclosure to protect themselves with. So not only are they extremely selfish scientists, they are also straight out of the Fred MacMurray School of Absent Minded Professors because although I'm sure they wear their seat belts and lock their car doors, they somehow forget to close the vents on their Comet Proof Bomb Shelter. What that means is they need to track down Sam, Reggie and other survivors who may pop up here and there in order to find a cure before they have to begin their own auditions for George Romero.If it all sounds kind of goofy and wacky it certainly is all of that. Early in the film, you may have a bit of trouble buying into the proceedings but you'll eventually be seduced by the perkiness and charm of Stuart and Mulroney, and the witty dialog that inhabits Eberhardt's script. For instance, when Reggie returns with an arsenal to fight off zombies, Reggie complains that, `Dad would have gotten us Uzis'. And what are two teenage girls to do when faced with the apocalypse? They play D.J. on the only radio station still broadcasting, they vie for the affection of the only guy available, and they lift their spirits by going shopping at the mall to the music of Girls Just Want to Have Fun. As for special effects, they aren't much to speak of but we don't care because it's the script carrying the film anyway. It's obvious that Eberhardt was working from a somewhat miniscule budget, and although there are a few scary moments when Zombies pop out of nowhere, it's the whole premise of two Valley Girls trying to survive in a desolate Los Angels while being chase around by monsters and evil scientists that will win you over. It's obvious from the narration in the opening moments that this is a B movie, but Eberhardt keeps things on track by never taking himself seriously or asking us to which is a major requirement in a film of this nature.Night of the Comet is not currently available on VHS or DVD. You may catch it on Cable at some point if you don't own it. Your only other alternative is to purchase it on Ebay at your own risk. I was lucky enough to have taped it some years ago, and am glad of having done so.It takes an offbeat sense of humor to make a film like Night of the Comets and have it succeed as well as it does. It takes a quirky sense of humor for someone watching it to appreciate the film for what it is a cheesy plot-hole ridden B movie, with a lot of odd but good natured humor and with two lead actresses that are good enough to take us along for the ride. I bought it, hook, line, sinker, cheap special effects and everything else that went with it.

Known for his extravagant camera angles and complex traveling shots, he also tried his hand at low-budget documentary-like film-making (THE WRONG MAN) and B-movie exploitation (PSYCHO). And he was not above taking a gimmick and working to make it seem more like creative genius. With REAR WINDOW, virtually all the action happens within one room or within the sight of a wheelchair bound man in that room. In LIFEBOAT, everything happens on that small craft adrift at sea. With REAR WINDOW and LIFEBOAT, Hitchcock made the gimmicks work because the restrictions actually made sense within the context of the stories being told. With ROPE, Hitch is on shakier ground, because the gimmick isn't justified within the context of the story. Though Hitchcock didn't give himself enough rope to hang himself, he did come up with enough to tie his own hands. ROPE is basically a filmed stage play (not unlike the live TV dramas of 1950s). The action, a murder mystery, takes place approximately within real time. Hitchcock's self-imposed challenge was to make it seem like it was all filmed in one continuous take with one mobile camera -- not really possible since movie cameras couldn't film more than 8 to 10 minutes at a time. Hitchcock contrived to hide edits from one take to the next by ending and beginning scenes with the shot passing over a dark or neutral surface.Hitchcock further complicated the entire affair by having the story unfold before a panoramic window with a cityscape in the background, thus forcing his crew to duplicate the timing and imagery of moving clouds and a setting sun. As such, ROPE is less a movie than an elaborate cinematic Rube Goldberg gadget. It is a series of mechanical devices and clever bits of trickery that ultimately don't amount to much to a casual viewer, but which gave Hitchcock the joy of building an elaborate toy. ROPE's story isn't all that compelling, though it does have it's moments. In a Leopold and Loeb twist, the story involves two supposedly brilliant college students, Phillip and Brandon (Farley Granger and John Dall), who believe themselves to be superior individuals to the point of being above both the law and common morality. As such, they feel they have the moral right to kill anyone who, in their view, is an inferior. Thus (in possibly the most unconvincing murder you will ever see in any movie), they strangle a college friend just moments before they hold a small dinner party in which they have invited a few of the young man's friends and relatives. Their private joke is that the young man's body is hidden in a chest that the two killers use as a buffet table for serving their guests. The dinner party is also a ghoulish wake. This is a pretty macabre story, more in tune with the Alfred Hitchcock Presents... TV series than with his films of the era. While the murder victim's girlfriend, aunt and father sit worrying about the whereabouts of the missing man, Dall's Brandon makes jokes about his victim and taunts his guests with vague references to his crime. For some reason, Brandon thinks tricking a man into unknowingly eating a meal off his own son's coffin is a supreme joke and the perfect way to prove his intellectual superiority. It would be hard to find a criminal more coldly amoral than Brandon.Behind the storytelling gimmick and beyond the sick joke of the dinner party, Hitchcock does tackle some pretty daring stuff. It is, for one thing, something of a commentary on the fascism of Hitler's Germany (though Phillip and Brandon apparently think they are even superior to Hitler's Aryan nation). Also, to play the part of Prof. Rupert Cadell, Phillip and Brandon's mentor, the man whose theories they take to the extreme, Hitchcock uses Jimmy Stewart, Hollywood's all-American boy. Was it Hitchcock's private joke to make the boy-next-door Stewart the character who voices enthusiasm for acceptable acts of murder, or was it Hitchcock's commentary that such amoral ideas could even come from a boy-next-door. Either way, it is more creepy than amusing to hear Stewart suggest an organized method for killing off undesirable individuals. (Instead of killing head waiters, landlords and tap dancers, imagine him suggesting killing Jews, gypsies and the mentally disabled.) One suspects that Hitchcock was also challenging himself to see just how far he could go in exploring homosexual themes. It is made obvious that Phillip and Brandon, and possibly even Prof. Cadell, are gay. This may just be because the film is patterned after the crimes of Leopold and Loeb, but more likely Hitchcock was attracted to the material more by the characters' deviant sexuality then by their deviant morality. On the one hand, Phillip and Brandon's relationship is obvious and accepted without question by the small group of intellectual friends they entertain. Yet, there is the inescapable implication that their homosexuality is somehow intertwined with their contempt for basic human values. Even the discussion of the murder has sexual overtones. Perhaps that is how the film got past the censors; it seems that homosexuality simply underscores the characters' evil.Despite Hitchcock's puckish desire to play around with and even contradict his own theories on film-making, ROPE doesn't really work very well. Perhaps revealing its theatrical roots, the basic story seems contrived and unconvincing, just as its attempts at humor seem forced. Hitchcock may have been so absorbed working out the complex logistics of filming the story that he didn't notice that the story itself was undeserving of all the commotion. A bigger problem however may be the acting. Dall's villain quickly takes on a Snidely Whiplash quality and Granger's tendency toward theatrical hysterics doesn't supply a suitable counterbalance. And Stewart (in a role originally offered to Cary Grant, though more suited for James Mason) is just simply miscast. ROPE is what it is and what it was meant to be, a stunt. As such it has little value to a casual viewer who just wants to see a tidy little thriller. But for film buffs, who understand Hitchcock's self-imposed puzzle, it has a unique curiosity factor.

Overall I didn't like this for two reasons1 - The pace of the film is really disturbing. It starts in a very interesting and introductory pace. You start to understand what is going on, the characters involved, and so on... But then as if there was no more time or money to make it a decent flic the pace feels like David Cronenberg was in a hurry for lunch. Everything just starts to get really fast-paced and rather ailing.....2 - Jude Law's interpretation is disappointing.

But this is not your ordinary western. The movie's greatness stems from the fact that it realistically shows how hard it is for an ordinary person to actually kill a man. Clint Eastwood, playing the legendary killer William Munny, tells the shaken kid wanting to be his protege it's a hell of a thing to kill a man. You take away everything he has and everything he would have. It's not like most movies where people shoot and get shot as simply as eating a ham sandwich. This movie shows the wrenching impact of killing from the perspective of the people with a gun in their hand the shaking hands, the quivering jaw, the terror. It also shows that the good killer is not the fastest, or the strongest, he's the one who is steady as other men blink in fear.
