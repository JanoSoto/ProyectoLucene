Anyway to start this short review, lets have a look at the story, we have Kevin McCallister, the child of (even though they never say) rich couple who are going on a vacation to Paris, in the madness of trying to get out of the house, the leave Kevin behind. Then we have some burglars who want to rob the place, and Kevin must defend his house. Now, i found this to be believable but some of the things that happen throughout the story are strange, such as (i think) we sometimes see the world as Kevin sees it such as the Oven(?) downstairs and Old Man Marley at the grocery store. These were just some unusual points in the movie, which is nor a good or bad thing. You could say the whole movie is about growing up and becoming more selfless rather than being selfish, and this is a good message to tell, it also seems to make an entertaining movie. Onto directing, what can i say Chris Columbus is a good director when it comes to kids films, he is definitely a safe choice. Now i think i will mention a few mistakes in the movie i noticed such as- Buzz could not have seen Old Man Marley from where he was standing, as the curtains were half closed and Old Man Marley was on the far right, not in the middle of the window, therefore Buzz could never had seen him. Also one other thing, was the church scene sort of like in Kevin's mind showing Old Man Marley coming from the dark, scary side over to Kevin's light, nice side, just what i saw in the lighting. Anyway to sum up the film i personally think it is one of the best kids films out there and is a must watch for everybody. Home Alone gets a 7\/10.

Sometimes it would just cut out at a seemingly random point in a scene and insert you into another random point in a scene without any style. Charles Bronson is wooden. He definitely shouldn't have been cast in this role, this movie was meant to be too dramatic for him. For a combat veteran he seemed kind of shaky after fighting off a mugger.

While Les passes his test driving on the road,he fails his computer exam. Although Les has no license and is in trouble with his parents,Les decides to take his Grandfather's Cadillac and go on a joyride with his friends Dean(Corey Feldman)and Charles(Michael Manasseri)and Les' dream girl Mercedes Lane(Heather Graham). It's going to be a wild night of laughs and insanity Les and the Cadillac.License To Drive is a terrific and hilarious Teen Comedy and is one of the better Teen movies of the 1980s that was the second movie starring the two Corey's Corey Haim and Corey Feldman and for 88 minutes offers nothing but fun and laughs. It's a movie that isn't trying to be thought-provoking or inventive,it's just a movie that tells you to turn off your brain for a while and just come along for the ride(no pun intended). License To Drive is a movie that is from the very start is outlandish and takes the viewer on a wild journey that gets more insane and over the top with a relentless energy and never stops until the end. This movie doesn't rely on realism or true life accuracy just lighthearted fun that will have you laughing. And while License To Drive maybe a little predictable and have tons of trademarks and familiar aspects that are in other Teen movies you as the viewer are entertained throughout and there is never a dull moment. The Comedy and laughs in License To Drive are funny and memorable because the Comedy has a wonderful balance of being simple one minute and being surreal and ridiculous the next with some characters and moments that are exaggerated and with dialog that is witty and clever. The Comedy and laughs are nonstop and incredible. What also makes License To Drive work so well is the structure of the film which is two sections. The first section is showing Les trying to ask out Mercedes and taking his driving test at the DMV and trying to get his license. The scenes at the DMV as well as Les driving on the road are pure Comedy gold and we as the viewer relate to Les' nervousness of trying to get a license. The second section of the film is about Les' joyride in the Cadillac with Mercedes and his friends and taking a big risk driving without a license. With the second section Les and his Grandfather's Cadillac take a lot bumps and bruises and even gets into a car chase which is one of the funniest moments in the film. The moments in the second section make the moments the first half look normal and regular in comparison and things get much worse for Les and the Cadillac. You can almost say that the second half of the movie is not only a Comedy but also an adventure with laughs,thrills and stunts. When we see the main character Les Anderson and the chaos that he has to deal with we connect and relate to him because he's a typical teenager who is in a crazy situation that is beyond his control and when we watch the film we are in the car with him and we see what he sees and we as the viewer all ask will he get the car back to his house before his parents find out? When you see the film you will find out what happens. The ending of License To Drive is truly wonderful,hilarious and filled with surprises and laughs that will put smiles on viewers faces. A great ending.The cast is great. Corey Haim is terrific and hilarious as Les Anderson,with Haim bringing Humor and a likable charm to the role. Corey Feldman is wonderful and funny as Dean,Les' friend with Feldman having great scenes with Haim. Richard Masur(Mr Anderson)and Carol Kane(Mrs. Anderson)are fantastic as Les' parents. Heather Graham is great and beautiful as Mercedes,Les' dream girl. James Avery is outstanding and funny as Les' DMV examiner. Helen Hanft is sensational as Miss Hellberg,a woman that works at the DMV. Michael Manasseri is memorable as Charles,Les' other friend. Nina Siemaszko does a fine job as Natalie Anderson,Les' twin sister. Parley Bear(Grandpa Anderson),Christopher Burton(Rudy Anderson),Grant Heslov(Karl),M.A Nickles(Paolo)and Harry Alan Miller(Drunk Driver)give good performances as well.The direction by Greg Beeman is great with Beeman always moving the camera and giving the movie a wonderful style and pace. Fantastic direction,Beeman.The score by Jay Fergusan is good,light and matches the film perfectly. The soundtrack is sensational with songs by Billy Ocean(Get Outta My Dreams,Get Into My Car),New Edition(Crucial),Frank Sinatra(That's Life,Strangers In The Night),Nia Peeples(Trouble),INXS(New Sensation),DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince(Jazzy's In The House),Belinda Carlisle(I Feel Free)and more.In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies or The Two Coreys,I highly suggest you see License To Drive,a wonderful and hilarious Teen Comedy from the 1980s that is worth your time.

For the first time, we see the dazzling heights James Bond would reach occasionally, and this is a riveting, razor sharp cold war thriller with heaps of escapism, suspense and soul. Take that Jason Bourne!

It was released at a time in the early 70's when the Hollywood studios were systematically releasing a number of highly controversial, violent films such as Straw Dogs, Deliverance and Dirty Harry. It was withdrawn from public circulation by the director himself in the UK for 27 years, only becoming available again after his death. The reason for the self-imposed ban was the result of reports of some violent incidents where thugs appeared to be acting under the influence of the film itself and the Kubrick's themselves even received death threats too. It really was a film that touched a nerve that's for sure.It was based on an excellent novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess, a book made so brilliant in that its narrator Alex speaks throughout in the Nadsat slang which was an invented form of youth-speak of the near future, influenced by Russian; at the time it was written we were in the midst of the cold war and it was not unreasonably thought that Russian culture would seep through in the years that followed. Burgess was famously unhappy with Kubrick's adaption, seeing it as revelling in the sex and violence at the expense of the point he was making. In fact, the novel had been released in the United States in a different version to elsewhere, missing out the epilogue in which Alex concedes the error of his ways and decides to leave his life of violence behind. Kubrick had only read the American version and his film also missed out this final section much to Burgess's annoyance. In truth, the book would have worked better without Burgess ending, as it comes across as a little too idealistic and doesn't square very well with what has gone before. Needless to say, I think the film works better without it and in fact makes its central point far clearer too, i.e. Alex is inherently bad but this is a lesser evil than him being artificially good. Whatever the case, both book and film are marvellous.It is a dark satire set in the near future where a young hoodlum called Alex and his gang of Droogs spend their nights fighting, raping and pillaging. Alex is eventually caught and imprisoned. He puts himself forward for an experimental aversion therapy procedure called the Ludovico technique that is designed to make sociopathic individuals experience feelings of terror when they have violent thoughts. The state's solution is ultimately seen as another form of violence as opposed to a true solution.A Clockwork Orange is extremely stylised. Visually it's beautifully shot as you would expect from Kubrick. The sets alternate from the dreary to garish bad taste. Many places are decorated by strange, disturbing erotic art. The costumes are really great too, especially the iconic retro-futuristic styles worn by the Droogs. While soaring above everything is the incredibly distinctive soundtrack from Wendy Carlos - the electronic music used here was cutting edge at the time and went on to influence a whole cycle of synth groups in the late 70's \/ early 80's &#x96; it is really original sounding and considerably helps creating the distinctive world of the film; the moody, ominous main theme is particularly brilliant and futuristic versions of Beethoven are very unusual too. Acting is very stylised throughout but Malcolm McDowell truly shines in one of the most charismatic screen performances of all time. If you read the novel after seeing the film it is well-nigh impossible to do so without McDowell's tones ringing through your Gulliver&#x85;I mean head! Ultimately, I love this film but still find it somewhat disturbing to watch for several reasons. It's really rather unpleasant quite a lot of the time in actual fact but really I suppose that's the point.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"25 July 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Before 1985, Karen Blixen was not a widely known figure in the English- speaking world, even though she was an English-language writer as well as a Danish-language one. Indeed, she was best known as Isak Dinesen, having oddly adopted a male pseudonym, even though it was quite obvious that the author of the autobiographical Out of Africa was a woman. After the film came out, new editions of Blixen's novels were on the shelves of all the bookshops, generally credited to Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen). The cultural influence of Hollywood can be positive as well as negative. The film is based on Blixen's best-known book, telling the story of her life in Kenya, to which she and her husband Bror had moved to take up farming, between 1913 and the early 1930s. The book also tells of Karen's relationship with the large white settler community in the colony, her divorce from Bror and her love affair with the big-game hunter Denys Finch Hatton.Although the real Finch Hatton was an English aristocrat, Robert Redford here plays him with an American accent, although he is never referred to as an American in the film and the audience is probably supposed to accept him as British; he takes part in British military operations in 1914, at a time when America was still neutral. Apparently Redford wanted to play the part with an English accent but this was vetoed by director Sydney Pollack, who found Redford's accent unconvincing. This piece of miscasting was much criticised in Britain. It is certainly received wisdom that no film can do well at the American box-office without at least one major Hollywood star in the cast, but this film already had such a star in the shape of Meryl Streep. Pollack probably just wanted to do a good turn to an old friend; he and Redford had previously worked together on several films. Streep's own accent (I haad a faarm in Aafrika....) has been criticised for sounding insufficiently Danish and also praised, Leaving that controversy aside, however, her performance here, for which she received an Oscar nomination, is well up to her usual standards. It seems odd that Pollack originally did not want to use her on the grounds that she did not have enough sex appeal, as there is no reason why Karen Blixen needs to be played as a sexy glamour girl. She was, however, evidently a woman of intelligence and humanity, and these are qualities which Streep is well able to convey. Klaus Maria Brandauer is generally better acting in his native German, but this is one of his better English-language performances, making Bror seem a likable rogue even when we learn just how badly he has treated his wife. Pollack was able to direct films in several different styles, and Out of Africa is very different in terms of its pacing and visual style to his earlier films like This Property is Condemned, The Electric Horseman and Tootsie. It was made as a grand, sweeping epic, similar in style to works by British directors like David Lean and Richard Attenborough whose Gandhi had come a couple of years before. It was perhaps a brave move on Pollock's part to make a film of this nature. Lean had come rather unstuck the previous year when he attempted to use this style for A Passage for India, an intimate story of human relations rather than of the great political or military events which had formed the backdrop to his earlier epics. Out of Africa tells, if anything, an even more intimate story than Lean's film, the story of a woman and the two men she loved. And yet, for me, it works in a way in which A Passage to India does not. I think that the reason is that, whereas the likes of Gandhi and Dr Zhivago are great historical epics, Out of Africa is a great geographical epic. In this it is comparable to some of the great American Westerns, such as Wyler's The Big Country, or Luhrmann's more recent Australia. Although there are some big historical set pieces, such as the victory celebration at the end of World War One, the film is really as much about the African continent and its landscapes, wildlife and indigenous people- Karen befriends the local Kikuyu people who are patronised or neglected by the other Europeans- as it is about colonialism or about the story of Karen and Denys.Streep did not win Best Actress- she lost out to Geraldine Page- but the film received seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director for Pollack and Best Cinematography.

Indeed, she was best known as Isak Dinesen, having oddly adopted a male pseudonym, even though it was quite obvious that the author of the autobiographical Out of Africa was a woman. After the film came out, new editions of Blixen's novels were on the shelves of all the bookshops, generally credited to Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen). The cultural influence of Hollywood can be positive as well as negative. The film is based on Blixen's best-known book, telling the story of her life in Kenya, to which she and her husband Bror had moved to take up farming, between 1913 and the early 1930s. The book also tells of Karen's relationship with the large white settler community in the colony, her divorce from Bror and her love affair with the big-game hunter Denys Finch Hatton.Although the real Finch Hatton was an English aristocrat, Robert Redford here plays him with an American accent, although he is never referred to as an American in the film and the audience is probably supposed to accept him as British; he takes part in British military operations in 1914, at a time when America was still neutral. Apparently Redford wanted to play the part with an English accent but this was vetoed by director Sydney Pollack, who found Redford's accent unconvincing. This piece of miscasting was much criticised in Britain. It is certainly received wisdom that no film can do well at the American box-office without at least one major Hollywood star in the cast, but this film already had such a star in the shape of Meryl Streep. Pollack probably just wanted to do a good turn to an old friend; he and Redford had previously worked together on several films. Streep's own accent (I haad a faarm in Aafrika....) has been criticised for sounding insufficiently Danish and also praised, Leaving that controversy aside, however, her performance here, for which she received an Oscar nomination, is well up to her usual standards. It seems odd that Pollack originally did not want to use her on the grounds that she did not have enough sex appeal, as there is no reason why Karen Blixen needs to be played as a sexy glamour girl. She was, however, evidently a woman of intelligence and humanity, and these are qualities which Streep is well able to convey. Klaus Maria Brandauer is generally better acting in his native German, but this is one of his better English-language performances, making Bror seem a likable rogue even when we learn just how badly he has treated his wife. Pollack was able to direct films in several different styles, and Out of Africa is very different in terms of its pacing and visual style to his earlier films like This Property is Condemned, The Electric Horseman and Tootsie. It was made as a grand, sweeping epic, similar in style to works by British directors like David Lean and Richard Attenborough whose Gandhi had come a couple of years before. It was perhaps a brave move on Pollock's part to make a film of this nature. Lean had come rather unstuck the previous year when he attempted to use this style for A Passage for India, an intimate story of human relations rather than of the great political or military events which had formed the backdrop to his earlier epics. Out of Africa tells, if anything, an even more intimate story than Lean's film, the story of a woman and the two men she loved. And yet, for me, it works in a way in which A Passage to India does not. I think that the reason is that, whereas the likes of Gandhi and Dr Zhivago are great historical epics, Out of Africa is a great geographical epic. In this it is comparable to some of the great American Westerns, such as Wyler's The Big Country, or Luhrmann's more recent Australia. Although there are some big historical set pieces, such as the victory celebration at the end of World War One, the film is really as much about the African continent and its landscapes, wildlife and indigenous people- Karen befriends the local Kikuyu people who are patronised or neglected by the other Europeans- as it is about colonialism or about the story of Karen and Denys.Streep did not win Best Actress- she lost out to Geraldine Page- but the film received seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director for Pollack and Best Cinematography.

Although it is not as cleverly crafted nor as strangely terrifying as Mr. Hooper's first outing; it does have some redeemable qualities. The part that works the best to this picture's credit is the idea of which it focuses on. Funhouses are never what they promise, anywhere. The only intent funhouses are made for are to have fun by being creeped out. Nobody really goes there for actual fun and games.Well not according to these characters. Meet Amy (Elizabeth Berridge) a young teen girl looking to have fun with her hotshot boyfriend Buzz (Cooper Huckabee) and two other friends. Together they head out to the local carnival that's running in town and decide to be there snobbish young selves. Adding to that particular attitude is completely ignoring her parents wishes of not attending the carnival since there were some issues with it from the year before. Oh but no harm should come this time, it was all a misunderstanding - sure. Protagonist wise there isn't any particular actor that stands out. Lawrence Block's screenplay is at best average. It has interesting ideas but doesn't bother to conclude them with much closure except for its main plot.Funny thing is that Block only wrote for one other production and that was the failed and now cheap looking Captain America (1990). But perhaps even stranger is that there are various elements to the story that are similar to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). Specifically that some characters have the Southern accents, work as a family and do not have normal lives. All very similar to the cannibal family that Leatherface belonged to. The man in charge of this family is The Barker (Kevin Conway - who would play better roles later on his career). Conway is probably the best part when it came to characters but sadly he was underused. Along with Conway were other strange characters that appeared from time to time.

Some of the vintage props look great because by today they look rather creepy. But there were also other items that felt like something today's funhouses would include too. The best particular scene would be the chase in the basement. That was creepier than the actual funhouse. Andrew Laszlo's cinematography, the guy behind First Blood (1982) got some nice shots of the carnival but once inside the funhouse, nothing was really interesting.

(The fact that the 2006 2Entertain DVD I watched it on presents the film in 43 aspect with less than great picture quality also undoubtedly helped to contribute to the video nasty feel!)It's a British and Spanish co-production, although the only evidence of British involvement on screen is the presences of Messrs Lee and Cushing, a fact not lost on the writers. In my favourite moment it is suggested to the British leads that one of them might be the monster that is killing people off on board the titular express train. This is an allegation they refute with an argument that consists entirely of looking indignant and explaining in two words that this couldn't possibly be case because We're British! We British might be a little bit emotionally stifled,but we're not the kind of people that would turn into a prehistoric ape man come alive from a 2,000 year-old fossil, that may or may not be Satan himself or may or may not be an alien spaceman, and that is killing selected passengers on board a trans-continental express train journeying across Russia. That by the way is the plot, together with some remarkably strange science along the way that tells us people's memories are either stored in the fluid in their eyeballs or stored in the creases in their brains (which brains will therefore become completely smooth if one is unlucky enough to have one's memories sucked out through one's eyeballs). Also amongst the strange ideas that are shoe-horned into the film's shortish (83 minutes) running time, at the expense of overall coherence, are a mad monk who converts from devotion to God to devotion to Satan with a remarkable rapidity and a police inspector with one hairy arm who nobody notices as a consequence keeps one of his hands permanently in his pocket. We also get Telly Savalas who stars a Cossack Captain and does his menacing-holding-his-cigarette-in-a funny-way-persona (much as he did for his depiction of Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service) for maybe about 15 minutes of the film's running time before being turned into a zombie! So all in all a film well worth a watch if you like that kind of thing!

The reasons for this are partly aesthetic (Vulgar razzamatazz!), partly nationalist (Vulgar Yankee razzamatazz!) and partly feminist. (Shouldn't women play a more active role in sport than dressing in skimpy costumes and standing on the sidelines to cheer on the men?)It would, however, appear from Bring It On that this last objection is also shared by some Americans, as cheerleading has now become a competitive sport in its own right, a sport which, moreover, is open to mixed-sex teams. (I often wonder if competitive cheerleading teams ever have their own non-competitive cheerleaders to cheer them on). The film is set in the fictitious Rancho Carne High School in San Diego, California. There is a running joke that the school's football team, the Toros, are a useless bunch of losers who get soundly thrashed in every game they play, but the school's cheerleading squad, who nominally exist to cheer on the hopeless Toros, are brilliant- in fact they are the reigning national cheerleading champions. The main character in the film is Torrance Shipman, the captain of the cheerleading squad. Despite that male-sounding name, Torrance is a girl. (The squad might be mixed-sex, but the film concentrates far more on the female members than the male ones). In fact, virtually all the female cheerleaders have forenames that sound either sexually ambiguous or even distinctly masculine, generally surnames that have been pressed into service as baptismal names- Torrance, Carver, Whitney, Courtney, Casey, Darcy. There are so many that I wondered if the scriptwriter was indulging in some satire at the eccentric naming habits of American parents. About the only squad member with a recognisably feminine Christian name is Missy (a diminutive of Melissa), but she is an outsider who has recently moved to the school from Los Angeles. Torrance's reign as captain gets off to a bad start when the aforementioned Carver is injured during a training session. Torrance is keen to recruit the aforementioned Missy, who possesses impressive athletic skills, but Missy, a gymnast at her former school, holds to the vulgar razzamatazz opinion of cheerleading, and only joins the squad (with great reluctance) when she learns that Rancho Carne does not have its own gymnastics team. Missy, however, brings bad news with her. The team's cheerleading routines have all been stolen by their previous captain from an inner-city Los Angeles team, the Clovers. (Intellectual property theft is not, it would appear, actually forbidden in the cheerleading world, although it is strongly deprecated). Other plot lines involve a love-triangle between Torrance, her unreliable boyfriend Aaron and Missy's handsome brother Cliff, and the emergence of the Clovers as Rancho Carne's main rivals at the national finals. I suspect that the original intention was to make the Clovers Irish-American; their clover-leaf emblem recalling the shamrock, their leprechaun-like mascot and their green-and-orange uniforms all suggest Irish associations. In the film, however, they are African-American whereas the Rancho Carne squad are (apart from a token Chinese girl) all Caucasian; doubtless someone thought that a black-versus-white clash would be more dramatic. Kirsten Dunst is neither an outstanding actress nor a striking beauty, yet she has become a popular figure in Hollywood movies, probably because of her ability to project a girl-next-door sweetness. (She even played Marie Antoinette as a girl-next-door Queen of France). This film is a good example of this ability; despite her juggling of two boys we always think of Torrance as the Nice Girl figure. (And, of course, one of the boys turns out to be unworthy of her innocent niceness). It helps that Kirsten, a former child-star, was only eighteen when the film was made, whereas Gabrielle Union, who plays the Clovers' captain Isis, was a full decade older, in keeping with the normal movie convention that the school leaving age is around 30. Of the other acting contributions the only ones worthy of mention are Eliza Dushku's rather truculent Missy and Ian Roberts as Sparky Polastri, the arrogant, self-obsessed choreographer brought in to coach the cheerleaders. The film will probably please fans of organised competitive cheerleading (who are, as I said, more likely to be found across the Atlantic than on this side), and it must be said that the routines are often performed with some energy and skill. Overall, however, this is just another clichéd sporting drama about triumph and tragedy and rivalry and friendship on the sports field and love and romance off it. (See the recent British Fast Girls for another example of the same thing, albeit about a more mainstream sport).

The highlight segment is What Happens During Ejaculation?, it's the most quotable and most consistently funny of the seven and with its surreal quality is visually the most imaginative as well. In conclusion, uneven but of the seven segments only two are misses, the others are either ones with shortcomings but have enough to make them work or strong hits. 7.5\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Comedy"}]
