However, Planet of the Apes isn't the best work he's accomplished in his career, but despite my gripes, it's worth a viewing. One complaint I've heard is that it was nothing like the original, but nor was it supposed to be. It is a revisiting, not a re-make. Visually, I found the movie stunning. The costumes (compliments of Burton's long-time collaborator Colleen Atwood)were innovative in distinctive, Rick Baker's ape make-up was absolutely incredible, and the special-effects were very up-to-date and realistic (and see this in a theatre with a good sound system, ladies and gentlemen; the sound is rich and full). And last but certainly not least, Tim Burton certainly polished it with his wonderfully unmistakable style, and I'm glad the movie seems to be raking in the bucks, for Burton's sake. He is an underappreciated artist, and there's nothing like a Burton movie.My complaints? Well, first of all, I was upset the Danny Elfman's score got virtually buried under the sound of explosions and such, although from what I heard, it wasn't his best work either. The characters were grossly underdeveloped and the good aspects of the plot were those taken from the original, like the watered-down metaphor it creates of society in general. The screenplay was really nothing special, and I wonder how the writers sat down and wrote such unoriginal drivel when their point in going about this film was to adapt the story their own way but make it as good as the original film. They should consider themselves lucky (the writers, that is, and by the way, they are the same guys who produced such masterpieces as Mighty Joe Young...) that Twentieth Century Fox hired Burton to convey the story to film in his own vision and that the actors were, for the most-part, fine artists. Although I found Mark Wahlberg's (Leo Davidson) acting wooden and unfelt, there wasn't much one could do with the character, I suppose. Estella Warren as Daena was nothing more than a pretty face and her acting was not impressive in the least, but what can be expected of a model turned actress?. It was refreshing to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role where there are no parasols and corsets, and she was fairly impressive in the role of the sympathetic ape Ari. Paul Giamatti (Limbo) was hilarious and added a nice touch to the heavy plot, but he couldn't redeem the screenplay, and Michael Clark Duncan (Attar) was just big and scary! Finally, Tim Roth, as always, gave an exquisite performance as the villainous Gen. Thade. His bad guys are always wonderful, but he was so delightfully sinister in this one (I think it may have been the prosthetic make-up, too, but he's a superb actor!) My MAJOR criticism would have to be the ending. I wondered what it would be like, since the original film's end was so ingenious, and I had heard that Burton filmed 5 versions before the filmmakers chose this one. I would be interested in seeing the remaining 4, seeing as I didn't care much for this one. I won't give it away, but it really confused the HELL outta me for a long time, and after discussing it with lots of different people, we came to a theory that is probably wrong, but it is still unimpressive. Honestly, I believe the the fina scene is there purely for shock value.  Here I quote John Hiscock from The Daily Telegraph (London)  Even Burton found the final scene difficult to explain. 'Movies should be open to interpretation,' he said, gesturing wildly. 'You have to go to the overall mythology of Planet of the Apes. It's about the unexplainable. It's trying to put a symbol and face to something that can't be fully explained.'  Well, if even the O Holy Burton can't put it to words, I won't even try.  There will never be an ending like seeing the Statue of Liberty right there on the beach...it's chilling. If this version's ending had been explained a bit better, maybe it could have been received better, but the general concensus in the theatre was, Huh?? I guess the producers just want to see if they can milk a sequel out of this one too so they can make a quick buck...I hope to God Burton doesn't direct it, for his own sake. I would hate to have him mixed up in something that would definitely be so awful if those writers remained. Ugh. ANYWAY, I know my complaints seem more passionate than the things I LIKED about this movie, but I did enjoy it, actually. I recommend it, and if you don't like it, yippee for you, but at least you opened your mind (and your wallet, too, but oh, well.) I never thought I'd give a Burton movie anything but a 10 out of 10, but I give Planet of the Apes a 8 out of 10. Hats off to Burton for trying to redeem the lamentable script, though.

First off, one of my main problems with Clockwork Orange is that it underestimates the intelligence of the audience by repeating its messages again and again and again.  In 1971, it probably would've fit right in with the time because no one had really seen a movie so extreme but I think that in current times, it's not so uncommon to think the messages of Clockwork (such as the creulty of the government and to find correctional programs hypocratic).  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for extremes, but I think when you look at A Clockwork Orange, it's not all that extreme when viewed next to Fight Club.  The repetition in Clockwork actually has a dull  effect on the over all intensity (sorry about that but it's just the theory of relativity).  I think that if the audience's intelligence wasn't underestimated, the movie could've been made much better.The fact that Clockwork Orange is still a very good movie is aw inspiring and a sign that it's not completely a trend, but I think that when looked upon as an equal with other movies made, it's hard to say it's the best movie ever made.  I use Fight Club as an example of a better movie because it's in the same psychological category.As far as raw entertainment, the movie isn't bad at all although some movies still surpass.  To tell you the truth, I still can't get enough of The Fifth Element so I'd have to say that that movie beats it in the entertaining department.I think #55 spot on the top 250 films is right on the spot.  It's not __too__ strong a movie but it's extremely well made and it gets its point across simply (although I'd personally prefer a more complex Usual suspects type movie).So, sit back and enjoy Kubrick's awesome tale of rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven (and don't forget to bask in all the nudity while it still doesn't make you sick).

First off, one of my main problems with Clockwork Orange is that it underestimates the intelligence of the audience by repeating its messages again and again and again.  In 1971, it probably would've fit right in with the time because no one had really seen a movie so extreme but I think that in current times, it's not so uncommon to think the messages of Clockwork (such as the creulty of the government and to find correctional programs hypocratic).  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for extremes, but I think when you look at A Clockwork Orange, it's not all that extreme when viewed next to Fight Club.  The repetition in Clockwork actually has a dull  effect on the over all intensity (sorry about that but it's just the theory of relativity).

The sense of mystery as they enter the jungle is great, and this scene brings the first classic moments, but there is a terrible under-reaction to a stegosaurus that almost undermines the whole thing.  Admittedly, these guys have witnessed some strange stuff on the island already, but finding a prehistoric creature deserves better than `Say, look at that!'This pattern of great-bit\/crap-bit stays throughout the film and becomes increasingly frustrating.  There is a terrific moment where Kong tries to kill his pursuers, tipping them off a log bridge and letting them fall to their deaths.  A particularly tense moment comes when one of the crew hides in a small cave and Kong tries to grab him, and this is followed by a great battle between Kong and another of the island's huge creatures.  But then the cack sets in, as the same scene is repeated over and over again; Kong gets jumped by a monster, Kong puts Wray down, Kong fights monster, Kong wins, Kong picks up Wray and carries on walking, Kong gets jumped...  It undermines the first such scene, and shows that there is very little that can happen between the kidnap and rescue.Luckily, the film moves on by reversing the situation as Kong is defeated then taken back to America to be put on show, but logic takes a bathroom break again as it takes only one gas bomb to take him down, while the steg took three.  Inevitably, Kong breaks free and goes on a rampage through the city in search of Wray, and again the movie gets its arse in gear.  His attack on the train is stunning, as is the moment when he plucks a woman out of her apartment, then drops her carelessly to the ground as he realises she is not the woman he wants.

Because people are not always whom or what they appear to be, which is the case in `The Spanish Prisoner,' written and directed by David Mamet.  As can be expected in a Mamet story, the con is on once again, and this time it involves a certain valuable formula developed by a man named Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) for a company run by a Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara).  It's a formula that will put them ahead of the Japanese for the next three to five years, and during that time it's going to make everyone in the company very rich.  Only two people have access to the formula, which is written on Xerox-proof paper and kept in a safe Joe and Mr. Klein.  Joe, however, is somewhat concerned about being properly compensated for his work, as he is not a full time employee of the company, but took this particular job as a work-for-hire; and Mr. Klein has a way of putting off any talk of how much Joe can expect by telling him to wait until the `Board meeting.'  And it's making Joe a bit anxious.In the meantime, Joe meets another man, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), a wealthy businessman who ingratiates himself with Joe and in a subtle, passive-aggressive way inflames Joe's doubts about whether or not he will eventually get his due from Mr. Klein and the company.  Joe has no reason to suspect that Jimmy wants anything from him; Jimmy apparently has enough irons in his own fires and he shows no real interest in whatever it is that Joe is involved in, business wise.  He's merely a man who seems to know finance, and his counsel to Joe is nothing more than well-disposed advice to a friend with a mutual concern from someone with experience.  Jimmy even goes so far as offering to have his lawyers look into Joe's affairs.  Joe is not exactly naive, but he lacks experience in these matters.  He trusts Jimmy, but he still wants to believe that Mr. Klein and the company will do right by him eventually.  It's something of a conundrum, but very quickly things begin to happen that force Joe's hand and make it necessary for him to make some decisions.  And it all comes down to the age old question Who do you trust?Mamet certainly knows how to weave a web, and what makes this one so effective is the fact that with a clever, detailed screenplay he never lets the audience in on anything more than what they have to know at any given point in time.  Watching the story unfold, you never know any more than what Joe knows, which allows you to experience it all first hand, so to speak, through Joe.  It all becomes very confusing very quickly, and it's supposed to be; it's what makes it so engrossing and very subtly gets you inching ever closer to the edge of your seat.  You-- like Joe-- know that something is going on, but you never know exactly what or who's behind it.  That it has something to do with the formula and Joe's access to it is obvious early on, but beyond that, anything goes.  It's complex storytelling, and Mamet makes it even more mesmerizing with his unique touch of having his actors deliver their lines in a clipped, rhythmic manner, which combined with the plot makes this spellbinding cinema.Campbell Scott is well cast as Joe Ross; he has the look and affects a manner completely compatible with his character.  Anyone who has ever been in a position in which things are not quite clear will be able to identify with him, and Scott never lets the character get ahead of where he's supposed to be, as far as what he could possibly know and when, and it adds credibility to the fact that a con like this can be perpetrated at all. If Scott didn't do his job, it would be like having a crack in the dam, and the water would quickly come gushing out.  But he does do his job, and it keeps the tension and the mystery in tact until the very end.In a dramatic role, Steve Martin is effective playing somewhat against type in the role of Jimmy.  He's convincing, and displays an aloofness that makes everything he does believable and, like Scott, he never tips his character's hand or does anything to reveal any more than he should. The winsome Rebecca Pidgeon gives an absolutely enticing performance as Susan Ricci, the `new girl' with the company who befriends Joe and gives him the encouragement he needs as he attempts to make some sense of all that is happening.  Pidgeon has an extremely direct approach and employs Mamet's style of acting perfectly (few actors have been able to utilize that rhythm more effectively, in fact; Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy and Lindsay Crouse among them), and she has a quality that draws your attention, no matter who else may be in the scene with her. Arguably, it is her performance that defines the realism of Mamet's world.The supporting cast includes Ricky Jay (George), Felicity Huffman (Pat McCune), Ed O'Neill (F.B.I. Team Leader), Paul Butler (Bookbinder) and J.J. Johnston (Doorman).  With a cryptic title taken from one of the oldest con games on the books, `The Spanish Prisoner' is riveting drama that will keep you guessing until the very end.

Because people are not always whom or what they appear to be, which is the case in `The Spanish Prisoner,' written and directed by David Mamet.  As can be expected in a Mamet story, the con is on once again, and this time it involves a certain valuable formula developed by a man named Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) for a company run by a Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara).  It's a formula that will put them ahead of the Japanese for the next three to five years, and during that time it's going to make everyone in the company very rich.  Only two people have access to the formula, which is written on Xerox-proof paper and kept in a safe Joe and Mr. Klein.  Joe, however, is somewhat concerned about being properly compensated for his work, as he is not a full time employee of the company, but took this particular job as a work-for-hire; and Mr. Klein has a way of putting off any talk of how much Joe can expect by telling him to wait until the `Board meeting.'  And it's making Joe a bit anxious.In the meantime, Joe meets another man, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), a wealthy businessman who ingratiates himself with Joe and in a subtle, passive-aggressive way inflames Joe's doubts about whether or not he will eventually get his due from Mr. Klein and the company.  Joe has no reason to suspect that Jimmy wants anything from him; Jimmy apparently has enough irons in his own fires and he shows no real interest in whatever it is that Joe is involved in, business wise.  He's merely a man who seems to know finance, and his counsel to Joe is nothing more than well-disposed advice to a friend with a mutual concern from someone with experience.  Jimmy even goes so far as offering to have his lawyers look into Joe's affairs.  Joe is not exactly naive, but he lacks experience in these matters.  He trusts Jimmy, but he still wants to believe that Mr. Klein and the company will do right by him eventually.  It's something of a conundrum, but very quickly things begin to happen that force Joe's hand and make it necessary for him to make some decisions.  And it all comes down to the age old question Who do you trust?Mamet certainly knows how to weave a web, and what makes this one so effective is the fact that with a clever, detailed screenplay he never lets the audience in on anything more than what they have to know at any given point in time.  Watching the story unfold, you never know any more than what Joe knows, which allows you to experience it all first hand, so to speak, through Joe.  It all becomes very confusing very quickly, and it's supposed to be; it's what makes it so engrossing and very subtly gets you inching ever closer to the edge of your seat.  You-- like Joe-- know that something is going on, but you never know exactly what or who's behind it.  That it has something to do with the formula and Joe's access to it is obvious early on, but beyond that, anything goes.  It's complex storytelling, and Mamet makes it even more mesmerizing with his unique touch of having his actors deliver their lines in a clipped, rhythmic manner, which combined with the plot makes this spellbinding cinema.Campbell Scott is well cast as Joe Ross; he has the look and affects a manner completely compatible with his character.  Anyone who has ever been in a position in which things are not quite clear will be able to identify with him, and Scott never lets the character get ahead of where he's supposed to be, as far as what he could possibly know and when, and it adds credibility to the fact that a con like this can be perpetrated at all. If Scott didn't do his job, it would be like having a crack in the dam, and the water would quickly come gushing out.  But he does do his job, and it keeps the tension and the mystery in tact until the very end.In a dramatic role, Steve Martin is effective playing somewhat against type in the role of Jimmy.  He's convincing, and displays an aloofness that makes everything he does believable and, like Scott, he never tips his character's hand or does anything to reveal any more than he should. The winsome Rebecca Pidgeon gives an absolutely enticing performance as Susan Ricci, the `new girl' with the company who befriends Joe and gives him the encouragement he needs as he attempts to make some sense of all that is happening.  Pidgeon has an extremely direct approach and employs Mamet's style of acting perfectly (few actors have been able to utilize that rhythm more effectively, in fact; Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy and Lindsay Crouse among them), and she has a quality that draws your attention, no matter who else may be in the scene with her. Arguably, it is her performance that defines the realism of Mamet's world.The supporting cast includes Ricky Jay (George), Felicity Huffman (Pat McCune), Ed O'Neill (F.B.I. Team Leader), Paul Butler (Bookbinder) and J.J. Johnston (Doorman).  With a cryptic title taken from one of the oldest con games on the books, `The Spanish Prisoner' is riveting drama that will keep you guessing until the very end.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 August 2001","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie, filmed under the extremely dangerous conditions that were shown in the film itself, was a true work of art dedicated to the beauty and tragedy of the city of Medellin and of the Colombian people, who live in what seems to be one of the most entrancing cities in the world, but also one of the most chaotic and crime-ridden.  The city is really one of the characters of the film and was shown so beautifully that I am eager for the day, if it ever comes, that I can safely visit it.  The two boys that the main character, the writer, gets involved with are really not actors, but are actual Colombian gang members and criminals who are playing parts much like the lives that they are really living. Part of the tragedy of this movie is that those characters, about whom I came to care about personally, may very well be dead by now.  Both boys show a phenomenal appeal and Alexis, in particular, kept me on the edge of my seat, fearing that any minute the buzz of a motor scooter going past would signal the end of his life... which seemed like a loss that would be too hard for anyone to bear.At first blush, one might think that an almost instant love affair between a cultured, world-weary writer and a teenaged gang member would be impossible, and yet as portrayed in this film the combination is utterly believable and hope-filled.  The advertisements say, A man without faith, a boy without conscience, and yet the beauty and willing openness of the boy gives the man a reason to continue living, while the sophistication and heart of the man gives hope to the boy that one can find a higher, more value-based path. This is a truly life-enhancing symbiosis.To be sure, this movie is a tragedy...if it reminded me of any other movie I have seen, I guess I would have to say the Baz Luhrman version of Romeo + Juliet starring Leo DiCaprio, which demonstrated a similar level of violence in the midst of unlikely love, and stylistic beauty in the midst of a color-saturated city.  But, like all well-done tragedies, the pay-off is the rush of the life-enhancing catharsis.  Surely we don't have it as bad, and let's make sure that we never do, despite the original book's author's contention that what we were experiencing is merely a precursor to our own future.Living like I do in a city that has the world's the highest concentration of Hispanics outside of Mexico City, it was easy for me to become weary of what seemed like an invading, alien culture whose members adamantly refuse to assimilate, particularly in matters of language.  However the Spanish as it is spoken in this film sounded as beautiful and romantic as French or Portuguese, which is probably due to the Colombian accent which may be more highly refined and spoken by more educated speakers than what I hear among the crowds of Spanish-speaking economic refugees.  This, combined with the opening of my heart that this film engendered, has allowed me to see the beauty and tragedy of a people who have been forced to leave their precious homelands in an effort to survive any way that they can.

","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2001","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie, filmed under the extremely dangerous conditions that were shown in the film itself, was a true work of art dedicated to the beauty and tragedy of the city of Medellin and of the Colombian people, who live in what seems to be one of the most entrancing cities in the world, but also one of the most chaotic and crime-ridden.  The city is really one of the characters of the film and was shown so beautifully that I am eager for the day, if it ever comes, that I can safely visit it.  The two boys that the main character, the writer, gets involved with are really not actors, but are actual Colombian gang members and criminals who are playing parts much like the lives that they are really living. Part of the tragedy of this movie is that those characters, about whom I came to care about personally, may very well be dead by now.  Both boys show a phenomenal appeal and Alexis, in particular, kept me on the edge of my seat, fearing that any minute the buzz of a motor scooter going past would signal the end of his life... which seemed like a loss that would be too hard for anyone to bear.At first blush, one might think that an almost instant love affair between a cultured, world-weary writer and a teenaged gang member would be impossible, and yet as portrayed in this film the combination is utterly believable and hope-filled.  The advertisements say, A man without faith, a boy without conscience, and yet the beauty and willing openness of the boy gives the man a reason to continue living, while the sophistication and heart of the man gives hope to the boy that one can find a higher, more value-based path. This is a truly life-enhancing symbiosis.To be sure, this movie is a tragedy...if it reminded me of any other movie I have seen, I guess I would have to say the Baz Luhrman version of Romeo + Juliet starring Leo DiCaprio, which demonstrated a similar level of violence in the midst of unlikely love, and stylistic beauty in the midst of a color-saturated city.  But, like all well-done tragedies, the pay-off is the rush of the life-enhancing catharsis.  Surely we don't have it as bad, and let's make sure that we never do, despite the original book's author's contention that what we were experiencing is merely a precursor to our own future.Living like I do in a city that has the world's the highest concentration of Hispanics outside of Mexico City, it was easy for me to become weary of what seemed like an invading, alien culture whose members adamantly refuse to assimilate, particularly in matters of language.  However the Spanish as it is spoken in this film sounded as beautiful and romantic as French or Portuguese, which is probably due to the Colombian accent which may be more highly refined and spoken by more educated speakers than what I hear among the crowds of Spanish-speaking economic refugees.  This, combined with the opening of my heart that this film engendered, has allowed me to see the beauty and tragedy of a people who have been forced to leave their precious homelands in an effort to survive any way that they can.
