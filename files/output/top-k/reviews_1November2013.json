I watched this film with trepidation. I didn't regret it. I think I picked a good horror movie to start off with. Carpenter sustains a creepy, suspenseful a atmosphere all the way through the movie. His camera work is very simple, bringing you to the center of the action. The views he gives over Micheal's shoulder are very clever, giving us his point of view. But it's the empty shots that create the most tension as they leave you thinking 'What's going to happen next?' The score to this film is fairly minimal, but highly effective. Who could ever forget that famous theme tune? It helps build up this unbearable tension and you just know something is going to happen soon. Carpenter uses it cleverly though. He knows that silence can be just as effective as suspenseful music in creating an aura of expectation. Though the plot is fairly implausible, but it holds fairly well through the movie. One could attempt to tear holes in it, but it's a lot more difficult then you'd think. Donald Pleasance is as good as always, portraying the worried doctor very well, if not always believably. Jamie-Lee Curtis is solid, but not outstanding and her two friends are as stiff as a plank throughout most of the film. They're characters and the way they act are fairly believable though and, in my opinion, vacuous and annoying. But it's really the character of Micheal Myers that makes the movie. The William Shatner mask is very disturbing and his silence is far better then if he grunted or talked. The way he shows up and disappears works very well and makes him seem almost supernatural, an idea aided by how impossible it seems to kill him. The movie moves along reasonably slowly, but it's worth the wait. The ending is terrifying and finishes off the movie with a bang. A seminal film which, horror buff or not, you should make time to watch. 7.9 seems about right.

I only watch horror movies occasionally. The Ring was disturbing and Alien, Jurassic Park, The Conjuring were good IMHO. New Evil Dead was stupid as heck. So that gives you some idea about my preferences.I got a chance to watch Halloween on Halloween 2013 (it's 35th anniversary) in Cinerama and I figured why not. It IS a classic after all, why pass up the chance to watch it on big screen?Maybe I'm just too used to newer movies (I do like old films - 12 Angry Men, Godfather movies, GBU, Once Upon..,even Cleopatra), but I thought this movie did not work for me as a horror at all. There is no development of Michael Myers as to why he's that evil and why he is after our protagonist. The story might continue in Halloween II but I'm never gonna watch it. Even if I take the evilness for granted, I find it hard to believe that he can appear\/disappear from anywhere at his will, learn to drive like an expert after 15 years in captivity, become unconscious and conscious like a robot AND nothing can kill him when even a 6 years old can kill an adult with a couple of awkward slashes. Then we have our heroine who never bothers to check whether he's dead or alive and keeps leaving the butcher knife (and herself) close to him. I confess that the heavy breathing was probably effective in 1978 but to me it just sounded funny. The score, though nice, never really connected - there would be ominous music so many times in the movie for no reason. And when he does appear, it's not all that scary. Again, maybe it was back when it came out. One part that was disturbing was babysitters allowing others to have sex in their employer's house and two characters talking about ripping a child's clothes off. Ugh!Now to the fun part - late 70's low budget fun! Clueless inspector who doesn't smell weed out of a hitherto airtight car? Agrees to stay on duty for a doctor he doesn't believe? Girls getting naked or half-naked for no reason? Nobody calls the police in the entire movie (except 1 try), even after suspecting murder(s)? And the BEST part - a sex scene that lasts 10 seconds and the girl goes - FANTASTIC!! I expected to come out of the theater scared, and I came out smiling. SMILING! I guess I better stop.

Life in the jungle declines under Scar's rule as Simba abandons his identity and meets new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, in another part of the jungle.Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff directed an exciting movie, adopting more of what I think are some of mainstream Hollywood's intense drama and comedy styles, seen in such parts like Uncle Scar and his crafty hyena goons chasing away poor Simba like gangsters pursuing a helpless hero, and the parts of the more modern day jokes and punchlines made by Timon and Pumbaa. The movie is also full of drama and action that will attract an audience of all ages, providing a great source of entertainment. It is compelling to see how Simba tries to wrestle his way out of his doubts as he tries to find his true identity and compelling to see Simba's family try to overcome adversary under Scar's rule. This is also a powerful story about courage, duty and identity (noticable as Simba tries to find his way) and the importance of family. Hans Zimmer did a good job on the music score and Elton John wrote some memorable songs like Circle of Life and Can You Feel The Love Tonight. The toe-tapping I Just Can't Wait To Be King is my favorite.The characters are likable and, like the plot's style, take on more of a mainstream Hollywood approach. This movie differs from the more earlier films such as Cinderella and The Jungle Book, and even the later films such as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.

Nada then comes across a group of mysterious people lurking around with boxes filled with sunglasses. After a riot breaks out he puts on the one pair of the sunglasses, and through them he sees an entirely different world. He comes to realize that aliens have enslaved humanity without them even realizing it. They can only be seen in their true form with the sunglasses. Nada then tries to get Frank on his side but he thinks he is crazy at first. However, Frank eventually joins up with him and, together with a group of resistance fighters, they must free the world.There are many good things about the film. The premise is interesting.

I like that over the years he has grown in popularity a bit.However, the rest of the cast I do not care for. I liked the main character, Nada, in the beginning, but later on he kind of annoyed me.

Now don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of criticising corporate America because the nature of the system which is based on greed and on lining the pockets of a minority to the expense of the majority is something that needs to be criticised &#x96; it is just that I don't like it when Micheal Moore does it because it is becoming clear that the only reason he is doing it is because people pay him money to watch his movies and to read his books.The question that I have is what does Michael Moore do with all the money that he makes from these enterprises? I know I won't be able to ask him because he doesn't like to give interviews in exactly the same way that the CEOs he chases allegedly don't like to give interviews. I suspect the reason that he doesn't like to give interviews, and the reason that CEOs don't like to give interviews to him, is because they do not trust him and they do not know how he is going to manipulate the stock footage that has been taken of those interviews to his own advantage.Anyway, the whole idea of downsizing and moving to Mexico (or other developing countries) is a double edged sword. Manufacturing in America (and in Australia) is a dying industry because it is much cheaper to move it overseas.

To be completely honest this is a movie that I grew up with but now I almost completely hate it. It's lazy, it doesn't take much risks (with the story\/characters) and the risks that are taken are insulting, nothing really Happens, yet there is a lot to talk about. It's a rehashed story with uninteresting characters. It can be described as a perfect train-wreck. My first main issue is that the story and characters are lazily written. The basic story is a rescue mission that runs for 90 minutes. It's a bad sign when a movie has such a sickeningly simple story, underdeveloped characters and 3 writers. It could have worked as it's own individual movie but not as a Jurassic Park movie. It took the B-movie route like the Jaws series and didn't care about continuing the story thus making the film feel like a dumb special effect cash cow. The rest of the characters are forgettable, expendable, annoying and pointless. There is even an attempt to make you feel sorry for one character after he supposedly dies. This doesn't work because we aren't given much detail about the character or what his personality is like. Suddenly, he is brought back from the dead... what was the point? A lot of people who do like this movie compare it the first two saying, The other two took themselves too seriously and this was some good B-movie fun! The first two were so good because of their themes and creative ideas and this one just doesn't care and goes for goofy rental action movie. It borrows so much imagery and plot devices from the first two and it's painful. It isn't horrible as a movie, I just can't enjoy it. 4\/10Ciaran's Review Jurassic Park 3 almost ruined the entire Jurassic Park series for me. How? Well the movie was just cheap, with a pathetic excuse for a story and a wide range of 'new' dinosaurs to lure audiences in. I believe that after about 30 minutes or so the movie knew the story was fading and so multiple references are made referring back to the original film. The CGI is decent but not brilliant, Grant's character development is good and some jokes are funny- but the movie is ruined by dumb action scenes. Whenever i ask someone how they would rate all the Jurassic Park movies usually JP3 comes in with the second highest rating- this always disgusts me. Many people say JP3 is better because it contains more dinosaurs and has better action scenes... People like Spinosaurus over T-Rex rampaging through San Diego...Ladies and Gentlemen the world has gone mad. As i said before i despise this movie as it almost ruined the previous two Jurassic Park films. Jurassic Park 3 in my opinion is a sin on the dinosaur movie community.

A lot of people who do like this movie compare it the first two saying, The other two took themselves too seriously and this was some good B-movie fun! The first two were so good because of their themes and creative ideas and this one just doesn't care and goes for goofy rental action movie. It borrows so much imagery and plot devices from the first two and it's painful.

Well the movie was just cheap, with a pathetic excuse for a story and a wide range of 'new' dinosaurs to lure audiences in. I believe that after about 30 minutes or so the movie knew the story was fading and so multiple references are made referring back to the original film. The CGI is decent but not brilliant, Grant's character development is good and some jokes are funny- but the movie is ruined by dumb action scenes. Whenever i ask someone how they would rate all the Jurassic Park movies usually JP3 comes in with the second highest rating- this always disgusts me. Many people say JP3 is better because it contains more dinosaurs and has better action scenes... People like Spinosaurus over T-Rex rampaging through San Diego...Ladies and Gentlemen the world has gone mad. As i said before i despise this movie as it almost ruined the previous two Jurassic Park films. Jurassic Park 3 in my opinion is a sin on the dinosaur movie community.

The developments with Grant's character is really good, the CGI occasionally looked impressive, one or two of the animatronics looked good, the action sequence with the flying pteranodons is great, maybe one or two jokes work... and that is it. To be completely honest this is a movie that I grew up with but now I almost completely hate it. It's lazy, it doesn't take much risks (with the story\/characters) and the risks that are taken are insulting, nothing really Happens, yet there is a lot to talk about. It's a rehashed story with uninteresting characters. It can be described as a perfect train-wreck. My first main issue is that the story and characters are lazily written. The basic story is a rescue mission that runs for 90 minutes. It's a bad sign when a movie has such a sickeningly simple story, underdeveloped characters and 3 writers. It could have worked as it's own individual movie but not as a Jurassic Park movie. It took the B-movie route like the Jaws series and didn't care about continuing the story thus making the film feel like a dumb special effect cash cow. The rest of the characters are forgettable, expendable, annoying and pointless. There is even an attempt to make you feel sorry for one character after he supposedly dies.

Coming from the very well written novel by Judith Guest, and adapted by Oscar winner Alvin Sargeant, this movie very much deals with the harsh reality of a post-tragedy family in America. With great acting, and a very impressive directing debut from Robert Redford, it became something more than a cheap drama a lot of people think it is at first glance.The story centers on the Jarrett family, consisting of Calvin, Beth, and their second son Conrad. Their eldest son, Buck, recently drowned in a boating accident and Conrad is still reeling from both survivor guilt and a recent suicide attempt. Both Calvin and Beth are trying to keep going through life and take care of their remaining child, but also try to comprehend what they are actually like and if they really care for one another. Conrad seeks help from psychiatrist Dr. Berger, who helps Conrad to deal with his still festering grief and his seemingly abandoned feeling from his mother.The acting is truly noting short of excellent in this film. There is not one false note in the list. Donald Sutherland gives a truly fine portrayal of Calvin, who really is trying to connect with Conrad, but doesn't quite know what Conrad wants or how to assert his opinions in arguments or even see what Conrad is feeling even though its in front of him. The fact that he wasn't even considered for an Oscar is truly bizarre, and I see it as one of the worst snubs in Oscar history. Timothy Hutton (who won the Supporting Actor Oscar) Conrad too is complex. he is trying to deal with his grief, but with the world at school who see him as a freak both in general, and after his suicide attempt, it doesn't help his cause. But with Berger, he works through defense mechanisms and vague desires to the root of the problem. We both laugh and cry during his journey throughout the film, which is always interesting.But the most complex of the characters in the whole story is Beth. She is played by comedienne Mary Tyler Moore who completely breaks that mold and shows of her very good acting skills here. Beth is the one everyone loves and likes being around, and a kind of person who keeps up the appearance of both a loving mother and a good housekeeper. But as the film progresses, it seems that she really doesn't love her son Conrad, and even her own husband. She seemed to pour all her energy in Buck, who many saw as the other version of herself. There is one heartbreaking quote about her character during an argument with Conrad and Calvin. Conrad shouts that even though she never visited him in the hospital she surely would have visited Buck, with her responding, Buck would have never BEEN in the hospital. Even at the end when Calvin questions her love for him, she breaks a stoic exterior but immediately puts the mask back on, revealing a very broken and vain woman who wants everything to look good, even at the cost of love and connection with her family.Both Sargeant and Redford do not use drama and the occasional slip into the melodrama for the sake of doing so, but because it helps tell the story and reveal the motivations and idiosyncrasies of the characters. There is no special music or camera tricks to emphasize anything, making the movie seem far more natural and pure than anything else. As a great actor himself, Redford knows how to get his cast to react in a natural way, but not appear to be in a movie.Even though many consider Raging Bull to be the biggest pass-over in Oscars, it really wasn't looked highly upon as a movie back then and this movie was selected for Best Picture, and Redford beat Martin Scorsese for Directing. I see both of them as equal, just on a different level. I consider them both to be the Best Pictures of 1980. I also wish that Mary Tyler Moore won Best Actress, she so deserved it.This movie is a fascinating character study of ordinary people put in a situation which is a far cry from something remotely ordinary in life. Each deals with it in his or her own way, which leads for some touching and affecting moments, and an ending that seems open-ended in one way, but closes the book in another.

Halloween is the best horror movie made in the last 35 years. Yes, I said 35 years! If you don't believe me watch it and see for yourself. I have seen this movie at least 20 or 30 times. I won't exaggerate, because there is no need to.John Carpenter and Debra Hill took a budget of $325,000 and created a franchise that has scared movie goers for 35 years. The franchise estimated budget, according to different sources, is somewhere around $80,325,000; this covers all ten movies, including the two Rob Zombie versions. The total gross income for all ten movies is over $366,000,000.Over 115,000 IMDb.com users have voted that puts Halloween at 7.9 stars out of 10. I of course believe that this is one of the scariest movies ever made and give it 10 stars. John Carpenter used many different tricks of lighting and shadow in order to create this masterpiece. He used many tricks of psychology in order to feed the movie goers fears of what might happen next. The tricks that Carpenter used are so simple.As I said before I have seen Halloween many, many times. So yes, I know what happens. But, knowing something is going to happen and the anticipation of it happening is enough to make anybody jump even just a little.I love Halloween from beginning to end. But I will describe my three favorite scenes from the movie.The first scene I liked is when Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) are driving up to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. They are talking as they drive up to the hospital and all of a sudden they see several patients wandering around in a storm. Dr. Loomis orders Chambers to drive up to the gate, he gets out of the car to inspect the gate house. As Loomis does this, one of the patients climbs on top of the car and then forces Chambers out. The patient, later determined to be Michael Myers (Tony Moran), drives off.The second of my favorite scenes is one that has been talked about before on other reviews. It's the scene where Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) is going to pick up her boyfriend. She goes out to her car and tries to get in, but the door is locked. She runs back into the house to get her keys and comes back and gets into the car... without using the keys to unlock the door. She goes to put the key in the ignition and notices the windows are fogged up. As she tries to wipe off the condensation she is attacked by Michael Myers, wearing his now famous mask. Michael eventually cuts Annie's throat. Of course, the fact that her throat is cut is not why I like this scene. I like this scene because Annie doesn't even pay attention to what she is doing, but a real movie fan would have picked up on the fact that she couldn't get into the car and then about 30 seconds later she can.Before I describe my third favorite scene I want to tell you about my favorite line. Dr. Loomis explains I met him, fifteen years ago; I was told there was nothing left; No reason, no conscience, no understanding; and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.The third scene I liked is when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) goes to the Wallace house to see what is keeping Annie. She walks in and searches the house, but doesn't find anyone until she gets to an upstairs bedroom. When she enters the bedroom she finds her friends Annie, Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Lynda's boyfriend, Bob Sims (John Michael Graham) have been killed. She runs from the Wallace house to the Doyle house, across the street, in an attempt to call the police. Laurie is pursued by Micheal and then the real fun begins. Michael pursues Laurie several times; I say several times because Laurie stabs him with knitting needles and a few other items, but he gets up after each. It is only after Dr. Loomis shoots Michael several times that he seems to be stopped.Yes, I know, I gave away the ending of the movie. There aren't too many ways that someone could have never seen Halloween. Giving away the ending of a movie that is over 30 years old is not a bad thing. Like I said before it is the way the scenes are set up that make the movie anyway. The psychology of fear that John Carpenter used to scare everyone.I already gave this movie 10 stars out of 10.

But I will describe my three favorite scenes from the movie.The first scene I liked is when Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) are driving up to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. They are talking as they drive up to the hospital and all of a sudden they see several patients wandering around in a storm. Dr. Loomis orders Chambers to drive up to the gate, he gets out of the car to inspect the gate house. As Loomis does this, one of the patients climbs on top of the car and then forces Chambers out. The patient, later determined to be Michael Myers (Tony Moran), drives off.The second of my favorite scenes is one that has been talked about before on other reviews. It's the scene where Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) is going to pick up her boyfriend. She goes out to her car and tries to get in, but the door is locked. She runs back into the house to get her keys and comes back and gets into the car... without using the keys to unlock the door. She goes to put the key in the ignition and notices the windows are fogged up. As she tries to wipe off the condensation she is attacked by Michael Myers, wearing his now famous mask. Michael eventually cuts Annie's throat. Of course, the fact that her throat is cut is not why I like this scene. I like this scene because Annie doesn't even pay attention to what she is doing, but a real movie fan would have picked up on the fact that she couldn't get into the car and then about 30 seconds later she can.Before I describe my third favorite scene I want to tell you about my favorite line. Dr. Loomis explains I met him, fifteen years ago; I was told there was nothing left; No reason, no conscience, no understanding; and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.The third scene I liked is when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) goes to the Wallace house to see what is keeping Annie. She walks in and searches the house, but doesn't find anyone until she gets to an upstairs bedroom. When she enters the bedroom she finds her friends Annie, Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Lynda's boyfriend, Bob Sims (John Michael Graham) have been killed. She runs from the Wallace house to the Doyle house, across the street, in an attempt to call the police. Laurie is pursued by Micheal and then the real fun begins. Michael pursues Laurie several times; I say several times because Laurie stabs him with knitting needles and a few other items, but he gets up after each. It is only after Dr. Loomis shoots Michael several times that he seems to be stopped.Yes, I know, I gave away the ending of the movie. There aren't too many ways that someone could have never seen Halloween. Giving away the ending of a movie that is over 30 years old is not a bad thing. Like I said before it is the way the scenes are set up that make the movie anyway. The psychology of fear that John Carpenter used to scare everyone.I already gave this movie 10 stars out of 10.

What audiences got was From Russia with Love, a film that significantly improves on the previous film in a number of ways. Returning director Terence Young continues to develop the Bond formula here, building on a lot of what worked before, and polishing it to create a sequel that completely outshines its predecessor. This film does not the bombastic action flick that one might expect, even though the action sequences are really well done when they do come around. This is a much more tense, espionage spy thriller fueled by the Cold War tensions that were rife during the time From Russia with Love was made. The film's main theme perfectly fits the tone of the film, a constantly building ballad with Matt Monro's clear vocals that create a slow burn that leads to a richly satisfying conclusion.This time around, Bond is sent to Istanbul, Turkey, to obtain a Soviet encryption decoder and, by seducing a former Russian agent, bring it back to MI6. However, the criminal organization SPECTRE is constantly pulling the strings, lurking in the shadows all the while. It's a rather complicated plot, and is difficult to sum up here, but in the film, everything ties together and makes sense by the end. A number of cast members return from the previous film, such as Sean Connery as Bond, Bernard Lee as M, and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, and they all improve on their prior performances. Connery seems much more comfortable and charismatic here, but he never loses that cold, animalistic intensity. It's classic Bond, no question.However, we're also graced with one of the best casts of characters a Bond film could ask for. Daniela Bianchi makes for a great Bond girl as Tatiana, and Pedro Armendáriz is a joy to watch as Bond's ally in Turkey, Kerim Bey. The film also boasts a great assembly of villains, SPECTRE and henchmen alike. Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb is suitably sinister, and in their limited screen time, Vladek Sheybal's Kronsteen and Anthony Dawson's mysterious Blofeld manage to leave an impression. But the most memorable villain in the film, and possibly in the whole series, is Robert Shaw's Red Grant. Everything about him is great, the way he's constantly watching silently from the shadows. He's intimidating, he's a formidable foe for Bond, and Robert Shaw does a great job going toe to toe with Connery. That fight on the train with Bond and Grant is one of the most iconic action sequences not only in the film, but in the entire series. If this film is remembered for one scene, it should be that sequence with Bond and Grant on the train.The action is less frequent here, as the film takes a more spy thriller approach. There's a constant build of tension throughout the film that, despite being slow paced, keeps the film from ever feeling dull. That doesn't mean there isn't enough action here, though, because the action is really well shot and choreographed. As I've already gushed about, the fight sequence on the train is a master class in film action. The movie is also notable for John Barry's score, which developed the trademark Bond sound that would remain as a mainstay for the rest of the series.From Russia with Love is a masterpiece. It's got its fair share of strange moments, such as the scene at the gypsy camp, and it definitely shows its age, but like with Dr. No, I can't fault it for that. So many defining elements of the series can be traced back to this entry, such as the stuff with MI6, the trademark Bond sound, the title songs, the cool gadgets that are a bit underplayed here, but still iconic, and of course, the iconic Bond himself in Connery's improved performance. It's a bit different from what you'd expect, but it's still got everything you could possibly want from a Bond film, in spades.
