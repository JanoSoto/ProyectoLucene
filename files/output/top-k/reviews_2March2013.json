[{"date":"2 March 2013","score":"","review":" Movies about rock bands are a tough job to do - the filmmakers either tend to make one endless video clip with little action, or many events but with almost no music. Here, Cameron Crowe made a fine and nice balance between much music and much action. It is a movie for music fans and for those who can easily tell an Iggy Pop song from a Lou Reed one, even if a short snippet is played. Music plays a vital part in this long but fast movie, but still, there is enough room for drama, humor, sarcastic portrayal of rock business, magazine running, journalism, fandom, stardom, groupie-dom, family matters and honesty. The band? Stillwaters? Well, they're a nice bunch of moody hombres and they play a good hard rock. The story? it is not boring and rather realistic. The painful questions of who the leader of the band is are not avoided, too. The ever-present problem of sex-drugs is here, too. But what is good, the movie does not praise the ruinous lifestyle and does not teach youngsters to do the same stuff all the time. I do not remember The Director's Cut well, but the shorter version is very upbeat and goes on quite well. The main stars did a good job - Lee, Crudup, Fugit, Hudson - they all play very well and even if are not rockers or journalists, they do a good and decent performance. The film is highly recommended and good for all who are curious about rock lifestyle, but still not the best, as simply there are none. All such movies will lack certain clarity or just drag, or be not what some of viewers would like to see.

He quoted loving him in movies such as Blow Out, Carrie and this little gem called Perfect. Such opinions are quite surprising since most of those films (except Carrie) weren't box-office hits neither well criticized, some gaining cult status in the following years of its release. However, even with Quentin's approval Perfect still finds a great deal of unexplainable resistance among film buffs, currently giving to this one of the most absurd low ratings ever given to a quite decent movie. A short way to explain the story is thinking of an Absence of Malice made for the masses it deals with ethics in journalism with Travolta playing a biased Rolling Stone reporter while unsatisfied with the running of a controversial article involving political officials dealing with corruption charges, decides to write a new and apparently harmless article on health clubs and their new function as being a cool dating place replacing the decadent singles bars. Yeah, why bothering going in places where everybody is so down when you go to a happier place, make lots of exercise and meet guys and girls with perfect bodies? There's something worth writing he thinks. Working as an obstacle to this story is a gym instructor (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) who doesn't trust reporters after a career damaging event when a reporter distorted facts while publishing a story involving her. While Travolta's story goes under false pretensions (with a bit of truth in it as well), he can't escape resisting some affection he has by the main character of his article, who each day goes by starts to like this guy, believing he's about to write a good report on the gym and its attendees. The stone in the way of this movie is that its lack of seriousness while the events are being unfolded, often deeply concerned about the romance between the main characters. At times you think something really dangerous is about to happen, he's being followed by someone due to the other inflammable article where Travolta is torn in between telling about what his source said to him on an exclusive interview or go to jail to protect his source, but no, the film doesn't take off much from this scenario except towards its conclusion to be used as a closure to the gym instructor situation, a predictable and not very believable device. But Perfect manages to keep you hold to your seat due to the reliable and impressive performances of Curtis, Travolta, Laraine Newman, Marilu Henner and small appearances from Kenneth Welsh and David Paymer. It drags down a bit when it stays for too long in the work out exercises, fun for the actors jumping up and down to the coolest and energic 1980's soundtrack but tiring for us viewers seeing an unimaginative lack of camera angles and poor editing which shifts from two different angles instead of being more acrobatic.Story delivered some valid points (although it can look ridiculously dated now since gym's are also definitely places for dating and no one questions those things anymore), might not be perfect (no pun intended), it was well balanced and easy to follow and feel interested. So, why viewers think this is one of the worst movies ever? Makes me wonder what some of you are watching these days. There's plenty of quality in Perfect, you just need to open your eyes to see it. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 March 2013","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" While promoting Pulp Fiction back in the 1990's Tarantino while explaining his casting of John Travolta in what would be one of his most iconic roles, resurrecting his career and taking to a new status, the writer and director didn't mention Grease or Saturday Night Fever as why he thought Travolta was a good actor.

This movie is wonderfully casted, superior in its story telling than most action movies in its time, and the villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman who played Sheriff Of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves in 1991 with Kevin Costner and Severus Snape in the Harry Potter Film series) was so out of it that it was amazing how he lost the fight.No better lone hero action movie has been able to stand the test of time like Die Hard has. This 1988 first in the film series was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Sound Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects. Bruce Willis character portrayal in this movie has been highly praised by many and he has carved a name for himself. As a young boy watching this franchise, me and my friends memorized John McClane's (Bruce Willis) catchphrase to use whenever, the phrase Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er was nominated as one of the best movie lines in the AFI's 100 Greatest Movie Lines.The movie plot and script is an adaptation based on 1979 Roderick Thorp bestselling novel Nothing Lasts Forever, about a New York City Police officer John McClane, who got in the middle of L.A. skyscraper heist, as he traveled to L.A. to go visit his family.The heist is led by Hans Gruber who under the guise of a terrorist attack took over the skyscraper so as to steal 640 million dollars in bonds. What Hans didn't plan was running into McClane who was in the same building and this man was ready to do anything possible including risking his life to stop Hans and his group.

The sad part of this movie is the Deputy Chief of Police his portrayal in this movie is annoying and you have to over look him, which is easy since he had a few screen times.This movie was a commercial success making over 140 million based on a 28 million dollar budget and the screenplay is written by Steven E. de Souza (Commando (1985) and Die Harder (Die Hard 2 (1990)) and Jeb Stuart.To me this one of my very best Bruce Willis movie after Sixth Sense of cause, and I'm sure majority has already seen this, so I say go see it again.Also in this franchise are Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).

It is feel-good, hilarious and witty.A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one.The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her.The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film.Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending.In sum, Clueless is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

This is one of those movies you either love or you hate. I love it, and honestly like it better than the actual story of Peter Pan, or other spins on it like Finding Neverland. But, let's see why Hook is near and dear to many hearts, and hated by others.Peter Pan (Robin Williams) has grown up into Peter Banning, a man who has no memory of being Peter Pan, and is a workaholic who is cold to his wife and children. But when his wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) insists they take a trip back to England to visit her Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) he gives in, despite his crippling fear of flying. But when Peter, Moira and Granny go to a ceremony in Wendy's honor, their children Jack (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott) are kidnapped by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). While the logical Peter calls the police, Wendy tries to remind him of his youth&#x97;but he thinks she's lost it until Tinkerbelle (Julia Roberts) comes in the night to take him back to Neverland. While there, Tinkerbelle and the Lost Boys must help Peter remember who he is, teach him to fight, and help him get Jack and Maggie back home.It's been said many times that Spielberg considered this movie a failure, but I really don't understand why. It captures the innocence and adventure of the original Barrie story, and gives a new spin on it by questioning what it means to grow up, as well having a cat's in the cradle vibe to it. The sets, wardrobe and look of the characters in Neverland are hit and miss. Some things look very fake, others look really cool. However, it is clear was the film was made in the 90s. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Hook, and I also loved Robin Williams as Peter Pan and Charlie Kosmo as Jack. The lost boys like Rufio, Thud Butt, and Pockets were interesting and unique. I also think all the actors fit their characters, except Julia Roberts. I might be pulling some thoughts off The Nostalgia Critic but Julia Roberts was way too&#x85;sweet in her role of Tinkerbelle. In the days of Fairy Hollow and other Tinkerbelle popularity, people often forget that Tinkerbelle in the Barrie story (and even the 1950's Disney film!) is often jealous, vindictive, and downright mean. There was NO trace of that personality or allusion to her past indiscretions in this performance. If anything she just weirdly comes off as a friend zoned character who is still sadly in love with a man she can never have. However, plenty of scenes and characters are just epic and unforgettable. How can you not love the make-believe feast scene? Or the Run Home Jack scene? This is a great film for kids and the kid in all of us.

My personal opinion of this movie is constantly wavering for years now. Even while I re-watch it, I find myself not liking certain aspects of it, but unable to let it go.Cruise and Kidman, once a couple in real life, act as a couple that has reached a crisis. The crisis involves sex and the issue of sexual fantasies and their dangerous and ignored place in a marriage.It attacks immaturity and the act of burying your head in the sand when it comes to other people's human frailties, flaws and fantasies while accepting your own. Hence the title.Dr. William Harford (Cruise) is a typically naive young husband who thinks a woman, and especially his wife, is faithful because she requires love and stability in a relationship. He flirts at parties, seems faithful, but also seems to be oblivious to the dangers and hypocrisies of his fantasies and the way he sees women.When he fails to show jealousy over a suave man that hits on his wife, she brutally crushes his naiveté by telling him of a time where she was willing to leave him for a fling with a sailor. Although it is an aggressive and rude confession, it's easy to overlook her admissions of fear and conflicting feelings for him, and her message to him, which she does a bad job of conveying, is clear once you think about it with mature sensitivity.(spoilers) He then wanders through the city, staggering with the implications and unpleasant images that this confession triggers, and is so outraged, angry and confused, that he tentatively pushes his flirtations and fantasies a few steps further. This night of strange sexual encounters is almost surreal, with people hitting on him for the strangest reasons, coming close to infidelity with a sweet hooker, all leading to the notorious cult-orgy scene.And then comes the day-after, full of disappointing realism, daylight, and scary repercussions. He finds out how dangerous his encounters could have been. There is a death which may or may not have been caused by his naiveté. There is a plausible explanation, but is it really plausible? The movie doesn't answer this question. It leaves us hanging with our own imaginations, like a fantasy. Instead, it is back to reality for the couple, only this time their eyes are opened to their flaws and responsibilities and possible choices.Given the above way of looking at this movie, her last line becomes clearer. It is a crude awakening that sex is not always a romantic, or harmless fantasy, and that adults don't just make love to their wives, but *uck as well.On the other hand, the movie may just be saying that humans are led by their animalistic drives regardless of dangerous consequences, and it's time to wake up to this fact and accept it the way it is. It doesn't explicitly raise the issue of making responsible choices. That's the kind of movie this is Ambiguous, but thought-provoking.It is not really an erotic movie. Kidman's nudity in the beginning of the movie is just as engineered as the rest of the movie She starts as a sex object and a mother, gives us a strange, mysterious look in the mirror, then forcibly becomes a sexual person with flaws and immoral sexual fantasies of her own.There was much hullabaloo over the cult-orgy scene and what it did or didn't show, but whether genitalia was shown or not is irrelevant. I found the whole scene ridiculous and mechanical until I realized that it is exactly the effect it was going for and that it needs to be taken as a surreality, and is only there to involve the audience in a fantasy experience detached from reality and a tangible eroticism, and with unexpected, unknown dangers.Besides the ridiculous orgy, another flaw is Kubrick's ability to drain some scenes of their blood, drawn out with overly-pregnant pauses and slow pacing, possibly due to his famously pedantic multiple takes. But, in some cases, this helps the atmosphere and gives you time to absorb the scene.This movie is a lot of things. It is an art-house movie about sex for adults. It is a horror-thriller for men in a unique sense of the genre. It is definitely a thought-provoking movie. It doesn't seem to appeal to female audiences as much as men though, but perhaps this review will help appreciate it a bit more.I may have explained too much for a movie that wants to be open-ended and provocative. But if nothing else, I wrote this for myself to try to organize my thoughts and figure out why it glued itself to my mind so.
