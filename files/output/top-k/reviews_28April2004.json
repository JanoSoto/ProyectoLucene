[{"date":"28 April 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE (2000) **  Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Piper Perabo, Randy Quaid, Robert De Niro, (Voices of June Foray and Keith Scott), (Cameos Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, John Goodman, Janeane Garofalo). Jay Ward's classic cult cartoon comedy team of Moose & Squirrel are back and this time they're larger than life on the big screen in  this rather flat-footed attempt at a resurrection for two of the most beloved animated characters of all time. This time screenwriter Kenneth Lonegran employs the standard trademarks of the series (breaking down the fourth wall directly talking asides to the audience, ironic dispositions, silly puns and on-the-sly knowing winks at their familiarity) but does so in a largely mirthless endeavor.   The plot, such as it is, has our heroes Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose (voiced by Foray who has been Rocky since the get go and Scott doing the honors for the moose and replacing the late, great William Conrad as the smart-aleck narrator) enter the virtual reality from 'toon land when a development girl in Hollywood inadvertently enlivens their notorious arch nemesi Boris Badenov and Natasha and their evil despot Fearless Leader (played with gusto by long-time fans Alexander, Russo and De Niro, who also co-produced) who find themselves longing to rule the world by incorporating the masses to be hypnotized by Really Bad TV.   This leads to involvement by the FBI to seek help from our heroes with their emissary being the young, impressionable and darn right plucky Agent Karen Sympathy (sexy newcomer Perabo) to get the denizens of Frostbite Falls to New York as they race the clock and overcome the pitfalls set up by the dastardly Mutt & Jeff team of Boris & Natasha.The premise is weak with the fact that the Cold War is over and is about as timely as the villain trio's out-of-it attempts to plot in overruling the free-world but then again so are the James Bond flicks.  What really doesn't translate well is the fact that the animated heroes interacting with the real world a la `Roger Rabbit'.  They work better on the small screen in retrospect and a lot of the interaction seems forced (except with the gung ho energy to spare by the lissome Perabo, who actually breathes a fresh presence into every scene she's in).Alexander and Russo make for an amusing pair as the rotund Boris and statuesque Natasha and De Niro even is passable with his thick accented Leader (even aping his `Are you talkin' to me?' icon moment from `Taxi Driver').  But the pointless cameos by comedy stars like Crystal and Goldberg seem perfunctory (although it's always a guilty pleasure to see Winters at his battiest, although he's surprisingly sedate in this setting). Maybe the next film they'll let the duo work in their natural state of just animation.
