It had no intersting plot or actors or even worthviewing locations... yeah I know that it's an independent movie, but also is Reservoir Dogs, which I love... c'mon it's just not scary at all and has one of the crappiest endings i've seen. Totaly dissapointing even for watching with friends.

I mean every movie does, some of its the actors and some of it is the way the film is made. In this case it was neither, the flaw is simply the story, the whole basis for the film. To me, its the film that will suffer in the long run.The whole aspect, the futuristic authority, catching someone before they even commit a crime. Unbelievable. Spielberg does some amazing things, that I won't deny, some of the stuff that goes on in the movie is just simply amazing, but not perfect.Tom Cruise is a Detective for Pre-Crime (go figure..), he lost his son back in the past to a kidnapper...thus is why he goes to work there anyway. Von Exel is Burgess, like his mentor, his guiding light, the person who continues to tell him everything is okay, Also is the director of this Pre-Crime.So Cruise's character John Anderton is set up for murder so he believes...but then be begins to believe otherwise..Colin Farrel (aka Bullseye, Yeah!) is a investigator sent to the Pre-Crime Unit to seek out flaws and he finds one. Now I won't go on to ruin the movie, but it was a really good movie, I rated it a 9, and I consider it probably one of the best movies of the Summer.However I haven't seen XXX yet, and MIB is Coming in July...so who knows. Thanks for Reading this.  ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2002","score":"","review":"  To say that this movie is perfect wouldn't be a total lie, however, it does have its flaws.
