It starts off a little slow with small hints that something bad is going to happen and it just gets better from there. I loved the way they made it where you wonder who's going die next and how they're going die. The deaths in the film were very unique and each one could really happen. There's no crazed killer on the loose killing off people one by one in this film, no these deaths could happen to anybody.Even though this film was supposed to be about Death coming back at the teens who cheated him, you never actually get to see Death. In the origional script, it featured an actual Grim Reaper figure slicing and dicing his way through a teen cast, but they chose not to do it, thinking that way it wouldn't be compared to teen slashers like 'Scream.' I'm glad they did that because it was a lot better then when you got to see Death in 'The Frighteners.' Don't get me wrong, he looked pretty cool in 'Frighteners' it's just a movie's much scarier if you can't see what's there. It was nice to finally see a teen movie that had no sex involved in it at all. That's a rarity. It was also nice to see Tony Todd in a movie not as Candyman. He did a pretty good job playing the creepy mortician. There was a little gore in some parts of the film and nicely done special effects in some parts. I'm glad they didn't overdue it with the special effects like other horror films that I would like to remain nameless (The Haunting). The acting was good and the film itself was pretty suspenseful. There were some parts that were meant to give the audience a quick jump in their seats and was proven successful. Not in my case though. This movie makes you think that maybe Death does have a plan for all of us and we can't escape it. Makes me wonder how I'm going die. Well anyway, the ending was a lot better than I expected. There are actually two endings for the film. The first ending was screened to an audience before the release, but the filmmakers decided that the ending wasn't good enough. So, they went back and shot a different ending.Final Destination is definetly worth watching for a real taste of horror.

During the slower moments in the beginning that fade into black...you can almost sense Kubrick's presence. However, cartoony moments like the motorcycles chasing the mechas, and David trying to operate the police vehicle just ooze with Speilberg's joy in the spectacle.  Overall, the film is very self-aware and very well crafted.However...I've been reading other User Comments about A.I. and its really beginning to bother me. Many people are complaining about the end of the movie and the aliens...but...they must be misinterpreting probably the most amazing concept in the movie! THEY AREN'T ALIENS!!! The beings at the end of the movie are obviously the evolved robots -- self aware and dominant. The whole point is that the humans, in the beginning, created David so they can be loved -- much like God created Adam and Eve. Unfortunately, much like humans, the artificial intelligence evolved, became self-aware, and then dominated the planet.  The robotic beings at the end of the movie are searching for the one thing that they dont have..and thats the ability to have dreams and to wish. So, much like how the humans created David to understand love, the super-intelligent robots try to create humans in order to find out the secret to desire\/love. They find these things in David after discovering him in the ice, and that is how, in a way, he becomes a real boy - even if it is for a short while. He is a carrier of the human spirit and, therefore, becomes a representative of human beings.The film is, in my opinion, one of the most optimistic and beautiful testaments to the human spirit.  Humanity's drive and aspirations are applauded as well as criticized in this film. It shows the good that comes out of creation, but, however, reminds us of its dangers. We see technology as a bi-product of our goal to realize who we are and what we want.This movie was so amazing and thought-provoking...that when the movie was over and people in the audience applauded and said, Thank, God as the credits started to roll...I couldn't help but feel disgusted. A.I., like any Kubrick project, has a way of p***ing people off - and I can respect that. Some people just shouldn't see movies like this..or A Clockwork Orange..or 2001....because heaven forbid they require a little introspection afterwards.

It had a lot of cool battle scenes, excellent graphics, and a lot of other cool stuff, but there was something missing. I guess I was just bored with the fact that this film is really nothing new. Still enjoyable.I was surprised with the amount of money this film made this weekend. I thought it would make a good 50 or so million, but 70 million? Damn, that's a lot.

Some will like it, of course, particularly the more sensitive, and aware of what kind of film it was likely going to be.It's very interesting that Kubrick and Speilberg collaborated on this project and it ends up showing, I believe, that although Kubrick is a cold, analytical film maker, he has his soft HUMAN side.Speilberg does an excellent job of mimicking Kubrick's direction style, when he chooses to, but one can also see plenty of his own influence throughout.  Some critics have said, this is a Speilberg film, no doubt.  But I think they are mistaken...it was a collaboration...a project that Kubrick had started, and ASKED SPECIFICALLY for Speilberg to take over.I think this is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence.WHY did Kubrick do such a thing?I think if one understands the PRIMARY message of the picture, one can see why he chose Speilberg to direct it.Kubrick, it appears, would have had difficulty in sending the message he wanted of this film, if he had directed it.It is not completely hoakie as many Speilberg films can be, nor is it completely cold as Kubrick's.

It was not always effective in what it wanted to do, but overall it worked, because it couldn't get away from being cheesy and still send its message.THIS WAS A CLASSIC SCI-FI GENRE FILM.Many people think that Sci-Fi somehow translates into a lot of cool explosions and action...(the New York Times gave a good description of this understanding as...an Old Western done up with cool special effects), but this has not usually been the case.  Oh, and don't get me wrong, the visual effects in A.I. are marvelous.  But they compliment the story, rather than dominate it.  This Kubrick understood when shooting 2001, Cameron with Alien and the Terminator (and tried with the Abyss), and now Speilberg with A.I. (as well as other films, i.e. the Star Trek series).This is something that over time will probably be appreciated more.  It is both a fairy tale, and an examination of human beings and their attributes.The end sequence, which has been much criticized, although seemed a bit forced at times, was a prime example of this, and fits within the context of the films' message.Once you think about that, I think it is easier to digest.  People looking for a fast paced story, sorry, you aren't going to get what you were looking for.  I wonder if this was really a children's story, (as some have labeled it) or a fairy tale for adults.  Most young kids are not going to understand it, and older kids, looking for the next Star Wars are probably going to get the wrong impression due to the movie's marketing campaign.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"2 July 2001","score":"","review":"  A.I. will clearly be a film that evokes strong emotional reactions, either for or against it.First off, this movie...once again, like Eyes Wide Shut, was mis-marketed, all in hopes of making a lot of money, even though the classic summer audience is likely to not enjoy it that much (especially due to most people's assumption of what a Sci-Fi movie is).  Some will like it, of course, particularly the more sensitive, and aware of what kind of film it was likely going to be.It's very interesting that Kubrick and Speilberg collaborated on this project and it ends up showing, I believe, that although Kubrick is a cold, analytical film maker, he has his soft HUMAN side.Speilberg does an excellent job of mimicking Kubrick's direction style, when he chooses to, but one can also see plenty of his own influence throughout.  Some critics have said, this is a Speilberg film, no doubt.  But I think they are mistaken...it was a collaboration...a project that Kubrick had started, and ASKED SPECIFICALLY for Speilberg to take over.I think this is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence.WHY did Kubrick do such a thing?I think if one understands the PRIMARY message of the picture, one can see why he chose Speilberg to direct it.Kubrick, it appears, would have had difficulty in sending the message he wanted of this film, if he had directed it.It is not completely hoakie as many Speilberg films can be, nor is it completely cold as Kubrick's.  It had a little of both.  It was balanced. It was not always effective in what it wanted to do, but overall it worked, because it couldn't get away from being cheesy and still send its message.THIS WAS A CLASSIC SCI-FI GENRE FILM.Many people think that Sci-Fi somehow translates into a lot of cool explosions and action...(the New York Times gave a good description of this understanding as...an Old Western done up with cool special effects), but this has not usually been the case.  Oh, and don't get me wrong, the visual effects in A.I. are marvelous.  But they compliment the story, rather than dominate it.

To my mind, he's a fine actor, a very good director, and his failures in each area are more than made up for by his ambition--when he screws up it's because he's tried for something magnificent that proves to be just out of his reach.  As opposed to most people, who can screw up on things that aren't worth achieving in the first place.  But there seem to be a lot of people that just hate Branagh--that go out of their way to be annoyed by him.  I just don't get it. This film was produced by Francis Coppola and American Zoetrope, and his Dracula cohort James V. Hart, and it shares that movie's aim of trying to make a film true to the literary spirit and themes of the original novel.  That said, in feel and approach it's very much Kenneth Branagh's movie.  In place of the baroque immersion in setting and atmosphere that Coppola usually brings to a project (particularly Dracula), we get the fantastic energy that Branagh pours into his work.   It really is the first Frankenstein movie to capture the Romantic spirit of Shelley's book.  The frequent appearance of fire (especially the scene of the monster holding aloft the torch at the end) remind one of the book's subitle  The Modern Prometheus.  And Branagh's portrayal of Victor embodies all the promise and hubris of Shelley's protagonist.   And at the same time, the film manages to be a really good Gothic horror flick, too.  The lab setup is wonderfully imagined--everything one could want from a mad scientist's lab circa 1794--and some of the scenes are among the weirdest and most horrifying ever filmed.  Horrifying in the old-school sense, the feeling that you're watching Something That Should Not Be.  I'm thinking of Victor's weird dance in the amniotic fluid with the newly reanimated monster, still unable to stand.  It goes on forever, while the viewer becomes more and more aghast at what is being shown.  Then there's the climax, where he reanimates his bride, and the viewer realizes he's truly gone mad. The movie manages that rare trick of being two things at once  an intellectually satisfying literary movie and a ripping good adventure  Performances  Branagh's great.  Helena Bonham-Carter is also superb--her post-reanimation scene alone is worth the price of admission.  She must have had a lot of fun doing that.  Tom Hulce is fantastic as usual in a bit part.  And John Cleese is astoundingly good in his cameo. The only real problem with this movie is Robert DeNiro.  Physically, he's perfect for the role--a more monstery-looking Frankenstein's monster you couldn't ask for.  But once he learns to speak, it's Brooklyn, and it just about ruins the movie.  For this film to work the monster has to be alternately horrifying and poetic--you have to believe that under all those scars and stitches is a sensitive, wounded soul.  But every time DeNiro speaks it sounds like he's saying You lookin' at me?! even if he isn't.  The accent ruins it.  The monster's utterances are essential to the book, but I think it would have been preferable in the movie to have him remain mute, rather than let DeNiro speak.   If you can get around that, though, it's a fine movie. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 July 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  **WARNING  CONTAINS SPOILERS**I've never been able to understand why people resent Kenneth  Branagh so much.

To my mind, he's a fine actor, a very good director, and his failures in each area are more than made up for by his ambition--when he screws up it's because he's tried for something magnificent that proves to be just out of his reach.  As opposed to most people, who can screw up on things that aren't worth achieving in the first place.  But there seem to be a lot of people that just hate Branagh--that go out of their way to be annoyed by him.  I just don't get it. This film was produced by Francis Coppola and American Zoetrope, and his Dracula cohort James V. Hart, and it shares that movie's aim of trying to make a film true to the literary spirit and themes of the original novel.  That said, in feel and approach it's very much Kenneth Branagh's movie.  In place of the baroque immersion in setting and atmosphere that Coppola usually brings to a project (particularly Dracula), we get the fantastic energy that Branagh pours into his work.   It really is the first Frankenstein movie to capture the Romantic spirit of Shelley's book.  The frequent appearance of fire (especially the scene of the monster holding aloft the torch at the end) remind one of the book's subitle  The Modern Prometheus.  And Branagh's portrayal of Victor embodies all the promise and hubris of Shelley's protagonist.   And at the same time, the film manages to be a really good Gothic horror flick, too.  The lab setup is wonderfully imagined--everything one could want from a mad scientist's lab circa 1794--and some of the scenes are among the weirdest and most horrifying ever filmed.  Horrifying in the old-school sense, the feeling that you're watching Something That Should Not Be.  I'm thinking of Victor's weird dance in the amniotic fluid with the newly reanimated monster, still unable to stand.  It goes on forever, while the viewer becomes more and more aghast at what is being shown.  Then there's the climax, where he reanimates his bride, and the viewer realizes he's truly gone mad. The movie manages that rare trick of being two things at once  an intellectually satisfying literary movie and a ripping good adventure  Performances  Branagh's great.  Helena Bonham-Carter is also superb--her post-reanimation scene alone is worth the price of admission.  She must have had a lot of fun doing that.  Tom Hulce is fantastic as usual in a bit part.  And John Cleese is astoundingly good in his cameo. The only real problem with this movie is Robert DeNiro.  Physically, he's perfect for the role--a more monstery-looking Frankenstein's monster you couldn't ask for.  But once he learns to speak, it's Brooklyn, and it just about ruins the movie.  For this film to work the monster has to be alternately horrifying and poetic--you have to believe that under all those scars and stitches is a sensitive, wounded soul.  But every time DeNiro speaks it sounds like he's saying You lookin' at me?! even if he isn't.  The accent ruins it.  The monster's utterances are essential to the book, but I think it would have been preferable in the movie to have him remain mute, rather than let DeNiro speak.   If you can get around that, though, it's a fine movie. 7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance"},{"date":"2 July 2001","score":"","review":"  Monday, July 2, 2001SPOILERS BELOW.
