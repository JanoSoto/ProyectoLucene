[{"date":"17 July 2014","score":"","review":" Rushmore is a high school set comedy drama that provides laughs and also a sweet kind of strange story plus a great performance from a comedy legend. This also contains some great little characters, beautiful looking cinematography and sets that look like they were crafted for every great high school movie ever. With it's quirkiness and a style that many people may very much enjoy, I felt that it was firmly very good and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is massively fun to say it is so short, it is so quirky and well crafted, it could be said the end gets slightly more dull but generally it very entertaining throughout. I felt the comedy was maybe not massively funny but when it is funny, it pretty much is laugh out loud and coupled with the more dramatic parts, it is very fun to watch. The middle part of the movie is very fun, you will see what I mean if you see it but it at times can be very enjoyable to see it all.The main big performance here comes from Bill Murray and his very funny but different than usual acting display. Murray seems to blend his qualities in humour with a way of acting like a slob to create a memorable character who eclipses others in the film. Jason Schwartzman is the actual main actor here and he is pretty good to say he is so young and a crazy character who is unlikeable at times, Olivia Williams is also steady as the teacher in which she plays a pivotal role within the film.Wes Anderson's quality script is one of the shining lights of this film and his vision of this high school movie is seen out so well along with the performances. I liked the directing also but another massive positive behind the cameras is well, the cameras themselves in the cinematography which is at times maybe a bit strange but mostly is beautifully shot and just simple scenes without much meaning are done really well to say this isn't a film that had to do such things.Criticisms wise it doesn't have loads but the lack of comedy I think hits it, as said it is hilarious at times but a few more strong jokes could have and would have scored it higher. I wasn't too keen on the lapsing end of the movie where you can feel it has no ending in sight, it does finally end but it may make you slightly confused and possibly even bored with it. It could be said it is too short but it just about squeezes out what it wants to get out.I think teens yes may like it but everyone can certainly love it, it has that quirky style so many cult films seem to have and I believe this can be just that. If you like Bill Murray's style of comedy then I will actually say you could not appreciate him here but he brings something new and it really shows off by the end. It actually can be pretty sweet as well at times so if you want a fun quirky and at times a sweet film, this is exactly your type of film.Overall it is Firmly a Very Good movie, not quite Great or Excellent but nevertheless very highly scored. With this you just have to sit back and enjoy the stuff going on throughout, couldn't recommend it more to most film fans and I imagine some will love this much more than I did, and I enjoyed it. One more thing to add, it can get kind of busy in the middle and not confusing but mixed up so bare with it and it will pay off for you in the end.
