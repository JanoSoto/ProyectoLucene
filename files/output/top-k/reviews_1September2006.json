He too is caught up in a plot involving the Loc-Nah, which is also in this world, and is the pinpoint in a big huge sacrifice.3) Captain Stern A ruggedly handsome but irredeemably evil scoundrel is on trial for his various misdeeds, but he bribes a weakling named Hanover Fist to speak on his behalf at the trial, but Hanover gets a hold of the Loc-Nah, and it may or may not influence his Hulk like rampage at the trial.

It's enchanting to observe and quite challenging to follow, as there's always some ingenious gimmick to distract your attention from the main plot. I got hooked on it right from the GENIUS opening sequence in which a child's dream about Santa Claus slowly turns into an eerie nightmare. The action then cuts to the main character; the evil Krank who's unable to dream himself and hence kidnaps orphans in order to steal their dreams. Krank has an army of semi-human androids, one brother cloned six times, an uncanny midget-mother AND a malicious brain in a fish tank! Ron Perlman is a good guy for once!

Since the dawn of my obsession with film, friends of a more casual viewership have always claimed that I take the medium far too seriously. And while I do think an intellectual embrace inspires thoughtful critique, I am not beyond getting giddy over a film just because I can, reasoning be damned.Case in point Ghostbusters. Back in 1986, I started my school career as an extroverted kindergartener with a love for Saturday-morning (and weekday-afternoon) cartoons. Out of all I'd watch, The Real Ghostbusters was the most entertaining; I was endlessly fascinated by the premise of 4 guys running around New York (plus other parts of the world and even outer space) with their 'positron rifles,' blasting deformed comic apparitions. In hindsight, this mixture of comic hijinks and supernatural mayhem is probably what piqued my long-standing love affair with horror films.I didn't actually view the film version of Ghosbusters until I was a well-ingrained fan of the TV show, to the point where I had to adjust to the difference in appearance of the live-action characters (as opposed the other way around). Despite this, I warmed up to the film instantly--I laughed my butt off and was amazed by Richard Edlund's brilliant FX (which look f*cking incredible to this day). Bill Murray's portrayal of the coolly sarcastic Peter Venkman is one of my all-time favorite performances (and cemented Murray as my favorite comic actor); the efforts of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson also contribute to an unmatched cooperative of quirky humor that works better than one might imagine.The premise of Ghostbusters is so utterly ridiculous that it's something of a miracle it works as well as it does. The script, by Aykroyd and Ramis (back when they knew 'funny'), involves our heroes sweeping the ghost population of NYC while dodging EPA toady Walter Peck (Die Hard's William Atherton, in a hilariously straight performance); in the meantime, Venkman woos musician Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment becomes a portal for ghoulish baddie Gozer to enter through. Over the course of the movie, we'll cross paths with people who transform into hell-hounds, a giant marshmallow man, and a ghoul that would give David Bowie a run for his androgynous money.Through all its absurdity, Ghostbusters works well because of the characterizations--while everyone has a distinctive personality quirk that is somewhat exaggerated, they are fleshed out to the extent of being believable and worth rooting for. Not once does the film lapse into farce at the expense of character, which makes the humor even bolder; this also helps make the Armageddon scenario that arises in the third act the stuff of Vonnegutian genius (in the face of imminent global catastrophe, humor keeps the human spirit aloft). Due credit should go to director Ivan Reitman, who manages a seamless interplay between the comedic and the horrific without allowing one to awkwardly dominate.Personally, Ghostbusters is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to my childhood, a film that makes me grin as excitedly now as when I was 8...perhaps because nothing in it looks particularly dated (the effects actually look BETTER than anything that's come since), and the humor is still as fresh as it was upon my first viewing. While I could probably write a dissertation on Ghostbusters' impact on cinema and popular culture, I think I'll conclude by saying this is an entertainment everyone should be exposed to at least once. If you don't like it...well, that's your loss.

Over the course of the movie, we'll cross paths with people who transform into hell-hounds, a giant marshmallow man, and a ghoul that would give David Bowie a run for his androgynous money.Through all its absurdity, Ghostbusters works well because of the characterizations--while everyone has a distinctive personality quirk that is somewhat exaggerated, they are fleshed out to the extent of being believable and worth rooting for. Not once does the film lapse into farce at the expense of character, which makes the humor even bolder; this also helps make the Armageddon scenario that arises in the third act the stuff of Vonnegutian genius (in the face of imminent global catastrophe, humor keeps the human spirit aloft). Due credit should go to director Ivan Reitman, who manages a seamless interplay between the comedic and the horrific without allowing one to awkwardly dominate.Personally, Ghostbusters is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to my childhood, a film that makes me grin as excitedly now as when I was 8...perhaps because nothing in it looks particularly dated (the effects actually look BETTER than anything that's come since), and the humor is still as fresh as it was upon my first viewing. While I could probably write a dissertation on Ghostbusters' impact on cinema and popular culture, I think I'll conclude by saying this is an entertainment everyone should be exposed to at least once. If you don't like it...well, that's your loss.

To have three stars like Liotta, Pesci and de niro produce their best work, (first two mainly just shows the caliber of the film. If you look at the other contenders, Brando was the star in a great film, Pacino was, also as montana, but they carried those two films in my opinion. I may be biased as i think de niro is the greatest actor of all time but there you go. Let me know what you think and any other films that i may not have seen.

You're wrong! Jonny Depp is far from being amazing here, he even fails to deliver an average performance with his character's palette of expression limited to a cold face and a once in a while smile. Charlize pretty much play the samecharacter than in the Devil's advocate but seems even more insecure andweeps for most part of the picture. Concerning the storyline, the pace of the film is so slow that you will find yourself falling asleep after a couple of minutes. So why a 6? Because cinematographically speaking, it has no plot hole and descent shots. In a word it is decently made but without any tastes.

I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops one being a veteran corrupt one Alonzo (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one Jake (Ethan Hawke). This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started. At least that was the case on the first viewing. On the second, I didn't find the whole thing that appealing.I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.

Moreover, it seemed like whereas TTS was more of a biting satire, Edtv was going soft - maybe trying to be cute - with cameras following a video store clerk (Matthew McConaughey). However, years of reality shows have shown just how disgusting TV can get. And these two movies predicted it. Although I do prefer the former, the latter actually seems to be portraying what we now know as reality shows.So, I will say that this movie doesn't do as good a job as The Truman Show, it does have some funny scenes. I actually thought that Ellen Degeneres and Rob Reiner were the two best cast members. OK seeing once; Ron Howard has done better. Also starring Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Hurley, Jenna Elfman, Sally Kirkland, Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper and Clint Howard.
