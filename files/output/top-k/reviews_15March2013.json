Tootsie was on a popular roll that follow up the same humor as Some Like it Hot (1953). Hoffman does an incredible job as the nervous, slightly overbearing, not-so-slightly arrogant theater teacher Michael Dorsey who is forced into an unbelievable set of circumstances as a result of his rather unorthodox method of finding work. Michael's agent George Fields (movie director Sydney Pollack) can't even get his client a commercial since Michael complained that the tomato he was playing wasn't properly motivated. After screaming at Michael for being so obnoxious, he warns Dorsey that he might never find work as actor again. Dorsey doesn't think so, so when he hears of an opening on a popular Hospital soap opera for a woman role. He applies for the job by posing as 'Miss Dorothy Michaels'. The debut camera shot of Dorothy walking on the New York City's Street is amazing. Michael wins the part and becomes a widely known popular actress due to Michael acting out his character as a feisty, feminist administrator, which surprises the other actors and crew who expected her to be another swooning female in the plot. While Michael is on the soap, he falls for his co-star Julie (Jessica Lange, in an Oscar-winning performance) but, as Dorothy, is courted by Julie's widowed father (Charles Durning). The vocal exchange between Charles and Dustin is just funny as hell in the film. Michael ultimately finds that his disguise as a woman has made him a better man when dealing with women, due to quickly learning a little about what life is like for the opposite sex. The movie has this great message about gender equality in its humor. Still, he cannot hide in the role any longer. Michael must finds a clever way to extricate his character before he lose Julie's love forever. The final scene with Dorothy is funny and need to be watch. Yes, it's truly a nutty hospital. Tootsie's gender bending premise was great. The movie work with all the main leads, and support by memorable comic performances from Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, George Gaynes, and Bill Murray. Also the movie makes the film debut of future Oscar winner Geena Davis. It Might Be You, sung by singer Stephen Bishop was a work of genius. I also like to mention Metamorphosis Blues by Dave Grusin being a great song in the film as well. I love how they were trying to avoid writing a farce while making the film, but still at 116 minutes Tootsie is simply too long to support its one gag; Hoffman as a woman. While the movie offers its share of amusing moments, it eventually wears out its welcome and emerges as a fairly forgettable. Dustin Hoffman's acting as Dorothy can be a bit over acting. While I don't know if it's on purpose or not. It get kind of annoying hearing a cheat mocking Southern accent from him. Some homosexuals might find the movie a bit offending or degrading. The reason for this is because of movies with male cross dressing tend to be comical or mock about. Also straights being confront by homosexual acts in film tend to be funny. Not only homosexuals, but women can find this movie a bit offended as the movie is saying that strong independent women have to be manly. Cross dressing for example in comedy usually revolves around caricaturing and making fun of the other sex like women, albeit in a lighthearted way. Still, Tootsie was a pop hit!

Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a movie about a killer shark but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies of its generation. I'm talking, of course, about Jaws. This thriller has a very simple premise but turned out to be one of the best movies ever made. Filmed on Martha's Vineyard, this film was a pain to shoot, but the reward was well worth it.Jaws had a really strong cast with Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss. Chief Brody struggles to convince his summer town that there is a killer shark in their waters. The big problem is that it is 4th of July weekend and they need this weekend because tourists bring in all the money the town needs to survive. If word gets out of a killer shark that means no money which means no survival. Murray Hamilton plays the foolish mayor who won't listen to reason. The shark kills a few people and push comes to shove. Brody brings in Matt Hooper, a shark expert, and they figure out the shark is a great white. This thing is a cold blooded eating machine. All this fish does is eat, sleep, and make baby sharks, it's that simple. Eventually, the town hires Quint, a local fisherman and Brody, Quint, and Hooper venture out to kill the shark. That is our story and it really is done so well.Jaws is based off a book and they are similar. The basic story is obviously the same, character relationships and development is very similar. The only difference is that Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. In the movie itself we see them get along and build a relationship and its interesting how Spielberg threw a little tease n there for fans of the book. Also the endings were both different which I also find interesting. The movie ending was way more explosive and enjoyable.As I said this movie was terrifying when it was released in the 70s, but it was scary by accident. The mechanical shark they used was named Bruce, but the thing never worked. To make up for it they only showed parts of the shark. It takes a long time to see what the full shark looks like. Sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, it's what you don't see, and that is what worked so well. We see a girl screaming for her life and getting dragged around, but we don't see what is doing it. It is almost disturbing but it worked and films have copied this tactic time and time again. There were also a lot of problems filming on the open sea. I mention this because any real fan of film would appreciate to know how hard it was to make this movie and how dedicated the filmmakers were to deliver.Along with the scary images of a torn leg, a decaying face, and blood being spit out of a mouth while the jaws of the shark pierce into the abdomen are horrifying, John Williams makes it ten times worse with two notes. Everybody knows the Jaws theme and how it starts out slow and picks up. As it gets faster and faster the shark gets closer and closer, and finally strikes. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time, and John Williams proves it once again, and he did it with two notes. Towards the end of the movie all the focus is on Quint, Hooper, Brody, and the shark. Hooper and Quint's relationship is really hysterical. It is old school verses new school. Quint is the rugged fisherman who just makes it up as he goes along. Hooper is the rich college boy with a plan. They butt heads a lot and their sarcastic remarks back and forth are very entertaining. My favorite scene in the entire movie is towards the end when the three men are on the boat telling stories of how they got their scars from sharks or whatever. Then Quint tells a true story of the USS Indianapolis. The USS Indianapolis was a cruiser that sank and all the sailors were in the water and over a few days sharks attacked and killed mostly everyone. Quint was on that ship and he tells the story. Robert Shaw gives one of the best speeches I have ever seen in any movie. The way he tells the story. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. He describes sharks really well and that story was not something I expected form the movie. The true story takes the audience out of the movie and you feel sadness. We dig into Quint's character and even the way the camera just focuses on Quint and how he tells the story. This is a scene I watch twice every time because I love the way he delivers the speech. The only problem I have with the movie itself is that there are two scenes that scare the daylights out of me and I still can't what, and it is impossible to understand what Quint is saying without subtitles.Overall, Jaws is a classic and I love the way it was made, the people in it, and the movie itself. The movie works and it is nearly flawless. Jaws is a movie everybody alive in this world needs to see at least once. I bought this on blu ray and it was the best up converted movie I have seen so far. The picture was perfect and the sound was amazing. Sometimes I find myself constantly changing the volume of my surround sound but not with Jaws. Jaws easily gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"15 March 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a story that has always bothered me from the first time I saw the original 1949 movie (The Heiress) many years ago to the recent Broadway revival. It is interesting to note that Judith Ivey who plays the younger sister of Albert Finney here played the older sister in the 2012 production (played by Maggie Smith here). And being a look at polite American society, this can be compared to Downton Abbey from the opposite side of the Atlantic, with Dan Stevens playing the young man squiring around Catherine Sloper in that production as well. Those who only know Dame Maggie Smith from Downton Abbey and the Harry Potter movies will enjoy her here in a change of pace role as a really kind matron who anxiously longs to see her niece (Jennifer Jason Leigh) get together with the poor but charming Morris Townsend (Ben Chapin) even though her doctor brother (Finney) is dead set against their even seeing each other socially.The real conflict here is the relationship between father and daughter, a complicated and resentful one. Father hates daughter because his beloved wife died giving birth to her, and he was never able to relate to her emotionally. While Catherine has inheritance from her mother's side of the family, her father makes it clear that she will inherit nothing from him if she does not do his bidding, which means not marrying Chapin. While the character of Catherine is supposed to be plain, Leigh doesn't fit the bill. The problem with her performance is that Catherine seems quite hard, while DeHavilland's Catherine was fragile and only plain by the fact that she wore a very severe hairstyle that was not flattering to her face. That made her seem more suppressed, and her inner beauty was more obvious.

It is interesting to note that Judith Ivey who plays the younger sister of Albert Finney here played the older sister in the 2012 production (played by Maggie Smith here). And being a look at polite American society, this can be compared to Downton Abbey from the opposite side of the Atlantic, with Dan Stevens playing the young man squiring around Catherine Sloper in that production as well. Those who only know Dame Maggie Smith from Downton Abbey and the Harry Potter movies will enjoy her here in a change of pace role as a really kind matron who anxiously longs to see her niece (Jennifer Jason Leigh) get together with the poor but charming Morris Townsend (Ben Chapin) even though her doctor brother (Finney) is dead set against their even seeing each other socially.The real conflict here is the relationship between father and daughter, a complicated and resentful one. Father hates daughter because his beloved wife died giving birth to her, and he was never able to relate to her emotionally. While Catherine has inheritance from her mother's side of the family, her father makes it clear that she will inherit nothing from him if she does not do his bidding, which means not marrying Chapin. While the character of Catherine is supposed to be plain, Leigh doesn't fit the bill. The problem with her performance is that Catherine seems quite hard, while DeHavilland's Catherine was fragile and only plain by the fact that she wore a very severe hairstyle that was not flattering to her face. That made her seem more suppressed, and her inner beauty was more obvious.

Clarke once said, If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered. And boy does this movie evoke thought! This is definitely one my favourite all time movies and one I feel deserves to be rated higher than what it is right now. 2001ASO tracks certain events spread across time which are connected by mysterious appearances of a monolith. The movie is constituted of three different sequences A look at early apes and some breakthrough moments in their evolution, Briefing at a space station and hushing up of a discovery on Moon, A manned spacecraft on course to Jupiter and the events on-board.Stanley Kubrick is a true visionary and his 2001ASO is a seminal work of art that paves way for more awe-inspiring works over the years in the Sci-Fi genre. For two and a half hours, Clarke and Kubrick manage to keep the viewer enraptured and in awe of the magical confluence of classical music and surrealist imagery on screen. The cinematography is brilliant (No wonder people were convinced of the Fake Moon Landing conspiracy theory) and visual effects in the movie are a treat for the senses,one that deserve to be appreciated all the more for the time this movie was made in. The space station scenes with bright closed spaces and high contrast sofas are very reminiscent of some of his other works, notably the Clockwork Orange. The credit for the amazing foresight and technological innovations shown in the movie must go to Arthur C. Clarke's vision. The space food, zero gravity toilet and other machines on board the spacecrafts are catered to with absolute attention to detail. Perhaps nobody uses music better in his movies than Kubrick and the use of the Blue Danube and Thus Spake Zarathustra help give a transcendental feel to the movie. The Blue Danube sequence is an exquisite one with the majestic soundtrack adding to every bit of it. In between, he makes you experience vicariously the eerie and haunting silence of space that keeps you on the edge of the seat. You get an idea of how lonely and insignificant one is in the vast nothingness. The breathing in the spacesuit being that one sign of life that keeps you hooked to what happens next. The movie does not feel rushed at any point and it's the music that plays the most important part in capturing the stillness in such an artistic manner. The dialogue, simple at all times, is engaging. The ominous foolproof and incapable of error declaration and the iconic I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that produce the effects of anticipation and shock ever so naturally. Finally, to the phantasmal (most fitting word) wormhole sequence and the ambiguous ending. While one can think of any number of interpretations, the one common element that probably connects them is a realization of the human race being on the edge of what is a vast ocean of knowledge that awaits us. We are just an insignificant and tiny part of the universe and the ending leaves us dreaming of the infinite possibilities that explain our existence in the larger scheme of things. There is no specific function that the monolith points to. It is the sum of all the uncertainties and the mysterious phenomenon that we fail to fathom. It leaves us wanting to explore and charter into the unknown. We have advanced till this stage and learnt of where we stand, it is now time to take the next huge leap.Forever indebted to Stanley Kubrick for giving us this pioneering masterpiece of his.

Horse carriages arrive with guests as a light snow falls. There is entertainment in the form of poetry readings, piano recitals and solo singing. As with any dinner party, there is a mix of small talk, politics, religion, and gossip. Based on a short story from James Joyce's book Dubliners, we get a feeling for the type of world where Joyce grew up as guests gather at the home of two sisters, Kate and Julia, and their niece Mary Jane. Irish nationalism was on the rise, the Catholic Church was dominant and Ireland found itself still locked to the bosom of Great Britain. Parnell, the Irish nationalist, represented the conflict between religion and Irish nationalism and his story is mentioned. The party has its share of characters, including an alcoholic who arrives drunk and talks too much, much to his mother's disgust. There is chatter about the opera from this musically literate group. There are no downstairs servants for this upstairs apartment where friends gather for food prepared by the hosts and entertainment by the group itself. At one point, the conversation turns to the Catholic doctrine of indulgences and monks sleeping in their coffins in repentance for the sins of all. Kate gets upset with the Pope over her sister Julia being removed from the choir in favour of a boys' choir, while confessing that she is a loyal Catholic and would never question the Church; she just felt it was unfair. As the goose is carved, the plates are moved very efficiently from one guest to another. By the end of the evening, the goose carcass with only the bones remaining has its wish bone removed and it is pulled apart by a couple to see who gets their wish. Gabriel Conroy played by Donal McCann is the man designated to toast the hosts. During the evening he is called a West Briton by a dance partner, because she feels he is not Irish enough. Gabriel asserts that he is tired of the emphasis on all things Irish, feeling more international in his outlook. The young lady later leaves to attend a Republican meeting, to the annoyance of some of the group. Gabriel silently rehearses his toast during the evening and reviews his notes as the party conversation is going on. His toast to the hosts, the three graces of the Dublin musical world as he calls them, is superbly delivered without notes. His wife Gretta Conroy is played by Anjelica Huston, daughter of the director of the film, John Huston. We sense that all is not well between them. When she leaves, she stops on the stairway to listen to a mournful ballad. She later tells her husband about a 17-year old boy whose memory is revived by this sad tune. This made Gabriel very discontent, knowing she cannot feel such intense love in their marriage. We feel in the dead of winter the sadness for a country that has suffered much and tries to cope with its grief by enjoying food, laughter, music and poetry.
