At least Brando was having fun making the film. That's obvious....and unusual.By the way, for those who look at ratings, despite the light, fluffy atmosphere of this story, this is yet another PG-13 that should be R for all the sexual content.

When the film opened to the vast spread of the city of Thebes, as a sphinx was being constructed and hundreds of people crowded the square, I knew I was in for something special. The film (directed and co-written by Stephen Sommers) has since become a fixture in my DVD collection. A movie I watch anytime I am bored and in need of a good jolt of excitement. Sure, the dialog can be silly, and the story isn't the greatest, and there is the occasional plot-hole or two, but it is still a completely enjoyable adventure that I personally believe will stand the test of time.We begin with the back-story... High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is having an illicit and highly forbidden love-affair with the Pharoh's beloved mistress. After murdering the Pharoh, she takes her own life and Imhotep goes about the task of resurrecting her. He is caught and condemned with the worst of all ancient curses, being mummified alive with the prophecy that should he ever be brought back, he will have power over the desert, invincibility, and the ability to control the 10 plagues of Egypt. (First Question\/Possibly Plot Hole If the curse is so bad, why not just use another one that isn't so risky?)Flash forward several thousand years to the 1920's. Adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is saved by beautiful Librarian Evelyn (Rachael Weiz), who hopes to use O'Connell's knowledge of an ancient and legendary city to be the first to officially discover and explore it. There is also her silly brother Johnathan (John Hannah), and several other characters who join them (including O'Connell's old friend Benny, played by Kevin J. O'Connor) during the course of the adventure. Also, the super-cool, tattoo-covered character Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) appears occasionally, to try and convince O'Connell and the others to stop what they are doing and leave. We all know what happens next. It turns out this lost city (Hamunaptra) is the resting place of Imhotep. And before you know it, he is brought back through the recitation of a dark passage from the fiendish-looking Book of the Dead. And so the story propels forward, as Imhoptep stalks several of the disposable, treasure-seeking sub-characters who helped free him. Why? Because he needs to kill them and suck 'em dry to regenerate his form from mangled mummy to studly guy in a bikini. (Why is he in bikini bottoms anyways, other than to show off his form and look imposing?) After this, it becomes the classical story of rescue the damsel in distress (Evelyn), who is going to be a human sacrifice in an evil ritual... a plot we've seen before. O'Connell and Johnathan are joined by Ardeth Bay (who is a Magi destined to protect the world from evil) to stop the evil beast once and for all.Sure, it may sound familiar. It might even seem familiar at times when you watch it. But the magic behind the movie is the fact that director Sommers is able to take formulaic plots (Damsel in Distress; Evil Badguy stalking victims) and generic characters (The silly one; the fat, gross one; the smart-yet-greedy one) and inject them skillfully with life and quirks that make them seem much more real than other similar films.Also notable is the lighthearted nature of the film, which has abundant (yet not overpowering) jokes throughout. This lets us know the direction Sommers wants to take... not that of a straight-forward horror, but rather more of a fun and thrilling adventure. Think Indiana Jones with more special effects and creepy creatures and you'll know what he is aiming for.And on the special effects... they were absolutely fantastic when the film was released, and unlike anything I had ever seen... And now, in 2007, it is safe to say that they have aged very well and still look quite good. As mentioned before, there are a few plot holes... Well, more gripes than plot holes, that annoyed me. For one, why do only five plagues occur when there were in fact 10 that haunted the lands? (Other than of course to save money on expensive visual effects and screen time) Also, why do the bad guy's cronies (pretty much just a bunch of other mummies) seem strong and powerful at first, then turn into slow, silly wimps when they encounter O'Connell? (Of course just to benefit the plot, but still annoying.) But overall, I think people will be having too much fun to notice, or even care, about these small problems.I personally love this film (And to a lesser extent, I enjoy the sequel Mummy Returns and spin-off Scorpion King quite a bit) and I still would recommend it to any fan of movie looking for a fun, fast and great adventure!

And so the story propels forward, as Imhoptep stalks several of the disposable, treasure-seeking sub-characters who helped free him. Why? Because he needs to kill them and suck 'em dry to regenerate his form from mangled mummy to studly guy in a bikini. (Why is he in bikini bottoms anyways, other than to show off his form and look imposing?) After this, it becomes the classical story of rescue the damsel in distress (Evelyn), who is going to be a human sacrifice in an evil ritual... a plot we've seen before. O'Connell and Johnathan are joined by Ardeth Bay (who is a Magi destined to protect the world from evil) to stop the evil beast once and for all.Sure, it may sound familiar. It might even seem familiar at times when you watch it. But the magic behind the movie is the fact that director Sommers is able to take formulaic plots (Damsel in Distress; Evil Badguy stalking victims) and generic characters (The silly one; the fat, gross one; the smart-yet-greedy one) and inject them skillfully with life and quirks that make them seem much more real than other similar films.Also notable is the lighthearted nature of the film, which has abundant (yet not overpowering) jokes throughout. This lets us know the direction Sommers wants to take... not that of a straight-forward horror, but rather more of a fun and thrilling adventure. Think Indiana Jones with more special effects and creepy creatures and you'll know what he is aiming for.And on the special effects... they were absolutely fantastic when the film was released, and unlike anything I had ever seen... And now, in 2007, it is safe to say that they have aged very well and still look quite good. As mentioned before, there are a few plot holes... Well, more gripes than plot holes, that annoyed me. For one, why do only five plagues occur when there were in fact 10 that haunted the lands? (Other than of course to save money on expensive visual effects and screen time) Also, why do the bad guy's cronies (pretty much just a bunch of other mummies) seem strong and powerful at first, then turn into slow, silly wimps when they encounter O'Connell? (Of course just to benefit the plot, but still annoying.) But overall, I think people will be having too much fun to notice, or even care, about these small problems.I personally love this film (And to a lesser extent, I enjoy the sequel Mummy Returns and spin-off Scorpion King quite a bit) and I still would recommend it to any fan of movie looking for a fun, fast and great adventure!

A lot of this comes from the notorious tendency of teen films to be nothing more than clichéd stories done to cash in the popularity of celebrities or fashionable trends, and sadly teen horror, source of most of the worst horror films ever made, is a main offender in this aspect. However, not every horror film aimed to teenagers is dumb, as there have been movies that actually use the conventions of its genre to actually make something interesting and creative with it. Brian De Palma's classic, Carrie, is probably the best example of this, as it intelligently uses teenage angst as source of horror. While nowhere near De Palma's masterpiece, Andrew Fleming's The Craft walks on the same lines with relative success.In The Craft, Robin Tunney plays Sarah Bailey, a troubled teenage girl with suicidal tendencies who has recently moved with her family to Los Angeles in order to have a fresh start. In her new school, she meets Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Rochelle (Rachel True) and Nancy (Fairuza Balk), three outcast girls who have an interest in the occult and actually are practicing witches. Sarah is invited to join their group after Bonnie notices that Sarah seems to have the real supernatural powers of a natural witch, and after she joins them in their rituals, they discover that with her help they are able to achieve things beyond the normal witchcraft. With this real magical power, the four girls begin to solve their respective problems and everything seems to be perfect, until the ambition for more power overwhelm them, and they discover that everything has a price.Based on a story by Peter Filardi, The Craft was written by director Andrew Fleming and Filardi himself. It is essentially a teen drama with a touch of supernatural horror that, while predictable in its storyline, feels fresh and original thanks to the interesting plot that Filardi creatively develops. What makes it interesting is the amount of research that the writers put on the screenplay, as they based the rituals the characters practice in real witchcraft practices that followers of nature-based religions perform (obviously with exaggerated results); and what's most important, the angle they take on the story is not meant to be disrespectful to followers of those religions, but presents it as a philosophy as valid as any other faith. Of course, it's hard to escape the clichés of teen dramas, but Filardi never fails to make the story entertaining thanks to a good amount of character development.Director Andrew Fleming takes a very straight forward approach with The Craft, following to the letter the typical conventions of the teen movie genre, with a dose comedy thrown to good effect, a very modern atmosphere and a polished visual look (courtesy of Alexander Gruszynski's cinematography) designed with the MTV generation in mind. While at first sight this may sound unoriginal, it actually adds to the film's charm, as the overall feeling that results as the horror elements begin to enter the story is one of a teen drama gone to the dark side. The special effects aren't really amazing but they work effectively and even today look pretty good and convincing. Fleming's directing of his cast is another of the elements that make the film good, as nearly everyone gives at least a good performance that helps the film in some way.As written above, the performances by the cast are something that makes the movie to stand out, starting with Fairuza Balk, who as the lonely and angry Nancy becomes easily the best actress in the cast. Going over-the-top as her character gets more power, Balk makes a villain that is as delightfully insane as she is sympathetic. Robin Tunney is a effective as Sarah, but her performance feels kind of weak when compared to Balk and even Neve Campbell (the fact that as the hero, her character is probably the most clichéd doesn't help). In the supporting roles, Neve Campbell and Rachel True are very good, specially Campbell who despite the relatively small size of the role shows why she would be the one whose career would rise in the following decade. Skeet Ulrich and Christine Taylor also appear in supporting roles with good results, although Ulrich seems to have troubles with his role.It would be easy to dismiss The Craft as just another teen horror film like the many weak movies the genre spawned in the late 90s, but even when it may not be a classic, The Craft has a lot going for it that makes it stand out among the rest. True, the story is predictable, disjointed at times, and truly loses some steam at the end; but the way Filardi plays with the moral conflicts between the characters as well as that of being an outcast and having magic powers is pretty interesting. That element together with the fact that it offers a different (and at the time fresh) view on witchcraft and nature-oriented religions makes The Craft an interesting and entertaining movie. Still, one has to remember that The Craft is first and foremost a supernatural teen drama, so anyone expecting a straight forward horror film will probably be disappointed. Despite its many flaws, The Craft is definitely one of the best American horror movies of the 90s, showing a true understanding of the 90s pop culture and a disposition to play with both the horror and teen movie genres. Sadly, few horror films followed this movie's path and most of the rest of the teen horror movies for the MTV generation ended up having the worst qualities of the genre. It's not Carrie but still, The Craft is one of the good ones. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 August 2007","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Since its origins in the beach films of the 50s and 60s, the so-called teen film genre has been the target of much criticism despite its constant popularity among the audiences.

However, the fact that it was inferior to the other films cannot be denied even by die-hard fans of Star Wars.As has been repeated thousands of times, Jar-Jar is representative of the lack of effort on Lucas' part. He is annoying, and seems out of place amongst the serious message Lucas is trying to spread. If his antics had been turned down a couple of notches, the the film would have received an 8. But Jar-Jar seems to be an overdose of comic relief in near-fatal amounts. Perhaps if he was in another film, one which tolerated his behavior, then I might see things differently. But for me, R2 and 3P0 were as funny as the Star Wars films SHOULD get, because they kept the audience laughing without disrupting the plot. (Lucas apparently fixed this Jar-Jar flaw by reducing his screen time in Episode II and allowing him to indirectly cause the rise of the empire) Another thing was the child Anakin. This kid was also annoying. Lucas said that his behavior was to signify the innocence of Anakin, but for me it signified why some animals eat their young. Not to mention that this version of Anakin was so different from the version seen in the next film, and although this can be explained with time, it still seems a little much. He has fulfilled his dream of becoming a Jedi in number II, yet he is more depressed. Not seeing the connection. Now, Jake Lloyd is not to be blamed; he's ten years old, and most children don't have acting skills at 10 years old. No, I blame Lucas for even casting him in the first place. I think that a 13-14 year old Anakin would have been WAAAYY more believable.Darth Maul...an awesome-looking villain, kicks Jedi *** in the climax of the film, but he had had so little character development, and with one line of dialogue, he barely stood out from the droids (which were very well-done; the concept of a droid army, was, in my opinion, one of Lucas' greater ideas in the film).The force being explained through science? I need not speak. Part of the fun of the original trilogy was the combination of magic and technology, and the fine line dividing them. Lucas obliterated this line in a fiery explosion. Mysticism Gone. Or at least diminished.The podracing scene was an excellent concept, but executed in a disappointing fashion. And the climax of the film, with Anakin and the Droid Control Ship unbelievable. Really. It was very cheesy. (If the Anakin was older and more mature, then I would have believed it).Qui-Gon was brilliantly played, although I was disappointed by his lack of a role in the other two prequels. The last bone I have to pick is the lack of Obi-Wan's screen time. One of the most influential characters in cinema history only gets a few lines of dialogue throughout most of the film, and he only shines in the end in the climactic duel with Darth Maul.Now, I just gave this film what seems to be a negative review. However, in contrast to everything previously mentioned, I enjoyed it. It was a good film. Worth the watch. It just....was disappointing when I realized it was supposed to be Star Wars. STAR WARS, people! Overall, I give it a 7, minus 1 for Binks, minus 1 for Dennis the - sorry, Anakin in a out-of-place role, and 2 for the fact that it failed to live up to one of the greatest expectations for a film in the modern times.

Although this film is very bad it's just that what makes it so dam good. The story starts out with a cameo appearance by Cory Feldman playing Tommy Jarvis but it turns out this is only a dream and he wakes up. Tommy (Shepherd) now older, not sure how old and in great shape, is being sent to a halfway house for mental patients, I'm guessing around the area of Crystal Lake. As you go further in, this movie gets worse by the minute. Soon we are introduced to some characters, some retarded kids and the best being a mother and son pair of hillbillies that live in the area and hate the retarded kids who live there. They are by far the best part of this film. Apparently all the kids are on the honor system to be good and not misbehave. So a nut like this guy Vick, a patient there is allowed to chop wood with a large ax&#x85;.yea I'll buy that. Not surprising a fat mentally challenged boy named Joey offers Vick a candy bar and is denied and hacked to pieces. So one of the paramedics seems to be sickened by the scene, while the other seems to enjoy the carnage. A medic? Soon after we start to see the body count rise. But who is doing that's the big mystery. As if one couldn't figure it out. The local sheriff, who is a complete joke and can't act, proclaims it's Jason who has been dead for some time. OH MY it gets better. Let's see Jason really kills a lot of people in this, most deserving it. Some memorable kills would be the road flare, the belt, hedge clippers, motorcycle beheading, and of course the outhouse. Eventually Jason kills off most of the mental patients and we're left with one of the watchers Pam and a black kid named Reggie (Ross), one of the few bright spots of the movie. So of course Jason attempts to kill them, while Reggie continues to scream like a high pitched girl&#x85;.one of the funniest parts in the film. So some how Jason manages to catch up with them even though their running and he's not. Stupid! Soon they get to a barn, Reggie manages to drive a back ho into him, though he gets up and pursues. But now Tommy comes out of no where and confronts him, a struggle ensues Tommy gets whipped but they all team up on Jason sending him on to some sharp farm equipment. Now we find out that it was not Jason but a guy named Roy the medic, who son was apparently Billy and he when nuts when he saw him slaughtered. The ending is truly bad, showing Tommy taking over the role of Jason. Bad ending. Bad film.OK there's no question this film is bad. But this film is so funny for so many reasons. The acting is horrendous even more so than usual in these films, but since I don't watch a Friday movie for acting who really cares right? The story is bad but not as much as the Friday fans will tell you. Who cares if Jason is not in the movie? He wasn't really in the original either and if you know anything about mass murders there often is a copy cat killer, so cool it people. But it's easy to tell who the killer is so that part of the story is stupid. There are so many funny parts in this film&#x85;.let me review and laugh. 1. As stated before why would a place for mental patients allow one of them to have an ax? Not just one, but one who obviously has a few anger management problems and looks like he wants to kill you. 2. The medic's scene is stupid. How many medics would actually get a kick out of coming to a gruesome scene where a boy was just hacked to pieces? As the one says get your hands dirty I think not. 3. What's up with the greasers who come out of no where just to be killed? Apparently if you follow the time line of the movies, this film takes place in the 90's and even in the 80's 2 greasers would have been totally out of place. Can you say happy days? 4. I love the part when the playboy takes one of Tommy's masks and he slams the cream puff (so would I). 5. Of course the hillbillies are the best part and the vagrant visitor who is just looking to fill his stomach and Ethel is nice enough to feed him if he cleans the crap out behind the chicken coup. 6. What about Demon (Miguel Núñez Jr)? Anything this guy has been in is at least funny&#x85;street fighter anyone? Oh those dam enchiladas LOL then gets killed in the outhouse after singing with his woman. 7. Possibly the best part in the film, he hurt me ma! and the true retard gets beheaded on his motorcycle while his mother makes his stew (flavor added). 8 Watch the greatest shoot down in history when Robin shoots down Jake stuttering about who asks her to make love to him. LOL down in flames. 9. Who could forget watching Reggie get chased by Jason and screaming like a girl. 10. One of the dumbest things about this film is how Jason walks around while they run and yet he catches them. Soooooo stupid! OK so yes this will go down as the Halloween 3 and Nightmare 2 of the series, but if you can't laugh at how bad this film is your not gonna laugh at much. As a Friday movie this is bad, and basically this one big goof, but I have to give it a 6 for being so dam funny.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 August 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Friday the 13th V among fans has gone down as the worst of the series because of the absence of Jason. Although this film is very bad it's just that what makes it so dam good. The story starts out with a cameo appearance by Cory Feldman playing Tommy Jarvis but it turns out this is only a dream and he wakes up. Tommy (Shepherd) now older, not sure how old and in great shape, is being sent to a halfway house for mental patients, I'm guessing around the area of Crystal Lake. As you go further in, this movie gets worse by the minute. Soon we are introduced to some characters, some retarded kids and the best being a mother and son pair of hillbillies that live in the area and hate the retarded kids who live there. They are by far the best part of this film. Apparently all the kids are on the honor system to be good and not misbehave. So a nut like this guy Vick, a patient there is allowed to chop wood with a large ax&#x85;.yea I'll buy that. Not surprising a fat mentally challenged boy named Joey offers Vick a candy bar and is denied and hacked to pieces. So one of the paramedics seems to be sickened by the scene, while the other seems to enjoy the carnage. A medic? Soon after we start to see the body count rise. But who is doing that's the big mystery. As if one couldn't figure it out. The local sheriff, who is a complete joke and can't act, proclaims it's Jason who has been dead for some time. OH MY it gets better. Let's see Jason really kills a lot of people in this, most deserving it. Some memorable kills would be the road flare, the belt, hedge clippers, motorcycle beheading, and of course the outhouse. Eventually Jason kills off most of the mental patients and we're left with one of the watchers Pam and a black kid named Reggie (Ross), one of the few bright spots of the movie. So of course Jason attempts to kill them, while Reggie continues to scream like a high pitched girl&#x85;.one of the funniest parts in the film. So some how Jason manages to catch up with them even though their running and he's not. Stupid! Soon they get to a barn, Reggie manages to drive a back ho into him, though he gets up and pursues. But now Tommy comes out of no where and confronts him, a struggle ensues Tommy gets whipped but they all team up on Jason sending him on to some sharp farm equipment. Now we find out that it was not Jason but a guy named Roy the medic, who son was apparently Billy and he when nuts when he saw him slaughtered. The ending is truly bad, showing Tommy taking over the role of Jason. Bad ending. Bad film.OK there's no question this film is bad. But this film is so funny for so many reasons. The acting is horrendous even more so than usual in these films, but since I don't watch a Friday movie for acting who really cares right? The story is bad but not as much as the Friday fans will tell you. Who cares if Jason is not in the movie? He wasn't really in the original either and if you know anything about mass murders there often is a copy cat killer, so cool it people. But it's easy to tell who the killer is so that part of the story is stupid. There are so many funny parts in this film&#x85;.let me review and laugh. 1. As stated before why would a place for mental patients allow one of them to have an ax? Not just one, but one who obviously has a few anger management problems and looks like he wants to kill you. 2. The medic's scene is stupid. How many medics would actually get a kick out of coming to a gruesome scene where a boy was just hacked to pieces? As the one says get your hands dirty I think not. 3. What's up with the greasers who come out of no where just to be killed? Apparently if you follow the time line of the movies, this film takes place in the 90's and even in the 80's 2 greasers would have been totally out of place. Can you say happy days? 4. I love the part when the playboy takes one of Tommy's masks and he slams the cream puff (so would I). 5. Of course the hillbillies are the best part and the vagrant visitor who is just looking to fill his stomach and Ethel is nice enough to feed him if he cleans the crap out behind the chicken coup. 6. What about Demon (Miguel Núñez Jr)? Anything this guy has been in is at least funny&#x85;street fighter anyone? Oh those dam enchiladas LOL then gets killed in the outhouse after singing with his woman. 7. Possibly the best part in the film, he hurt me ma! and the true retard gets beheaded on his motorcycle while his mother makes his stew (flavor added). 8 Watch the greatest shoot down in history when Robin shoots down Jake stuttering about who asks her to make love to him. LOL down in flames. 9. Who could forget watching Reggie get chased by Jason and screaming like a girl. 10. One of the dumbest things about this film is how Jason walks around while they run and yet he catches them. Soooooo stupid! OK so yes this will go down as the Halloween 3 and Nightmare 2 of the series, but if you can't laugh at how bad this film is your not gonna laugh at much. As a Friday movie this is bad, and basically this one big goof, but I have to give it a 6 for being so dam funny.

An excellent Hackman performance aside, this film, though far from boring, doesn't have that much to offer (unless you're a fan of the modern obsession in film and TV of flashback story-telling) . It's really a vehicle for the two main stars who have most of the screen time (Freedman is also good but plays the world weary cop again - a role to which he has almost become typecast). The film's main hook is the inevitable plot twist, which I imagine will keep you, as it did me, watching to the end. I got the ultimate plot twist wrong, but in my defence this may more due to the sometimes inexplicable behaviour of the characters rather the subtlety and guile of the script writers.This film never really rises much above the level of a who-done-it (with the draw back that there are only two characters that can form the lists of suspects). Dramatic realism, as so often in crime dramas, comes a distant second to the need to drip-feed background information to the audience in a build up to the plot twist. This is a shame as the portrayals of the two main protagonists by Hackman and Freedman are good and the central theme of a pillar of the community being drawn into humiliating admissions about his personal life is interesting (mildly). The ambiguity at times works well; the main character is at times sympathetic (credit to Hackman) and at others his self-serving privileged climb up the greasy pole and sleazy sexual mores are revealed; but is he guilty!!? This film has little real psychological depth (aside from Hackman the other star of the film is possibly Hackman's hair-piece - which provides the best piece of pathos in the film). Monica Berlucci looks stunning and adds sexual tension but is a somewhat impassive figure; wooden, but beautifully carved.In the end, the plot will have you questioning the characters actions and caring very little about them. The main criminal subject matter of child murder is treated in a somewhat lightweight and voyeuristic fashion The murders themselves are fairly incidental which is always uncomfortable; compared to the central horror of the story the drama played out by Hackman, Freedman and Bellucci seems trite, Unfortunately, Peurto Rico and its people are also incidental to the story which is a missed opportunity I think. At least it spares you the over-the-top, visceral exploitation of films like Seven - which makes it, in my opinion, a superior project - but that's not saying much.

Sure, it's an impossible story, but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie, it is however okay and fun to watch, entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used. Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time, which makes this a Christmas film. In fact, the movie has lots of Christmas decorations, lights, snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more, there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree (performed by Brenda Lee), You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch, White Christmas, Carol of the Bells, Oh Holly Night and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and some brilliant instrumental musics.Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid, he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the wet bandits Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected surprises. Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure, they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve, but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.The wet bandits were nicknamed like that by Marv because their calling card (according to him) was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said, both wet bandits are hilarious. Harry is more cranky, while Marv is the most stupid of the two (although both are stupid) and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain, a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene, followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason, I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally (particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film Angels with Filthy Souls are hilarious, but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him - he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin «Look what you did, you little jerk!», Kevin's parents should tell him something like «Frank, stay out of this and shut up!».The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister.

Geena Davis is also very good, ditto her editor\/ex-boyfriend.This is one of those films that is very hard to fault, technically or thematically, though if you are not a genre fan you will probably be repulsed by it or simply not interested. The special FX are realistic, and the film certainly doesn't pull punches in visually depicting the way Brundlefly eats and lives as his body and psyche are warped into something hideous.However as an entry in the horror genre, this film succeeds admirably. It is easy to care about Seth and Geena Davis' characters as they are presented as real, identifiable people with emotions, fears and flaws. Goldblum's anguish and fear is tangible as he struggles to come to terms with the horrifying changes taking place before his eyes, and Geena Davis is also very convincing as she too faces the horrible reality before her.Sex and death are said to be close relatives...so it is with this film, it is at once a touching love story (no, really...) and a truly horrifying horror film...but more than that it is a well-written, well-made, dramatic and exciting movie. Once a year is about all I can take though...it's very good, but it's not one I'd watch over and over.

When we were young, many of us loved stories about elves, goblins, fairies, and sprites in which children braved the unknown. When we got older, however, many became preoccupied with school, job, marriage, or children and never again dipped into the deeper, darker landscapes. Of course when no one is looking, we may secretly revisit tales from our childhood such as Rip Van Winkle or films like The Wizard of Oz or Darby O'Gill and the Little People. One of the most enchanting of this genre is Charles Sturridge's delightful adventure fantasy Fairy Tale A True Story.Fairy Tale\/ is a film about nature spirits known as devas, elementals, or fairies and is based on actual events that took place in Yorkshire, England in 1917 in which two young girls claimed to have seen and photographed fairies in the woods near their home in Cottingley Beck. The ensuing debate about the authenticity of the photos sparked a national controversy that pit spiritualists against skeptics and involved such people as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and famed magician Harry Houdini.The story begins when Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl) comes to England from South Africa to live with her uncle Arthur Wright (Paul McGann), her aunt Polly (Phobe Nicholls), and their daughter Elsie (Florence Hoath). Frances' father is missing in action in the war and Elsie has just lost her eleven-year old brother Joseph from pneumonia. Apparently, Elsie and her brother shared a belief in fairies and Joseph's room is filled with drawings of the barely five inch high winged creatures and an unfinished house for the little people. Frances and Elsie borrow Uncle Arthur's camera and take a photograph of the fairies they see in the woods and the photograph eventually ends up in the hands of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole) who persuades the girls to take four more shots.Sir Arthur, a Spiritualist, believes the photos are real as does Polly, a member of the Theosophist Society, and enlists photographic expert Harold Snelling to test them. Snelling concludes that the dancing figures are not made of paper or any fabric, are not painted on a photographic background, and that all the figures appear to be blurred as if the exposure had caught them moving in their dance. Doyle even involves the famous magician Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel) who is basically a disbeliever in things supernatural. Both men visit the girls and publish the photos in a magazine called The Strand which brings hundreds of curiosity seekers and journalists to the area in which the fairies were seen. A journalist is convinced that the photographs are faked and sneaks into Joseph's bedroom to try and prove it but is met by a curious visitor.Whether you believe in fairies or not, Fairy Tale A True Story rekindles a sense of wonder at the infinite mystery of life and the joy evident on the faces of the girls in the film's luminous ending seeps quietly into our hearts. Unfortunately, the film fails to inform us that the girls, interviewed in 1982 for an article in The Unexplained, confessed that the photos were hoaxes, cardboard cutouts pinned to the ground with a hatpin. Francis maintained, however, that one of the five pictures was real and stated in her last interview in 1986 that both she and Elsie saw the fairies and believed very strongly in them.She said that, The first time I ever saw anything was when a willow leaf started shaking violently, even though there was no wind, I saw a small man standing on a branch, with the stem of the leaf in his hand, which he seemed to be shaking at something. He was dressed all in green. Whatever the truth may be, there is even to this day still a strong belief in fairies around the Cottingley area and, after seeing Fairy Tale A True Story, some of us may believe in the possibility as well.
