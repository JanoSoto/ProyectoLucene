As he enters the anomaly, he is transported and crashed on a mysterious planet. While investigating the planet, Leo is captured by intelligent apes and imprisoned with a group of fellow humans. He is taken to a city and sold into the service of an ape named Ari. Leo, however, wants to get back to his ship and decides to escape. To his surprise, Ari helps him. This enrages the ruthless General Thade and galvanizes him into declaring martial law and rallying the ape army to destroy the humans.I watched the first Planet of the Apes movie when I was a kid. It was dull and boring. I was worried when I bought the new version that it'd be as bad as people said it was. However, I enjoyed it. Director Tim Burton completely holds back his dark Gothic method of filming and instead creates a rich, detailed world on how apes would live if they were as smart as humans. The Apes are different in this movie. They are more ape-like while the humans were intelligent and can speak, extremely different from the original Planet of the Apes.Acting-wise, the film is golden. Leo Davidson is played excellently by Mark Wahlberg while Tim Roth is brutally awesome as General Thade. Even under heavy ape makeup, Helena Bonham Carter is beautiful as Ari. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa bring in a brooding presence as Attar and Krull. Paul Giamatti is quite funny as Limbo the Human trader and Estella Warren is beautiful as the human girl Daena.

Instead of the comic-book plot and feel of The Legend of Zorro, everything is made realistic, from the fight scenes to the plot. The Mask of Zorro has awesome fight scenes and great acting from Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. Bob Anderson unleashes himself in this film, creating vivid and just plain cool fight scenes and action sequences.On the day the Spainards were pulling out of California, the governor Raphael Montero wanted one last reckoning. He created a trap to bring Zorro out in the open so he could kill him. He was successful in a ways. Zorro was revealed as Don Diego de la Vega and was imprisoned. To make Diego suffer even more, Montero kidnapped Diego's baby daughter, Elena, to raise as his own.20 years later Diego has escaped from prison and Montero has returned to California to fight for its independence from Mexico and America. At the same time, A small-time bandit named Alejandro's brother is killed by the cruel US army captain, Harrison Love. Diego begins to train Alejandro in the ways of Zorro so they both can take their revenge while stopping Montero from slaughtering hundreds of people in order to make California his own kingdom.The Mask of Zorro rocks big time. Antonio Banderas plays the new Zorro perfectly with suave charm and determination. Anthony Hopkins rocks, as usual, as Diego, who is now consumed by revenge and retrieving his daughter from Montero's grasp. Catherine Zeta-Jones does a great Spanish accent as she plays the slightly naive Elena. Stuart Wilson is cold and merciless as Don Raphael Montero and his performance is on par, appropriately, with Anthony Hopkins's performance.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2006","score":"","review":" Dear Readers,The Mask of Zorro is the best Zorro I've ever seen.

No one has ever known we were among you... until now...Probably one of the most popular Cult Classics is Highlander. With three okay sequels and a killer awesome TV Series, Highlander has cemented itself as a successful series with a large fan-base. Christopher Lambert is interestingly cast as Connor, his french accent has a tendency to overlap his Scottish. Sean Connery is at his best as Ramirez, a philosophical swordsman who's both dapper and charming. Clancy Brown is rather 2-dimensional as The Kurgan but he has some killer (Literally) fight scenes.Connor Macleod is different from other people. He's immortal. He's battled through the centuries his fellow immortals and mortals until he arrives at the Gathering and will win the 'Prize'. Pursuing him throughout the years is the brutal Kurgan, a ruthless monster Immortal seeking to rule the world. Teaching Connor is the charming and charismatic Juan Sanchez Villa Lobos Ramirez, who is soon killed by the Kurgan. Now it is 1989 and the Gathering has arrived. Two Contestants will fight, but there will Be only one victor.Highlander, despite its crazy premise, is a good action thriller. The Fight scenes and Special Effects are a little cheesy considering this is a low-budget movie but they do a good job. The Actors all are quite good, especially Sean Connery. Queen's score is nice while the direction is interesting.

It has a great all-star cast, neat score by Jerry Goldsmith, excellent acting, and lots of action and fight scenes. There's some gruesome events that are shown off-camera that mature the film up a bit which makes it a little harder to watch than an Indiana Jones Film, since those aren't graphic though a little creepy at some scenes.Thousands of years ago the High Priest of The Pharoh of Egypt, Imhotep, fell in love with the Pharoh's Mistress, Anuck-su-Namun. When the Pharoh Seti discovered the romance Imhotep and Anuck-su-Namun killed him before the Pharoh's Bodyguards. While Escaping, Anuck-su-Namun killed herself, telling Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep took Anuck-su-Namun and her vital organs to Hamanaptra, the city of the Dead. His ritual to revive her was stopped by Pharoh's bodyguards, seeking vengeance. Imhotep's priests were condemned to be mummified alive while Imhotep was forced to suffer the Hom Dai, the most feared of all Egyptian curses. His tongue was sliced off and he was placed in a sarcophagus filled with scarabs.Years later a Foreign Legionairre, Rick O'Connell, is asked to lead an expedition to Hamanaptra. Heading the expedition is a young librarian, Evey and her conman brother Johnathan. The threesome embark into the Sahara, followed by a group of Americans who are after Hamanaptra for its treasures and wealth. Watching all of them are the Medjai, the descendants of Pharoh Seti's bodyguards, sworn at Manhood to stop Imhotep from rising from the dead. Both expeditions arrive at Hamanaptra and begin to excavate it with a secret key that Johnathan found. After digging for a while they discover Imhotep's sarcophagus and try to open it with the key while the Americans discover the Book of the Dead, the key to bringing dead people back to life. Evey reads from the book and awakens Imhotep, who begins consuming the lives of all who excavated the city of the Dead and unleash the seven plagues of Egypt. Now the three heroes must battle the ancient Priest who is searching for Anuck-su-Namun's body and a human sacrifice.The Mummy is filled with tons of adventure action. Brendan Frasier is excellent in his role as an action hero while Imhotep is perfect as Imhotep. Rachel Weisz is beautiful as the clumsy Evey and Josh Hannah is a laugh riot as Johnathan.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the recovery of a stolen item designated Chimera. You may select any two team members, but it is essential that the third member of your team be Nyah Nordoff-Hall. She is a civilian, and a highly capable professional thief. You have forty-eight hours to recruit Miss Hall and meet me in Seville to receive your assignment. As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. And Mr. Hunt, the next time you go on holiday, please be good enough to let us know where you're going. This message will self-destruct in five seconds.Forget the boring first movie, MI-2 is golden. With an easier plot, tons of cool martial arts, and some killer acting (Literally in some cases) Mission Impossible 2 is the second best spy film ever! As Ethan Hunt is busy climbing rocks in America, a rogue IMF Agent named Sean Ambrose steals the antidote to a monster virus called Chimera. Enlisting the help of his fellow agents Luther Stickell and Billy Baird and professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall, Hunt goes to Australia to hunt down Ambrose and stop his plans for the deadly virus.MI-2 is a John Woo masterpiece. The action sequences are stunning and awesome at the same time. John Woo's use of slow-mo camera work intensifies the film and makes it more spectacular. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt much more like Maverick on Top Gun. Thandie Newton sizzles as Nyah while Dougray Scott and Richard Roxburgh are sinister as Sean Ambrose and Hugh Stamp. Ving Rhames returns to play Luther, whose character is more fleshed out than he was in Mission Impossible. John Polson is funny as Billy Baird and Brendan Gleeson is cool as John C. McCloy. Add in guest star appearances from Rade Sherbedgia and Anthony Hopkins and you've got yourself a kick-butt film. Plus, Hans Zimmer writes the score, using an awesome Hard Rock and Roll guitar to enhance the film.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Dear Readers,Good morning, Mr. Hunt. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the recovery of a stolen item designated Chimera. You may select any two team members, but it is essential that the third member of your team be Nyah Nordoff-Hall. She is a civilian, and a highly capable professional thief. You have forty-eight hours to recruit Miss Hall and meet me in Seville to receive your assignment. As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. And Mr. Hunt, the next time you go on holiday, please be good enough to let us know where you're going. This message will self-destruct in five seconds.Forget the boring first movie, MI-2 is golden. With an easier plot, tons of cool martial arts, and some killer acting (Literally in some cases) Mission Impossible 2 is the second best spy film ever! As Ethan Hunt is busy climbing rocks in America, a rogue IMF Agent named Sean Ambrose steals the antidote to a monster virus called Chimera. Enlisting the help of his fellow agents Luther Stickell and Billy Baird and professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall, Hunt goes to Australia to hunt down Ambrose and stop his plans for the deadly virus.MI-2 is a John Woo masterpiece. The action sequences are stunning and awesome at the same time. John Woo's use of slow-mo camera work intensifies the film and makes it more spectacular. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt much more like Maverick on Top Gun. Thandie Newton sizzles as Nyah while Dougray Scott and Richard Roxburgh are sinister as Sean Ambrose and Hugh Stamp.
