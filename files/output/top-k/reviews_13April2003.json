It has a great cast with Robin Williams and Philip Seymour Hoffman, a great scriptwriter in Steve Oedekerk, and a great premise for what should have been a great movie. But something went wrong in the process, and what we get is a wannabe great movie. It tries to be the Next Great Drama, but it isn't.Robin Williams gives a standout performance as Patch, a man who believes that laughter is a better cure than anything doctors can give us. But Williams doesn't seem to really hold the film as well as he usually does in cases like Jumanji, mainly because he doesn't fit all the attributes of the character. If you told me, Hey, there's going to be a movie about a doctor who cures people with laughter, my first thoughts would be Jim Carrey, Steve Martin or Robin Williams. Out of those three, my first pick would be Steve Martin, then Robin Williams, then Carrey. So, yes, Williams fits the TYPE of character, but not the actual character. He just doesn't talk like Robin Williams, he doesn't really act like Williams...so Williams has to adjust to this character, and we can see that the stretch in character is visible.Robin is good, but there's just something that doesn't work in his character.Patch Adams is a man who, in prison overnight with a crazy man who thinks squirrels are attacking him all the time, realizes laughter is the best medical cure. After he gets out of jail he enrolls in medical school, but encounters strict doctors and the dean of the college whose views on medical procedures are much different than Patch's. Prejudice is taken to new heights as Patch is constantly being beaten down by the cynical doctors who are after one thing money. Actually, two things money and money. So Patch constantly sneaks into the campus hospital and makes the patients there smile and giggle and laugh and cry with giddiness, and Patch gets a certain new-found high from this experience. Soon Patch opens Gesundheit!, his own medical shack which treats patients free of charge, while at the same time providing humor in their life. Here he and fellow medical students steal supplies, under the knowing eyes of kind hospital staff, from the college hospital to treat their Gesundheit! patients with. But things turn bad after Patch's girlfriend is shot by a mentally-deranged patient. Patch is later put on trial for medically treating patients without a license. His argument? You treat a disease, you win, you lose; you treat a person, I guarantee you win!So Patch fights for the right to treat his patients, up until the end of the film where (spoiler ahead) Patch graduates college in a revealing scene (was that really Robin? I don't think I want to know), and continues to run his Gesundheit! hospital in the middle of nowhere.Patch Adams is based on a true story which took place in the seventies, but, surprisingly, something about the film just doesn't click right. There's a certain something that doesn't hold together. It desperately tries to be the next big thing, but it doesn't really accomplish this as well as it should. It's too heavy on the sappiness, and too light on the comedy. It tries to be too cute for its own good, and too emotional for a film of its stature. It's not Citizen Kane material, and never will it be. It is a light-hearted comedy that preaches a true message using a true story. Well, that's what it should have been. But it's not.The film is good to a certain degree, I'll give it that, but on a level as a whole it does not excel at what it tries to do. I became uninterested in the story after an hour, and for a film like Patch Adams, that's pretty bad.

I knew I would be in for an unforgettable ride that would not give up for a second. I got what I expected because my expectations were just right. Let me explain. I didn't know about David Lynch until I saw Mulholland Drive. Sure, I remember seeing the commercial for Lost Highway when it first came out, but I knew nothing about the film or who made it then. I loved everything about Mulholland Drive except for the incoherent story. Well, that is a big part of the movie, isn't it? It took me some time to get over that, and actually think about it (although I'm not close to being done). Anyways, having watched Mulholland Drive, and learning some information about Lynch afterwards gave me the right expectations for this film.Lost Highway is not for everybody. I think film noir, surrealism, and dark movies are generally not for the mainstream casual movie audience. I think it is an acquired taste, and only certain people will like this movie. Of course, if you're an open-minded person, and can handle strong content, then you might appreciate this film. Most detractors don't like this film for the same reason they don't like other Lynch films like Mulholland Drive, mainly because the story doesn't reveal itself right away. Their main argument is that films like these put nonsensical elements together and pretend to be art, and that people just eat it up. I am glad that there are critical people like this around who question the artistic value of such films because it's good to be skeptical rather than accepting things right away. I'm not art expert, and I believe it's hard to be one because so many subjective elements make up art. Sure there are objective elements one can look at, but it still comes down to your personal views about it (somewhat like film reviews). Anyways, these disputes will never settle, and so there is no point in arguing one way or the other, it's more about how the film connects with you.For me, entering the Lost Highway, I knew I would see bizarre things with wild twists and turns. I knew the movie would not be wrapped up with everything explained at the end. So one reason I watched this is mainly for the experience. So what can I say about the experience? Most of the movie was dark (literally and figuratively). Only few scenes contained daylight. The atmosphere was intense and never let up the entire movie. The background was droning with ominous sounds. I think Bill Pullman who plays Fred did an excellent job of creating the mood. At the beginning, we see him smoking, his face distraught and lost. He gets a buzz at the intercom and the message says, Dick Laurent is dead. At the end of the film, Fred leaves that message at his home before going on the wild police chase. Supposedly, Fred killed his wife, Dick Laurent, and Andy. One key line in the film is Fred saying, I like to remember things my own way...Not necessarily the way they happened. One theory is that while he was being executed for the murders, Fred thinks back to what happened, mixing the real with the imagined (the Pete character).One question that some wonder about is who taped Fred's house along with the murder of his wife, if indeed the Mystery Man is a part of Fred's conscience. To answer this question, one might refer to the Mystery Man saying, You invited me. It is not my custom to go where where I am not invited. This doesn't necessarily answer the question if he's real or not, or if he really videotaped everything. One thing to remember is that the character is pervasive throughout the film. He's on the intercom at the beginning, at the party with Andy (and at the same time in Fred's house), with Dick Laurent when he calls Pete, at the cabin, and at Dick Laurent's shooting.The imagery in this movie is unforgettable, from the love scene between Pete and Alice to the look on Fred's face as he rides away at the end. I still can remember the scene at the beginning when Fred is making love to Renee and the time shifts to slow motion. With exasperated pants and breathes from Fred we realize that he is disturbed and disgusted as something is eating away at his mind. The look on the Mystery Man's face is haunting with his big black dark eyes, his pallid aged face, and the look of a sinister being.The soundtrack to Lost Highway is great with songs by Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and others. Lynch packed the movie with great eery sounds throughout so that it's made to feel like a nightmare. Yes, some may feel the movie is a nightmare because it gets under your skin. It makes you uncomfortable. I think that's what makes it so great, to have the power to cause real reactions.Lost Highway is one suspenseful horror that takes the viewer to the depths of the mind and reveals fears of the unknown. I loved this film, but I'm sure most mainstream viewers won't. This movie will appeal to the film noir audience and people with a love for the Absurd.

How are we to care for a character in which there is no depth or emotional attraction? I couldn't care less about what happens to Lewis' character, nor those who come in contact with him. It seems Lewis thought that by setting up a few gags he could forget about character development and no one would notice. Perhaps, as a summer fun flick, you could get away with this, in a sense. But you know what you can't get away with? You can't get away with it when the film is not funny--the only thing Lewis relies on to carry his film is nonexistent. No matter how dull the character study was in Eddie Murphy's 1996 The Nutty Professor, you have to admit it was at least kind of funny--I barely laughed at all in Jerry Lewis' take on the story. The script writing by Jerry Lewis and Bill Richmond is like colliding together a horribly unfunny blend of humor and a terribly boring, slow-paced plot. Jerry Lewis as the barsinger-type-hip guy was incredibly boring and lasted about ten minutes--way too long for something so unfunny.Jerry Lewis has put together an unfunny, boring, pretentious, unimaginative film that had inspiration but not enough charm to carry off the project the whole way.1.5\/5 stars - John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2003","score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Nutty Professor is what you get when you cross Jerry Lewis as an actor and Jerry Lewis as a director A mind-numbingly unfunny comedy that tries to be something it isn't.

I think it's safe to say that the 1996 remake (or just a film with that shares the same name) is not only funnier, but also entertaining--and that's pretty sad, because the remake wasn't even that great.Jerry Lewis plays a crazy dork-of-a-scientist that creates a...er...creation that makes him hunkier and more hip. Feeling more self-confident than ever before, Lewis hits the streets in his new persona Buddy Love. He (Buddy Love) then sparks relationships with women and becomes suave and vogue--until his new persona starts to ultimately take over and causes trouble.Jerry Lewis not only directs a boring film here, but a terribly pretentious one, too. How are we to care for a character in which there is no depth or emotional attraction? I couldn't care less about what happens to Lewis' character, nor those who come in contact with him.

People were scared to death to go into the waters and Jaws became the very first summer blockbuster. As set by example by later Hollywood, it made money, WE NEED A SEQUEL. Well, Jaws 2 was an actual book, but why not capitalize on it's success? Jaws 2 actually is a decent movie, I don't know why this film is so picked on. I think because it does have a bit of a slow start, but the ending is fantastic. This was one of the first times we saw good looking teenagers terrorized. Arguably yes, it's silly to think the shark would come back for a second bite, but why not just let go and have a good time with this one? I went back for seconds and still like this movie.Once again, Mayor Vaughn doesn't share Brody's belief that the town has another shark problem and warns him not to do something hasty. The following day, while Brody is in an observation tower, he sees a large shadow produced by a school of bluefish, which he mistakes for a shark. In his haste, Brody orders everyone out of the water and fires his gun, causing a panic. The town council fire Brody for the beach incident, with Mayor Vaughn being the only one to vote against dismissal. The next morning, Mike sneaks out and goes sailing with his friends, but has to take his young brother Sean along to stop him telling his parents about Mike's trip. But as they sail on the waters, the shark decides it's time for some afternoon lunch and terrorizes the teens. Martin realizes with his sons missing, they may be in trouble and goes to save them and their friends.Does the movie have it's flaws; yes. The acting is alright and the plot is a bit silly. The beginning is a bit slow and the story isn't as interesting as the first film with intelligent adults as clearly this was made more for the scare and bringing back old characters for the fans. Not to mention that the boat scene was a bit sloppy where the dumb woman is grabbing a bottle of gasoline to light the shark on fire I'm assuming but looses her balance and dumps it on herself and proceeds to shoot a flare gun! Yeah, she had it coming. There is a really bad mistake caught on film when the shark reaches in to bite Michael, Jaws scraps it's mouth on the boat and the mouth bends as if it was plastic, lol. But one of the things I like about the film is that it still does give a good scare with the teenagers. Especially when Marge has to save Shawn out of the water and she can't get back up on the boat and keeps slipping, as you see Jaws going after her and it just breaks your heart when Shawn witnesses her death. Also I have a guilty pleasure for the actor Keith Gordon(Christine, All that Jazz, and Back to School), this was one of his first films and he does a very good job. The cast seemed to really click and did a good job working together. Plus you have to love how marine Martin Brody gets when he faces down Jaws for his last time and goes for that money shot. Jaws 2 is definitely flawed, but honestly a fun film that too many people judge harshly. I think it's just a fun popcorn flick that you need to let go and just have a good time when sequels had good intentions.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2003","score":"32 out of 36 people found the following review useful","review":" When Jaws was released in 1975, I don't think audiences knew what hit them.

However, later I learned that the most extreme alcoholics develop such a high immunity to alcohol´s effects that alcohol makes them act relatively normal more than anything else. When under the influence then, Cage´s character acts calm but also unfocused, silly ,  crazy, and irresponsible. When he has too little alcohol in him, he gets worse shakes than anyone kicking a harder drug. Whether all this is accurate, I really don´t know now. His relationship with the Elisabeth Shue character can be touching at times, especially in the scene when she lets him stay in her apartment and he gets a truly grateful smile on his face as a result. However, the movie would have actually benefitted  from an extra hour or at least more touching moments because the relationship is presented as  too quick and choppy for the viewer to fully sense it´s importance (even though the Shue character says how important it is to her at least three times to hammer this point home).  However, the most striking thing about the relationship is that we get the sense that the two characters could really change their dead end lives around if they made the effort, even though the process would be very hard.  However, as things rarely change for the better unless we actively want them to, we witness these two characters helplessly watch their lives fall apart because their attitude towards their lives is one of surrender.

Seriously, is it really necessary to watch Shue take a number one  or to hear her describe deviant sexual practices to know that the characters live rough ? Also, is pessimism really realistic or do  tragedies resonate more  in a world that is neither good nor bad ?

I remember watching it and thinking it was intriguing but hard to follow...but I was only fourteen or so. The video has sat on the shelf for a while, and I've kept it the same way that I've kept other films that intrigued me. One day I'll sit through them all and see what all the fuss is about. There are some films that you have to be ready to watch.  Anyway, it's been a good four or five years since I last watched it, and I decided to read the novel that it was based on a couple of days ago. (I like Raymond Chandler books - they're fantastically written, imaginative and inventive and effortlessly elegant, but in a hard-boiled way.) So I read the novel yesterday - it was my day off, and I really concentrated and read hard - and then watched the film again this morning. SPOILERSWhat was Altman thinking? OK, so he wanted to make an adaption of The Long Goodbye... but he didn't. He used the same characters and elements of the same plot, but why did he bother doing all the different stuff? Why not make a 'new' film?  So he wanted to update Chandler. Fair enough, That's OK with me. But why in such an inconsistent manner, and with such little regard or respect for the source material? Elliot Gould is fantastic, as always, the acting is uniformly splendid, the score is excellent and the camerawork is impressively foreboding. My problem is with Altman and his rather childish treatment of such a great source. There's something that has always bothered me about him - the 'easy target' syndrome. MASH, The Long Goodbye, Short Cuts, The Player.... all great films (yes, The Long Goodbye IS great, but VERY flawed). But why does he do things in such a childish and transparent manner? (Not just here - witness the clumsy dog sh*t in Pret A Porter, the war metaphors in MASH...and so on.) You can almost hear the conversation when he pitched this film to United Artists. Hey, let's make Marlowe a shambling fool. If someone was transposed from the early 50s to the early 70s, that's what he'd be, right? He can let people walk all over him. He can drive an old car and wear these strange anachronistic clothes so that it refers back to the period when the book was set... What? Have I read it? No, I didn't bother (allegedly). Anyway, forget all this mystery business, and the plastic surgery, and the intertwining relationships and the betrayal at the end and the rather tender and touching ending (so I've been told, I didn't finish it, remember?). Let's dumb it down. Let's include some senseless mysogyny, because that's what the 70s is all about. In fact, forget about telling a story, that can be incidental. Let's make it a big in-joke, and a scathing comment about cinema in the 1970s! Yeah, that'll work. The audience can unpick it themselves, including the references to Hollywood that pervade every scene. You know, the way that the security guy imitates Hollywood stars. The way that everything is done on looks and image and how people see things. Let's throw in some contemporary politics, some sly cursory nods to current fads. We can get rid of all the intriguing things about the novel...and replace them with generic stereotypes. 1970s audiences can't cope with subtlety or anything too complicated. And throw in a big chunk of missing money, cause that's what everyone's obsessed with nowadays. And get him to shoot an unarmed man at the end. Can he be in danger? No, he just commits a cold-blooded murder. Yeah, that's right, to end the film with. Then Marlowe can wander off as happy as Larry, and we can dub an ironic song on the end...yeah, 'Hooray For Hollywood' will do. After all, hooray for any town where we can get away with this butchery, huh?BUT.................criticism of Altman's motives aside.......... If you haven't read the book, or you don't read the book after you've read it, it works pretty well as an Altman film (a look at Hollywood from the inside, although not necessarily a subtle one). As an abstract look at Hollywood in the 70s (as I've outlined above) it works well and gives an insight into what was in vogue at the time. I only question Altman's reasoning behind using such an excellent text, butchering it completely and subverting the storyline for his own ends. I haven't got anything against adapting texts - after all, a book is a book and a film is a film. But when the source is so perfect, why not just come up with something _original_? ...And before you say it, I mean why not come up with your OWN story rather than dessicating someone else's. Why put Chandler's name on the credits at all?

Why not make a 'new' film?  So he wanted to update Chandler. Fair enough, That's OK with me. But why in such an inconsistent manner, and with such little regard or respect for the source material? Elliot Gould is fantastic, as always, the acting is uniformly splendid, the score is excellent and the camerawork is impressively foreboding. My problem is with Altman and his rather childish treatment of such a great source. There's something that has always bothered me about him - the 'easy target' syndrome. MASH, The Long Goodbye, Short Cuts, The Player.... all great films (yes, The Long Goodbye IS great, but VERY flawed). But why does he do things in such a childish and transparent manner? (Not just here - witness the clumsy dog sh*t in Pret A Porter, the war metaphors in MASH...and so on.) You can almost hear the conversation when he pitched this film to United Artists. Hey, let's make Marlowe a shambling fool. If someone was transposed from the early 50s to the early 70s, that's what he'd be, right? He can let people walk all over him. He can drive an old car and wear these strange anachronistic clothes so that it refers back to the period when the book was set... What? Have I read it? No, I didn't bother (allegedly). Anyway, forget all this mystery business, and the plastic surgery, and the intertwining relationships and the betrayal at the end and the rather tender and touching ending (so I've been told, I didn't finish it, remember?). Let's dumb it down. Let's include some senseless mysogyny, because that's what the 70s is all about. In fact, forget about telling a story, that can be incidental. Let's make it a big in-joke, and a scathing comment about cinema in the 1970s! Yeah, that'll work. The audience can unpick it themselves, including the references to Hollywood that pervade every scene. You know, the way that the security guy imitates Hollywood stars. The way that everything is done on looks and image and how people see things. Let's throw in some contemporary politics, some sly cursory nods to current fads. We can get rid of all the intriguing things about the novel...and replace them with generic stereotypes. 1970s audiences can't cope with subtlety or anything too complicated. And throw in a big chunk of missing money, cause that's what everyone's obsessed with nowadays. And get him to shoot an unarmed man at the end. Can he be in danger? No, he just commits a cold-blooded murder. Yeah, that's right, to end the film with. Then Marlowe can wander off as happy as Larry, and we can dub an ironic song on the end...yeah, 'Hooray For Hollywood' will do. After all, hooray for any town where we can get away with this butchery, huh?BUT.................criticism of Altman's motives aside.......... If you haven't read the book, or you don't read the book after you've read it, it works pretty well as an Altman film (a look at Hollywood from the inside, although not necessarily a subtle one). As an abstract look at Hollywood in the 70s (as I've outlined above) it works well and gives an insight into what was in vogue at the time. I only question Altman's reasoning behind using such an excellent text, butchering it completely and subverting the storyline for his own ends. I haven't got anything against adapting texts - after all, a book is a book and a film is a film.

I remember watching it and thinking it was intriguing but hard to follow...but I was only fourteen or so. The video has sat on the shelf for a while, and I've kept it the same way that I've kept other films that intrigued me. One day I'll sit through them all and see what all the fuss is about. There are some films that you have to be ready to watch.  Anyway, it's been a good four or five years since I last watched it, and I decided to read the novel that it was based on a couple of days ago.

Yes, this movie was made first, so calling it a Matrix rip-off is a sign that you should work on pumping up your IQ a few notches. Back to the point, they're similar, but yet so different. What am I talking about? Well, I'd say it's the style.There's no denying that both movies are stylish. The Matrix actually changed fashion when it was released. Dark City has a wonderful amalgamation of Film Noir and sci-fi, a weird juxtaposition that leads to a visual treat for the viewer. And it sets the movies miles apart. The plots have familiar elements. An artificial reality, subjective to those who are aware of it, an inhuman controlling race, a saviour character who learns to manipulate the reality better than the controllers. Yet they go about them in completely different ways.The Matrix is an action movie, first and foremost. Dark City is a mishmash of styles, with the old Noir detective mystery being one of the frontrunning feels of the movie. Do yourself a favour if you haven't seen it yet; skip the first two minutes of the movie. It explains a large part of the plot which is uncovered later on anyway, and it's much more satisfying if it's not just handed to you.The movie has pace, which again is at odds with its mood, yet somehow they work together brilliantly. A dark, dreary night with a fast-moving orchestral piece playing behind it as a character searches for answers, it's not what you'd expect, but it works. It's only heightened by the setting, the Dark City itself, which is a blending of many different architectural styles, though predominantly I was thinking of prohibition-era Chicago.

He asked a series of questions in his comment, claiming they didn't have answers, yet they did, right there in the movie.Why do the bad guys try so hard to kill the protagonist? When they realise what he's capable of, they don't, they try to capture him. Like they manage during the end. How can they have so little knowledge of his whereabouts and activities during the story if they are supposed to be observing him? They observe by pausing the city at midnight, and taking the memories. They don't have surveillance cameras set up everywhere. The cop has a gun, why don't they have guns? Well how many times have they had to deal with anyone they'd regard as dangerous? None. Why don't they all get sucked out into space when they (improbably) break a hole in the wall and see outer space? There's a blue barrier a distance from the spaceship which marks the outside of the ship, presumably what holds in the oxygen. You see the detective and stranger pass through it as they fall, and see it again at the end when the ocean fills up. Why do we only see them shutting everything down at midnight--wouldn't there still be daylight hours that follow the tunings? Like the good Doctor says, they control even the Sun. As John does at the end. If they can tune the whole environment, why do they not use this ability to overcome the hero when they are trying to detain him? It looks like they need to put their abilities together to do this, and as they're in the machine, not able to see where John is, it'd be impossible. If the Strangers are a group mind, they would not need to converse with each other the way they do. They have a collective memory, not mind.

There's a hell of a lot more potential there.See, the movie is subtle, there's a lot to pick up if you pay attention.But despite everything I've said about the movie, there's one main point to it.

If they designed the machine that changes the environment based on their telepathic powers, why can't they control it as well as the hero, or at least prevent him from using it? They didn't anticipate the need to stop a human using it, they didn't even believe he could Tune when they found out. As for the level of control, it's one thing that's not explained. Speculating, these things are the size of squids. The human brain is about as large as their entire body. There's a hell of a lot more potential there.See, the movie is subtle, there's a lot to pick up if you pay attention.But despite everything I've said about the movie, there's one main point to it. It's fun. If nothing else, you have a bunch of aliens chasing around a guy with psychic powers. And that's just good fun to watch.

Most of you thought it was long, but I thought it went by to fast, some people thought the ending was corny, but I thought the ending was great, and Stephen King found his best muse (in the book On Writing, by Stephen King, it's good you should read it) and none of his movies could compare to this one. Frank Darabont did a great job, and brought back as much drama as he did in The Shawshank Redmemption. I thought that Michael Clark Duncan made a once in a life time performance, and I would be stunned if Duncan ever acted better than this. Then Tom Hanks was great, his western accent. Even if they don't tell you he was a western folk, you can just tell by his every move. Then the screenplay was great, personally, my favorite line was We've never gone four times in one night since we were nine teen. And the art direction, oh the art direction was great, it made everything worth the movie, if you didn't have that art direction then the movie wouldn't give you a feeling like you were there. And the guy who playes Wild Billy made a once in a life time performance also, I don't think this actor will get another good role, because if you look at him, he seems sort of punkish, and probably is hard to get him to play the right role. But Frank, did a great job, and the cast director picked definitely the right people for the job, that's pretty much what I've been trying to say through these lines. Then the producer definitely did a fine job, but he did take a risk by putting the sreen time that long, because other people thought it was to long, I read the zagat book and they stated a lot of people thought it was to long (I know it's 3 hours and 8 minutes, but when you are into a movie so much, it goes by so fast). So really what I'm trying to state is that his is and excellent movie, and don't miss out on it, don't care what other people say about it, because I kind of didn't want to see this at first because I heard it was pretty long, and the ending was pretty corny, but I loved, just go for it.

By comparison, Chris Klein looks like he should be playing tennis. The guy doesn't even look like he shaves regularly. A sport like Rollerball would just chew him up and spit him out.However, the most important thing with a film like Rollerball is the story, and that is where this new version fails in a big way. The original showed us a world where a singular conglomerate of corporations controls the entire world, and people do whatever they are told or risk the most unkind sort of censure. The game of Rollerball was created in an effort to demonstrate to the people that individual effort was futile, and thus enforce their desire to submit to an ant-like existence. Obviously, such subtleties are beyond the writers of this 2002 version, and they instead dissolve into an extreme display of banal, pointless violence.

The ending of Rollerball circa 2002, with the spectators mostly running out into the parking lot, overturning cars, and killing one another, only demonstrates that nothing has changed and no one has been saved, to quote the song.And in the end, that sums up the whole 2002 effort. It is a film with no meaning, no message, and ultimately no point. If it was intended to be a story about the most extreme of extreme sports, it missed the mark by trying to appeal to everyone.

First I feel that this is the one of the greatest films ever and it is arguably the greatest film of all time and I feel that everything was perfect. The cast, the music, the sets, everything and the scenes are perfected with such emotional moments. One is that When Maximus returns home to find his family. Russell Crowe put everything he had into that scene! The performances of the great actors Oliver Reed and Richard Harris was outstanding and Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect choice to play Emperor Commodus and what a performance and Connie Nielsen  was such a smart choice. It was a treat to see Omid Djalili, Sven-Ole Thorsen, Ralf Moeller, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and Tommy Flanagan in one film! One of the greatest things about this epic blockbuster is the music by great composer Hans Zimmer. During the scene when Commodus and Marcus Aurelius are together for the last time (Patricide which it is called on the soundtrack which is track 7) the music plays during this scene and it fits the it perfectly and I believe that that is the greatest piece of music ever composed and I think this is Zimmer's greatest score ever and I don't think he'll be able to top it. Lisa Gerrard's singing in the film is beautiful! Buy the soundtrack along with the second great album by Zimmer and Gerrard on Amazon.com for a low great price! The second album I feel is even better than the first! Ridley Scott's direction was great and I loved the fast past camera effort and the battles were so good and exciting! That's all I wanted to say. I feel that Gladiator gets 10 stars and is one of the greatest films ever made! If you have not seen this awesome movie yet then when you have a chance rent or even buy it because believe Me when you watch it you won't want to stop and you'll want to see it again and again. Its truly a special film and I Hope that everyone will be able to see the golithian epic!

(SPOILER WARNING)Now, if a woman was handcuffed to a bed and sleeping and somewhat delirious and her ex-boyfriend showed up and had sex with her, when she is clearly in no position to give consent, few people would hesitate to label that as rape, and it certainly would not go without mention and condemnation in the film.  Yet Nicole rapes Matt, and the only issue that seems to arise is how he screwed up.  Excuse me? Granted, blaming the rape victim is not a new concept, but one would hope in this day and age it doesn't find its way into films, at least not without suitable counter statements being made.  Male rape is a serious issue that is rarely dealt with as such, and movies like this tend to reinforce the erroneous belief that male rape doesn't exist, except in prison, or Deliverance.  Maybe we shouldn't expect this movie to have any great social impact, challenge the views of the establishment, but acknowledgement that SOMETHING wrong had happened (other than Matt screwing up) would have been nice.  I seriously hope Nicole didn't get to collect on her bet.Also, someone suggested that it was unrealistic for Matt not to have woken up before he had an orgasm.  I'm not a guy, so I can't speak from experience, but there are such things as wet dreams.  It seems to me that was essentially what Matt had, only unbeknownst to him, he had a little help.

The film starts confusingly, and this is really the shape of things to come. We see a boy wake up on a road, stand-up, and smile to himself. Then get on his bike and cycle home. Once home things seem normal until that night when a strange voice seems to be talking to the same boy, at which point he gets up and sleep walks out of his house. A few minutes later a jet engine crashes into the house. Confused yet? -)Donnie Darko is literally very dark, and also a highly original film. I don't think there are any easy ways to gauge whether someone will like it or not. It doesn't help to hear too much hype about it, as expectations will be driven sky high for what is a very different type of film. Also the film will for most people require repeated viewings to make the most sense, and probably a visit to the DonnieDarko.com web site will be in order as well for those that want to understand the most about the story. Some moviegoers will not want to do this and\/or not appreciate this. You have been warned.I was fortunate to see Donnie Darko in mid-2001 before a lot of the hype surrounding the film had built up. I caught a trailer, and was very curious as to what this film was about. Personally, I wasn't dissapointed. A first time effort from Richard Kelly, this has that wonderfully original feel of someone new to cinema and with a childlike perspective, someone who wasn't adhering to convention. The movie plays a little like a stream of conciousness. Things happen, it isn't obvious whether they make any sense to begin with, but you soak it up and think about it later. As I thought about the movie, watched it second and third times, and read a little more about it, it all began to make sense. I don't think it requires a genius to understand it, but it does require some imagination. People often compare this to David Lynch's films, but it is not like Lynch in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhal, although not a total newcomer to Hollywood, puts in a fantastic performance as Donnie really capturing what is a difficult role. Everyone else puts in good performances, the only exception being Drew Barrymore, and although she helped produce the movie, her characterisation seems very patchy. In terms of cinematography, there are some particularly nice sequences. The music is fantastic for any fan of the 80's and resurrects some strangely timeless and apt tunes, and an original score my Michael Andrews is also extremely well done and suited to the film.

With that said, you know what's going to follow I don't hate it.  It's not my favorite movie, or the best work from any of those three great talents, but it's actually pretty good.  I love how we find out things in this movie as Sarah (Julie's character) finds them out, particularly about the real reason Michael (Paul's character and Sarah's assistant\/fiance) is in East Germany.  It has all the suspense of Hitchcock's best films and even though you're pretty sure what's going to happen at the end, just knowing that Hitchcock directed it makes you question until the end.  Could have gotten by just fine without Julie's bushy hairdo, but for a chance to gaze into Paul Newman's eyes I'll take what I must.  The chemistry between the two stars isn't like hers with Christopher Plummer or his with Joanne Woodward, but it's not a total fizzle either.  They're believably in love, and if they weren't, the movie wouldn't work since Sarah would have much less of a reason to care about what happens to Michael.

Polanski makes sure that we get our fair share of chuckles as we play along. A good example is when book detective Corso (Johnny Depp) gets his phone call in the hotel room whe he is with the girl, he immediately tells the operator that he'll take it in the lobby. Recalling that not long ago he had just got a call in the lobby which he wanted to take his room is ticklish enough to make us chuckle. Not falling off our chairs, but just a little chuckle. We get plenty of them, with the repeated calls from his client, and when he gets into the habit of losing his consciousness, as in Sleepy Hollow.Although there are traces of Gothic horror, Sherlock clues and Hitchcock suspense, The Ninth Gate is none of these. The story develops in a simple, traditional, linear progression. The mysteries get unraveled pretty quickly and continuously throughout the movie, swimming in predictability. All too famaliar are the encounters, chases, killings, as well as the seemingly omnipresent villain.What Polanski seems to be telling us is,  Be patient while we play this little game. I don't want to distract you too much with over-complicated stuff. Just wait for my final twist. This final twist, when it comes, is at best mildly satisfying, but not sufficient to carry the entire movie.Is it a good movie then? I would say yes, for a number of reasons. Debb, for example, has just the right mix of seriousness and playfulness so that we do enjoy the ride with him in this game. The cast is excellent, portraying a good variety of interesting characters. I particularly love the mischievous brothers (twins?). Both cinematography and music are appropriately positioned to attract some attention without becoming overbearing. Finally the humour, dry without going to the extent of being dark, makes the game an enjoyable experience.
