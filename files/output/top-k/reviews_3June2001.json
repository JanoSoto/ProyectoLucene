It's funny, witty, at times gross, while at other times, poignant.  And there's plenty of humor for children of all ages, while the adult humor (with which it's loaded) is for the most part implied, so parents can rest easy sitting next to their eight-or-ten-year-old sons or daughters; there's nothing in this film that's going to cause any embarrassing moments, and the only question you're likely to hear when it's over is, `Can we see it again?'\tWhen the local Monarch, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decrees that his kingdom must be rid of all fairy tale creatures, he has them rounded up and deposited across the line, as it were, into a swamp that just happens to belong to a big green Ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers).  Much to his chagrin, as he happens to value his privacy above all else, Shrek soon finds himself bedeviled by a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), as well as having his sensibilities assaulted by the hordes of fairy tale squatters who don't have a clue as to what to do next.  Quickly Shrek sees no recourse but to go to Farquaad himself and settle the matter without further ado.  And when they meet, the diminutive Farquaad strikes a bargain with Shrek; it seems that in order to become a real King, Farquaad must marry a Princess.  But his chosen one, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), is currently being held captive in the highest tower of a castle guarded by a fierce dragon who has slain all that have attempted to rescue her.  If Shrek can successfully effect her release, Farquaad promises to restore his swamp and rid Shrek of the pesky fairy tale creatures encamped there.  The fearless Shrek agrees, and with the donkey in tow, sets off on his quest.\tBesides the humor, the wide appeal of this movie is due in part to the many clever references to other movies, stories and cultural icons it incorporates so well into the story.  There's the fairy tale's themselves, of course, like `Snow White,' `Pinocchio' and `Cinderella;' and movies like `The Matrix,' as well as the cultural phenomenon of `Riverdance.'  There's a scene that fans of professional wrestling will get a hoot out of, and the scene involving Princess Fiona and Robin Hood and his dancing band of Merry Men is beyond hilarious.  There is some bathroom humor, as well, but it's fairly brief and inoffensive-- miles away from anything remotely resembling what you'd expect to find in the latest Jim Carrey movie. \tThe actors supplying the voices do a great job, especially Mike Myers who brings Shrek so vividly to life, complete with a Scottish accent.  Murphy has some great lines as the donkey and makes the most of them, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect, as is Lithgow as Lord Farquaad.  Other notable voices are supplied by Vincent Cassel (Monsieur Hood), Kathleen Freeman (The Old Woman) and Conrad Vernon (Gingerbread Man).  The use of music in this film is exceptional, also.  A number of familiar, popular songs are integrated into the story and the action to great effect throughout, and repeatedly, the filmmakers seemed to have an innate sense of knowing just the right song to plug into any particular moment or scene.  As with virtually everything else about this movie, it all came together beautifully.  In the final analysis, `Shrek' is an innovative, entertaining movie for the whole family that is guaranteed to keep you laughing and smiling for a lot longer than the 89 minutes it's on the screen.

While on vacation, a young couple, Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege), stop at a crowded rest area.  While he fills the car with gas, she goes into the store for some drinks.  And she never comes back.  And, lest the scenario seem too improbable or implausible, Sluizer proceeds to take you back through the days preceding the mysterious disappearance; and once you meet Raymond, you begin to understand what happened, and how.  And when you finally know, it's as terrifying as anything you could possibly imagine.\tOn the surface, Raymond appears to be a rather `normal' individual; he's married, with two children, and teaches science.  He and his wife, Simone (Bernadette Le Sache), have recently purchased a country home which they are gradually restoring, and spend some time there with their children whenever they can.  But hidden beneath Raymond's reserved and respected exterior is a sociopath capable of actions so heinous it defies comprehension.\tLeading up to the day of the vanishing, the film alternates between scenes of Rex and Saskia vacationing, and Raymond, as he methodically plans and calculates his cold-blooded crime.  And it's chilling, watching him prepare and fine-tune each step so matter-of-factly, as if he were staking out a new garden or planning a picnic with the family.  It's unsettling, watching Rex and Saskia going about their business, blissfully unaware of the terror that awaits them.\tWhat puts the real bite into the impact of this film is the way it's presented; this is no boogeyman-in-the-closet or `slasher' type horror film-- it goes way beyond that and takes you into a very real world of very real horror.  Early on, of course, you know that Raymond is responsible for Saskia's disappearance.  But don't have a clue as to what he's done with her or where she is-- dead or alive-- until the very end of the film.\tThe second half of the film concentrates on Hofman's obsessive quest to find out what happened to Saskia.  Three years have elapsed, and he still doesn't have a clue (and neither does the audience at this point).  Then something happens, something is revealed, and you follow along with Rex as he pursues the single clue he's been given after all this time.  And as you watch him desperately trying to uncover the truth, you begin to hope with all your heart that he does.  Because after a point it becomes excruciatingly clear that if he fails, you'll never know what happened, either.\tTer Steege lends an earthy vitality to the role of Saskia, with a performance that is entirely convincing and very real.  Bervoets does a good job as well, credibly expressing the myriad emotional levels that Rex experiences.  And Donnadieu, as Raymond, is absolutely disconcerting, exhibiting an off-handed nonchalance that evokes the image of a lion patiently stalking his prey.\tThe supporting cast includes Gwen Eckhaus (Lieneke), Tania Latarjet (Denise), Lucille Glenn (Gabrielle), David Bayle (Raymond at 16), Roger Souza (Manager) and Caroline Appere (Cashier).  A sobering film that kind of sneaks up on you, `The Vanishing' does what most horror movies never really do-- it makes your skin crawl.  The ending is rather startling in it's simplicity; it may even leave you nonplused for awhile.  But once you've had some time to think about it and assimilate what actually happened, be prepared for a sleepless night or two.  This is one that just isn't going to leave you alone.

But once you've had some time to think about it and assimilate what actually happened, be prepared for a sleepless night or two.  This is one that just isn't going to leave you alone.  I rate this one 9\/10.   \t   ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"3 June 2001","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  \tA disturbing movie that will take you into realms usually reserved for Poe and Lovecraft, `The Vanishing,' directed by George Sluizer, is a dark tale that takes you into the twisted mind of a man named Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), with implications that are truly frightening.  While on vacation, a young couple, Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege), stop at a crowded rest area.  While he fills the car with gas, she goes into the store for some drinks.  And she never comes back.  And, lest the scenario seem too improbable or implausible, Sluizer proceeds to take you back through the days preceding the mysterious disappearance; and once you meet Raymond, you begin to understand what happened, and how.  And when you finally know, it's as terrifying as anything you could possibly imagine.\tOn the surface, Raymond appears to be a rather `normal' individual; he's married, with two children, and teaches science.  He and his wife, Simone (Bernadette Le Sache), have recently purchased a country home which they are gradually restoring, and spend some time there with their children whenever they can.  But hidden beneath Raymond's reserved and respected exterior is a sociopath capable of actions so heinous it defies comprehension.\tLeading up to the day of the vanishing, the film alternates between scenes of Rex and Saskia vacationing, and Raymond, as he methodically plans and calculates his cold-blooded crime.  And it's chilling, watching him prepare and fine-tune each step so matter-of-factly, as if he were staking out a new garden or planning a picnic with the family.  It's unsettling, watching Rex and Saskia going about their business, blissfully unaware of the terror that awaits them.\tWhat puts the real bite into the impact of this film is the way it's presented; this is no boogeyman-in-the-closet or `slasher' type horror film-- it goes way beyond that and takes you into a very real world of very real horror.  Early on, of course, you know that Raymond is responsible for Saskia's disappearance.  But don't have a clue as to what he's done with her or where she is-- dead or alive-- until the very end of the film.\tThe second half of the film concentrates on Hofman's obsessive quest to find out what happened to Saskia.  Three years have elapsed, and he still doesn't have a clue (and neither does the audience at this point).  Then something happens, something is revealed, and you follow along with Rex as he pursues the single clue he's been given after all this time.  And as you watch him desperately trying to uncover the truth, you begin to hope with all your heart that he does.  Because after a point it becomes excruciatingly clear that if he fails, you'll never know what happened, either.\tTer Steege lends an earthy vitality to the role of Saskia, with a performance that is entirely convincing and very real.  Bervoets does a good job as well, credibly expressing the myriad emotional levels that Rex experiences.  And Donnadieu, as Raymond, is absolutely disconcerting, exhibiting an off-handed nonchalance that evokes the image of a lion patiently stalking his prey.\tThe supporting cast includes Gwen Eckhaus (Lieneke), Tania Latarjet (Denise), Lucille Glenn (Gabrielle), David Bayle (Raymond at 16), Roger Souza (Manager) and Caroline Appere (Cashier).  A sobering film that kind of sneaks up on you, `The Vanishing' does what most horror movies never really do-- it makes your skin crawl.  The ending is rather startling in it's simplicity; it may even leave you nonplused for awhile.

The plot of this movie (if that is what you want to call it) is not easily explained in a blurb on the back of a video cassette box or a description from a friend. To understand what the hell Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is really about, you need to see it, probably twice. I'm still exhausted from seeing it the first time.Richard Burton is history professor George, living on campus with his brash wife, Martha, played expertly by Elizabeth Taylor. (But more on her later.) The film opens with the two stumbling home from a party, late at night, only to then have guests Nick and Honey (George Segal and Sandy Dennis), a new biology professor and his wife, stop by for a visit, as invited by the couple, though George can't remember that ever happening. From there, drinks are passed around, conversations begin, and personalities come out. And secrets. And a whole long line of character twists that, in the end, destroys each character in their own little ways. That's the best I could do for explaining this plot, and it's weak, at best.Oh, what a movie this is. What a movie, carried solely by almost constant dialogue and interaction between the characters. No real action (well, in the visceral, shoot-em-up sense), but the movie is action-packed, and as many would agree, exhausting. Martha seems to love a good argument, while George is quietly passive. Martha eggs him on, pushes him further and further, dragging their seemingly innocent guests into what ends up being a night of very calculated games and trickery and lies, to the point where you don't know who's telling the truth.While the film is engaging from the start, it takes some time before you are truly sucked in, trapped in this nightmare. I'd say it takes until after the scenes at the bar until you are not just the viewer, but are in the movie, observing very closely, and held tight until the very end. To say this film is delirious is an understatement; the movie itself is insane. And it isn't until those haunting scenes once the film returns to George and Martha's house, after the trip to the bar, until you realize how insane this all really is. To say there are any stand-out scenes in the movie would be leaving out the great scene before the stand-out scene, and the one after. This whole film is one great, memorable scene after another. Mike Nichols appeared on Inside the Actors Studio, in one of those excellent interviews with James Lipton, who noted the director as being known to do memorable scenes. As far as this whole film is concerned--the scenes aren't memorable, they're haunting. Whether they're funny or scary or tense or dramatic...you'll never forget them. My favorite moments in the movie mostly involved Sandy Dennis. I was enthralled with her entire performance, and as another reviewer noted, there is more going on with her than it seems at first. Notice when she's coming downstairs, and George and Nick are talking about her. She pauses, listening, almost contemplating how she would reappear, then puts on the whole ditzy, Oh, this house is beautiful! act, making it appear as if she were as naive as first believed. I also loved her interpretive dance at the bar (I dance like the wind!) and her drunken giddiness is great. Then notice her performance closer to the end, particularly the scene between her and George outside. We know what's going on inside, and we see how George feels about it (though we don't fully understand it), but you have to pay close attention to how Honey reacts, and it's then that you really understand her character.Not to put down any of the other actors. Richard Burton is so amazing, you have to wonder why the heck he didn't win an Academy Award. He gives a brilliant performance, so brilliant it's hard to understand with only one viewing. George Segal's performance is almost entirely composed of reacting to the situation, and it's amazing. His performance should be used as a model for other actors, in playing a very straight, very average guy, thrown into absolute hysteria. While everyone else almost outshines him, he gives a performance so realistic, it's amazing. And then there's Elizabeth Taylor. What a great performance. She portrays and envokes every emotion possible. She's laugh-out-loud funny, in the way that a real person would be funny. I love when she's eating the chicken wing, asking George about the Bette Davis movie. And later, when she follows Nick as he answers the door, and starts singing and dancing towards him. It's sheer madness. But besides being funny, she's frightening, intimidating, powerful, weak, hopeless, intelligent, and perhaps one of the great characters ever portrayed in film.I think the women in this movie really carry the film. Segal and Burton are terrific, but for example, their scene together outside was sort of flat, while the eccentricities of their wives seem to always keep the film alive and exciting. I wish Honey didn't have to vomit so much, she seems to disappear at moments in the movie that need her.Overall, the movie is about four people getting wickedly drunk and going mad together, and it's insane and crazy and a lot of fun. Of course, it's so much deeper than that, and by the end of the movie, you're not only afraid to ever drink again, you're tired and shaking you head, wondering what the hell just happened. Then, it will haunt you, and over the next few days, you'll keep thinking about the movie, and you'll need to see it again, to understand the issues about George and Martha's son, as well as Nick and Honey's issues with having a child.

Satine promises her boss, Zidler (Jim Broadbent), that she'll sleep with the domineering Duke (Richard Roxburgh) in exchange for a face lift to and support for a new play at the Moulin Rouge. Mistaking him with the Duke, she falls for Christian and gets him hired as the writer of a stage extravaganza that will prove her worth as an actress. But there's a problem, (there's always a problem) Satine is dying, but like any die hard stage performer, she realizes that the show must go on.I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie. I will say this much for Bazz Luhrmann. The man is a stickler for detail. You may remember his directing style from `Romeo and Juliet'. He's a very vibrant director and very quick with the camera movements. Bazz directs movies to keep you on your feet and Moulin Rouge does just that. The movie starts out with a very lamented version of Nat King Cole's Nature Boy and before you know it, you are drop kicked in to the world of the Moulin Rouge a spicy night club with every color in the sin spectrum with movements and pictures that are very Tex Avery in style. In my opinion, Moulin Rouge is a stroke of genius because it was told as a turn of the century demented fairytale where the juvenile and ingenue didn't live happily ever after. This is a movie to both love and hate. You love it because it is very funny, it uses popular music, therefore you can relate to it, it's about the one emotion that we all can't live without, and the fact that Ewan plays his character so down to earth that you cant help but relate to him. You hate it for a few reasons. Movie musicals and stage musicals share a common hate they're not natural. You don't break into song in mid conversation to get your point across (wouldn't that be annoying) in normal conversation. Some guys will hate this film because it literally drips with love.

This could be a problem if it isn't handled right but the cast (mainly Ewan) handles it brilliantly. I will say the same thing for this movie as I said about A Knights Tale before I saw it Will the recent music work? YES IT DOES and what's cool about it is that the actors ease into the songs and if you're not paying attention, you will miss it.

Was this a love story written around popular music or popular music draped around a love story. I'll let you figure this one out.The actors make this movie work. Most of the acclaim has to go to McGregor for his excellent portrayal as the love ignorant poet in search of a muse. I loved him in Velvet Goldmine. He's just a fantastic actor and surprisingly a wonderful musical performer. I believed him every time he opened. It wasn't Christian that was in love with Satine, it was Ewan in love with Nicole. Nicole was very good in the acting department and I will even say that this has to be some of her best work. In the singing department (and being a singer myself), she might have had a stronger voice with some breath support lessons. I hated John Leguizamo...period.Luhrmann definitely puts this film in your lap and weighs you down with it. It's new, it's old, it's off the scale but registers with you, it's both beautiful and tragic, romantic and playful and a full throttle trip down a demented psychedelic love canal.

Satine promises her boss, Zidler (Jim Broadbent), that she'll sleep with the domineering Duke (Richard Roxburgh) in exchange for a face lift to and support for a new play at the Moulin Rouge. Mistaking him with the Duke, she falls for Christian and gets him hired as the writer of a stage extravaganza that will prove her worth as an actress. But there's a problem, (there's always a problem) Satine is dying, but like any die hard stage performer, she realizes that the show must go on.I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie. I will say this much for Bazz Luhrmann. The man is a stickler for detail. You may remember his directing style from `Romeo and Juliet'. He's a very vibrant director and very quick with the camera movements. Bazz directs movies to keep you on your feet and Moulin Rouge does just that. The movie starts out with a very lamented version of Nat King Cole's Nature Boy and before you know it, you are drop kicked in to the world of the Moulin Rouge a spicy night club with every color in the sin spectrum with movements and pictures that are very Tex Avery in style. In my opinion, Moulin Rouge is a stroke of genius because it was told as a turn of the century demented fairytale where the juvenile and ingenue didn't live happily ever after. This is a movie to both love and hate. You love it because it is very funny, it uses popular music, therefore you can relate to it, it's about the one emotion that we all can't live without, and the fact that Ewan plays his character so down to earth that you cant help but relate to him.

But, it seems as if coppola's version is somewhat different than it predecessor's.  What you must realize when watching this movie is that it is not about terror of vampires or the wrath of nosferatu, but simply about love, the universal subject of the world.   Though this seems clearly shown throughout the movie, it has come to my attention that most people have not recognized the tragedy for what it really is. Though it is violent and gory, it is also entrancing.  With the strange visuals throughout the movie including the weird blue and green lights that were almost groundbreaking in 1992, it seems that it enhanced the viewing of the movie and also knowing that they spent time on the horror element of the film rather than always focusing on romance.  The part of the film I didn't like was the first-person view of the beast running through the woods.  Now, I will admit in 1992, this was probably scary, but I think that Evil Dead 2 just totally ruined that scene.  Evil Dead 2 being a very funny movie, did not mean in any way to harm the viewing of this masterpiece I am sure, but the fact of the matter is, it almost seems like it was copied.  After seeing ED2, this part made the movie cheesy in a way, and I did not like that feeling.What made up for the ED2 cheesiness though, was the very solid cast and their very solid acting.  Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, and Keanu Reeves! What a cast!  Probably the best cast in a horror film ever.  Anthony Hopkins ranking way up there on my favorite actors list of all time, sord of stole the show at times, but I was glad to see not all the time, leaving more room for the other actors to show their great talent.  The cast made some of the shallow gore into a dramatic showing of epic proportions.  It was like the cast felt the script when they were acting it.  The acting will remain in memory along with some of the best acting ever (Titus, Magnolia, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Silence of the Lambs, Nsferatu, American History X etc.) Overall this movie towers over other dracula films (except for nosferatu of course) and is a must-see for any film lover of any kind, but remember to be awake and to clench your teeth.*********\/********** 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Of course, all dracula fans know the story and have heard it few too many times.

You remember the 80 teen romantic comedy genre. It was a nice idea that became an epidemic, but once and awhile there was a gem like Some Kind of Wonderful. But here is the major difference, the lack of cliche, the lack of formula, the lack of cute dialogue, and saying things without any words. Instead it is said with a look, a touch, a smile, and a tear falling down a face. It allows these talented young actors to _act_!John Cusack plays Lloyd and it is the fact that Lloyd dares to be normal that explains why the film works. Lloyd is just a regular guy who dares to just call the beautiful class brain Diane (Ione Skye) after they graduate. It is the genuine niceness and persistence of Lloyd's phone call, that is responsible for her caving and saying yes. And it goes from there. What is a friendship, a respect for each other, grows into friends with potential, and then goes even farther. Writer-director Cameron Crowe is famous for not pushing it and he perfected that style here. He doesn't try to make John and Ione look and feel hot, he lets them continue to play young adults, who would by all rights still be awkward, nervous, testing the waters of life, love, and trust.In a brilliant parallel, we learn of Diane's relationship with her father Jim (John Mahoney) which she has always been sure of, even when she needed to chose between her parents after their divorce. The subtle and detailed scenes between Diane and Jim are important to the twists in the story when Diane grows to trust someone other than her father and finds deceit with something she had faith in. Jim, is not your typical teen movie father. He's real and normal as well. His car is not backed into a house, he is not thrown into a great body of water, and he is not a typical ogre. He is allowed to be a three dimensional character, a driving force and an obstacle in the teen romance. Jim runs a nursing home and wants the best for Diane.

Start by giving Julia Roberts the lead role, that's guaranteed to lower the quality of the film by about 60%. Then you can give her an Irish accent, that'll be good for another 30%...and what you have left isn't worth the film it's printed on. Julia Roberts, who's bad enough when she speaks in her own American lilt, does the Irish accent about as well as Richard Gere in The Jackal and Brad Pitt in The Devil's Own. That is to say, she sounds about as Irish as Stephen Rea sounds Japanese. Her accent slips repeatedly (Irish voices don't 'twang') and the few moments when she *almost* sounds Irish, the other Irish accents, which are *real*, make her sound about as convincing as she acts not very. When will Hollywood learn and give Irish and Scottish and English roles to actors from their own bloody countries??? Take Bronagh Gallagher, a highly underrated actress (whose been in The Commitments and Pulp Fiction among others...) who could easily have done this role justice, but instead is thrown into the background in a bit part.And that's just the beginning. Trying to take a schlock penny-horror story, a classic in many ways but not to be mistaken with quality literature, and infuse it with intellect and soul-searching that weren't meant to be there. is ridiculous.

Mary Reilly, who barely existed in the original novel, had no bearing on the story, little bearing in Jeckyll's life. And where were Lanyon and Utterson?? Two integral parts of the story, and not even a glance? And a maid such as Reilly, especially with her background, would not be literate, nor so impertinent; suspension of disbelief only goes so far. And the romance at the end?? Give me a break!! If ever there was a story that needed to stay away from the Hollywood-ization, this is one!! That and the end of the book has the staff (Mary included) breaking down the door to discover his body...Most of all, where is the story? The good versus evil, the trials of Jeckyll's conscience and life? The whole 'story behind the story' that made it as interesting as it was, that propelled it to near-intellect? Not a hint of it. And Glenn Close's character, who for some odd reason resembled Cruella a little too closely (pardon the pun;) took up *way* too much time and space.Finally, as brilliant as John Malkovich is (and he played the two halves distinctly) wasn't too convincing as either character. Could have been the script, or the directing, or it could have been him, but Jeckyll seemed to shriveled, too anemic. And Hyde was crude and obnoxious, and vicious and strong, but he lacked two important elements the intellect (which was referred to by Poole but never actually shown very clearly), he was supposed to be a *very* intellectual man, which was part of the reason he was so horrific; and the presence he was supposed to be so eerie, as if something was wrong with him...so that even being in his presence was enough to make one frightened or uneasy, and his eyes were supposed to be piercing and contain pure evil...I'd have like to have seen a 60s era Christopher Lee in this role instead.

My favorite scenes are- When Bridget heard Mark Darcy's comments about her spinsterhood to his mother and she squeezed out that bitter smile I felt so sorry for her. This kind of prejudice against older singletons are truly hurtful.- When Bridget sang in her pajama All By Myself I nearly cried. I can't believe I can relate so much to this scene. Personally I'd rather work out to death in the gym than singing karaoke in my apartment if I were her, but I can feel her pain.- When Briget spitted to Daniel by saying I'd rather *** than *** when she decided to leave the publishing house for a new job. I had such a good laugh. It's perfect vengeance to a sleazy guy like him. And the expressions on the onlookers' face are also funny. Again only BJ will say such words but that's what makes her so unique and lovable!- When the one and only Mark Darcey said ...like you as you are. Wow!That's the sweetest line any woman wants to hear, esp. for someone like BJ, who keeps bumping into social blunders and thinks she is an idiot most of the time.- When Darcey helped her out of embarrassment at the dinner table when the smug-married couples are waiting to see her humiliated.

This is truly unexpected, and heartening.They are many more subtle scenes and good laugh triggers throughout the film. It's refreshing to see the British style of humor well meshed with the American mastery of comedy making. It's not an ordinary comedy but a WONDERFUL one. I guess I really begin to like British kind of humor now, after Notting Hill and BJD. I wonder when the sequel can be made. That one is good too.

Al Pacino is great as always, Any Given Sunday also stars former NFL greats Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor the musical scores played during the movie are great.

It is utterly ridiculous that the species managed to destroy the human race or most of it and let alone in 9 minutes. And if Terl\/Travolta graduated the top of his class it baffles me to think what the low acheivers are like.Jonnie starts off Ok and remains pretty Ok throughout 80% of the flick but the ending is where this thing really de-rails.WARNING SPOILERS PATROL BEYOND THIS POINTHow the hell could a species who had never before worn anything more than animal coverings or used a gun learn how to fly harrier jump jets, let alone in 7 days, and how did power stay, where was it coming from and how did the global leveling have no effect on the condition of the craft or the instructing machine. If the movie took two hours to get to that point how boring must the 1000+ page novel be. By the way, a previous reviewer named Star Wars EI and The Matrix as writing creditors, way too recent to be named, this movie would have taken two years to make, these books came out in the 80's but if the movie is anything to go by they are a splicing of Star Wars E4 and Planet Of The Apes, they borrowed much of the human-psychlo situation and relationship from POTA and the climax and humans fighting back is lifted straight from Star Wars.This page must currently hold a record.

You'll find a crowd rebel on every page looking to make a statement against the rest not supply truth about the flick, but it's funny I don't think I have heard the too inteligent to be appreciated line used seriously before.

I am doing a history degree and my grandparents fought for Britain and the Allies in the Second World War.  I understand that the film is being toned down for German and Japanese audiences, for the sake of me retching in the aisle, could the editors consider toning down some of the America-saves-the-day heroics and marginalisation of the European effort for our sakes?As for the likes of Braveheart and The Patriot, don't even get me started. Needless to say they were so historically inaccurate as to be slanderous.OK, toys are back in the pram, I have had my little moan.  As for the film, the special effects were awesome, but the love story was unconvincing - Kate Beckinsale just came across as a Slapper, the dialogue floated between corny and wooden, and some of the acting was distinctly average - though Voight as Roosevelt deserves special mention.If you are American, go and see it and feel proud, noble and invulnerable.
