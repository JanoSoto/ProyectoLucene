I know that the Hans Christian Anderson version didn't have a lot of substance to it either, but that story was written in a time were fairy tales were more simpler and by-the-book. This movie's main problem was that it tries to stick too close to the original fairy tale, that it comes off as boring and well, rather, predictable. Thumbelina herself, unfortunately, is not very interesting as a heroine. She's constantly getting kidnapped by shady-looking animals, and never really learning from her mistakes (except when it involves love or romance). Then we have her love interest, Cornielious, who's hardly in the movie, an obnoxious love-crazy Swallow named Jaquimoe, and a group of antagonistic animals who have only one common goal Steal Thumbelina's hand in marriage and\/or use her talents for money! I know Rock-A-Doodle and Pebble and the Penguin weren't particularly spectacular either, but at least they had some creativity put into their stories. Rock-A-Doodle even had a handful of likable characters, this movie only had one likable character (Mr. Beetle). The point is, Don Bluth was usually known for making original stories. Stories that often separate themselves from the Disney formula.

In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The fading salesman with problems character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman or Shelley Levene in Glengarry Glen Ross. I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay.De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in Cape Fear. De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the what have you done for me lately attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to help him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell.Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit.The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this.

Full Moon's first franchise was Puppet Master inspired from an earlier Empire film, Dolls, and United Artists' success with Child's Play the year prior. Directed by David Schmoeller, the first movie start off in 1939 at a hotel at Bodega Bay, CA where the puppet master himself, Andre Toulon (William Hickey) who commit suicide to escape being captured by Nazi spies for his knowledge of reanimation dead people and putting their souls into his puppets. Bodega Bay will be used for the settings for a lot of the Puppet Master movies. The actor that play Andre will most likely be remember to most people as Uncle Lewis from 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Anyways cut to 1989, where a bunch of psychics are invited by a former colleague, Neil Gallagher. (Jimmie Skaggs) who they believe has been sending them visions of the future. Only to find that Neil Gallagher shot himself and they have come upon his funeral. If they were really psychics, how on earth did they not see that Neil killed himself? They must have not been the best of their trade. The first 40 minutes dragged on without any puppets on screen. Finally all of the psychics are attacked or killed by the puppets that remain at the hotel. Only two of them will find the connection between Andre Toulon's puppets and what happen to Neil Gallagher. Without giving away too much of the mess of a plot, the film is a bit confusing and made absolutely no sense. I watch it, a number of times, and it still doesn't. It didn't explain enough in the film, to the point, I have to guess just to fill in the blanks on the plot holes. Metaphysically speaking Neil killed himself. Okay that really tells us a lot about why there's puppets running around the hotel killing people. What did the new puppet master had against his own friends and quickly turn against his puppets? How was he able to bring himself back from the dead, when he was dead? Wouldn't it make sense if his wife use the formula to bring him back? What ever happen to his wife in the end of the film? Anyways it's never answer, and the whole heavy use of psychic power was never explain in the other films. The other thing, good about the plot was that they at less, gave the victim characters a little bit depth. Plus, the puppets seem to have more free will than the film lets on and can quickly turn sides unlike other movie monsters. They can play both the villains and the heroes. The movie got a cult following so the puppets were turn the good guys in most of the subsequent films, fighting various enemies including Nazis and inter-dimensional alien puppets. One of the treats of the movies is when new puppets are introduced, although it's always kind of sketchy as to how they come into existence considering Toulon is dead in most of them. The best thing about this movie are the puppets. Each of them having an interesting way of killing people. Blade looks like a small version of the Fisherman from 1997's I Know What You Did Last Summer with a hook. Pinhead is a Conehead lookalike muscle man mixed with Addams Family Uncle Fester who punch and strangles people. Tunneler has a drill on his head, that drills into people. Last is Ms. Leech who is a Leech-puking doll is originally terrifying. Also there is Jester who pretty much just there to be there. He's pretty useless. Overall Puppet Master was enjoyable, but I never bought the struggle between man and puppets. Too much rolling around. Chucky from 1988's Child's Play was certainly the superior murder toy. The puppets themselves are magnificent though, but I just wouldn't see how people in this film can't overpower them. Their stop motion movement was always fantastic and creepy. Lending the film a unique eerie presence that couldn't be accomplished with CGI and this is coming from someone who thinks people are too hard on CGI. Would've been nice to see some elaboration on the sequels considering there are so many of them, but this was nice none the less. I was left scratching my head for about 90% of the movie and the other 10% of the time, I was freaked out by the puppets I do like the music. It fits the mood indeed. The movie is full of 1980's and 1990's stupid horror clichés. Following the age-old formula of people wandering off alone and getting killed one by one, stupid scenes of nudity, and pointless scenes that make no sense. It's watchable, but give up your hopes for a serious horror movie here. It's not that. So check it out if you want to.

In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticize it could come across as churlish or contraries, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticize - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favorite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling formlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it a poster child for Christianity. It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).

The acting\/singing of Kidman and McGregor was excellent, and the supporting roles avoided being 2D, with some I feel like I want to know more about them.

My rating rests on this film as a film. On that score, it's a long, dreary, dismal, unsuspenseful slog, in which the viewer is put through the mill as much as Brad Davis is in prison. That seems to be the point, to punish the viewer and show us how bad a prison can be. They are bad in America too. Is there some other theme to it? And it's because the film is such a slog, in which artistry is mainly to show the darkest, dankest, dirtiest, most depressing, prison possible, the role of artistry is minimal.Brad Davis does a decent enough job with a role made difficult by a below-par script that seems to make him adolescent and everyone else too, John Hurt being the exception. The script is lacking and the direction is lacking in building up side characters. In a 120 minute movie, there should have been more of that. We get some feeling for the frustrations of Brad Davis, what with his sentence extended arbitrarily and due to politics, but not that much sense of his character, other than his love for his family. The darkness of the prison is the star of the movie. It causes hopelessness. After that comes the hulking main guard who likes to beat people's feet, but he's a one-note sadist. Randy Quaid comes and goes.My main memory of this movie will be the pitch blackness or close to it of many scenes. This prison had a scarcity of inside light.If you are a fan of prison movies, you may like this. It depicts a lot of callousness of the authorities. It depicts poor tattered men penned up. There is some homosexual embracing. There are the obligatory escape scenes, but I cannot praise them for their execution, story telling and suspense. The story is mainly about hopes being dashed. Oh, yes. Don't get caught for drug offenses in countries that have stiff punishments for them.

This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as that boring decade in between. Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the counter-culture started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in Rebel prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years.Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it.There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.
