Thus in early 1998 Bruckheimer and Bay announced the planning on making the film PEARL HARBOR. The original cast included Cameron Diaz and Gene Hackman, but through time the actors became Kate Beckinsdale and Jon Voight.  But it would be expected that there would be big explosions and special effects for this film.  And this film does have big explosions and special effects. But first let's get to the plot (which some would critize that there really isn't one).  Ben Affleck plays Kentucky native Rafe McCawley (with a bad Southern accent) and Josh Hartnett is his long time best friend Danny Walker.  Rafe falls in love with volunteer nurse Evelyn Johnson (the ravishing beautiful Kate Beckinsdale), and Rafe tells Evelyn that he is going over to England to help the English fight against the Nazi's, since this is in early 1941.  Rafe's plane is hit while flying causing his plane to crash and Danny and Evelyn to think he's dead.  So to put the past behind, Evelyn falls in love with Danny, and realizes that Danny is more fun to be with.  Then Rafe comes back stateside and shocks both Danny and Evelyn, and did I forget to mention that this is in Hawaii and it's December 6th 1941?  Anyways, just when Rafe and Danny's friendship is about to come to a end, dozens of Japanesse airplanes fly into Hawaii and begin attacking Pearl Harbor, thus making it a frighting and unforgettable scenes to watch.There is good news and bad news about this film.  The good news, the attack of Pearl Harbor is frighting, spectacular, exciting, and unforgettable.  The bad news, in this 3 hour plus film, it takes 90 minutes for the film to get to the attack.  So it's another obvious factor, Bay is trying to pull the romantic factor from TITANIC to make the character's three dimensional.  But there's a difference, Leonardo DiCapprio and Kate Winslet had chemistry, Affleck, Beckinsdale and Hartnett don't.  That makes the first nintey minutes of PEARL HARBOR very very s-l-o-w and unintresting. You just want everyone to die just so it can get to the attack, since the characters are so cliche.  And the supporting characters are no better for both the men (the guy who tries to get a girl in bed, the one who stutters, the one who wonders why can't he get a girl) and the women (the flirt, the brain, the obese one, etc.)  Then the film shows scenes of airplane flying in the clouds during a sunset that looks like something from Bruckheimer's other flying film, TOP GUN (which also was another boring romance film). I was just waiting to hear Berlin's Take My Breath Away being played in the soundtrack. Then it happens.  The attack.  The Japanesse planes fly in looking like something from one of the STAR WARS films.  They fly over a valley, over a woman hanging clothes on a line, and by a baseball field where kids are playing a early morning game.  The first torpedo is dropped, as the sailors wonder was is heading towards them, and BOOM!!! All hell breaks loose.  For the next seventy minutes is very horrific scenes of sailors getting shot, blown up, or even drowned.  This is when the movie works, it's just as intense as the sinking of TITANIC and just has frighting as the attack of Normady in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film's pacing went from 10 mph to 100 mph!!!  Then, the attack is over and the film drops back to 15 mph, brining the sappy love story back into the spotlight, and making the audience groan. I did enjoy the acts of PEARL HARBOR II and III, but part I should have been cut, massively.  Bay figured that people want a three hour romantic epic, and yes we do, but we also want intresting characters!! I really didn't care much of the acting by the actors who played fictional characters (but Kate Beckinsdale was so pretty to look at that I would rather be with her and die at Pearl Harbor than to be on the sinking Titanic with Kate Wislet).  It's the actors who play the factual characters that are good Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Dorie Miller, a colored sailor who fought back at the Japanesse during the attack; Jon Voight as the respectable President Roosevelt who will not let America fall down to the Japanesse; and Alec Baldwin as the crusty and brave Col. Doolittle who led the defense attack at Tokyo because of Pearl Harbor. I did also highly enjoy the score by Academy winner Hans Zimmer.  The score to this film is more romantic and whimiscal, unlike his dramatic scores like from THE ROCK, CRIMSON TIDE, and GLADIATOR, so it was a very nice different change.  And Randall Wallace does succeed and fail with the script, he succeeds during and after the attack, he fails during the first 90 minutes. But compared to the other summer films (MUMMY RETURNS, SHREK, and KNIGHT'S TALE) PEARL HARBOR is the best summer film, so far.  I know it's not saying much since so far this is a very disappointing summer, but I did enjoy it more than the others.  It's not a classic that Touchstone Pictures is pushing it to be, and it's no TITANIC that Bruckheimer and Bay are trying to make it be.  But it is entertaining and enjoyable, and is worth watching. But Michael Bay must remember this old saying, less is better and for this film, that would have made this film better.  **** (out of five) ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2001","score":"","review":"  It's obvious that when Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heard about the record breaking gross for TITANIC, they put heads together and said, let's make our own 20th century tragic disaster film.

With this in mind I'll begin by commenting on the low points so as to end on a high. Spoilers alert The general premise of this film was pretty unoriginal and the story contained a few cliches, not to mention some moments which require a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. Some people have complained that it was ridiculous for a psychotic killer to be transported on a passenger ship, but I can accept that the mercenary Johns might have wanted to keep his trip back to Earth low-key in case a competitor tried to relieve him of his quarry, and we have to remember he was an independent mercenary and probably not possessed of infinite resources.It's a little hard to accept that the ship would crash at exactly the right time in the 22 year cycle to experience a total eclipse, and the astronomical model in the film seems to show three incredibly small stars somehow linked together, orbiting the planet. Perhaps the centre of the model wasn't actually the planet, I'd have to see the film again.The aliens seem to change drastically throughout the film, from some creepy looking starfish to swarms of bats, then from three feet tall quadrupeds to six feet tall bipeds. Also, their sensitivity to light seems to increase. Early on they all come out in the twilight as the suns pass behind the neighbouring planet's ring. Later they are warded off with bottles of faintly luminous grubs, though for some reason they have no problem running directly into torchlight.Vin Diesel is just too resilient. He has no trouble running through the pitch darkness in an alien warzone pulling 140kg of power cells behind him and even wrestles with an alien and kills it (one of the bigger ones, not the starfish\/bats).These are the only problems I can see in the film, some people have complained about the dialogue, this is something that always irritates me as I feel that it's more realistic if characters don't have an ingenious catch phrase for any eventuality. People say dumb things in real life.Overall, I though this film was very good delivering suspense, some decent action and incredible (but restrained) effects for the relatively low budget. Most of the characters were a little cliched, but they seemed fairly credible to me (face it, spaceships need pilots, equal opportunities will dictate there is a fairly good chance of them being female and most people don't like to leave others to die on alien infested hell planets). I was impressed that the Englishman lasted so long, I was tipping him for an early end, probably jumping down a dark hole after a particularly expensive Chardonnay. Apparently the characters were irritating, so I must have missed a crucial character-building moment when I went to answer the door.Apart from the points above I can't fault this film. You don't get much good scfi around these days but this is a highly respectable addition to the genre.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2001","score":"","review":"  I've been looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.

Some people have complained that it was ridiculous for a psychotic killer to be transported on a passenger ship, but I can accept that the mercenary Johns might have wanted to keep his trip back to Earth low-key in case a competitor tried to relieve him of his quarry, and we have to remember he was an independent mercenary and probably not possessed of infinite resources.It's a little hard to accept that the ship would crash at exactly the right time in the 22 year cycle to experience a total eclipse, and the astronomical model in the film seems to show three incredibly small stars somehow linked together, orbiting the planet. Perhaps the centre of the model wasn't actually the planet, I'd have to see the film again.The aliens seem to change drastically throughout the film, from some creepy looking starfish to swarms of bats, then from three feet tall quadrupeds to six feet tall bipeds. Also, their sensitivity to light seems to increase. Early on they all come out in the twilight as the suns pass behind the neighbouring planet's ring. Later they are warded off with bottles of faintly luminous grubs, though for some reason they have no problem running directly into torchlight.Vin Diesel is just too resilient. He has no trouble running through the pitch darkness in an alien warzone pulling 140kg of power cells behind him and even wrestles with an alien and kills it (one of the bigger ones, not the starfish\/bats).These are the only problems I can see in the film, some people have complained about the dialogue, this is something that always irritates me as I feel that it's more realistic if characters don't have an ingenious catch phrase for any eventuality. People say dumb things in real life.Overall, I though this film was very good delivering suspense, some decent action and incredible (but restrained) effects for the relatively low budget. Most of the characters were a little cliched, but they seemed fairly credible to me (face it, spaceships need pilots, equal opportunities will dictate there is a fairly good chance of them being female and most people don't like to leave others to die on alien infested hell planets). I was impressed that the Englishman lasted so long, I was tipping him for an early end, probably jumping down a dark hole after a particularly expensive Chardonnay. Apparently the characters were irritating, so I must have missed a crucial character-building moment when I went to answer the door.Apart from the points above I can't fault this film. You don't get much good scfi around these days but this is a highly respectable addition to the genre.8\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 May 2001","score":"","review":"  I've been looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.

Well-defined characters with unique and important roles, an excellent story line, great action scenes (as expected), and yes, a brave duty-oriented Robocop who STILL manages to regain his humanity.

Director Baz Luhrmann showed his flair for anachronism with his 1996 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, and uses it as the heart and soul of his latest film, Moulin Rouge.Satine  (Nicole Kidman) is a beautiful courtesan and star dancer of the decadent Paris nightclub. She is conned by artist Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, kneeling inside prosthetic legs to make him look shorter) into seducing a ruthless and powerful Duke, convincing him to back a musical written by a fledgling writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor). The Duke agrees, but at a price, Satine is to be his and only his. Faster than you can say Stephen Sondheim, Satine falls in love with the Christian, after being wooed by his genius poetry (actually, lyrics from songs by David Bowie, U2, Paul McCartney and Wings, among others). Luhrmann keeps the story moving at break-neck speed, switching back and forth from Busby Berkeley-styled musical numbers, romantic melodrama, and the high camp of French comedy. The effects can be emotionally distancing (as most musicals are), since there is twice as much singing as there is dialogue. But what Moulin Rouge lacks in character development, it more than makes up for with earnest performances and sumptuous visuals.  Kidman's timeless beauty and McGregor's energy bring charm to their stock characters. As visual stylist, Luhrmann has few peers (the Coen Brothers and Lars von Trier among them). His use of visual effects, camera moves and editing, steam roll through what would be static, expository moments in a film by a lesser director. The costumes, sets and elaborately choreographed and photographed dance numbers, make Moulin Rouge like nothing you're likely to see this summer, or this year. A strange hybrid of Cabaret and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where lascivious nightclub patrons sing Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit and grown men wrap themselves in makeshift veils to sing Madonna's Like A Virgin.Some of what I've said in this review may not make sense to you.

If you read many of the hostile complaints here about Center of the World, you will find that to some degree they almost all center around the sex. Some found it offensive. Others thought there wasn't enough of it. Others still didn't like the way it was presented (the digital video wasn't clear, etc.).Listen up. This movie is not about sex.It's about loneliness, isolation, the inability to connect to others. Wayne Wang is presenting the idea that modern life has made many people unable to connect to each other even in areas as intimate as sex. Everything about the movie is intended to reflect this. He didn't shoot on digital video to save money; he did it for the look, which is somewhat pixilated, distancing, with a sort of tv-like unreality.Is the movie perfect? No, in particular the ending seemed unsatisfying, as if at the very last Wang wasn't sure how to leave us with the point.But it's still pretty damned good. I could see and understand every choice that was being made on the screen. Peter Sarsgaard and Molly Walker turn in fine performances as two people who want to connect to someone else and at the same time are terrified to do so and don't really know how. In the end it feels safer to keep themselves emotionally disconnected, to keep relationships on the level of internet porn or chat rooms, or in the form of a financial transaction or lap dance.If you can't see beyond the sex in the movie, whether you're offended or titillated by it, you almost certainly won't like the film.

Shrek is one of them.  This film takes all of the fairy tails that adults grew up with, puts them into the plot, and places an unlikely hero to be protect them.  This one uses the expected, child like humor that children love and places enough, adult humor that get the parents laughing.  At first I was worried about some of that, but then I noticed my 10 year old asking what the joke meant.  The writers did an excellent job of keeping the adult humor subtle enough to where the adults would understand it but the children won't.  This one has something for everyone in the family.The animation, is without a doubt, the best I have ever seen!  The realism of some of the characters is by far, superior to any other film.  The most notable, is Cameron Diaz's character, of Princess Fiona.  It is very plain to see, the animators used her expressions and mannerisms when drawing Fiona.  There is a very real, human touch to her, something I have not seen any animated film before.  This gives the film very warm touch.  The comic relief of Eddie Murphy's character of the Donkey brings laughs for everyone.  This keeps everyone's attention.The story is based on fairy tales but altered to bring out some of the comedy and to show that you can't judge people by a first glance.  This is done well and the story as a whole is presented very well.  If you like a good story and are looking for something for the whole family, then Shrek is a must see movie for you and your family!  The only thing missing from the film is the courage and honor that should have been displayed by Mike Myers character, Shrek.  Shrek searches and finds the courage to face his own fear and self doubt, but the great challenge to make right what is wrong just does not seem to be there.  The climax just seems a bit too easy.

I'm a big Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart fan, plus I enjoy the old Cheech and Chong movies. I wasn't just delighted or pleasantly surprised by this Gen X drug comedy - I was enthralled! Half Baked is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last 10 years. The main cast is solid and very funny, but the cameos are the best part of the movie. Not many people know that Bob Saget's stand-up routine is so filthy that it would melt their children's ears off! He gets to bring some of that to the screen as a recovering drug addict.

Their Friendship and affinity are brewing on such a soul- searching trip. Having gone through all the twists and turns, they both find their renewed lives back. The simple plot has nothing to do with the eye-catching title, but Al pacino¡¯s performance really inspiring. Judging from its script, this movie might be nothing but a tedious and even repellent one, but  The two protagonists Al pacino and Chris O'Donnell amazingly elevate this low-budget and silly-plotted movie on to one of the classic Al¡¯s masterpieces. Al Pacino again brings his artistic talents into full play by playing the blind officer, who enjoys flirting with girls, tends to speak sentimentally and possesses such an ability to see through others with his sharp eyes that nothing can escape his notice. Al, in this movie, talks Charlie into joining him on the trip, then manages to keep him in company. There are many delicious moments of the movie , among which Tango is no doubt an excellent scene, in which Al shocks me with his fantastic and masterful dancing skill!!! In contrast,Chris O'Donnell gives a fine and competent performance although he by no means matches up well to Al. He is a student with full scholarship. He goes to Al in response to an advertisement for a baby sitter, but only to find Al is the one he needs to care for. At first, Al is knotty and troublesome, but as movie goes on, Al¡¯s true life and past reveals, he becomes aware of the real purpose of his trip.While experiencing ups and downs together, his curiosity about Al grows as his compassion for him develops. He prevents Al from committing a suicide which Al thinks himself is a glorious end. In a sense, he helps Al recollect faith and courage which used to be suffocated by his blindness by an accident in war. In the meantime Chris O'Donnell is caught in trouble back in his school. He is being used as a scapegoat for the trouble made by his wicked fellow classmates. In the end of the movie, he is put on a trial in school. When he is faced with a bitter choice between being expelled and retaining his seat in the prestigious school at the expense of his integrity, Al saves him by showing up and giving a inspirational speech on truth of friendship and importance of life choice. I think car-driving and suicide attempt deserve a second viewing. As a blind car driver, Al shows excitement and calmness about driving in contrast with Chris O'Donnell nervousness. Although in my opinion this suicide attempt seems a little contrived , Al still captures Lieutenant's mentality exactly. The only flaw in the movie is Chris O'Donnell, who could have delivered a much better performance if given a more intelligent script and more room to act emotionally. Finally, the speech by Al in the end is full of wisdom and inspiration. Faced with choice between betrayal and integrity, Charlie hesitates but eventually chooses integrity instead of selling friends. Al defends and protects him by defying the absurd accusations by school authority and convinces them of the truth of friendship and importance of life choice.¡°He has come to the crossroad , he made a choice and he choosed the right path, this boy¡¯s future lies in yours hands, it is a bright future, embrace it , not destroy it, believe me, one day you will be proud of it.¡± Al¡¯s voice is always so real, so convincing, and so reasonably aggressive!! I just enjoy watching and listening to him !!! the movie earns Al an Oscar award for best actor in 1992!!!

I'm a huge fan of Mike Myers' I think he's one of the funniest people around at the moment and I always enjoy his work. I've also enjoyed the other actors\/actresses previous work - Murphy, Diaz and Lithgow. I was prepared to really love this film. I'm really upset that I didn't...From the moment the opening credits blasted up, with Smash Mouths All Star screaming over the top of the animation I knew there was something wrong. The rest of the audience was in hysterics - one guy laughing distracting loud. But I just didn't think an ogre washing himself with mud was *that* funny. The rest of the humour was unfortunately the same. I don't mind the kind of humour in Shrek when used in small doses - but I need some subtle humour as well. Everything was so in your face LAUGH, LAUGH, LAUGH we *really* want you to laugh. Look, we're doing a parody of Robin Hood and now we're copying that scene from The Matrix. Well, ha-de-ha ha! Haven't we seen the effects used in The Matrix spoofed in enough films for one lifetime? Obviously not 85% of the audience laughed their heads of - I didn't.It's obvious from the other reviews that I'm not in the majority as far as opinions on this film go. I'm prepared to say chances are if you're reading this you'll enjoy the film. But I didn't and others didn't - as with all movies sometimes the *charm* is just lost on some of us. Don't let the overly positive reviews here have you entering the theatre thinking nothing can possibly go wrong. Loving this movie is not by any means a certainty - don't expect to fall in love with the movie - I did and was bitterly disappointed.Do you like humour so obvious it leaps out of the screen and slaps you in the face? I'm sure half of the cinema laughed because they felt they had to. Some of the laughter sounded really phony.So do I have anything good to say about this movie? Well, yes I do. The animation was excellent - the animators did a great job. The actors' who were cast were perfect for their roles! The storyline was good and I enjoyed following it - it just wasn't funny! I smirked at a few things but as I said I didn't laugh out loud once.4\/10 for effects and casting!
