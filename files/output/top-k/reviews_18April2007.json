This film is possibly his greatest and certainly his most memorable movie. Art-house\/foreign film lovers will be in Heaven viewing this slice of French cinema from a bygone time and from a master. For 1962, this film was ahead of its time regarding its subject matter, which is polyamorous relationships, with just the slightest hint of swinging\/wife swapping which would become common in the States in the later 60's. Jules Et Jim (Jules And Jim) is based upon the novel by Henri Pierre Roche. It's the story of a beautiful, charismatic French woman, Catherine (Jeanne Moreau) and her relationship with two men. The first is her husband Jules (Oskar Werner) whom she married as a younger girl during the onset of World War I. They have a child together and their marriage appears to be running well but in time Catherine's lust for life, exceeding Jules, leads to her falling in love in where else but Paris, the city long known for romance. Her lover Jim (Henry Serre) is initially unhappy to discover that she is married and the mother of a child. But Catherine's irresistible charms touches his heart so when she decides she wants to remain married to Jules, he respects her decision and both men agree to share her. This was very modern stuff for 1962, and despite the menage-a-trois involved, this is a romantic film. A romantic aspect of this film is the wonderful music by veteran film composer Georges Delerue, who suffuses the musical score of the film with beautiful, French melodies and orchestral jewels. The cinematography by Raoul Coutard and production design and costumes by Fred Capel are also outstanding and make this film very romantic. The historical setting - France between World War I and II- provide this film with much realism, despite its romantic leanings and dreaminess. There are beautiful vistas of the French countryside, quiet country rodes, the sea, Paris and we are treated to scenes of life in France during the World Wars and the prosperity it enjoyed afterward. This is a well-made film, and a touching one. It is a story of a woman who finds happiness with two men and the fleeting quality of that happiness. This is a movie sure to move you. It may also serve as a date movie, despite it's cultural gloss. Shot in classic black and white, with a great score, well-directed, terrific script and superb acting, this is a film that, had it been made in America, it would have garnered Oscar buzz at the time. Even though Jeanne Moreau did not enjoy the success of other French film actresses like Catherine Deneuve, she is a well-trained and convincingly real actress. She doesn't need to look drop dead gorgeous to look beautiful. Her beauty is quietly feminine. Watching her in this film, one can understand why Jules and Jim fall for her and don't have a problem sharing her. The ending is always moving and tragic. A fine film.

Is their security firewall that lame? Seriously? Who writes this crap?

Most movies work the opposite way, the more attention you pay the more flaws that make themselves apparent and the larger they seem to grow.The Conversation follows Harry Caul (Gene Hackman, in a great understated performance), the best bugger on the West Coast who secretly records otherwise private conversations for large cash rewards. He doesn't involve himself personally in the cases (as he verbally states), but his suppressed guilt is growing and he ends up personally affected in some way by the most recent conversation he has recorded. He feels something bad could be about to happen and is unsure what to do about it or how he should feel about it.One of the aspects I really loved about The Conversation was the way it was shot, in a somehow objective style giving the feel of peaking in on private lives through hidden cameras. For example, several shots are very reminiscent of security cameras in the way they pan back and forth slowly (including the final shot if I remember correctly). This style of course creates an interesting parallel with Caul's work. It brings to mind Rear Window in that it seems to become almost addictive to simply watch another person's life, though this is no doubt helped tremendously by Hackman's performance which I thought was fantastic.The score by David Shire was great and it helped to create suspense in some unexpectedly shocking scenes. I don't think many movies capture the true feeling of guilt the way The Conversation does (nor as memorably). I could go on and on about why I loved this movie, but that would arguably be a waste of time. Anyway, I can't wait to watch it again some time (as well as the commentary)!

I think that perhaps these comments reflect both the lack of an adequate attention span and a lack of a proper knowledge and perspective of the times. The Remains of the Day requires both. I found it to be an interesting movie with many facets, each of which could be used as the sole theme of a movie. It is a movie that has great acting, is beautifully filmed in and around one of England's great mansions, and tells a fascinating and complex story as well.It is true that the movie is about, in part, what many in the audience would believe is a romance that never has a chance because of Mr. Stevens' devotion to and pride in the occupation he has chosen. It is important to recognize that it is the job of his choosing, not one that has been forced upon him. It is tempting to write the job off as no more than servant of the wealthy, but it is actually the equivalent of presidency of a small company. Stevens is in charge of seeing that the large staff serving Darlington gets all of the many jobs in the household done - to perfection - every day of the week. I doubt that the White House has standards that approach those of Lord Darlington. So, each viewer can decide for himself or herself whether there could have ever been a woman in Stevens' life to whom he could give husband-like devotion.Darlington is not a Nazi sympathizer. He is a man who exhibits the ideals of 20th century Britain honor, fairness, and full devotion to what is right. He believes, most would say correctly, that the Treaty of Versailles was unduly harsh in its treatment of post-WWI Germany. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize, as many Americans do now, that unfairness in the past cannot be rectified by stupid policies in the present. So, by seeking what he considers fairness for Germany in the 1930's, when Hitler's evil and expansionist aims should have been clearly evident, he and others set the stage for a world-wide conflict that cost 60 million lives, of which the lives lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute less than one-half of one percent.One of my tests of a movie is how far into it I start looking at my watch. In this case I began looking at my watch not to see how much more I had to sit through rather, I was hoping to assure myself that there was enough movie left to provide a satisfactory ending.

The story is what gives this movie the biggest push and as well it should. It is about Elizabeth Cronin who as a child was always alone with an abusive and demanding mother, when she finds a JACK-IN-THE-BOX toy she calls upon an imaginary friend, his name is Drop Dead Fred but actually he is not just and imaginary friend, because he is helping child to child instead of being only with one. When Elizabeth Cronin loses all her money plus her husband and other stuff she returns to live with her mother, later at night she finds the JACK-THE-BOX and here he returns to help her and of course to cause more havoc hehe. The story is a softer spot with a lot of younger humor made for kids but you will laugh even when older. I am 19 years old and i laughed out, also felt a sense of gladness in the end of the movie thats why it is a softer spot.Soundtrack. The music and other in this movie is mellow and kind and made perfectly for this movie. Even at the exact times, the music is not much vocal just more melodies. And if that was not the point then the music and other would have ruined this fantasy classic Actors. The only place i have seen Rik Mayall was in bottom and i hated him in that series, so to see him play a role in this movie as Drop Dead Fred and like the way he played was incredible. All the way he plays a role suited for him and perfectly, if someone else had played it, this movie was nothing he makes up for every thing he played in this movie. Peoebe Cates is also very suited she plays the role almost as good as Rik Mayall does. The rest of the cast puts out and good performance as well especially Ron EldardSpecial Effects. This is a fantasy so it needs Special Effects and as for a movie from 1991 it is well adjusted with Special Effects and some even looks nice. But there is not much to say about them then that.Summary. All in all this movie is something you wanna see and buy and if you never seen a fantasy before this is a good start. This movie will be liked by none who likes fantasy and by them who likes them. by kids by adults. this movie is worthwhile your time as long as you understand the movie. Aslong as you understand that Drop Dead Fred is not only an imaginary friend but a child's spirit who travels from kid to kid and saves them. then you are good on your way.nothing more to say about this movie check for my other reviews around and see what more is good film.

This really helped make the movie exciting and worked very well. What also helped the movie was the exceptional acting by mostly unknowns or long-time character actors. Good Noir usually does NOT star big names and having the film anchored by Sterling Hayden (who was amazing), Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern was an excellent move. To assist them were some other exceptional actors, such as James Whitmore and Marilyn Monroe (in a small but exceptional role).However, despite the amazing acting, the biggest star of the film was the taut script. From start to finish, it sparkled and abounded with realism and an unflinching message that crime doesn't ultimately pay. The total package is one of the best Noir films ever--only exceeded by a small number of movies (such as my favorite Noir, THE KILLERS).

Made only six years ago, it came at a time when Disney's animated branch was really in a slump. Although I'm not really a Disney acolyte, they do on occasion turn out decent pictures. Atlantis was sadly one of their last really good ones before Disney's hand drawn animated division shut down production.Much more serious in tone than Disney's last outing, the delightful Emperor's New Groove, Atlantis is a film that takes a leaf from classic matinée serials and sweeping Indiana Jones adventures. A team of scholars, mercenaries and soldiers set off in a grand submarine to locate the lost city of Atlantis, and when they discover it, it all results in a clash between exploration and capitalism among the crew.Atlantis may not be quite in the classic bracket, but its definitely got much going for it. One thing I found refreshing about it is compared to most Disney films of late, there are no buffoonish comic sidekicks, no songs and no glib contemporary film references. Its all played with a considerable degree of seriousness, making it an animated feature that even adults can enjoy. I can safely say I never felt patronised by the material.One thing Atlantis has in its favour is the really wonderful cast of characters that Disney have managed to create. There may be a few too many, and it could have done with dispensing with one or two, but this is a crew that's motley in every sense of the word.Michael J Fox is likable enough as the nerdy Milo Thatch, providing a suitably exasperated voice to their dilemma. But its really the supporting characters that give Atlantis its life. James Garner is perfectly crusty as the treacherous Commander Roarke. Leonard Nimoy brings dignity to the King of Atlantis. Jacqueline Obradors is a wonderfully feisty engineer (a female engineer in a Disney film, gasp!!). And Florence Stanley is downright hilarious as the ship's dryly cynical radio operator.One thing that took me by surprise when I read the end credits was that part of the screenplay was written by Buffy creator Joss Whedon. Crafting the crew must have been his input, because there are striking similarities between Atlantis and Whedon's much underrated SF show Firefly. Two eclectic crews who swing between ambiguous extremes of profit and nobility. Look at the crew of Atlantis, and you see the crew of Firefly in an earlier form.Another great character is Princess Kida, the King's daughter. She is one of the sexiest characters to ever crop up in a Disney film. We even see her strip down to her bikini! Not only is she a great sex symbol, she's a great leader too. Its a shame she gets sidelined towards the end, although the scenes of her transformed into a being of pure light are very eerie, and recalls the style of many a Japanese anime cartoon.Some of the animation is a little bit on the blocky side and not quite up to the high standards of Disney's earlier efforts. But some of the backgrounds and underwater shots of Atlantis are exquisitely stylised and detailed. And I love the moment when Milo and Kida climb to the top of a pyramid, and the camera does a stunning 360 degree angle of the entire city of Atlantis.And as it gets to the end, we get to see some really exciting action sequences, aerial dogfights and monumental plot developments. There are times when Atlantis scales almost operatic heights. A truly thrilling climax! Its a pity Atlantis The Lost Empire went unnoticed by the public because its far too worthwhile to be cast aside. With so many great voice actors and set-pieces, its a superb animated feature, and one of Disney's lost treasures.

The film is near a 3 1\/2 hour biopic of the man named Malcom X who in 1960 opposed Martin Luther King Jr as one of the most important civil rights leader. With the controversial director Spike Lee behind the camera and Denzel Washington giving it his all on the screen, Malcolm X has stood the test of time since its release in 1992 and was a privilege to watch for me.As stated above, the film is a biopic of Malcolm X. The story starts with his early 20's. He is a junkie, a thief, and a criminal in all aspects of life. The film has many flashbacks to give us an idea of his childhood and what he has endured thus far and why he is where he is. Soon he is sent to jail where he maintains his hostility towards life and all other people. But a transformation is on its way, one that will put him into the public spotlight and become one of the most influential members of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.Now I usually don't watch many Spike Lee films. I respect his work and I have seen some of his work but I tend to not watch his films. Don't know why. Malcolm X to me is the best of his work I have seen. He tells a story, he doesn't lie to the viewers or tone anything down, he tells the story exactly how it was. This has drawn heavy criticism from the white community which views this film as a tad bit demeaning to their race and along with some racial overtones. I myself am I white male and I did not find the movie to be racist. Yes there are the use of the word n*gger and several other racist names but these are not intended to single out an audience, it is part of the story. Spike Lee is a controversial director because he does not use stereotypes. He portrays people exactly how they are\/were in life. He shows that not all white people in life are good, he shows not all black people in life are good. There is no controversy in my mind in this film.Denzel Washington is... how can I put it into words... MAGNIFICENT. His portrayal of Malcolm X is exactly how I picture the man to have been and that is human. A man who had the will to never give up and the ability to overcome any obstacle thrown at him in order to achieve his goal in life, to obtain equal rights for African Americans. Denzel shows all of this on screen through brilliant acting and character typing, something very hard to achieve.At first I found the film to be a bit choppy. One second you're in one place, the next you're some place else. Characters coming in left and right, all within the first 20 minutes. It is quite confusing in the first 20 minutes. I do realize that Malcolm X's early days were confusing and he was probably trying to obtain that with the audience in order to relate to him but I still found the start to be a little much. But after the first 20 minutes, the film is spectacular. The emotion behind Denzel's words and the support of the rest of the cast makes the acting in this some of the best I've seen. The cinematography and sets are top notch in their own respective areas. The film does go slow at a few parts near the middle and the end. It does grab your attention though when it needs you with a powerful montage of scenes to close out the film.4\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"18 April 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I had the privilege to finally have the chance to view Spike Lee's film on the controversial black Nationalist Leader Malcolm X.

She thought it was too spooky (but she covers her face with Murder, She Wrote) and just listened to the second half of the flick. I thought the movie had great potential and the power never got written into the screenplay. It's strangely ordinary and inconsequential because the emotional issues of sisterhood, bigotry (this time, against witches), and love just aren't that deeply explored.For me, it was a chance to be just entertained. And what entertainment--although Kidman is given a very secondary role, she is visually delightful. There's something very appealing to the lizard at the back of my skull with Nicole Kidman in a mini-skirt.But Practical Magic gave me a chance to rediscover Sandra Bullock, an imperfectly beautiful woman who exudes desire and decency at the same time. She's all elbows and kneecaps, with lips so pressed together that you're afraid she'll start shooting out steam from her ears and an ability to convey more than hurt and anger--disappointment and frustration are better--with her eyes.It's not prurient that I mention Bullock's breasts. Thank God she never went, as far as I can tell, for augmentation; small is just fine, thank you! When she wears a spaghetti-strapped top and no bra, she's not trying to wow you with headlights, but say that it's too damn hot to wear anything more when you're rooting around in your garden.Now, this may sound sexist piggy or psycho-pervo for me to go on about Bullock boobs, but she can get away with it. Bullock isn't a bimbo. She looks real, and that's why I've always liked her and her work.Once again, I liked Practical Magic, despite its flaws.

I felt inspired &#150; somehow I was able to relate a lot of the experience of the boy to my own when I was his age and am wondering now if other people who have seen Hearts of Atlantis would feel the same way? Take only this quote that refers to the first kiss for example It will be the kiss by which all others in your life will be judged&#133; and found wanting.Or that one Why do we always expect home to stay the same?
