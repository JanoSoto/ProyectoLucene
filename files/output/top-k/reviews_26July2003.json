Tim Burton had reached the pinnacle of direction and was just a year a way before he would reach it as a producer with Nightmare Before Christmas.  This, more than the original Batman and Edward Scissorhands cemented the director's legacy in Hollywood as the Gothic Director of Pop Culture.  Looking back this is GREAT for lovers of TIM BURTON FILMS but BAD NEWS FOR LOVERS OF THE FIRST TWO BATMANS.  You see with a combine effort many critics, so-called Batman fans who actually had not read a comic book in over 20 years, and neurotic parents joined forces to bury this film.  There were claims of it being too dark, too morbid, and too vulgar.  The last complaint really upset me because the movie's innuendos were no more potent than a 1960's James Bond film.  Because of these complaints and the fact that the sequel was not the success that the original Batman had been, even though it still made over 160 million dollars domestically, Warner Brothers decided to go in a lighter direction with the following two sequels.  Everything in this film works.  It plays up on the theme of the original Batman film, that the so called normal world can be a scary freaky place and that in it your hero is more likely going to be some ordinary guy with problems, trying to save the day for his own personal and some times disturbing reasons.  Nothing against the other super hero movies but that is what made the Batman movies cool and Tim Burton knew it. The look of this film is more a Burton and designer Bo Welch creation than a traditional comic book setting but the same can be said about Anton Furst's sets designs in the first Batman.  Once again the film makers took the spirit of the comic book worlds of roof top battles and brought into a film-noir world that worked on the big screen. Now one complaint I can sympathize with NON-BURTON critics is with the Penguin.  It seems that Burton and screenwriter Daniel Waters simply took the character's comic book name and disregarded everything else about him.  Instead of the comic book creation, we get a villain that could have come out of any horror flick.  I can understand the aggravation that some true to the bone Batman fans might have felt over the Penguin but it also forces me to ask those fans a question.  How else would you make a villain such as the Penguin, who is fat and short, an entertaining match for Batman?  The way Tim Burton approached the Penguin was the only way it could work outside of turning the villain into a mob boss and the first Batman had pretty much done the whole mob thing. As for Catwoman, if you had a problem with either Tim Burton's spin on the character or Michelle Pfeiffer's performance than you are just not a very good judge of movies.  Catwoman was definitely a strength in Batman Returns.  I would have loved if Tim Burton would have gotten to make the Catwoman movie.  It was the director who first brought it up but Warner Brothers dragged their feet and it looks highly doubtful that Burton will be involved or if even the film will ever be made.        I love Batman Returns.  It's a great Tim Burton movie.  Unfortunately it sparked an end to Burton's reign as Hollywood's golden director.  A year later the over-rated Spielberg would recapture the title and Joel Schumacher would be named the director of the third Batman.  The movies were never the same after that.  Still all is not wrong with the world.  The third Batman was decent but the fourth one was horrible, and Tim Burton would go onto make entertaining films such as Sleepy Hollow.  But still I wish movies would get back that quirky, imaginative, and sometimes dark edge that has been largely missing in movies in recent years.

I mean long duck dong's character I believe is the best part of the movie....he was the essential character that had me in stitches and there are people out there like that, that's the part of the realism in the movie. It was eighties too and a lot of teen eighties movies back then was so horrible I think their in a special vault somewhere and moved to Egypt and they buried it 10,000 feet underground.

And for the most part this movie didnt define a new generation or anything because the generation was already in progress while the camera's were rolling but I do think in a humbled opinion lol, is that if the film was made in 1979 it would've defined a generation or it might of flopped even too....who knows?

But if you watch this movie, you'd think Chicago was the setting to every episode of Scooby-Doo.Joel Schumacher, who hasn't made one good movie since D.C. Cab, serves us all up a heaping helping of crap on a platter and calls it Flatliners. He tries to hide the weak script by giving us an attractive cast (save the horrendously ugly Kevin Bacon) but we catch on early that this movie just plain sucks.  The movie begins in the Vatican, I mean Chicago, and it's about 5 medical students who are fascinated with the afterlife.  Their leader is Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts plays the damsel in distress, Kevin Bacon is the sensitive one who, of course, gets the girl in the end, William Baldwin (at least I think it was William) is the slick ladies' man, and Oliver Platt is...um, well...Oliver Platt is f***ing useless.  What's the point of this character?  If you take him out, the movie is identical; he doesn't do ONE thing!!!Early in the movie, Julia Roberts learns about the afterlife through one of her patients whom we'll call Yoda.  This old woman is afraid to die, and understandably so.  Just look at her.  Death is about 2 and a half minutes from her.  This woman is so old, it's a miracle she finished her scene. So in order to cheat death, these med students kill themselves, then zap themselves back to life after so many minutes.  It was cool the first time, but after Kiefer does it, the movie becomes so repetitive it's unbearable. Soon, the students are arguing over who goes next.  I wanna die!  No, me next!  I was yelling at the screen No, ME next!  For God sakes, somebody kill ME!!!Basically, nothing happens in this movie.  The students die and when they do, they see people they hurt in the past.  What a dumb idea.  If they would have died and had some kick ass demons chasing them once they were brought back, the movie would have been cool.  And I don't mean human demons that teach a lesson.  I mean monster demons that eat flesh.  But instead, we get the following skeletons  Kiefer teased a little boy, Bacon teased a little girl (I guess Schumacher couldn't think of 2 different situations), Baldwin video taped sex with women without them knowing, and Julia Roberts has the dumbest skeleton of all....she opened a door.  That's it, folks!  She opened a door!  So this is the worst thing Julia has ever done?  Gimme a break.Then in order to resolve these skeletons, it is implicated that they all must face their pasts and apologize.  Well, this makes sense in Kevin Bacon's case.  He finds the girl he bullied and apologizes.  But Baldwin never apologizes to any of the women he taped, and his demon fades away all on its own.  And both Julia Roberts and Kiefer's demons are dead, so how do you make amends?  Even this movie isn't sure, and it doubles back and changes its own rules that it has set up.  At the end when you see Julia hugging her dead daddy, you'll barely be able to retain the rising vomit in your throat.Is this supposed to be a thriller?  It isn't very thrilling.  After all, there isn't one drop of nudity, and the sex scene is done off camera.  Is this supposed to be horror?  Hell, the scariest thing in it is Kevin Bacon's face.

Come on folks, this is a horror movie, give me SOMETHING!What this movie needs is some kick ass demons who eat people, a graphic sex scene (if Julia's not willing to do that, maybe we could have a scene with all the guys discussing death at a strip club or something), and we also need more little boy whuppin' Kiefer Sutherland.

I was yelling at the screen No, ME next!  For God sakes, somebody kill ME!!!Basically, nothing happens in this movie.  The students die and when they do, they see people they hurt in the past.  What a dumb idea.  If they would have died and had some kick ass demons chasing them once they were brought back, the movie would have been cool.  And I don't mean human demons that teach a lesson.  I mean monster demons that eat flesh.  But instead, we get the following skeletons  Kiefer teased a little boy, Bacon teased a little girl (I guess Schumacher couldn't think of 2 different situations), Baldwin video taped sex with women without them knowing, and Julia Roberts has the dumbest skeleton of all....she opened a door.  That's it, folks!  She opened a door!  So this is the worst thing Julia has ever done?  Gimme a break.Then in order to resolve these skeletons, it is implicated that they all must face their pasts and apologize.  Well, this makes sense in Kevin Bacon's case.  He finds the girl he bullied and apologizes.  But Baldwin never apologizes to any of the women he taped, and his demon fades away all on its own.  And both Julia Roberts and Kiefer's demons are dead, so how do you make amends?  Even this movie isn't sure, and it doubles back and changes its own rules that it has set up.  At the end when you see Julia hugging her dead daddy, you'll barely be able to retain the rising vomit in your throat.Is this supposed to be a thriller?  It isn't very thrilling.  After all, there isn't one drop of nudity, and the sex scene is done off camera.  Is this supposed to be horror?  Hell, the scariest thing in it is Kevin Bacon's face.  Is this supposed to be a comedy?  Bingo!!  I laughed throughout the whole thing.  The funniest parts involve a kid about 10 years old beating the dog snot out of Kiefer Sutherland.  I think he was the kid from Stand By Me getting his revenge.  But anyway, he beats him up over and over and although these scenes are also repetitive, they are welcomed with open arms in this crap fest of a flick with hardly any action anyway.  Nobody even dies in this movie!  Come on folks, this is a horror movie, give me SOMETHING!What this movie needs is some kick ass demons who eat people, a graphic sex scene (if Julia's not willing to do that, maybe we could have a scene with all the guys discussing death at a strip club or something), and we also need more little boy whuppin' Kiefer Sutherland.  Oh yeah, and somebody getting killed violently.  Preferably Oliver Platt, but this movie is so dull, I'll take a death scene from anybody they give me.  As I've always stated, I am a reasonable man.Zero stars out of 5.

The movie is just about Ali refusing to go into the service. That made me dislike the movie. Today he is considered a hero. Why? What did he do besides become champ. Other fighters have done that, like Joe Louis. Who also by the way enlisted in the army after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He didn't refuse like Muhammad Ali and try to use the excuse that he was a Muslim Minister. Joe Louis was a hero and the greatest. This movie is just saying, I'm Muhammad Ali. You took my title from me, but I got it back. I thought this movie would be about Ali's life and career. This movie shows terrible fights too. It depicts his fights with Liston. Oh and by the way, in Ali's rematch with Liston how come there's no mention of a phantom punch? The movie shows the punch land. It doesn't show the crowd yelling fix after the fight. That really made me dislike this movie. The movie shows Ali's fights with Jerry Quarry and Ernie Terrel. Who cares about those fights. Those are such bad fights. If they wanted to show good fights why didn't they show his fights with Frazier. They only show Ali\/Frazier I. The fights that ends it all is his fight with George Foremen. It stops right there. They don't even show his whole career. They don't show his spectacular fights with Ken Norton or his loss at the hands of Leon Spinks. They don't show him regain the title when someone beats him. What is it with Will Smith? He is a terrible Ali. He looks and sounds nothing like him. He tries to sound like him, but he comes off sounding gay. This movie is not good. Muhammad Ali even hated it.
