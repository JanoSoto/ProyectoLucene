I certainly didn't like it as much as many others do, but thought it was pretty good low-budget action movie, so I intended to watch the sequels soon after seeing their predecessor. Released in 1981, Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is the first of the two sequels which the 1979 blockbuster spawned. Due to its reputation, I was expecting it to be better than the original, even if that isn't usually the case with sequels. At first, it looked like it WAS going to be better than the first installment, but for me, that unfortunately didn't last.In this future society, an energy crisis and nuclear war have made the world a bleak and dangerous place! In Australia, Max Rockatansky once worked for the Main Force Patrol in this post-apocalyptic society and had a wife and son. However, his wife and son are now dead after being run over by motorcycle gangsters, and Max no longer works for the MFP. He is now a loner, wandering through the Outback with his pet dog and doing what he can to survive. Searching for fuel, he finds an oil refinery in the desert, which is being terrorized by a gang led by a big, brawny masked man known as Lord Humungus, who are determined to get the refinery's settlers to surrender their fuel and home! Max makes a deal with this oil refinery community. He will retrieve a semi-truck which could help the people transport their fuel away from the gang, and in return they will give him fuel for himself. So, he sets out on a dangerous mission, assisted by the Gyro Captain, the man who led him to the remote refinery! This first Mad Max sequel begins with a montage, featuring a good narration by Harold Baigent. This sequence can certainly be gripping, and with this, the film is off to a good start. After this, there's lots of suspense, with another road chase and then Max's search for fuel, leading to his encounter with the Gyro Captain, and then we soon see the two of them spying on the oil refinery. There are flaws at this point in the film, but it still looks like it's going to be superior to the original. However, this ends around the time Max comes down to the refinery and is taken captive. I did not find myself entertained by Lord Humungus, played by Kjell Nilsson (he kind of seemed like a ridiculous villain to me), and the Feral Kid, played by Emil Minty, was also a character I didn't like. There's still a lot of suspense in the movie, plus some good desert scenery, but I often found myself struggling to try and stay into it. Mel Gibson still does a good job in the title role, and Bruce Spence, who plays the Gyro Captain, provides reasonable comic relief, but most of the performances aren't really that impressive, and none are excellent. I found that there was something missing from the original, and towards the end, Mad Max 2 outstays its welcome, as the action and chaos gets a little tedious.This second installment in the successful Mad Max trilogy is certainly a popular one, which was why I was expecting to like it so much, but I have to be honest. After watching it, I have to admit that I disagree with the majority. For better or worse, Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is certainly bleaker than its predecessor, and I personally thought this was a bad thing, as much as that's clearly not the case with many other viewers. I was expecting this to be at least an 8\/10 in my book, and it looked like it was going to be that around the beginning, but eventually, it was clear that I would not be able give this particular action film that rating. While this movie certainly can be intense, and from the film I learned what a certain part of the South Park episode, Proper Condom Use is a parody of, I still found a lot of this sequel to be a little too underwhelming, unlike so many other people, who have been blown away by it at some point in the past 29 years!

That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension.The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him.The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Clémént shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder.Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl.The character of Marge (Marie Laforêt) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Laforêt doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone.Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him.Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Clément is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Decaë, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and François Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie.The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Clément takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man.I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

Emmet Walsh. The film takes place in modern day Texas.The film starts off with Ray (Getz) and Abby (McDormand) driving in a car. Abby is complaining about her husband Marty (Hedaya) and how she wants to leave him. Abby and Ray then make love in a motel. What they don't know is that they are being photographed by Private Detective Visser (Walsh) for Marty. When Marty sees the photographs of the two making love after a while of consideration he tells Visser that he will pay ten thousand dollars to have his wife and her lover (who happens to be an employee at the bar he owns) killed. This thriller is the first of the Coen brother's career and shows great promise for what is yet to come.The screenplay for this film was very dark and had a touch of comedy in it. It is somewhat of a basic plot but it is done like none of the other ones like it. At some points the film does drag but it is mainly because some of the acting is poor and does not keep me interested. The suspense in this film is great, especially in the final scene. The main characters have very relatable traits but as the film goes on they lose control of themselves and just let the events happening just carry them to the next dramatic moment. A very good first feature script and as we now know the Coens stay around for a long time.The direction for this film was superbly crafted, easily the best part of the film. The first thing I think of is how I love the shot where Marty is sitting at his desk laying back and how the fan is perfectly between his elbows. I just love how that shot is framed. The Coens get some good performances some bad but it is only there first feature so you can't blame them. The suspense in the film is due to them and I am giving them credit for it and I love seeing No Country for Old Men and knowing that they mastered the art of suspense.The acting in this film is overall decent. Francis McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh give very good performances. They make me interested in their characters and make me wait to see them on the screen. But it is basically the exact opposite for Getz and Hedaya. I was entirely bored during the parts when they are on the screen and I could not wait for the scene to end. The only scene where I was not bored with them involved a lot of dirt and a shovel but that is due to the superb direction at that point.Overall I give this film a 7\/10, I would have given higher if the acting in total was good.

The tricks (the matter of separate chapters, the way all the actors talk to the camera's eye, the unbroken singing soundtrack, &#x85;) didn't serve much in my opinion. It made the movie just atmospheric, and when it comes to that soundtrack, annoying is the right word! The characters look so strange and odd. Yes, we all are like that without love. But sometimes they looked too odd as no humans, moving woodenly like puppets and talking intermittently like robots! (Owen Wilson)'s character was surely the worst. I didn't understand that guy at all. So he became great writer out of his love pain, then he became hopelessly addicted to drugs when he understood that his girl is in love with her brother ?!! (Ben Stiller) hates his father so much, so why exactly is that ? Stealing his money once? Or hitting his fingers at another? The reconciliation between them both at the end was a farce. Or how (Stiller) discovers his fears after his wife's death too late as well. Look at the way (Royal Tenenbaum) divorces his wife so simple, with not much to explain why (personally I though it's another scheme of his). And it was so lame that someone smokes for years and years and nobody, including her husband, didn't ever notice. I know (Wes Anderson) is telling us how far we became towards each others, but he just assumes too much, with great confidence, that that would work. I don't know why this movie tries to say simple things with this amount of pedantry? Like the long one-shot sequence after the car crash, it has a lot of effort to it, yet with so little drama or comedy.It is movie about not living love, or losing it, through a tale of some always absent father who tries so late to connect his true disintegrated family while discovering that the thing they all miss, and suffer because of missing it, is love. However, that tale, while being eccentrically funny at times, didn't have much soul, and seemed so dry at times. I loved some points here and there, such as the way nearly all the characters live in no real home (ship, bathroom, elevator, tent, or a house always burning); simply there is no belonging since there is no home of love, or home with love. And so, selecting the name (Tenenbaums) would be understood for sounding so close to (tinted bums). The new job of (Gene Hackman)'s character; aside from being a funny sudden transformation for him, it says metaphorically how his character tries to connect people to their rest or stability, while he himself has none. It has another merit; (Alec Baldwin) as the narrator. Unexpectedly the movie unearths the wise and heartwarming tone in his voice and uses it perfectly. (Hackman)'s performance ruled as the only human character there. The rest immersed in roles were written to look like a caricature however no real fun did generate.

","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The first segment wasn't clear enough. The case of that family as very disconnected wasn't portrayed well. I didn't feel at all the sufferance of these characters apart, and since being kids. The matter of being geniuses was lost; other than assuring the expatriation of the characters, it added nothing, being not utilized at all. Sometimes the dialog has so little to showcase. The tricks (the matter of separate chapters, the way all the actors talk to the camera's eye, the unbroken singing soundtrack, &#x85;) didn't serve much in my opinion. It made the movie just atmospheric, and when it comes to that soundtrack, annoying is the right word! The characters look so strange and odd. Yes, we all are like that without love. But sometimes they looked too odd as no humans, moving woodenly like puppets and talking intermittently like robots! (Owen Wilson)'s character was surely the worst. I didn't understand that guy at all. So he became great writer out of his love pain, then he became hopelessly addicted to drugs when he understood that his girl is in love with her brother ?!! (Ben Stiller) hates his father so much, so why exactly is that ? Stealing his money once? Or hitting his fingers at another? The reconciliation between them both at the end was a farce. Or how (Stiller) discovers his fears after his wife's death too late as well. Look at the way (Royal Tenenbaum) divorces his wife so simple, with not much to explain why (personally I though it's another scheme of his). And it was so lame that someone smokes for years and years and nobody, including her husband, didn't ever notice. I know (Wes Anderson) is telling us how far we became towards each others, but he just assumes too much, with great confidence, that that would work. I don't know why this movie tries to say simple things with this amount of pedantry? Like the long one-shot sequence after the car crash, it has a lot of effort to it, yet with so little drama or comedy.It is movie about not living love, or losing it, through a tale of some always absent father who tries so late to connect his true disintegrated family while discovering that the thing they all miss, and suffer because of missing it, is love. However, that tale, while being eccentrically funny at times, didn't have much soul, and seemed so dry at times. I loved some points here and there, such as the way nearly all the characters live in no real home (ship, bathroom, elevator, tent, or a house always burning); simply there is no belonging since there is no home of love, or home with love. And so, selecting the name (Tenenbaums) would be understood for sounding so close to (tinted bums). The new job of (Gene Hackman)'s character; aside from being a funny sudden transformation for him, it says metaphorically how his character tries to connect people to their rest or stability, while he himself has none. It has another merit; (Alec Baldwin) as the narrator. Unexpectedly the movie unearths the wise and heartwarming tone in his voice and uses it perfectly. (Hackman)'s performance ruled as the only human character there. The rest immersed in roles were written to look like a caricature however no real fun did generate. As a drama it isn't so great as well. You read that Danny Glover's looks was modeled after the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's&#x85;SO WHAT ??!! So much to the sophisticated details (the spots on the dalmatian mice, the hawk, the amputated finger, the monster-masked men paintings, the brown color for all the clothes..) either. As you see there is great attention to many picky external details, but with no such attention to the essential, more sincere to the drama, ones.After watching (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), then (The Royal Tenenbaums) for (Anderson), I began to believe that this guy loves to change the form, ornament it, showing different characters in different taste, however with no nifty outcome yet. The problem with him obviously is that he thinks that style is an enough narration, and the form can be satisfying core.After its end, I wasn't impressed or that satisfied.

He boldly designs this character for Powell ( over a bottle of Scotch, might I add ) and does so in a great way. The character is really dynamic, you get to feel the insight of Godfrey as the movie unwinds. I found it ironic that in the beginning he starts out as a bum and no one wants anything to do with him, but then in the end everyone is in love with him. The time period in which the film is shot is also very interesting. It gives a great look into the lifestyle of the rich and privileged back in the 1930's. Godfrey is the butler among a very rich, and diverse family. The family all has characters that contrast with each other. The mother strikes a cord of comedy, whilst the one sister is a spoiled brat, and the other is young and naive. The father seems to be the only level headed one in the house. The butlers and maids tip toe carefully, obeying every antic of this whacked out family, and do so in a comedic display that is thrilling to the audience. The pace is very quick, there are a lot of quick little quips thrown in here and there, and intelligent banter, which is very different from main stream Hollywood movies of today.

Some standard elements include Alpha males woo an attractive female scientist, lots of military toys go into action, authority figures eventually recognize the danger but their actions cannot solve the problem, the threat is a consequence of nuclear testing, the situation can only be properly understood and resolved by a combination of expert scientist and action hero (the alpha male).It Came From Beneath the Sea features an atomic submarine as the centerpiece military toy. However, in the movie, we are shown old WWII diesel submarine types (stock substitutions are all just part of the fun of 50s movies). There is lots of other military hardware in action - search and rescue aircraft, helicopters, flamethrowers and so on. And we get a glimpse of 50s Pax Americana, as the US just arbitrarily shuts down all north Pacific shipping, thereby halting trade on three continents, and does not disclose their reasons to any other nation. Nice! Although It Came From Beneath The Sea is a good movie, it could be better. The problem is that there is little drama or tension (aside from the opening scene in the submarine, which is excellent) until almost an hour into the picture. Finally, when the monster attacks San Francisco the pace picks up and the action gets goofy in that 50s monster movie style we all know and love. Of course the two alpha males each have to personally fight the monster one at a time! It is all good stuff and the stop motion effects of the rampaging octopus tearing apart the San Fransico waterfront makes the movie worthwhile.As in many movies there is a love triangle, but it is not well handled here. The serious scientist character of Dr. John Carter (Donald Curtis) has little dramatic impact because he does not deliver any romantic competition. If there is any conflict in the love triangle, it is a contrast between the detached intellectual (who does not get the girl) and the wolfish man of action (who does). But I felt cheated because there were no fireworks or conflict between the two men. The main alpha male, Cmdr. Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), is terrific as a tough, wolfish submarine commander (yet for some reason he also supervises the scientists and their onshore research). The love interest, Dr. Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue), is one of the ...new breed of woman that feels they are just as smart and courageous as men. Her character alternates between domineering scientist and sultry seductress, which is confusing (but fun). The problem with the love triangle is that it takes a long time to never develop. All three characters get along just fine and are good friends from start to finish.For me, a truly enjoyable 50s monster movie must have lots of head shaking, bizarre moments. What about It Came From Beneath the Sea? -The pick up scene at the lab. Talk about predatory! Pete physically backs Lesley into a corner just after they first meet, (smoking a cigarette with a 'No Smoking' sign in the background) and gets deep into her personal space. Far from being uncomfortable, Lesley responds to his predation with sultry innuendo while she suggestively caresses a test tube.-Lesley extracts information from a survivor of a ship sunk by the octopus. The survivor is afraid to talk about his experience to the doctors because he is afraid of being declared insane (typical 50s fear of non-normal). In a nearby meeting room, Lesley announces to the several men in the room that she will try to talk to the survivor. She stands up, strips off her sweater and tosses it aside, saunters out of the room, then gets alone with the survivor and seduces the man with practiced skill. Mesermerized by her come on, he tells his tale. Are all female scientists this sexy? -The beach swim scene makes no plot sense at all. Of course, the purpose of the scene was to get both Pete and Lesley in swimsuits, but there should have been better attention to eye candy. The shot was too brief and too far away. Their embrace is steamy and suggestive, however.-13 days and nights of research for two premier marine biology experts to find out that a barrel sized piece of creature they examine is from a species of giant octopus. Really? I would have guessed they could make that determination in 13 minutes. I also love how dumping a couple of goldfish in a small tank with a radiated octopus somehow proves that fish have natural Geiger counters and can therefore avoid being eaten by a radioactive creatures...Huh? The goof ball science in these movies is just a joy to watch.-I really enjoy the beach scene at the jeep where the two alpha males and Lesley discuss the new breed of woman. Right after declaring that she is a help in a crisis, the monster attacks the sheriff. She screams helplessly! But what do our alpha males do? Try to rescue the sheriff? No. They bug out at high speed to escape the beast, and in their panic they drive right through the warning gate, smashing it to pieces! Stuff like this that make these old movies so wonderful.

The kids will make you feel sad about their desperate struggle to cope up with their lives but the way the teacher connects with them leaves something to be desired&#x85;FINAL VERDICT Won't Change Your Life (3.7\/10)+ Decent acting. You might shed a tear at times.- Good concept, bad execution. Not as dark as it should be in my opinion. Too much like a soap opera episode.Also Check Dead Poets Society (1989) &#x96; Good Will Hunting (1997) - Stand And Deliver &#x96; Up The Down Staircase (1967)P.S. My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say I like\\don't like this movie but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

Then, it's a movie to make you think, and such an important one too in that area. It exposes the new ideology of the TV in the age of no nations, only corporations, that want to get money only, and so long for anything else. And it says, so extremely bold and insightful, such a testimony about the falsity of TV through the speech of we lie, and you're the truth!. I loved extra points like using the voice who speaks rightly as a merchandise, until it speaks against the higher powers. Or how these corporations themselves became the higher powers and the new god! This is rare to be seen in mainstream American movie before, and sometime after!, however it doesn't lack problems, some problems.The second part of the movie, starting from the decision of (William Holden)'s character to live with his mistress, wasn't as well and true as the first. The dialog between him and his wife, concerning his new love, transformed into farce at the end; the consciousness of the writer was too wide-awake more than enough. I think nobody ever talks this way. Speaking of which, the last dialogs between (Holden) and that very mistress (Faye Dunaway), like the speech of you're the TV!, suffered from the same problem, it's so compositional and abstract to be said by humans, even if so educated ones, and sure it served the movie's message more than its credibility's strength or contact with reality.Then, another problem with reality, well, major one this time, related with the ending; it is a complete fantasy, in which it just demolishes big part of what was before it, destroying the movie's credibility utterly, and for the same reason  a rigid consciousness beating the usual narrative for the sake of pure warning enlightenment, NOT effective drama; which's in my viewpoint the most powerful warning enlightenment ever. In that ending the god of money Arthur Jensen (played by Ned Beatty) suddenly insists on putting the true show of Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch) on air so incomprehensibly (he should have known better as a businessman, and &#x96; most pressingly &#x96; as a businessman who has been stricken badly by that show short time ago!). The main executives suddenly, and so simply, approbate killing the show's host. And then, suddenly the terrorists agree to appear on live TV to kill someone, while it's certain having an execution for them later (?!). As you see, it was all on account of shocking end, not believable one at all. Even as a wild black satire, which was nominated for the Golden Scroll as the best science fiction film in 1976 (while having no sci-fi factor at all!), it can't get away with it; since the drama couldn't put logic, any logic, to what happens, to end up anyhow as unconvincing.Still, despite being near to drowned in directness and melodrama, this is an excellent movie with unique script and sharp acting (I think it's where nobody was acting!), being one of the most significant, bitter, and &#x96; somewhat &#x96; truer movies ever made about TV, or accurately the TV's state since the 1970s, having a good, so early, rank among the list of movies that hitting the books, or just hitting, the ugliness of media in modern time. (Sidney Lumet) loves the courtroom movies, and he made a cutting one. Only part of the defense along with the final verdict both lessened the power of the cause.

It was boring, it dragged, it wasn't scary, and it had nothing noteworthy. Before you start flaming me keep in mind that I do realize that this is George Romero and the studio messed him over or whatever. I feel bad for the guy and I like his films, but at the end of the day this movie is just flat out dumb. If you've seen the cover for this movie ignore it and move along. This cover was skunk turds. It showed this evil monkey looking creepy and scary. Well guess what that monkey isn't even in the film. Instead we get a super smart helper monkey. If it sounds cool to you I can't blame you but it was a bunch of garbage.Nothing in this movie is scary. The plot is too ridiculous for the audience to relate too, thus nullifying the feeling that this could happen to you. The tension in the film really doesn't work, because even though the main guy is in a wheel chair helpless, he goes so slow and it just seems humorous rather than scary. The worst part of this movie is the pace. It drags along from one uninteresting scene to the next before somebody dies. It must have been at least one hour before there was any action, and that includes the monkey killing the bird. So really if your a horror fan and a Romero fan then you will still hate this movie. This film is more for the stay at home mom who has a soft spot for paraplegics and they want tension, drama, and a feel good ending. So please do yourself a favor and skip this garbage.
