Yes, the plot is predictable and weak, and in some cases over-familiar. Yes, the script is a bit weak in places. Yes, it is a little lacklustre, and doesn't quite capture the feel good nature of the show. But it is far from the worst movie ever. I really don't know what people were thinking when they gave this film such a low rating. Some of the worst movies I've ever seen, are Home Alone 4, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Cat in the Hat, Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Pokemon the First Movie and Batman and Robin, but this film doesn't deserve to belong to this category. On the most part, due to the enthusiastic performances of the cast, it was quite entertaining. John Goodman was born to play Fred. He looks the part, and put a lot of much-needed enthusiasm into the role. Rick Moranis is fine as Barney, very like what I imagine him. The prequel is probably better, but Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin don't quite fit the bill as Goodman and Moranis. I also liked Elizabeth Perkins and Rosie O'Donnell as Wilma and Betty. As the villains, Kyle McLachan and Halle Berry play their clichéd characters more than adequately. I do miss Elizabeth Taylor when she was pretty, but she was game as Wilma's mother, though not quite in the same league as Joan Collins in the prequel. The sets and costumes are spot on, and the design of Dino was superb. All in all, I liked this movie, it's not perfect, but it is far from the worst movie I have ever seen. 6\/10 Bethany Cox.

What would Michael Keaten and Val Kilmer and even Christian Bale say when they see that Batman has turned charming? Chris O' Donnell looked uncomfortable, and in almost every movie where he is a hero, this includes the 1993 version of the Three Musketeers, he is rather lifeless. Uma Thurman does her best, but what they gave her to work with was ridiculous, and she just failed to deliver, while Alicia Silverstone was extremely annoying. The worst case was poor Arnold Schwarznegger. He was completely miscast as Mr Freeze, completely lacking the coldness and evilness that makes the character so memorable. Schwarznegger is a talented actor, but his skills are hidden beyond recognition in this movie, he just looked so uncomfortable and totally out of character. The direction from Joel Schummacher was disappointing as well, it lacked the artistic flair and the temperament that is needed to make a great film.

In 1973\/74, an animated version appeared, which disappointed some but for my money equalled the original in terms of quality. Plans to make a sequel series entitled 'Star Trek Phase Two' were scrapped as soon as 'Star Wars' became the motion picture industry's biggest ever hit in the summer of 1977. A movie was given the green light.To direct, veteran Robert Wise - who also made 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' and 'The Andromeda Strain' - was hired. The script was by Harold Livingston, author of a number of 'Mission Impossible' episodes but who curiously had never contributed to 'Trek'. He developed an existing outline entitled 'In Thy Image' by Alan Dean Foster. The plot concerns a strange object detected heading towards Earth. It initially zaps out of existence some Klingon warships, before turning its attentions to an Earth space station. Star Fleet decrees that the newly refurbished U.S.S. Enterprise be brought out of mothballs - once more with Captain ( now Admiral ) James T.Kirk - in command. His presence tees off the ship's new Captain, Decker ( Stephen Collins ). With the original crew assembled ( along with Deltan Navigator Ilia ) the Enterprise shoots off to meet the threat head on.Released at the end of 1979 to great fanfare, 'Trek' disappointed many fans. The dreadful new costumes were the least of the film's worries. The story was simply not strong enough to support the film's two hour ( depending on which version you view ) running time. It was not particularly original, owing a debt to an episode entitled 'The Changeling' ( a robot in search of its creator ) as well as an animated story called 'One Of Our Planets Is Missing'. Wise gave the impression of being so enamoured of Douglas Trumbull and John Dykstra's S.F.X. he could not bring himself to trim any of their work. Unfortunately, it was these lengthy sequences which slowed the pace down to little more than a crawl. A good example of this is at the beginning when Scotty ( James Doohan ) gives Kirk ( William Shatner ) a tour of the new-look Enterprise. The shuttle goes slowly up the length of one side, then slowly down the other. Even Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent music could not conceal the tedium. Later on, the Enterprise enters the thick murk surrounding the entity known as 'Vger' and the movie grinds to a bum-numbing halt.

Worse, the chemistry that existed between the characters has been virtually forgotten.The script had problems too. When a bearded 'Bones' McCoy ( the splendid DeForest Kelley ) returns to the Enterprise, Kirk tells him Bones...I need you badly.. Well, you can imagine the derisive laughter that line caused in cinemas.Though it initially looked as though Leonard Nimoy would not return as 'Mr.Spock', he changed his mind. Although as Spock had just left Vulcan having undergone some sort of ritual designed to purge himself of emotions, it was difficult to tell if he was glad to be back or not.Among the new characters, Stephen Collins' 'Decker' was best, coming across like a younger 'Kirk'.

After seeing this film, I'm not what you'd call encouraged. All I knew beforehand is that it contained some minor detail on offshore drilling (something of a personal interest) and featured Emily Watson, an actress I much admire. Both turned out to be the highpoints of a film that is overlong, all pretension, and no profundity.Most audiences know there are appreciable subtleties when it comes to performances, framing by the camera, and the editing. They know some directors can deliver a cogent message from only these three devices instead of relying on insistent music cues or excessive dialogue. Most audiences prefer this method because it seems less cloying, more sophisticated. And it's a skill von Trier utilizes. There is music here but only during pointless title cards that break the narrative into segments. There may have been background music in the wedding that opens the film, but I'd have to take another look to be sure. The story's delivery, however, depends almost entirely upon Watson what she does, what she says or doesn't say, how she inflects.Her character's name is Bess, and an alert viewer is aware that this woman is seriously mentally ill. She has been oppressed all her life, by her parents and by their community, all of them beholden to the Calvinist church. She talks to God a lot, a one-sided conversation though she goes a step further than is usual in the movies, by composing His responses and projecting aloud His contralto voice. I applaud Watson for how successfully she imparts the damaged psyche of this woman. She conveys total disintegration without self-conscious expressions or gestures that would have distanced the actress from her character. Another actress may have been compelled to do that, to play against the blunt harshness of the material.But the other characters are far less developed. Their existence is kept at the rote level of the screenplay, to provide various foils for Bess's brainsickness. Okay, but to what end? First there is her husband, Jan, a roughneck who suffers his own mental damage after an accident on an oil rig leaves him paralyzed. Consequently, he implores his wife to sleep with other men and tell him about it afterward. It will aid his recovery. This request understandably mortifies her, even after she relents. Then there's the doctor and nurse (the latter is an in-law) who take care of Jan. Both of them try to talk sense into Bess, but something in their manners suggest not concern so much as the deluded ramblings of clinical hypocrites, people who are as compromised in their own way. The essential conflict in their relationship with Bess is that they just don't get her (i.e. the value of her faith). All she wants is to help her husband. She is naïve and emotionally fractured, but her intentions are inherently good.

Everything is posed. It is all in the performances, in the close-ups of Watson. What von Trier has done is to communicate a message almost exclusively through his performers and that message is reprehensible.

Famed director Stanley Kubrick called The Godfather a candidate for the best movie ever made and without a doubt, the best cast. Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.The Godfather is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, The Godfather never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.But of course, The Godfather does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in The Godfather look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.The Godfather was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until Jaws (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Vertigo (1958), and Spartacus (1960), The Godfather is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.

It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until Jaws (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Vertigo (1958), and Spartacus (1960), The Godfather is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.

Peter can't remember what happened in the accident, let alone the last 30+ years of his life, so stays and tries to work it out.

Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around.

Here in this review, I will talk about how why I love this movie so much and how I think it has influenced action films today.First off let me talk about why I love the film. When I first saw THE MATRIX I really loved it for the action. I was too young to really understand what it was really about to know how deep and complex it really is. I watched this film a billion times with my brother on video and HBO and imitated the martial art scenes and of course the famous bullet dodging scene. (May contain Mild Spoiler Plot description) As I got older, I grew to appreciate this movie for the story. I just loved the idea behind the movie. I think I just loved the idea of a alternate world that humans lived in. The idea that the world humans live in is a virtual reality world and being slaves is simply brilliant. I wrote a research paper on this about how us being enslaved by the machine world is a reference to Plato (I learned this from the documentary Burly Man Chronicles from my DVD) I also did a ton of research on the matter. There is so much philosophical references in this film. Actually, all three films have philosophical references and of course religious themes. A lot of people can see Neo as a symbol to a lot of major prophets such as, Jesus Christ and Mohammad. Basically, I love it for how my many symbols and ideas that are put behind the film (aside from the action of course that was amazing). (More possible Minor spoilers ahead) THE MATRIX has been mimicked in a lot of ways by many different action films. Especially the bullet time. Films such as THE ONE (With Jet Li), EQUILIBRIUM (with Christian Bale) and even some Super hero films used some of the Bullet time sequences and all looked similar to THE MATRIX.

It's so cool and slick you would honestly not believe it was an older film. It could easily be pulled off as something that came out last year. It has stood the test of time better than many other films ever do.The story is what makes this film great. It's outstanding it's so interesting and often sick?! and at the same time twisted. It's not a film of beauty in anyway it's ugly and twisted but that is what it does so well you can't help but fall in love with the film and the characters involved.The story is pulled off that well that i actually thought it was based on a true story until i found later it wasn't. Stupid me but it is pulled off and written so well i guess it shows.With phenomenal performances from Woody and Juliette. I don't think i've ever seen characters come to life on screen like i did in this.It's not Juliette and Woody your seeing it's Mickey and Mallory! It's a great film that i think anyone with a good taste for films will love.Also look out for great character acting from both Tommy Lee Jones & Robert Downey JR (Playing a Australian documentary interviewer).And come on 7\/10? what the hell is going on there.

I'm a huge Hitchcock fan. But this simply is not one of my favorites. Usually movies based on noir writer Cornell Woolrich's plots work very well with his unusual twists and turns and core themes of nothing being as it 'seems' until in the end we see 'the truth' behind the facade. There's a little of that here, but just a little. It's as straightforward as possible. Yes, the set for this movie is wonderful. But the 'star' turns from Stewart, Kelly, Ritter, even Burr et. al, are a bit artificial. James Stewart, I have to admit, I've never liked in Hitchcock movies like 'Rope' or 'Man Who Knew Too Much' - his aw shucks, limited acting vocabulary doesn't stretch far. Grace Kelly - I don't believe she is in love with this man for a minute. Her accent is strange throughout and distracting and she is wooden - trying so hard to look beautiful she doesn't dare let a real expression cross her face. Her saving the day from afar is the last thing I'd expect this Patrician Figure to attempt - maybe Teresa Wright or even an Anna Massey, but not Grace. Thelma does her shtick - but does it to better effect in ALL ABOUT EVE. Burr seems a bit uncomfortable in the role of the one-note hapless villain and Judith Evelyn seems lost as sea as well in her rather thankless cameo as Ms. Lonelyhearts. She does her usual hysterical turn, but not as well as she does in THE TINGLER or FEMALE ON THE BEACH. There are some boring stretches along the way and too much artifice here - notwithstanding the interesting 'claustropobic' set, done just as well in LIFEBOAT as far as I'm concerned. The actors never seemed real people but 'stars' playing themselves. As such, they didn't provide enough interest for me as characters and helped keep the movie a bit 'flat'. The so-called climactic scene of Burr confronting Stweart was a real let-down. I can name a lot of H's movies that seemed scarier and more real, and had great photography too, such as THE BIRDS, MARNIE, and the excellently acted FRENZY. Not to mention the tension, editing and groundbreaking cinematic 'vision' seen in his early black and white pictures. But this seems to be everybody's favorite and that's fine with me, there's no right or wrong opinion. This one just doesn't grab me.

While Brer Rabbit morphs into the beloved Bugs Bunny, Uncle Remus is left behind as an artifact of America's past. It is difficult to NOT see the references to slavery in this film; however, the stories are intricately coded with messages unique to the African American oral tradition. Joel Chandler Harris was inspired by slaves and based his characters on such people. Still, the stories have value. The problem is that the DIXIE the folks are singing about during the opening credits is one that is CONFEDERATE, i.e. pro-slavery. Therefore, the film is problematic because it presents an idyllic myth and fallacy about the slavery institution as benevolent and kind. The happy darkie or contented slave is one of those mythical characters. Happy darkies like Uncle Remus are the myth, not the reality of chattel slavery. Plantations were not fun places to live and work, sing with animals and play with children. Uncle Remus is akin to Bojangles; both were black male characters who were only capable of befriending white children.Hmmm... I think any film that portrays slavery in a positive light is a problem, such as Gone with the Wind. Hattie McDaniel is a SLAVE, not just a mere maid. Downplaying the historical, political and social subtext of these films only adds more controversy to an already very sensitive issue that began with Africans' arrival in the New World in the 17th century. Granted, most child viewers will not ever interpret the deeply-packed subtext; further, there are many white Americans who do not want to address or even acknowledge issues of race and slavery. You see, then, how Uncle Remus becomes such a problem for those who are sensitive to topics of race, racism and slavery.I wonder, though, if the film were entitled Song of Aushwitz, whether the Jews depicted in their ghettos and camps (sans plantations) would be as beloved. An old rabbi will tell tales of Herr Rabbit evading Herr Fox and Herr Bear (Herr = mister in German). No one would ever refute whether that portrayal was anti-Semitic or bigoted. However, when browner people are involved, somehow things are not racist, bigoted, etc. Very interesting indeed. The South never had a song to sing in the Post-Civil War era, unless they were still whistling Dixie, but then, we are back where we started.Messy. Quite messy indeed.
