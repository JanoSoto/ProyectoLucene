You know, opinions are opinions, to each his own. But at very least, I'd like to know how you people can group this movie in with teen flicks or chick flicks. Trust me, I hate sappy teen flicks pretty much with passion, and this is my favorite movie of all time. Maybe your idea of these kinds of movies is different than mine, but to me, chick\/teen flicks usually consist of things like sex, a desperation to be popular, changing oneself to fit a mold, crazy drunken parties, the skanky popular girls, the jocky football players, the nerds who'd do anything to be\/date them, oh and a little more sex if there's time. All set up with a backdrop of a cute little California high school where everyone knows their place on the social ladder and in the end, it's all about how the unpopular finally defeated the popular. You know, stuff like that. Maybe you'll laugh a little, but you end up walking away with nothing more than some funny(ish) quotes and the same old story. I have several movies in mind now that I've said all this, don't you? OK. now...moving on to AWTR. Let me just say...NOT the same old story. Whoever tells you that it is wasn't quite paying attention, either that or their mind just doesn't work with the ideas that come across in this movie. (In less nice terms, they're shallow and don't think about things much.) Read the book first, really liked it, so of course my next step was to see the movie. Since I knew the story already, I wasn't expecting (I really couldn't) the whole overused cheesy sappy teen flick thing. I'll admit then when the beginning music started up and I started seeing people getting out of their cars I was confused. Wasn't this like 1958? But it the movie version it's not, and it didn't take away from the story at all. If anything it made it more relatable, seeing modern day teenagers in situations that are honest, realistic (if you disagree, go watch Mean Girls or She's All That and compare them to this) and very moving. Very.Don't, PLEASE don't make the mistake of ignoring this movie because of Mandy Moore. Jamie Sullivan is easily my favorite movie character of all time, just because of who she is. And guess what? It never changes. Never once does she come close to even wanting to change who she is for anybody else. Instead it's pretty much the opposite. She changes them, without even trying. Even as the plain Jane she is so beautiful. This character just grabs your heart and holds on. Watching her is just incredible...I wish I could describe how amazing she makes this movie experience the way some of the reviewers on here have. Trust us- she is just amazing.Landon's transition is also amazing to watch. I mean..ahh, I can't even describe it in a way that does it justice. Just watching the people, the emotions in their eyes, the tears, the joy, being overwhelmed, everything like that...you feel it, and you believe it. You just do. It's nothing I can really describe perfectly, or make you grasp unless you watch it for yourself.Yes, there's Christianity in this movie. But whether you believe or not (and I know some nonbelievers who absolutely love this movie), the idea that it's possible for someone's entire life to change by being exposed to faith when they least expected it, can and definitely does affect anyone, as I have personally seen.As for me...you know what? Never in my life has a movie affected me like this, it just hasn't. It doesn't matter if some people don't believe me when I say it...it's made me want to change. It's that believable.

In fact, it was my mother's favorite and was the first movie that we ever rented as soon as they were available on the market in the early 80s. And there were two scenes that just HORRIFIED me and still produce a shock each time -- the part where the head pops out of the sunken boat and the part where the Skipper gets his. Since then the part where the guy's leg falls off into the ocean floor has pretty much rivaled that scene's scariness.However none of those were very realistic attacks. The most realistic one was the first one -- the girl in the bay. There's probably attacks like that in seaside resorts all over every whenever. And that is the part where you learn not to trick a shark into thinking you are a seal.However, in none of these were mentions of the very FACT that a shark CAN swim anywhere up to half-way down the Amazon and even into the New Jersey channel as long as the water remains, brackish -- that is, a hybrid of salt & fresh water. And my question is, why? It would seem logical. After all, Spielberg and Benchley would have you believe that a shark intentionally seeks out a human or even boat victim like it had a radar or something when that's the furthest thing from reality. One such race of shark is the bull-shark, though there are others, and I wouldn't doubt that the Great White would be among them. Yet, nowhere in the film did it even think of doing such things as has been found in real-life, supposedly.7 is the highest rating that I've gave a film so far, and I probably won't go much further than that because no film's perfect. However this one, for a mid-70s thriller, isn't bad. It's just a bit repetitive because it's over 30 and is on all the time. So I gave it that because it has never really worn out and still manages to have its moments at least. However, I had to knock off points because it too is capable of insulting my intelligence and has also been somewhat responsible for genocide of sharks worldwide. At least though, it did inspire others to learn more about them.An overall very powerful and unique film and book alike.

The people in the documentary are non-glamorous and pretty average. But this is a gem of human culture. I really like Mark. I'm not going to argue that he has an amazing gift. But he's persistent, optimistic, and generally a cool guy. This is one of the most 'real' movies I've ever seen. If you want to be a fly on the wall of lower-middle class American life, you ought to watch this. Also, if you were taken in by comics and horror movies of the 80's and 90's, I think you'll really enjoy Mark's spirit. Some users argue that he is talentless, but I disagree. 'Kevin' wrote a review saying that he thought if Mark had a little schooling, he would be shooting for someone right now. And I agree. Part of talent is a strong drive and consistent interest in what you're doing. And Mark has all the 'desire' lined up. You don't have to be an aspiring amateur film-maker to enjoy this. I would recommend this to anyone with a keen interest in people and a lot of common sense. It's not the kind of movie to sit down and watch with friends and family, but I think it's a good study-piece to watch a few times yourself. The cover for this movie is an accurate one. Mark and his slow-witted friend are thoroughly enjoyable people to be a part of.

'Kevin' wrote a review saying that he thought if Mark had a little schooling, he would be shooting for someone right now. And I agree.

I would recommend this to anyone with a keen interest in people and a lot of common sense. It's not the kind of movie to sit down and watch with friends and family, but I think it's a good study-piece to watch a few times yourself. The cover for this movie is an accurate one.

This is film-making at its most inept, convoluted and stodgiest. When I first saw Dune (in its original theatrical release) there were two distinct omens; upon buying your ticket you were handed a list of terms and definitions used in the movie.

The 2nd warning sign is the introduction to the film, clearly duct-taped on by desperate producers watching their profits evaporate, which shows Princess Irulan's (Virginia Madsen) floating head staring down the audience, didactically explaining still more obscure plot-points in positively boneheaded, stilted verbiage (with royal enunciation, ...and oh yes, I forgot to mention, the spice is crapped in big piles by an organism that looks like a blood clot, on the planet Jargon 7&#133;) At just the five minute mark, you have already sat through the most obtuse piece of film you ever will. Why Irulan (a fourth tier character, lost in this pile-up) is handed this ignoble task, may simply have to do with which actor was willing to come back and film additional footage for a few bucks. It's just one of thousands of questions you'll have.Moving on. The big plot point is that a privileged young man turns out to be even more privileged (with galactic implications) than he imagined; that's something you can really relate to. We all thought I was a messiah once in the third grade. As portrayed by Kyle Maclachlan, a wooden actor, Paul Atreides is unbearable, and once his true calling is revealed, he becomes even stiffer and duller. Are we supposed to like Paul because he smiles a lot?The movie is ceremonial & pompous. Characters lack an ounce of individuation, and speechify instead of relating to each other or moving the plot forward; talking in explicit meaning, as if communication and culture were only about passing parcels of information. They talk and talk and talk, and when their lips are closed they still talk via some hideous voice-overs. I'll be damned if I could tell you ten words that were important in the whole movie. Only Spawn handles language as stupidly as Dune. If you like movies to signify overt meaning literally, so that you don't have to reason things out yourself, this one's for you. Lynch (also the films author) constructs dumb illegible visuals, and forgets that a smart camera placement is worth ten pages of script. This is so non-filmic, that it's nearly impossible to believe it's a David Lynch movie. There is nothing more to say about this film except that every time it's creators make a choice it's a bad one, resulting in an utterly bewildering movie. DUNE is such a hopelessly, stupidly literal film, it easily claims a spot in my trifecta of the worst three films ever made. If you just want to see a decent escapist space opera, just rent Stargate, which is not great either, but it fails much less and has fewer pretensions than this.I really need to rent this again just for the laughs.

Watching it I'm reminded a little of a movie that came out also in 1989 or sometime around then called See No Evil, Hear No Evil with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. In it one is blind and one is deaf, and all through the picture Pryor and Wilder are never unconvincing in their parts, and even garner some big-to-small laughs. But the story is a clunker, a kind of 'gee-wiz' thriller that knocks their characters into stereotypical boxes that the actors then have to fight their way out of. The Dream Team has the main characters- a quick-fuse (Michael Keaton), an obsessive compulsive (Christopher Lloyd), a Jesus-delusional (Peter Boyle), and a common near-catatonic type (Stephen Furst)- set loose in New York City after their doctor, who's taking them out for a day out of the mental hospital to go to a Yankee game, gets knocked unconscious by a couple of cops in an alley. From there the characters are put into a kind of crux because a) they're stuck in the thin plot line of the cops being crooked and covering up a crime\/needing to bump off the doctor, and b) the patients then got to help save their van and their doctor before anything worse happens.Now this doesn't mean there aren't some spots open for some good comedic touches, and a good few of them come out of Boyle's religious-nut character (one scene I thought was great was when he steps into a black baptist type service and until a certain point doesn't seem any crazier than the rest of the attendees), plus with a great heap-load of Jack Nicholson ala Cuckoo's Nest type attitude in Keaton's performance. But then the plot comes around again, reeling them into a clockwork fixture that keeps more interesting things from happening. While it doesn't stick well to suggest this as it's a late 80s style comedy (with the typical musical score with it, if you hear it you'll know that it sounds like any other score from the Hollywood comedy of the period), I wondered what would happen if the doctor getting knocked out was more random, or even if it was more severe, then there would be chances for a different kind of story, where the four of them would have to be left to their own devices, and see what would happen. There are hints of that, actually, but it doesn't really come to pass. In fact the filmmakers even try to throw in some touching moments or stuff to sort of wrap-around that the patients (even Furst's hard-to-talk character) are getting 'better', whatever that means in the loose context of a comedy-thriller. There is one that does work, where Lloyd goes to visit his family, and it actually rings true. But another supporting character of importance to the four, played by Lorraine Bracco, is almost a foil in the scheme of the picture. The ending, too, seems like a very cheesy stretch.Yet through all of this I kept on watching it, because I liked seeing the actors filling these roles splendidly, almost in spite of the script. It's probably a lot of fun, if not necessarily a challenge, to play a crazy person, and it doesn't seem like at all like the actors (Lloyd the exception) possibly observed or were around mental patients in preparation for the roles, unlike with 'Cuckoo's Nest'. They could've had more to work with in a better screenplay or stronger comedic direction, and because of it it's only memorable for little bits and pieces. Then again, that might be expected from the guy who directed My Girl and My Girl 2, and a remake of Unfaithfully Yours.

The Dream Team has the main characters- a quick-fuse (Michael Keaton), an obsessive compulsive (Christopher Lloyd), a Jesus-delusional (Peter Boyle), and a common near-catatonic type (Stephen Furst)- set loose in New York City after their doctor, who's taking them out for a day out of the mental hospital to go to a Yankee game, gets knocked unconscious by a couple of cops in an alley. From there the characters are put into a kind of crux because a) they're stuck in the thin plot line of the cops being crooked and covering up a crime\/needing to bump off the doctor, and b) the patients then got to help save their van and their doctor before anything worse happens.Now this doesn't mean there aren't some spots open for some good comedic touches, and a good few of them come out of Boyle's religious-nut character (one scene I thought was great was when he steps into a black baptist type service and until a certain point doesn't seem any crazier than the rest of the attendees), plus with a great heap-load of Jack Nicholson ala Cuckoo's Nest type attitude in Keaton's performance. But then the plot comes around again, reeling them into a clockwork fixture that keeps more interesting things from happening. While it doesn't stick well to suggest this as it's a late 80s style comedy (with the typical musical score with it, if you hear it you'll know that it sounds like any other score from the Hollywood comedy of the period), I wondered what would happen if the doctor getting knocked out was more random, or even if it was more severe, then there would be chances for a different kind of story, where the four of them would have to be left to their own devices, and see what would happen. There are hints of that, actually, but it doesn't really come to pass. In fact the filmmakers even try to throw in some touching moments or stuff to sort of wrap-around that the patients (even Furst's hard-to-talk character) are getting 'better', whatever that means in the loose context of a comedy-thriller. There is one that does work, where Lloyd goes to visit his family, and it actually rings true. But another supporting character of importance to the four, played by Lorraine Bracco, is almost a foil in the scheme of the picture. The ending, too, seems like a very cheesy stretch.Yet through all of this I kept on watching it, because I liked seeing the actors filling these roles splendidly, almost in spite of the script. It's probably a lot of fun, if not necessarily a challenge, to play a crazy person, and it doesn't seem like at all like the actors (Lloyd the exception) possibly observed or were around mental patients in preparation for the roles, unlike with 'Cuckoo's Nest'. They could've had more to work with in a better screenplay or stronger comedic direction, and because of it it's only memorable for little bits and pieces. Then again, that might be expected from the guy who directed My Girl and My Girl 2, and a remake of Unfaithfully Yours.

It is a sweet and simple fairy tale, a colourful satire of suburban life, a quiet comedy and an emotional love story. How Tim Burton manages to combine these genres into something which feels anything but confused is beyond me. As a director he's an expert of combining stunning visuals with compelling soundtracks to create intoxicating and very entertaining movies. Still I wouldn't go so far as to call him one of the best directors ever - even if he is one of my favourites - simply because he's not the best storyteller, and his direction seems a bit confused at times.However, Edward Scissorhands is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and whether Tim Burton simply had a good day while filming, or his heart was more into it than, say, Planet of the Apes, doesn't really matter. Everything clicks wonderfully, from the intoxicating and haunting score (by Danny Elfman - who else?) to the pitch-perfect performances, to the beautiful visuals, to the simple and compelling story. It's just a wonderful movie and shouldn't be associated with the sticky, manipulative Hollywood genre called romance.As the setting of his story, Tim Burton has created a small but memorable world in which suburban banality has been taken to an entirely different level. In this world every single woman is a housewife and all of their husbands drive off to work at the exact same time each morning to bring food to the table. Burton effectively parodies the suburbs without doing a Paul Haggis - i.e. driving home his point with a sledgehammer. The bright pastel houses and absurd dress codes are really hideous and the contrast between this exaggerated suburbia and Edward's Gothic hideout is glaring. If I had to choose, I'd pick Edward's castle any day.Acting is excellent all around, Kathy Baker, Dianne Wiest and Conchata Ferrel, among others, play their prissy housewives convincingly and Alan Arkin's laid-back father figure makes for some nice comic relief. The much-praised Johnny Depp shines and is extremely entertaining, as well as likable, as Edward (no, he did *not* deserve an Oscar for playing a drunk pirate). Winona Ryder is a gorgeous leading lady, and Anthony Michael Hall makes for a genuinely nasty, if a bit dorky, bad guy. Burton's idol Vincent Price gets some of the best scenes, even if they're just flashbacks, as Edward's inventor.Edward Scissorhands will not change cinema. It's just a sweet, well paced, well directed and superbly acted fairy tale with stunningly beautiful music and visuals. It's one of few romantic movies you can safely watch without gagging or feeling intellectually insulted. Relax, bring your girl- or boyfriend along, and enjoy this wonderful masterpiece of human emotion. One of my favourites of all time. I wish every romantic comedy was as good as this one.

There's not really a Lord of the Rings element to it, being that the ring isn't going to destroy the entire world or not if it gets destroyed. In a way it's a MacGuffin (even as there is many a line exchanged about the importance of a finger, and how much Ringo might need it or not if chopped off). It could be anything, just as long as it has those quick-witted and quick-footed chaps from Liverpool on the run from the dastardly foreign royal-hunters and the scientists.To describe all of what happens in Help! would take up more than a page load, but to put it really quick some of the highlights- Beatles in the Alps, Beatles in the Bahamas, Beatles in a royal palace, and all going back to the temple! Well, those aren't really highlights, but there's lots of great nuggets of gags and jokes in there. In fact, I'd say that the first half of the film, while the boys are still wondering why the hell they're being chased all around just for the big red rock on Ringo's finger, is purely wonderful, spot-on comedy, where the irreverent goes to very long lengths, including title cards, surprising exchanges, and all in very broad strokes. No need to know what these fellows are really like, that's never a point to be made. They're too busy for that- what with getting tailed every which way, recording songs, playing songs, dancing sometimes randomly when an alarm clock goes off or getting out of places in outrageous break-out-of-window fashion, and then even getting caught in the middle of a military assault. All of it is pulled off via Richard Lesters's direction with a full understanding of how this being silly, and the Beatles going for it, allows for so many possibilities, and almost all of them are realized.The soundtrack, by the way, is definitely a favorite from the early Beatles days, with the classics of the title track, Ticket to Ride, Got to Hide Your Love Away, and Lose that Girl among others. They all fit in very well with the story too, or what's there of it.

Really, naked skiers and neon pistols that shoot lasers (or are they squirt guns shooting paint?). Gaudy and just plain ugly, the use of black light and infrared colors was bad enough in Wham! videos, but are beneath the dignity of a Bond film. 1 point.Theme song Recorded by Duran Duran during their brief moment as pop stars, the song can generously be described as nonsensical. The music itself is catchy enough, I suppose, but the lyrics about dancing into the fire has nothing to do with Binder's ice and snow motif and even less to do with the impending earthquake of the actual story. Maybe it is in reference to the coming fire engine chase. Lines like To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain \/ A chance to find a phoenix for the flame Not good, not good at all. 2 points.Bond, James Bond It is Roger Moore's swansong as Bond and he does nothing to disgrace himself. Though he does look a bit ill at ease in the love scene with Grace Jones -- but who wouldn't? And let's face it, that is obviously not Moore doing those stunts. Still, he deserves 7 points just for plugging along like a good soldier.Bond Babes For sheer contrast it is hard to beat Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones as costars. Roberts' Stacey Sutton is certainly whiny and more than a bit annoying. Yet she isn't an agent, but a civilian who gets sucked into the convoluted adventure and provides a few laughs as the comic relief. But with her squeaky clean sexiness she is certainly overshadowed by Jones' May Day, whose exotic appearance alone is a major asset\/distraction. Strangely frightening as both a love interest and a villainess, she almost blows it all with one line of dialogue (He said he loved me!). But she is undeniably unforgettable. And let's toss in an extra point for Fiona Fullerton's hot tub cameo as an easily seduced Russia agent. 9 points.Bond Villain As many creepy, wacky, weirdo, psycho nutcases as he has played, you'd think Christopher Walken would be a natural as a Bond villain. Alas, that is not the case; as Max Zorin, he seems vaguely uninterested in even being in the movie. Perhaps playing a maniacal, mass-murderer just didn't offer him much of a challenge. Rates 6 points simply because he seems to get off on firing a machine gun at innocent people.Bond Baddies With Jones doing double duty as a love interest and a femme fatale, Patrick Bauchau and Willoughby Gray hardly make an impression as Zorin's underlings. 4 points.Sinister Plot Walken's Zorin is supposedly a criminal mastermind, though his most daring crime it seems is ripping off the sinister plot from SUPERMAN THE MOVIE. Like Lex Luthor before him, Zorin hopes to set off a series of earthquakes designed to sink large portions of California, allowing him to cash in on the aftermath. Evil, undoubtedly; but far-fetched even for Bond's universe. Still, it seems to be a dependable plot. (Note to the Bond producers Get Gene Hackman to play your next evil archenemy. He knows how to do it well.) 7 points. Production values Just when you are all set to give up on the movie as being a major disappointment, they trot out a couple of Bond's all time best action sequences a fire engine chase through San Francisco and an ending with a shootout involving a blimp on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cool, and outrageously improbable. 9 points.Bonus Points The Bond people slapped around Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman in GOLDFINGER), assassinated Emma Peel (Diana Rigg in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) and now, as if to complete their vendetta against The Avengers, they knock off John Steed. Kudos to the producers for bringing on board the wonderful Patrick Macnee as Bond's latest doomed sidekick, but raspberries to them for both killing him and doing it in such a inglorious manner. Minus 5 points.Summary There is a certain irony to the title, as watching A VIEW TO A KILL isn't so much like watching a death as the end of an era. Moore bows out of the series with grace; and though he has been criticized heavily for giving the Bond films a more comical slant, it is easy to look back at his bemused approach to the character with a certain affection. At least Moore would risk showing some sort of emotion beyond grim determination, which can't be said for his successors. It is however sad that with the lackluster A VIEW TO A KILL he exits the role with more of a whimper than a bang.Bond-o-meter Rating 46 points out of 100.

I personally thought the script was very clever, it thought the twists & turns worked extremely well, I thought it was engaging, enthralling & hooked me. It's a complex film & I could easily see many viewers getting bored or frustrated with it & losing interest but I was glued to it & it really engrossed me. There are the usual moral messages as well which are presented in a strong & intelligent way, the obsession with games in our society, the way we use technology to escape our 'normal' lives, addiction, corruption & trust, hey it's all here. The character's are good, the dialogue not overly complex or full of technical jargon so most will be able to follow it easily & I also thought eXistenZ contained that one element which many films & they're makers have forgotten about, originality.

I got the feeling that everything in eXistenZ was carefully thought through & deliberate. The acting was good although I thought Jude Law was a bit flat.eXistenZ is a great film which I liked immensely, it's as simple & straight forward as that.
