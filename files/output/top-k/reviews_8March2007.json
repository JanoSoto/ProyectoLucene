Using the extremely bloody civil war in El Salvador as a back drop, this semi-biographical film (so I've heard) can be a stand in for so many brutal wars Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor, Guautemala, Chile, more....take your pick. The wars in Central and South America are particularly brutal affairs and are fairly well documented. As an American I'm quite sure Stone was outraged to see the US complicity in the spiraling murderous storms that over-took so many countries that they had vested interests in. For those of us old enough to remember, the Iran-Contra scandal (although involving sordid US affairs in Nicaragua) also spills its poison into places like El Savador. In short it is a clearly known fact (see Peter Dale Scott, read and weep) that the US helped prop up, set up and maintain the darkest, most vile police state regimes in almost every single Central American country and was totally duplicitous in the downfall of democratically elected President Allende of Chile. The CIA and US Army personnel have blood on their hands and this movie only just touches on the depth of their guilt. Sure, it was local gangsters and mobs doing the killing, setting up death squads; it was with tacit US support if only because they chose to look the other way. That then President Regan stepped up this process which only resulted in tearing the fabric out of so many countries, sending already poor countries into a living hell, makes me very wary of those who pine for or think that things were so much better under Regan's domain. Ask the poor of Central America and Regan and his cronies are held in total contempt.This movie is hard to watch in several ways. The scenes of mass killings are gut wrenching. Scenes of torture and random rape of nurses, nuns, missionaries is horrifying. The cold blooded murder of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero is crushing (see Romero, a phenomenal film with the late Raul Julia)....after Romero gives a fiercely impassioned speech to his flock, raging away at the mounting brutality...he is murdered....There is so much violence to talk about that I need to speak a bit about other matters. James Woods gives the performance of his career. He is simply outstanding. Belushi really surprised me and was an excellent foil to Wood's character. The wild and very raw camera movements and cinematography just added layers of roughness to scenes of violence and chaos. This is not a pretty film and it keeps us on edge, not allowing us to think for a moment that there are any redeeming moments. Without spoiling the end of the film, the bitterness of this films message goes right to the closing seconds without let up.Stone uses a sledge hammer to talk about journalists putting themselves in deaths door and there is ambivalence here. Wood's character is a sleaze-ball but at the end he begins a late in life process of soul rehabilitation. There are other journalists here who are junkies in the best tradition....to the super rush of fear as they photograph total chaos and murder, getting close to the ultimate bit of revelation that they too are often destroyed in the process. It is not a glamorous life but one filled with various and often conflicted personal agendas. Stone is again contemptuous of political apparatchiks and their often inept tour of duty. One comes away from watching this film thinking that Stone feels very little good about the way his country's foreign policy has been executed.

The Blaine Act ends Prohibition in the U.S. The Reichstang Fire Decree is passed in Germany.BIRTHS Kim Novak, Yoko Ono, Nina Simone.KEVIN Before 'Star Wars,' before 'Lord of the Rings,' 'King Kong' was the ultimate geek movie and the mother of all high-concept genre films. This is the movie that 'Island of Lost Souls' wished it had been. Today, films like this are made literally all the time. But in 1933, with the technology available, such entertainment was exquisitely rare, and never, EVER this good. You really have to appreciate how demented Cooper and Schoedsack must have been to even come up with this movie. The idea of seeing giant monsters and dinosaurs interacting with live-action elements was a pipe-dream back then, but the makers of this film knew it just HAD to be done. It is not that strange that the titular monster doesn't appear until halfway into the movie. Unlike the humanoid Universal monsters, you really can't just come right out with a creation like Kong; you've got to start firmly in the real world, work up to him, and build the anticipation until things explode into unrelenting excitement. Fortunately for us, the human actors do all they can to hog the screen before Kong crowds them out. Robert Armstrong is so deliciously hammy as Carl Denham, especially during those exposition scenes (Have you ever heard of&#133;Kong?). And let's not forget Bruce Cabot's lumbering chauvinist skipper Jack Driscoll. When we watched this movie with a class, Driscoll's admission to Ann, Hey, I think I love you, got the biggest laugh of the semester. I often thought, I could probably write more interesting dialogue, but&#133;why? After they've had their fun, Kong muscles his way in, and the action never stops for a second. Although Willis O'Brien's legendary stop-motion techniques give Kong his unmistakable emotional richness, Kong is still essentially a monster that needs to be put down. He rampages through the city killing and eating innocent people while destroying everything in sight. Unlike the 2006 remake, Ann doesn't sympathize with him, but is instead just like every other damsel of the day and wants to be far away from the danger (but never quite succeeds). No one in the movie feels any real sympathy for him, except for us in the audience, which is what's so brilliant about it; we are the ones who know he's not real, and we're the only ones who feel bad when he dies.DOUG 'Kong Kong' is the 82nd film on the Odyssey, and historically it is probably the most famous one thus far (Frankenstein and Dracula come close). 'King Kong' is best remembered, and deservedly so, for its title character, a new plateau of special effects in 1933. This has the most extensive special effects we've seen since The 'Thief of Baghdad.' Willis O'Brien was the brains behind making Kong move. Stop motion was still a very experimental process, and trying to animate a living creature had never been done on this level. Besides Kong, many other monstrous creatures (mostly dinosaurs) appear on film in protracted special effects sequences (some, like a carnivorous Apatosaurus, are depicted inaccurately from pending archaeological findings). Likewise, the music by Max Steiner was extremely pivotal and groundbreaking, composed and synchronized to match the action very specifically (they called it Mickey Mousing because it was only done in cartoons at that time). Up to this point, the music we've seen in the movies we've watched is either generic or nonexistent. Viewers unfamiliar with the film's significance may miss the music when they watch it here. All these fond memories and pivotal advances in technology allow the film to shine in spite of its flaws in other areas. The characters are flat, and most of the dialogue is just terrible. When Jack turns to Ann early in the movie and is like, Hey, I think I love you, my whole class erupted with laughter. It's all mostly just setup for the action and the effects. Kong ends up being the most interesting character, and he's a stop-motion puppet. When watched cold, the special effects are quite hokey and campy. When watched in context, the effects are really extraordinary, combining all manner of stop-motion, rear projection, and trick photography; the fight between Kong and the T-Rex still holds up. Even if it is seven decades dated, Kong himself is a marvelous example of special effects; you actually feel for him. Anything that can be done with CGI today is useless if it can't measure up to the emotional weight of the original Kong. The relationship between Kong and Ann is an exercise in primal animal magnetism. Scenes such as when Kong curiously peels off Ann's clothes, or drops an innocent woman out onto the street when he finds that she isn't Ann, are some delicious pre-Code delights. I can't decide if the best human performance belongs to Robert Armstrong's Carl or Fay Wray's Ann. I think Armstrong turns in the superior performance; he has a lot more dialogue, most of it expository, and he has to pretty much sell the movie to the audience. Wray has a lot of scenes with Kong, and has to do a lot of screaming (which she's very good at). On the DVD features, Peter Jackson and the rest of the gang are on hand to gush about the movie and break down nearly every special effects shot. One thing becomes clear in these featurettes before 'Star Wars' came out 44 years later, the Ultimate Geek Film was 'King Kong.' Last film 42nd Street (1933). Next film Gabriel Over the White House (1933).

And let's not forget Bruce Cabot's lumbering chauvinist skipper Jack Driscoll. When we watched this movie with a class, Driscoll's admission to Ann, Hey, I think I love you, got the biggest laugh of the semester. I often thought, I could probably write more interesting dialogue, but&#133;why? After they've had their fun, Kong muscles his way in, and the action never stops for a second. Although Willis O'Brien's legendary stop-motion techniques give Kong his unmistakable emotional richness, Kong is still essentially a monster that needs to be put down. He rampages through the city killing and eating innocent people while destroying everything in sight. Unlike the 2006 remake, Ann doesn't sympathize with him, but is instead just like every other damsel of the day and wants to be far away from the danger (but never quite succeeds). No one in the movie feels any real sympathy for him, except for us in the audience, which is what's so brilliant about it; we are the ones who know he's not real, and we're the only ones who feel bad when he dies.DOUG 'Kong Kong' is the 82nd film on the Odyssey, and historically it is probably the most famous one thus far (Frankenstein and Dracula come close). 'King Kong' is best remembered, and deservedly so, for its title character, a new plateau of special effects in 1933. This has the most extensive special effects we've seen since The 'Thief of Baghdad.' Willis O'Brien was the brains behind making Kong move. Stop motion was still a very experimental process, and trying to animate a living creature had never been done on this level. Besides Kong, many other monstrous creatures (mostly dinosaurs) appear on film in protracted special effects sequences (some, like a carnivorous Apatosaurus, are depicted inaccurately from pending archaeological findings). Likewise, the music by Max Steiner was extremely pivotal and groundbreaking, composed and synchronized to match the action very specifically (they called it Mickey Mousing because it was only done in cartoons at that time). Up to this point, the music we've seen in the movies we've watched is either generic or nonexistent. Viewers unfamiliar with the film's significance may miss the music when they watch it here. All these fond memories and pivotal advances in technology allow the film to shine in spite of its flaws in other areas. The characters are flat, and most of the dialogue is just terrible. When Jack turns to Ann early in the movie and is like, Hey, I think I love you, my whole class erupted with laughter. It's all mostly just setup for the action and the effects. Kong ends up being the most interesting character, and he's a stop-motion puppet. When watched cold, the special effects are quite hokey and campy. When watched in context, the effects are really extraordinary, combining all manner of stop-motion, rear projection, and trick photography; the fight between Kong and the T-Rex still holds up. Even if it is seven decades dated, Kong himself is a marvelous example of special effects; you actually feel for him. Anything that can be done with CGI today is useless if it can't measure up to the emotional weight of the original Kong. The relationship between Kong and Ann is an exercise in primal animal magnetism. Scenes such as when Kong curiously peels off Ann's clothes, or drops an innocent woman out onto the street when he finds that she isn't Ann, are some delicious pre-Code delights. I can't decide if the best human performance belongs to Robert Armstrong's Carl or Fay Wray's Ann. I think Armstrong turns in the superior performance; he has a lot more dialogue, most of it expository, and he has to pretty much sell the movie to the audience. Wray has a lot of scenes with Kong, and has to do a lot of screaming (which she's very good at). On the DVD features, Peter Jackson and the rest of the gang are on hand to gush about the movie and break down nearly every special effects shot.

The Blaine Act ends Prohibition in the U.S. The Reichstang Fire Decree is passed in Germany.BIRTHS Kim Novak, Yoko Ono, Nina Simone.KEVIN Before 'Star Wars,' before 'Lord of the Rings,' 'King Kong' was the ultimate geek movie and the mother of all high-concept genre films. This is the movie that 'Island of Lost Souls' wished it had been. Today, films like this are made literally all the time. But in 1933, with the technology available, such entertainment was exquisitely rare, and never, EVER this good. You really have to appreciate how demented Cooper and Schoedsack must have been to even come up with this movie. The idea of seeing giant monsters and dinosaurs interacting with live-action elements was a pipe-dream back then, but the makers of this film knew it just HAD to be done. It is not that strange that the titular monster doesn't appear until halfway into the movie. Unlike the humanoid Universal monsters, you really can't just come right out with a creation like Kong; you've got to start firmly in the real world, work up to him, and build the anticipation until things explode into unrelenting excitement. Fortunately for us, the human actors do all they can to hog the screen before Kong crowds them out. Robert Armstrong is so deliciously hammy as Carl Denham, especially during those exposition scenes (Have you ever heard of&#133;Kong?).

In theme, mood, structure, etc, it's most closely similar to Cries and Whispers, but trades the crushing misery of that film for a more melancholic autumnal sadness. Like Cries and Whispers, this is a heartrending painting of a film, utilizing reds and browns to evoke a mood of reflective sadness. It focuses more on character interrelations and human emotions then is usual for Bergman, with less symbolism and existential truths than his other, more famous works, but still rings painfully true.The structure is quite simple, a mother (Charlotte, played perfectly by Ingmar Bergman in her only Bergman role) comes to visit her daughter (Eva, played by Liv Ullman) after seven years, and they spend a few days at the house with Liv Ullman's husband and mentally handicapped sister. Most of the film takes place in the house and is almost completely dialogue driven. It seems sort of like an after-life, reflecting upon the drama of the past, which we only see through short palely coloured flashbacks, seeming distant and unchangeable. Mother and daughter slowly confront their past, at first avoiding it and stepping around conflict, but it eventually builds up to one long, cathartic scene, in which they both let fly all their hatred and resentment at each other. After that, they part and we see shots of each of them in their respective environments, finally out of the claustrophobic environment of the house. The film ends with a letter from daughter to mother, expressing a seemingly unattainable hope that they can reconcile, forget the past, and finally show affection for one another.The main subject here is the intense relationship between mother and daughter, how pain is handed back and forth between the two. Charlotte wanted love from her child, but through this want only managed to give pain and resentment. Eva, distanced from her mother, wanted only affection, but she could only watch from a distance and hand the same pain back. It's expressed best at the end of the most intense, cathartic scene in Eva's wordsA mother and a daughter. What a terrible combination of feelings and confusion and destruction. Everything is possible and done in the name of love and solicitude. The mother's injuries are to be handed down to the daughter, the mother's failures are to be paid for by the daughter, the mother's happiness is to be the daughter's unhappiness. It's as if the umbilical cord had never been cut.Part of Bergman's genius is how he can be so incredibly intimate with these characters and their problems, yet still express such universal truths.After the exhausting venting of emotions, we cut to Helena, Eva's handicapped sister and Charlotte's daughter, writhing around in bed, mirroring the inner emotional turmoil of the two main characters, and then Charlotte lays down speaks of her cold, unfeeling childhood, confirming the chain of misery that we have already seen expressed between her and her daughter. The scene fades out with Charlotte softly asking Eva for help and Helena crying out for her mother, a perfect expression of both the unbearable but unchangeable pain, and the vague hope for reconciliation.However, the film is not all pain and suffering. It ends on a ambiguous, yet slightly positive note, and throughout the film we see an expression of the hope that pain can come to be accepted and an appreciation of the melancholic beauty of life. At one point, Charlotte, talking of a past memory of her ex-lover drunkenly playing piano, says he played badly but beautifully, a perfect metaphor for Charlotte and Eva's drunken stumbling through their own emotions and troubled past, and the beauty of man's weaknesses in general. The whole film is drenched not in a mood of immanent misery, but in one of calm, reflective sorrow. The pain is all in the past and the characters attempt to deal with it. At one point Eva expresses, To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought. In man is everything, from the highest to the lowest. ...There are no limits, neither to thoughts, nor to feelings. It's anxiety that sets the limits. Here we have the summation of the film, and even Bergman's work in general. The universe is a beautiful, endlessly complex thing, but unfortunately we cannot understand it, being trapped in our human limits created by angst and anxiety. What truly makes him a genius though, is his ability to express this longing so articulately using the most intimate relations of these characters.

","genre":null},{"date":"8 March 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" It's not usually considered among Bergman's masterpieces, but Autumn Sonata is easily on par with the other four Bergman's I've had the pleasure of viewing. In theme, mood, structure, etc, it's most closely similar to Cries and Whispers, but trades the crushing misery of that film for a more melancholic autumnal sadness. Like Cries and Whispers, this is a heartrending painting of a film, utilizing reds and browns to evoke a mood of reflective sadness. It focuses more on character interrelations and human emotions then is usual for Bergman, with less symbolism and existential truths than his other, more famous works, but still rings painfully true.The structure is quite simple, a mother (Charlotte, played perfectly by Ingmar Bergman in her only Bergman role) comes to visit her daughter (Eva, played by Liv Ullman) after seven years, and they spend a few days at the house with Liv Ullman's husband and mentally handicapped sister. Most of the film takes place in the house and is almost completely dialogue driven. It seems sort of like an after-life, reflecting upon the drama of the past, which we only see through short palely coloured flashbacks, seeming distant and unchangeable. Mother and daughter slowly confront their past, at first avoiding it and stepping around conflict, but it eventually builds up to one long, cathartic scene, in which they both let fly all their hatred and resentment at each other. After that, they part and we see shots of each of them in their respective environments, finally out of the claustrophobic environment of the house. The film ends with a letter from daughter to mother, expressing a seemingly unattainable hope that they can reconcile, forget the past, and finally show affection for one another.The main subject here is the intense relationship between mother and daughter, how pain is handed back and forth between the two. Charlotte wanted love from her child, but through this want only managed to give pain and resentment. Eva, distanced from her mother, wanted only affection, but she could only watch from a distance and hand the same pain back. It's expressed best at the end of the most intense, cathartic scene in Eva's wordsA mother and a daughter. What a terrible combination of feelings and confusion and destruction. Everything is possible and done in the name of love and solicitude. The mother's injuries are to be handed down to the daughter, the mother's failures are to be paid for by the daughter, the mother's happiness is to be the daughter's unhappiness. It's as if the umbilical cord had never been cut.Part of Bergman's genius is how he can be so incredibly intimate with these characters and their problems, yet still express such universal truths.After the exhausting venting of emotions, we cut to Helena, Eva's handicapped sister and Charlotte's daughter, writhing around in bed, mirroring the inner emotional turmoil of the two main characters, and then Charlotte lays down speaks of her cold, unfeeling childhood, confirming the chain of misery that we have already seen expressed between her and her daughter. The scene fades out with Charlotte softly asking Eva for help and Helena crying out for her mother, a perfect expression of both the unbearable but unchangeable pain, and the vague hope for reconciliation.However, the film is not all pain and suffering. It ends on a ambiguous, yet slightly positive note, and throughout the film we see an expression of the hope that pain can come to be accepted and an appreciation of the melancholic beauty of life. At one point, Charlotte, talking of a past memory of her ex-lover drunkenly playing piano, says he played badly but beautifully, a perfect metaphor for Charlotte and Eva's drunken stumbling through their own emotions and troubled past, and the beauty of man's weaknesses in general. The whole film is drenched not in a mood of immanent misery, but in one of calm, reflective sorrow. The pain is all in the past and the characters attempt to deal with it. At one point Eva expresses, To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought. In man is everything, from the highest to the lowest. ...There are no limits, neither to thoughts, nor to feelings. It's anxiety that sets the limits. Here we have the summation of the film, and even Bergman's work in general. The universe is a beautiful, endlessly complex thing, but unfortunately we cannot understand it, being trapped in our human limits created by angst and anxiety. What truly makes him a genius though, is his ability to express this longing so articulately using the most intimate relations of these characters. Autumn Sonata is a heartrending testament to both the cruelty of life and the incomprehensible beauty of it, and yet another cinematic masterpiece by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.
