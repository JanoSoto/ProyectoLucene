It normally shows limbs flying everywhere or blood caked against the walls. Well, what would you say if I offered you a film that not only gave you a horror story, but also a very character driven stories. What if I were to show you a horror story that could possibly happen to you, or at least you feel that it could happen? Well, look no further, because I have found it in a little Spanish horror film called El Espinazo del diablo (also called The Devil's Backbone). There were several reasons why this film really worked, and worked well. I am going to list the top five reasons that this film worked so that you can take it back with you, and watch this film, and see what direction the horror genre is headed and how it will soon be a bigger part of cinematic culture.1) The obvious -- the Bomb. This was in nearly every shot, and provided so much for my mind. Why didn't the bomb explode? Sure, there are scientific reasons, but when researched further, you may see that it goes so far beyond that. It is the root of this film. It is the biggest symbolic reference in this film. What is the bomb you may ask? My question to you is ... WHO is the bomb? When I watched this film I really felt that the bomb symbolized Jacinto. When Jacinto arrived it was like the bomb arriving. It has the power to destroy, but has yet to. It is dormant, waiting for the appropriate time to wreak the destruction ... just like Jacinto. When he arrives he does not immediately kill, but waits for the perfect time. But, like the bomb, Jacinto has the ability to kill without remorse. It kills to fulfill its mission, which is all. Also, this bomb not only symbolizes Jacinto, but also Santi. Together an unknown force joins these two. The common bond ... the bomb. In the beginning of the film, Carlos immediately runs to the bomb because there is some attraction to it. There is no fear, just an unvarnished desire to know more about it. This is the same for when Carlos first meets Santi, fear is surrounding him, but instead he would rather learn more about Santi and help him.2) This wasn't the normal horror film plagued with beautiful scenery and screaming children, this was almost a fresh retelling of the book The Lord of the Flies. At times I had to ask myself if I wasn't watching a literal interpretation of this book in this film. There are some major differences, but some of the overall themes remain the same. Director del Toro takes a big leap with this film and succeeds where others have failed. He doesn't clutter this film with flowers or filler, he instead tells the story as it should be told, and for that I have so much respect for this film.3) The way that del Toro filmed this movie was amazing. I wasn't expecting the second half of this film when I first began it. I wasn't ready for the death of the children, or the sudden death of the adults. I sometimes get so used to Disney-fied storytelling that it almost jolts me when I am reminded that it can be dark. A story cannot always be happy, especially when you put characters out of their element. I longed to see the ghost, and del Toro wasn't afraid to show him. So many times in today's cinemas we have to wait until the very end to catch a glimpse of the evil spirit that has been causing the chaos ... not in this film. Immediately upon arrival at the school, we see (with Carlos) the spirit of Santi. It really helps build the tension much better than waiting until the very end.4) I loved the theme of revenge in this film. This goes back to my explanation of the common bond between Santi and Jacinto. While the bomb symbolically represents the both of them, characterally, they both are very similar. Both want revenge, both grew up in this school, and both are hopelessly wandering through life. I really though that it fit perfectly that these two characters were so similar, yet hated each other so much. There was a fear there that was kept hidden, but as you the viewer realized, it was always there. Only del Toro could have pulled this off.5) Finally, the actor Eduardo Noriega did an impressive job on this film. I had recently seen him in the film Abre Los Ojos (aka Open Your Eyes) playing the part that Tom Cruise would later improve, and was unimpressed, but upon seeing this film ... I have been reborn. . He has this air of malevolence about him. His intense, dark eyes are windows into a tortured soul. His voice is venomous. He even has an exceptionally evil grin. If someone were to smile at me the way Jacinto smiles, I would go pale and shrivel. At first I was very worried when I saw him on screen, but by the end of the film ... I was nothing but impressed!!!

I am not sure what director Barbet Schroeder or screenwriter Fernando Vallejo were trying to accomplish with this film, but it just didn't happen. I understand that perhaps this was a piece of Fernando Vallejo (the screenwriters) life (see connection of names of Fernando Vallejo and Fernando in the film), but it didn't make any sense. Coupled with the fact that this film was in another language, the overall themes were not brought at well at all.Let's begin with the title. La Virgen de los Sicarios or Our Lady of the Assassins. This is what initially threw me off. I was expecting perhaps a story about assassins (see the title), but that was not the case at all with this film. Alexis (the boy) does nothing more but shoot random people, then director Barbet attempts to make a very big leap with the connection that perhaps Alexis (the boy) is doing nothing more but killing the evil people in the world. He is perhaps doing the work of God himself (or herself). That is a huge assumption, since we have nothing to base this on other than the fact that he kills some random gang members and almost a waitress that did nothing wrong but give them bad service. There is a religious theme in this film, but it is so faint that I had trouble seeing it. There are moments when the two travel to the churches only to find some inhabited by prostitutes and drug addicts. Oh, can't everyone see the heavy and deep symbolism happening here?? Please, I have seen better moments watching crackers in soup.Next, there was the acting in the film, which nobody could do. I don't know if this was everyone's first film or what, but it seemed as if they were all reading their lines from cue cards and overdoing it. Perhaps it was the fact that it was in another language made the acting tough. When English is used, you can sometimes forget the actors and hear the words, this was not the case in this film. The use of Spanish only hurt the actors even more. I believed none of the characters. I couldn't get into them at all, and I blame the actors for that. Fernando (the man) and Alexis (the boy) were the worst. They were supposed to be in love, but that emotion was lost in the first little bit of this film. I never once believed that they were lovers, and that was an important part of the film!! Who wrote this film? I would like to read the three words they must have learned in Screen writing School. I would also like to attend, because it seems as if you can graduate without learning anything. The line that sticks in my mind the most is when Alexis (the boy) is shot down Fernando (the man) takes him to the hospital trying to save him, but sadly Alexis (the boy) dies. The doctor comes out and simply says, Why did you bring a corpse here? WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU TAKE IT??? Come on people.Finally, perhaps the hardest part to get over, was the fact that this film was filmed in HD Video format. It just felt like there was an amateur behind the camera instead of a respected director. It also made the film seem more like a movie instead of a story. I was continually reminded that I was watching a movie and not really at that location ... that should never happen. Overall, this was a horrible movie that only proves that critics either love the big budget films, or that little films that apparently need no talent to make at all. I can hear them now, oh, it foreign and about gay people ... we have to love this one. It is truly a sad day when a film like La Virgen de los Sicarios wins any awards.Well, I am off to shed my tears now and watch something ... anything ... that is better!!

The movie is a great adaptation of the book, most of the locations are there, the domed city, the frozen cave, old Washington, etc., and the basic story is still intact.The book was written in the middle 60's when the whole youth rebellion - don't trust anyone over 30 was going on. I believe Mr Nolan and Mr Johnson turned the age of becoming legal (21) to a death sentence for their characters (it was moved it to 30 for the movie) so you can see in the book's future, Hippies will rule the world! MGM changed the whole youth dominated world to a giant future city complex. OK the carousel sequence didn't make sense but it was a lot more visually exciting than how people terminate themselves in the book (they report to suicide shops). It's like a lot of books, it's tough to transfer to the big screen but in my opinion, they did a pretty good job with this one. I saw it when I was 12 and was completely mesmerized by the concept, now that I'm older (and way past what would be Lastday) I still consider it one of my favorites. So if you liked the movie, check out the books! (There are 3) Also if anyone casting the rumored remake reads this, I vote for Leonardo DiCaprio to play Logan.And by the way, stop complaining about the effects! Yes I know you can do better effects with a Power Book and a copy of Final Cut but this was made in the 70s! Give em a break for crying out loud. - Thanks for reading my post.

It's a rather unique film experience because of that no-holds-barred challenge - it challenges you to figure out what's coming next, in a direct way not many other films attempt. It's a thinking person's film; whether it's actually intelligent or not probably depends on the individual, but I'd like to think it's pretty smart. Also pretty smart is the character played by Michael Douglas - business smarts, that is. Douglas was near the end of a roll playing businessmen, began in Wall Street(87). He becomes involved with an odd company, CRS, introduced to him by his younger brother (Sean Penn in a small role). What begins as amusing distraction for his orderly world soon turns sinister.The film points out that people, especially smarter people whom you'd think don't need amusement, all need some kind of distraction. Isn't that what we're all doing essentially during our lifetimes - finding different means of distraction before the inevitable end? And aren't those distractions just a means to avoid thinking about that end? Douglas may be closer to that end than he thinks here. As the toying escalates and becomes dangerous, the viewer may think this has the makings of a slick, if standard, thriller, but that's not the case, to everyone's credit. You reach a point, however, when certain incidents demand suspension of disbelief, no matter how much you trust the filmmakers. How far can a man fall, for example, before you start to think there's a limit of how much I can buy into here? How much can be allowed, how much power can you allow for the puppeteers before a line is crossed? It crosses that line with me towards the end but reaching that point was an interesting experience, something I can say about too few films.This was Fincher's middle film in his personal great trilogy, caught between Se7en and Fight Club. If there's one other minor quibble I might voice, it's that his stylistic flourishes are missing in this one - it's comparatively straightforward, even with the Super-8 type flashbacks, and I would have to rate this a smidgen below the other two.

The few sympathetic characters die in horrible ways while the real scum gets away with everything. And that's just not right, not even if you exclusively watch horror films to see gore. The climax is unnecessarily gross and rock\/soft-metal flavored soundtrack is very inappropriate. Pet Sematary 2 can also be considered offensive, especially if you're an animal-lover.

I was as I attempted to watch the first official Hollywood film noir thriller, Detour. Filmed in 1945, this film took some heavy risks that the normal Hollywood production at this time was not willing to take. Detour dabbled in heavy themes, dark context, and highly developed characters, yet seemingly lacked in production and acting. While watching Detour, it became obvious that these missing elements turned this film sour.The production of this film consisted of three scenes a hotel room, the restaurant, and finally (the majority) scenes of a car with a screen behind it. It was obvious that there was no budget. Due to these budget restraints, the overall elements of this film were completely clouded in spotty backgrounds and amateurish acting. This was a case in which more money would have helped create a stronger film. Normally, this is not my feeling, but for some odd reason, Detour brought this thought come out in me.Finally, perhaps it was the era that this film was made, or maybe it was something else, but I felt as if both the director and the editor could have been heavily intoxicated while filming Detour. The scenes are so jumbled together and are so horribly spliced that you can tell when the actors have made a mistake or when the director had to cut and start again. Perhaps this would not have been the case if the director had a better grasp of what he wanted to do and how to do it. The plot, due to the direction, seemed implausible at best. I had trouble coming to terms with the fact that an educated man would run from the law (and steal from a man) when he did nothing to cause his death. Any man of the law would listen to his story, look at the evidence, and see that Al is innocent.When Al runs from the law near the beginning of the film, it made me consider a point that was never developed in Detour. Was Al crazy? When he hides the body, thinking that he killed Haskell, we begin to see a side of Al that was not obvious in the first fifteen minutes of this film. Something, from before this film began, changed Al. What was this changing event? The world may never know, but it would have been helpful seeing at least a few scenes of Al's past to help develop his character a bit more. This was the same with Vera. I didn't know enough about her to really get a grip on her character. I needed more between her and Haskell before her meeting with Al.While Hollywood has expanded and obviously grown this genre over the years, it was interesting to see its beginnings. Unfortunately, due to poor production and overacting, this was not the best film to begin the genre. Detour is a starter film.

Outdoorsy, hunting, gun toting types like myself understood the film. If we were outdoorsy hunting types who were also fans of WWII history then so much the better! As a little rebel kid in the late 60's I used to daydream what it would be like to have to take to the woods with my little rebel pals if we were invaded, not that I wanted it to happen, of course. If you didn't live in those times, then, even with 911, you can have no concept of how real we thought the possibility might be with the Russians, Cubans, and all the bad guys in South America, etc. Anyway, Red Dawn is personal for me because I was stunned. It was like they had lifted my daydreams right out of my head and put them on the screen. You see, we have mountains where I live too and they always figured in my concept of local survival. Add all the patriotic and historical touches and it made a masterpiece. Of course, the TV Guide rates it only one star. It's a shame that they didn't mention that Red Dawn was one of the real early films to run on HBO and they ran it for MONTHS. Everybody, with the exception of the NY critics, were crazy about that movie. You won't find that little fact mentioned in the reviews! It was a runaway hit.
