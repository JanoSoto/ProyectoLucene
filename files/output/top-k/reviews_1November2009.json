The characters are not particularly well-developed, so we don't care what happens to most of them much, and the story is very diffuse, not focusing on anything in detail before moving on to the next set piece.

I wouldn't say I enjoyed the film but I was frightened by it and if a horror film scares the viewer it is doing its job. I was impressed that it managed to be scary without showing vast amounts of gore, in fact I don't recall seeing much blood at all.The film starts off showing us events many years before when a young boy murders his older sister on the night of Halloween. We then move the the present where the boy, Michael Myers, is still incarcerated in a facility for the criminally insane. He is due to have a parole hearing but his doctor, played by Donald Pleasence, is determined that he must never be released. Just as the doctor arrives at the facility Myers escapes and heads back to his former home town. He goes to his old house were he sees Laurie Strode, played by a young Jamie Lee Curtis, as she drops of the key for her estate agent father. He then starts following her around and she occasionally glimpses him but as soon as she looks away he has vanished. On Halloween night when she is babysitting he comes after her and her friends.There is not a huge death toll, in fact after the prologue we have to wait a long time till any one else is killed. This isn't boring though as there is a constant feeling that something bad could happen at any moment, it is this that makes the film so frightening. The creepiness is increased by not showing the face of the adult Myers for most of the film; we either see him from the neck down or wearing a creepy Halloween mask.The scariness is heightened by the use of creepy music and camera work that gives is Myers's view in several scenes, this shaky-cam work was done years before it became de rigour in just about every film. While the minor parts are fairly forgettable Jamie Lee Curtis does a decent job and screams well and Donald Pleasence is great as the doctor.

I had wanted to see it for a long time, and was very excited to finally get the chance to see it. It was just as great as I expected it to be. To me, Halloween has both the greatest atmosphere, and setting for a horror movie. It may not be the best horror movie ever, but its got to be the best slasher. Halloween is a true staple of horror. It takes what is already a great concept for a scary movie and makes it even better by making it take place on Halloween night. Because of this, it is the most fitting, appropriate movie to watch on the night of Halloween. It is really the perfect setting, and works out very well for the movie. Halloween has a great script alone, but its transition to film is incredible. To call the movie engaging would be an understatement. Halloween is thrilling, from start to finish. It also has a haunting score. An edge-of-your seat suspenseful score, that is both creepy and foreboding. Its my personal favorite horror movie soundtrack. It is one that when accompanied with the stark face of Michael Myers, is sure to induce fear. As for the character of Michael Myers, we don't know much about him, other than his doctor's description of him, as a maniac.We don't really know why he is set out on killing people. He doesn't seem to be filled with hatred, or wickedness. Its just what he does. He also seems to posses a supernatural quality. He is seemingly invincible he is never defeated in the movie, despite being attacked several times. He also appears out of nowhere, and then disappears. And our protagonist, Laurie, is the only one to ever see him. Her friends don't see him, and think she's imagining him. Michael's plan of attack is slow but sure. He seems like he is in a trance while he is after his victims. It is a trademark of his He doesn't even have to chase them, as any other slasher does. He walks.And he is still able to get them! All of this is what makes Michael so scary. Michael Myers is an elusive villain. He's not in-your-face like a lot of horror villains. His appearances are subtle. We often see him in the dark, only a piece of him, or we see him from a distance (if we see him at all). We also never know when Michael Myers is about to pop up. There are certain times in the movie where Michael seems to have a golden opportunity to jump out from the bushes, but he doesn't. He normally appears when you're least expecting it.The movie makes the holiday of Halloween even more fun. I believe that movies like Halloween are such a classic that you they are essential to watch for the full enjoyment of the holiday. Not just for horror fans, for everybody. Everybody who wants to enjoy Halloween to its fullest, that is. I think movies like this are every bit as crucial to Halloween, as is trick or treating, or candy corn. Honestly, what kind of Halloween would you have without trick-or-treating? A bland one. It would be just like thanksgiving with no turkey, or Easter with no chocolates. It would be just like any other day. Definitely watch this movie; watch it on Halloween night.

But this time, it would be an old-fashioned ghost story titled The Fog. To this day, The Fog is one of the most impressive ghost stories ever made.Enter the nice, quiet coastal town of Antonio Bay. Today is the town's 100th anniversary. A group of residents are celebrating, including sexy radio DJ Stevie Wayne, normal local Nick Castle, the sweet hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, and the priest Father Malone. Even though it is Antonio Bay's birthday, nothing is right. Under this celebration lies a terrible secret. And it begins to show when an ominous fog bank begins to envelop the town with terror. What is in the fog? What does it want? And can it be stopped? You can't compare The Fog to Halloween because Carpenter builds you up differently with it. Instead of evil in the form of a human being, Carpenter takes inspiration from the tales of classic horror authors, such as H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, dealing with an otherworldly force that isn't human. This is a tale of revenge brought upon by a supernatural force that will not go away until it gets what it wants.

Today is the town's 100th anniversary. A group of residents are celebrating, including sexy radio DJ Stevie Wayne, normal local Nick Castle, the sweet hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, and the priest Father Malone.

What is in the fog? What does it want? And can it be stopped? You can't compare The Fog to Halloween because Carpenter builds you up differently with it. Instead of evil in the form of a human being, Carpenter takes inspiration from the tales of classic horror authors, such as H.P.

Yet I have never quite understood why.The story concerns the Creed family (hubby, wife, daughter and toddler son) as they move into their new home and settle into what they'd like to consider domestic bliss. That bliss looks set to be seriously tested by the large trucks that tear by the main road directly in front of their house and the first such test occurs when a neighbour (played by Fred Gwynne aka forever Herman Munster) finds the family cat dead in their garden. This leads to a surreptitious trip by the neighbour and Louis Creed (played by Dale Midkiff) to the pet sematary (sic) of the title, where strange things can happen and beings can be given another shot at life, albeit with quite a change in their character. When the cat returns all seems well for a while even though it's a bit more aggressive than it used to be. Then tragedy REALLY hits the family and the path, indeed the destiny of all involved, seems to lead right back to that burial ground where the ground is sour.While it's hard to discuss this movie without revealing too many details I am going to try my very best. The central subject matter, mixing some ideas so rarely used within the genre that they almost feel taboo along with a riff on one of King's very favourite tales The Monkey's Paw, is certainly disturbing and morbidly fascinating for fans of the macabre. Director Mary Lambert provides a fine balance between showing the scares and keeping some moments tastefully hidden in shadows. King, adapting from his novel, provides a screenplay that's excellent when it comes to the scares but rather flat when it comes to the rest of the character moments and dialogue. And his use of a helpful spirit really starts to grate somewhat as the movie unfolds (a mechanism that may have been in the novel too, though I cannot recall as it's been many years since I read the original material).In the acting department nobody really stands out apart from the wonderful Fred Gwynne, who elicits such fond memories from people who grew up with his wonderful TV character Herman Munster that it's hard to decide whether he is better than those he shares screen time with or whether it's nostalgia and familiarity creating a warm empathy with anything he does. Dale Midkiff gets most of the bigger scare moments and does okay but Denise Crosby is rather flat as the mother while the children are both great in their vital roles, especially Miko Hughes as young Gage who injects some memorable scenes with a mixture of malevolence and childish innocence. Brad Greenquist does well with his annoying helpful spirit role and Andrew Hubatsek is pretty terrifying as Zelda, a twisted figure mostly shown in flashback and probably still haunting the psyches of those who saw this film back in the late 80s.So I guess this is quite a positive review, overall, but as I said at the beginning I just don't understand the adoration that some fans seem to have for the movie. It's a decent enough horror with it's flaws that stands out from others thanks to it's nasty main story strand but the execution of the movie is rather flat, the acting is variable and the writing (from King's own pen\/typewriter\/PC) isn't anything to . . . . . write home about. Above average. Just.See this if you like Pet Sematary 2, Sometimes They Come Back, Don't Look Now.

A long sequence of cars in a traffic jam in the rain with the conversations now all separate as people sit secluded away from each other.

There was The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds, but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from Shakespeare's The Tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough. It's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates), but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're channeling it.On the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard, if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the B-movies of the period. A ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet Altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before. But the only one left is Dr. Morbis (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. Morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man, and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts, led by the Skipper (Leslie Nielsen), can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on Earth.But there's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship, one by one, every night, even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence, which the invisible something goes through easily. Meanwhile, there's some romance possibly between the Skipper and Alraira, and there's a more pushy vibe from the doctor you shouldn't have come to the planet to start, and now you need to go. What happens from this is even more fascinating, just on a purely intellectual level, but Forbidden Planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas. While everyone may remember Robbie the Robot, and for good reason, perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail, animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of Fantasia.The acting from Pidgeon is subtle you wouldn't expect him to be a villain, though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this, and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect. And the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from Nielsen as a born leader to Holliman providing some great comic relief as the Cook (who, I should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon Robbie provides). And the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its tones. But ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from Hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the B-movie lot. When it's meant to be funny, it's intentionally so and it works. When it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. And when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.An inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it's a classy and entertaining classic.

And the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from Nielsen as a born leader to Holliman providing some great comic relief as the Cook (who, I should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon Robbie provides). And the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its tones. But ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from Hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the B-movie lot. When it's meant to be funny, it's intentionally so and it works. When it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. And when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.An inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it's a classy and entertaining classic.

October marks a day at the very end which we know is the devil's day, Halloween. The scariest day in the year. For me Halloween has always been interesting and a fun time right since my childhood but this film changed my opinion on it altogether.Early this month it was my mother's day and I began to chose a gift for her, I found the gift and then I had a evil thought that why don't I buy a scary movie for myself and I actually got away with buying a '18' movie (as I was 17 during the time). So the night I got to see the movie it was late and I just switched it on as my Dad was working late and I had to open the door for him, it was the strike of 12. I saw the whole movie before his arrival. Before his arrival I looked out of my bedroom window, it was pitch dark and I thought, I know where John got his idea.John has made a movie about the darker side of Halloween, taking away the trick or treating or the fun partying, just a crazy masked killer killing people on one street during this night. The boy only 21 years old who was caught murdering his sister at the age of 6. A boy who knows no the difference between right or wrong, evil or good just pure evil in the back of his mind. The characters are kept alive, because the characters could be you or me, but Micheal Myers in no one. This is where John aces. In a small package, the film is suppose to be a slasher but this was more of that. This built the atmosphere of Halloween. Some scenes really do make your hair stand up, and some scenes need to be noted likeWhen Doctor Loomis explains his account on Myers. Micheal's sister's body is missing from the graveyard. Little boy Tommy is teased at school that the bogeyman is out for youBut just imagine, a cold night, the scariest day in year and a masked killer killing people on your street and this killer is still unknown. The good idea of keeping this doctor played by Donald Pleasence was there to explain this boy and why reason is he killing, wonderful!Overall, the film does intend to scare you and for the people who don't get scared easily will get scared from the thought of Myers. John intended to make people feel Myers is human, but slowly into the film he is nothing but a bad spirit, inhuman even. At first I misunderstood this film but it later grew on me. The perfect film for the holiday and for the month of October.

Any one of a number of small decisions could have sent the entire film off course. It's a credit to Hal Ashby that with this film he was able to maintain the kind of humanism and balance that would make the film not only convincing but heartbreaking. Peter Sellers turns in one of his greatest performances, projecting a kind of unearthly stillness and gravity that leaves itself open to the audience as well as the other characters for interpretation.Sellers plays an imbecile named Chance who has never been outside of the house where he has served as a gardener for decades. For a man whose entire life has been spent watching plants grow and watching television, simply being there is the real world is a fresh experience. He should probably be in an institution, but by the end of the film he's hurtling towards the Presidency. Of course this has often been interpreted as very dark satire, but I think the film is more concerned with people as individuals than society as such. Chance himself is like a magic mirror who shows everyone what they want to see, because he has nothing to offer for himself. I don't think that this is so much a cynical film as a sad one. You look at this character Shirley MacLaine plays, and I really don't think that the film -- as pathetic as it makes her seem at times -- is really condemning her nor casting her in any light as typical. The fact that Chance can bring her happiness without actually doing anything is pathetic, not laughable.So if the film is a satire, it's only incidentally a satire. Like St. Peter, Chance can literally walk on water as long as nobody tells him that he shouldn't be able to. Chance is a man who's been liberated without ever wanting to be free. This seems a theme in many of Ashby's films. For example, in Harold and Maude, Harold never knew that he even wanted to be alive until he met Maude. In The Last Detail, Nicholson and his buddy never had a clue just how enslaved they were to the military\/social hierarchy until they saw what freedom could be like in the Randy Quaid character. With Chance, however, there's no self-realization, no awareness. He doesn't even know how he has changed other people's lives, and his own philosophy and perspective are as solid as the water he walks on (to him).

But as a convincing or scary psycho- thriller it will strike anyone familiar with Hitchcock before Powell, Polanski at the same time, and Kubrick, Shyamalan, or even Lynch more recently, that this is dull potatoes.

The lead man, the bad guy, is Karlheinz Bohm, a bizarre choice, more a pretty type than a great actor, but he serves as a good post-Nazi German we can love to hate for external reasons.

The classic film All About Eve owes its fame to an incredible director\/writer, Joseph Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz created a script and mixed it together with an incredible cast of performers almost as if the roles were created for the individual actors based on their true-life personalities. All About Eve is a story about Margo Channing who is a Broadway star who is growing older. Margo invites a fan into her home only to learn that she is trying to become famous herself and has set her sights on Margo's life as a star. The theme of the film All About Eve, is the pursuit of success. Eve Harrington wants to become famous in the theatre so badly that she will do just about anything in order to climb her way to the top in the fastest manner possible. Eve is a caring person on the surface in order to get in close with those that can help her to maneuver her way into stardom to the top. However,under the surface she doesn't care about anything or anybody and doesn't care who she destroys in her quest for fame. Addison sees the true person that she is and begins manipulating her in order to prevent her from ruining the careers of any more actors.

The performances of all of the actors blend together perfectly in order to create one of the most famous films of all time which is loved by generations of all ages. The character of Eve, a Broadway actress who is growing old is compared to the performance of Gloria Swanson who played an aging star in Sunset Boulevard. Both Davis and Swanson were nominated that year for the Oscar award of best actress, but the award went to Judy Holiday for her performance in Born Yesterday.

John Coffey is a black man who is accused of the rape and murder of a child, but he is a miracle worker because he holds the power of faith healing. The cast includes Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, Bonnie Hunt as Jan Edgecomb, David Morse as Brutus Howell, and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.The theme of this film is about the death penalty surrounded by compassion and innocence of a man who is guilty by association. John Coffey has a gift of healing others through his touch, some my say impossible, but an act of God. Coffey is on death row awaiting electrocution for a crime that he did not commit. This is revealed to Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard, through Coffey's mind while Coffey is touching him in an attempt to heal him. When Coffey uses his power to heal someone it leaves him exhausted, he goes through the pain that the ill is feeling. Throughout the film, he heals a mouse that one of the prison inmates has deemed his pet, the warden's wife, and Paul Edgecomb himself. Once the guards understand Coffey's innocence they do not want to see him be put to death, however, Coffey does. He does not want to bear the pain and thoughts that his special power brings him. He can't take the hurt anymore. He has used all of his compassion and power to save others but wants to end his life so that he does not have to live with the pain anymore.The use of lighting and angles in this film is important to set the mood of the prison. It is a dark setting to set a dreary and sad atmosphere in most of the scenes. The angles of the camera are low and shoot up at John Coffey making his character look very large. He is a giant compared to the prison guards. This angle makes him look very tall therefore making the guards look much shorter than he.This is a brilliant film that puts the viewer on an emotional roller coaster ride of joy, tears and laughter. It allows you to travel back to that time era and experience the sadness in a place such as the green mile, an inmate's last walk before execution, but at the same time a feeling of joy and miracle.

John Coffey is a black man who is accused of the rape and murder of a child, but he is a miracle worker because he holds the power of faith healing. The cast includes Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, Bonnie Hunt as Jan Edgecomb, David Morse as Brutus Howell, and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.The theme of this film is about the death penalty surrounded by compassion and innocence of a man who is guilty by association. John Coffey has a gift of healing others through his touch, some my say impossible, but an act of God. Coffey is on death row awaiting electrocution for a crime that he did not commit. This is revealed to Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard, through Coffey's mind while Coffey is touching him in an attempt to heal him. When Coffey uses his power to heal someone it leaves him exhausted, he goes through the pain that the ill is feeling. Throughout the film, he heals a mouse that one of the prison inmates has deemed his pet, the warden's wife, and Paul Edgecomb himself. Once the guards understand Coffey's innocence they do not want to see him be put to death, however, Coffey does. He does not want to bear the pain and thoughts that his special power brings him. He can't take the hurt anymore. He has used all of his compassion and power to save others but wants to end his life so that he does not have to live with the pain anymore.The use of lighting and angles in this film is important to set the mood of the prison. It is a dark setting to set a dreary and sad atmosphere in most of the scenes. The angles of the camera are low and shoot up at John Coffey making his character look very large. He is a giant compared to the prison guards. This angle makes him look very tall therefore making the guards look much shorter than he.This is a brilliant film that puts the viewer on an emotional roller coaster ride of joy, tears and laughter. It allows you to travel back to that time era and experience the sadness in a place such as the green mile, an inmate's last walk before execution, but at the same time a feeling of joy and miracle.
