Written and directed by Edward Bernds (who directed many of The Three Stooges films), the film moves far away from the Gothic horror of its predecessor and gets closer to the many creature features of the 50s where a monster kills mercilessly those who oppose it causing havoc and horror among those who surrounds it.Set years after the events of the first film, Return of the Fly presents an adult Philippe Delambre (Brett Halsey) and his desires to continue his father's work on matter transportation now that his mother has died. His uncle Francois (Vincent Price) opposes him, as he knows the dangers that gave as a result his brother's death; however, after being blackmailed by Philippe he can't help but funding his research. To their misfortune, Philippe's assistant Alan Hinds (David Frankham) has a dark secret, a secret that will unleash the horror of the Fly again.To his credit, Edward Bernds connects very cleverly both films and the premise is actually quite exiting and original. However, the film develops in a way that favors action over the subtle suspense and the Gothic horror of the first film. While in the first one the horrors of the transformation where kept hidden most of the time, here the script uses every chance to show off the hideous monster as most as possible. Still, while the film is definitely more action oriented and way different from the first one, the plot is very entertaining on its own right.The direction is appropriate considering the whole change in tone and mood of the film, and Bernds' expertise in low-budget film-making crafts his film efficiently although with a very bland result. Gone are the Gothic feeling and the elegant camera-work, gone are the vivid colors and the dark imagery; this film is a full-fledged sci-fi film of its time and it shows. Bernds use of basically every visual effect available (without caring too much for quality) is notorious and while the Black & White photography is very well used to make an eerie atmosphere, the overall look of the film is a bit typical of the 50s.The cast is probably what saves the film from being just another cheap sequel, as despite the dull dialogs and the overall weak script, most of them deliver quite good performances. Vincent Price reprises his role as Francois and this time his character has more action. Easily the best of the cast, Price makes the most of what is probably the weakest character in his career. David Frankham is also very good as the mysterious Alan Hinds, and John Sutton is very effective as the Inspector Beecham. While Brett Halsey should be the best of the bunch given that he is the main character, his performance is a bit weak and definitely not up to the challenge.Return of the Fly suffers a lot from its low-budget, specially concerning the whole Fly make-up. Clearly designed to be more grotesque than the original, it looks exaggerated and clumsy, and the constant showing of the monster clearly doesn't help. Effects that in the original were used with great care to create horrifying scenes here are quickly wasted on useless scenes apparently done to show off as many effects as possible.This sequel is obviously inferior to the original, although it has an advantage over most of the countless cheap sequels it's entertaining. Although probably the movie is now a laughing matter, it's saved by the presence of Vincent Price that proves that his charisma and personality can make a film worthy. Return of the Fly is worth a watch, and while it is not a horror classic, it delivers entertainment despite all of its troubles. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Return of the Fly is the inevitable sequel to the 1958's classic horror film The Fly, and like most of the sequels done to capitalize on the success of their predecessors, it doesn't hold a candle against the original.

For starters, this was the last animated film that Walt Disney himself personally supervised. This film ended Walt Disney's animated features with a bang, a fine film that's an improvement over the previous Disney animated feature, The Sword in the Stone. The film is not without its flaws, but it is an effort that is much more confident than the previous Disney animated films that came after the box office disaster that was Sleeping Beauty. Disney took several liberties with Rudyard Kipling's classic. It was originally planned to be a very faithful adaptation of the two books, with Bill Peet outdoing himself on the original treatment. The complex, and rather dark version of The Jungle Book that he wrote screamed potential, but Walt did not approve and Peet left the studio.The result is a more comedic musical take on the books, and the liberties taken with the book are there. This allowed the animators to outdo themselves, which they did not do with The Sword in the Stone. The character changes allowed the animators to have a lot of fun with the film, and it can be easily seen. It's more exuberant than the previous two films and it boasts a strong selection of songs. The plot is episodic, but it works for the most part. The characters are well-developed and the animators masterfully get the audience to love them. Baloo is a delight to watch, and Shere Khan might be one of Disney's finest villains with his sophistication and his attitude. Kaa has comic genius written all over. King Louie is probably the best character, and his musical number I Wanna Be Like You definitely shows it.One surprising element in the film is how very 1960s-esque it is. Four great vultures resemble The Beatles, and being a Beatles fan, I personally love that. There's some 60s-style slang and dialogue like that. It somewhat makes the film a bit dated, especially with its then-celebrity voice cast. However, the cast perfectly fits each character, so that's not a major complaint. Everything works well, except for one thing. In the 1960s, Walt Disney was losing interest in animation after Sleeping Beauty's performance in 1959 and his hatred of Xerography, used on Disney films since One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Animation from other Disney films and shorts is recycled, and parts of the film feel slightly rushed. However, Walt wanted the animators to deliver a great picture, and that they most certainly did.The Jungle Book is a musical masterpiece and an important film in animation history, and it's success after the death of Walt Disney convinced the studio to keep going at a time when animation seemed to be on its way out as the 1970s rolled in.

In one scene, Marge tells her kids about Mozart's life, only to be criticized by Lisa for using Milos Forman's Amadeus as a source, since said film supposedly contains few true things. That may be the case, but as long as Amadeus remains one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen, why should I care?Amadeus is a beautiful film, which deservedly won the Best Picture and Director Oscars for 1984. Most of its genius is to be found in Milos Forman's ability not to be distracted by the vastness and splendor of the production design and the costumes and focus on the intriguing plot and well constructed characters.This is obvious already in the beginning, which is one of the best ever filmed. We see a priest enter an asylum to speak to Antonio Salieri (Academy Award-winner F. Murray Abraham), once a famous composer, now a disgraced and abandoned madman. When the two meet, Salieri starts playing the piano to test the priest's musical knowledge. After two failed attempts, he finally finds something the churchman recognizes, as the latter eagerly says Oh, that's charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote it. Salieri's answer? I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang... Amadeus... Mozart.... And so the story begins, told in flashback by the Italian composer.Mozart himself doesn't actually appear until about 17 minutes into the film. In fact, the strings are constantly pulled by Salieri, who starts his narration by recalling his difficult childhood and his prayer to God that he be allowed to spread His will through music. Naturally, such a thing doesn't happen. That privilege is awarded to young Mozart (Tom Hulce), who's in Vienna to perform for the Emperor (Jeffrey Jones). Imagine Salieri's surprise when he discovers that such talent can be found in a kid. Imagine his total astonishment when he realizes the enfant prodige from Salzburg is in reality a foul-mouthed, rude womanizer. The shock is too much for the envious Italian who, despite recognizing and admiring the perfection and superiority of the rival's work, vows to destroy him by any means necessary.The movie was shot almost entirely on location in Forman's home-town Prague, which perfectly captures the magic, but also the low points, of Mozart's life from marvelous palaces and theaters to distasteful night-clubs, Amadeus is a visual roller-coaster, never letting the eye rest amidst the settings of many fascinating (and shocking) events, events that form a haunting tale of jealousy and bitterness, masterfully incarnated by Abraham, a very talented actor who has sadly been confined to supporting parts ever since (his best post-Amadeus work? The Inquisitor in The Name of the Rose). Shame, because he has all the right qualities to carry an entire film. Also unjustly forgotten after this movie is Tom Hulce, who succeeds in making the great Austrian musician look like an annoying, occasionally drunk, constantly laughing (oh, that laughter is terrible) brat.Few films, particularly biopics, manage to stay interesting for all their running time. Luckily Amadeus is such a film at almost three hours, it's consistently captivating, inspired and inspiring.

With the singing voices of Marilyn Horne, LeVerne Hutcherson, Marvin Hayes, Bernice Peterson, Margaret Lancaster....Director Otto Preminger, Lyrics By Oscar Hammerstein II, Screenplay Harry Kleiner.From 1954, director Otto Preminger and Broadway musical composer Oscar Hammerstein teamed up for Carmen Jones, a musical version of the well-known and popular opera Carmen by Georges Bizet. For its time, this film was revolutionary and innovative. Musicals were primarily a vehicle for well-known Caucausian singing-actors Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Julie Andrews, Mary Martin and others. The cast for this film is all-black, and the principal roles are portrayed by well-known African-American actors of their day- Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte. Although an all-black Broadway musical was not new at this time (George Gerswhin's Porgy and Bess had already appeared on Broadway and in the 40's all-black musical films like The Green Pastures and Cabin In The Sky preceded this film), Carmen Jones was still very unique and an important film for the black community, for it meant that better roles were finally given to black actors. The movie was made in colorful Cinemascope, which was quite new at the time, filmed (thank God) outdoors and not in a studio, giving the film a realistic quality rather than a painted backdrop feeling which you would otherwise get in a musical or opera for that matter. Although the Bizet opera version is not what you see here, much of the original plot, themes and characters from the opera remain intact. There's a Carmen, Don Jose and Micaela, except with different, more realistic names and attitudes. The setting has been changed from the typically romanticized 19th century Spain composed of free-spirited gypsies, bullfighters, passionate romance and soldiers to America sometime after World War II (possibly the Korean War period)definitely the 50's. Carmen's opening number Habanera, in which a red-clad Carmen sings a seductive song about herself, is still as powerful and evocative as every Carmen production I've ever seen. Dorothy Dandrige had made several important films and her roles were like black Marilyn Monroe roles- sexy, smart and liberated. She was a sort of pre-feminist movement icon. Her love of freedom, sensuality and devil-may-care attitude serves her well for the part of Carmen, who lives to love men, leave them and move on to a better catch, living a life that is her own and doing exactly as she pleases. American Mezzo-soprano diva Marilyn Horne provides the singing voice for Carmen Jones. This was early in her opera career and it was a smart move, for many still remember her for her fine Carmen performances. Harry Belafonte as Joe, the soldier Carmen loves and later jilts delivers a man driven to torment and passion, a man transformed from a good, innocent, engaged man (he's engaged to Cindy Lou played by Olga James) to an obscessed and ultimately tragic figure. He is very realistic, in fact probably more so than other Don Joses who make him out to be some kind of psychotic soldier or overgrown boy. We feel for Joe's plight. We feel for Cindy Lou's plight. But Dorothy Dandridge is not complex enough for us to sympathize with her character. The film is probably at its best when there is no singing and we see the drama unfolding through dialog. But the words by Oscar Hammerstein are memorable, catchy and perfectly in-synch with the original music written for the Bizet opera, although it appears that Hammerstein composed variations and new music that seems to fit the Carmen music. This is a great film, despite the melodrama and the flat characters. Fans of Dorothy Dandridge, who lived a short life in the movies and who was, in her day, a serious black actress prior to the Civil Rights movement, will enjoy this film. This role is possibly her most famous and the one that earned her a great deal of fame.
