In addition to having great common themes, i.e., don't give up, don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and don't be a victim of your circumstances, October Sky is an excellent example of what many fathers and sons go through together.I sat down with my son to watch this movie. He loved the pursuit of the dream, the adventure of the boys and at the end, when Homer's father comes to watch the final rocket launch and put his arms around his boy, my son turned and looked at me and understood exactly why I wanted to watch this movie with him. Not many movies can entertain and teach at the same time without being heavy handed. The Director's handling of the father\/son relationship was right on.I also love Natalie Cannerday as the mom. I wish she had more opportunity to be put on screen because she has the best accent in Hollywood. I could listen to her twang all day.
