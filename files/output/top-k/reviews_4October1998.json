It is positively the most boring film ever made.  Kubrick has done great work with A Clockwork Orange and Spartacus, but when he tries to do profoundly thought-provoking films, he tends to put viewers to sleep.  I can argue against every single aspect of this movie, save the special effects, which are still fabulous even today.My problems with the film include a plot that is about as sporadic as the average Hollywood producer's creative processes.  Now, when I see a film concerning space travel, I assume it should be interesting to watch. However, Kubrick managed to even turn off interest.  If I wanted to watch a realistic exploration of space travel, I'd watch NASA videos.  But for movies in a theater, I want to be entertained.  I want to see the screen and watch something new.  2001 didn't do that for me.   If I had been alive in 1968, my opinion may have been different, because space travel wasn't something most people had been used to.  For me, I've seen it so many times that the film doesn't bring anything new to me.  I've seen it all done before, usually in reality, not film.  Therefore, I was hoping for a plot, and there wasn't one.The opening sequence is a masterpiece, just because it actually provides some great moments.  But once the bone is thrown into the air, be sure to grab your coffee or Pepsi or No-Snooz.  The bone thrown into the air has to be the most overrated sequence in the history of film.  Everyone keeps saying, The morph from the bone to the ship is absolutely stunning.  WHAT MORPH?  There is just a straight cut from the bone to the ship... and it just didn't work.  The ship didn't look like the bone, and I don't know why everyone gets so worked up over it.  It boggles the mind...And boggling the mind seems to be Kubrick's strong point.  The final sequence as Kubrick gives us a light and sound show goes on for what feels like three hours.  I actually fast-forwarded the scene just to get through it without falling asleep.  And the star child... what was that all about? Who was it?  What was the room he arrived in?  I believe that any other director in any other film would have been ridiculed and laughed at for years for making the exact same scene.  But because Kubrick's name is attached, it gains this respect that is rather... annoying... to say the least.  It's an overrated sci-fi film that provides moments of entertainment, and the rest is merely filler for your average insomniac.

While it necessarily lacks the layered nuance of the novel, it manages to pose many of the same issues contained therein and to challenge its audience in similar ways. An excellent film and an excellent adaptation!

It is hard, when attempting a serious critique of a film of such low-calibre, to know where to start when picking out its faults. Certainly the script is terrible. Over these last two movies in the series, the scriptwriting has undergone a dramatic decline from the quality of the first two, largely (if not entirely) due to the influence of Akiva Goldsman. Here the one-liners come thick and fast and not one of them is worth repeating. The narrative is extremely poorly formed and there are many loose ends jumps in logic as to the devolving relationship between the title characters. Particularly, the character of Poison Ivy makes absolutely no sense, at least that I can fathom. Robin comes across as a spoiled brat and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze merely defies description as possibly THE worst Batman villain on the screen. George Clooney is new to the cape and seems to be lost in trying to find his own way of translating the character. Not to worry, if this is the standard of quality, there hopefully won't be a fifth film. Chris O'Donnell plays a marvellously annoying Robin, but it is quite arguable as to whether this was intended of indeed, whether O'Donnell is acting at all. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy at least tries hard in the role, but not even Thurman can pull off the snake-headed flowers and emerge unscathed. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, I suspect, would have maintained a better handle on the role if only it were better developed and her second side not introduced so late in the film. Indeed, this lack of character development is any many ways the major problem with the script. We know, from Batman mythology, that the characters of Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze and Two-Face (from Batman Forever) are all intricate character with their own storylines and sympathetic sides. This is totally ignored in this film in deference to the implausible and uninteresting stunts. Schumacher has tried to play the action card upon us once again and has failed miserably, where in Batman Forever it was probably the saving grace. Schumacher's revamped Gotham is truly hideous and impractical to say the least and the observatory itself is quite quite exquisitely awful. I would recommend this film only to budding film-makers not only as a dystopic view on how films should NOT be made but also as a lesson in how much advertising and hype can shield the public from actual quality ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 1998","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Batman Forever was bad.

However, A Night at the Roxbury proves that no one is perfect, and all film-makers can bounce back.Doug (Chris Kattan) and Steve (Will Ferrell) Butabi are two very atypical young adults.  They work at their father's silk flowers store, ringing up customers and making deliveries.  They still live at home, and have no goal in life except to go clubbing and score!  Although, they own expensive suits and drive (dad's) expensive cars, they just can't seem to get with it.  One night after being tossed out of the famous club, the Roxbury, the brothers get the idea of one day starting their own club. Therefore, the rebellious brothers leave the reins of their father (Dan Hedaya) and begin going into business for themselves.This movie, which was directed by John Fortenberry, had many weaknesses to begin with.  First off, since the movie was produced by Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, Roxbury had a very small budget.  It also was very unable to achieve the big names that a movie like this could have used.  Only washed up actors like Loni Anderson and Richard Grieco made the big names list, with fellow SNL cast members Molly Shannon and Colin Quinn getting large billings as well.  Second, the movie starred two characters that previous to this movie didn't have names, identities, or lines longer then `Wanna dance?'I found myself laughing on many occasions.  Though I was never rolling around on the floor busting a gut, I wasn't bored silly.  The storyline is weak, and the acting is fairly sub-par.  However, the set design and the soundtrack, which features the Butabi brothers' signature tune What is Love, are a very notable highlight to the film.Overall, I guess I would have to say that although this was not nearly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, was not bad either.

Think of it, they are flesh and blood, not the characters in the TV games. Should they be killed just for one or two people's foolish decision? They all have families, they are innocent. I appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal, to save private Ryan and send him home at any cost, he didn't mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fields.Steven Spielberg has produced a very great movie, different from the other scientific films he had ever made, but it is a most touching film that give a good lesson to most of the people. It makes me think about the song Where have all the flowers gone? Yes, there are still battles even in this modern world, still destroying millions of spirits and families, when will they ever learn?

But it comes pretty darn close.  You could easily say this film had the 'Titanic' effect on me... you know, where a lot of people turn against the film for winning so many awards.  But here's my problem... it really wasn't a good film when I first saw it.  What you have here is essentially a two-hour long sitcom... one you want to end after half an hour.  But it doesn't... it keeps going.We are introduced into a story that seems to have been going on for three or four seasons, er... years, and the connections between them all are never quite distinct.  The characters are never fully developed because James L. Brooks thinks he can release these cut-outs onto us and get away with it. For the most part, he's succeeded.  He's received a warm welcome from many, many people.  But not me.This is just putrid.  One wonders how this one got nominated for Best Picture, when The Sweet Hereafter was infinitely better.  In fact, Atom Egoyan, the director of that great film, was nominated for Best Director, while James L. Brooks was not.  Thankfully, this meant As Good As It Gets wouldn't win.  But it won for Best Actress and Best Actor, and this just completely astonished me.  The hype over Helen Hunt is almost unbearable.  I love Mad About You, and I love her character.  But every single movie she's done since has just been that character with a different problem.  Twister Mad About You with a twist.  As Good As It Gets Mad About You with an ill child.  Even Mad About You is approaching the limits of which I can take, as Hunt won the Emmy for Best Actress purely on her Oscar win.  It amazes me that the Academy, a group of selected people who watch the performances and decide, chose Hunt over every other performance, all infinitely better. Kate Winslet was great, but either Helena Bonham Carter or Judi Dench should have won.  I doubt most Academy members even saw that movie.  Thankfully, Hunt even acknowledged Dench's loss (although, I think she secretly thought she deserved it).  Best Actor... JACK NICHOLSON?  Are you insane?  I mean, he's won before.  And he's won for doing this performance.  I think the Academy felt bad for not giving it to him for Chinatown, and so they awarded it to him again.  The REAL best?  Either Peter Fonda or Robert Duvall, both incredible in their performances.  Jack Nicholson was doing a cliche of a character, and he won.  And why wasn't Leonardo DiCaprio nominated?  He didn't deserve to win, but he deserved to be nominated.  I don't necessarily like the guy, but as an actor, he's one of the best.I don't normally hate a movie for winning awards, but this is one of those rare exceptions.  Undeserving of every nomination and award it received, As Good As It Gets becomes one of the most annoying films in recent memory.
