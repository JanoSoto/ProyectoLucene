While there's some truth in that, there's a reason for it too. Movies at the multiplexes can often become repetitive, and don't have as high of an intelligence level as the average viewer. This problem gets worse as the number of movies one watches increases, hence the term critic comes into play. Such is the case with Enemy of the State. It's great until you start thinking about it like a critic, then you recognize all the seams and problems.I am getting off on a tangent, and I apologize. To be fair, Enemy of the State is above par compared with most entries in the conspiracy thriller genre. It's fast-paced, well-acted, and pretty smart. Sure, at times it goes over the top, but I'm willing to forgive because of all it does right.Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is a lawyer who has to go on the run after he comes into possession of a tape that has the recording of a congressman being murdered. Soon the government is onto him, tracking his every move, and the only one he can trust is the elusive, and slightly paranoid, Brill (Gene Hackman).Probably the best thing that Enemy of the State has going for it is the performances. Will Smith is one of the most underrated actors around. Usually limited only to brainless summer action movies, this allows him to show his acting talent while still in a genre that he's comfortable with. Smith's character could have become another generic action hero, but Smith is smart and talented enough to play Dean as a human being, not a writer's construct. Dean is a normal man trapped in an extraordinary situation. The little things make Dean more believable how he acts around his family, what he does, how he talks, etc. This makes him more believable, and elevates the film. The script calls for him to do some dumb things, but Smith manages to soften the blows considerably. Yet at the same time, Dean does some smart things too (some of which I believed, some I didn't). He knows how to cover himself without being told (a rarity for someone who is a lawyer, instead of a cop or something). For example, when he finds a woman dead and realizes that he's being framed, he doesn't just run away or try to make it look like there was a struggle, he picks up as much evidence as he can and then leaves.Smith is supported by a talented cast. Gene Hackman is Gene Hackman, only a little quieter and without as much bravado. Credit goes to Hackman for underplaying his character's paranoia so as to not make Brill look like a nutjob. Jon Voight, well, one gets what they pay for when they see him in a role like this. Regina King is cast against type as Dean's wife, who's not a tough, but instead a normal wife, and she plays it well. Lisa Bonet is terrific in a small role, but Bonet makes her three-dimensional with the screen time that she has. It's a wonder why the former Cosby kid doesn't get any more roles as an adult (for my money, she's better as an adult).There are also a lot of up and coming (at the time) stars who make appearances here Scott Caan, Barry Pepper, Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Seth Green, Gabriel Byrne, Tom Sizemore, Jason Lee, Jason Robards, and Philip Baker Hall.Tony Scott is a great choice for this material. He keeps the pace fast, and things never let up, but he doesn't shortchange anything. Nothing seems like it was left on the cutting room floor. The gimmicks he is known for are very restrained, and help serve the material instead of hurting it.Still, sometimes the film goes over the top. Perhaps the budget was too big for its own good, but the amount of force that was after Dean seems excessive (the film could have lost the helicopter-if the Voight's character wanted to be discreet, would he really have made it look like he was going after the number one person on America's Most Wanted?). Additionally, the script makes some dumb moves. As good as Will Smith is, he can't cover up some of the blunders, like calling his house when he knows it's bugged.I enjoyed the fact that this film was geared towards adults, instead of a teenager movie with more violence and language. It allows for some interesting plot developments to happen, and it allows the actors more room to breathe. Considering this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, it's a sad memoriam for the films he used to produce before he sold out and only made big budget brainless action movies for the teenage crowd. This is his last, more adult-oriented big-budget movie that ISN'T a complete downer (like Black Hawk Down).Strangely, with all of the fuss about the Patriot Act and personal security these days, Enemy of the State doesn't manage to find a deeper level with its uncanny resemblance to today's world. Maybe that's for the best though, so the viewer can enjoy it on its own terms, cause it's a fun ride.

It starts off with 3 homeboys checking out the shyt from a mortician (played brilliantly by Clarence Williams the 3rd who ironically was in an episode of Tales From the Crypt years earlier). The mortician then tells 4 tales centered around real life issues.Tale 1 is about 3 white cops who murder a black politician while a rookie black cop looks on. A year later the politician rises from the grave to extract revenge. Its your basic police brutality and one of the weaker stories because its not very realistic, which I thought this movie was supposed to be.Tale 2 is the second best in my opinion. A child on the first day of school is examined by his teacher to find bruises all over him, he claims the monster at home did it. This one centers around child abuse with the awesome moral that there are monsters in real life, just not in the form everyone thinks.Tale 3 is another weak one but Corbin Bernsen is the man, he absolutely rules so I refuse to hate it no matter how absurd it is. This one's about a former KKK member who's moving into a mansion that was once the sight of a brutal slave massacre back in the civil war days. Once he move in the ghosts of the pasts haunt him and his associate to drive home the fact that someone always pays for the sins of the past. I don't know whether it was a casting goof, but Corbin's associate was a black man so if he was a racist then why would he choose this guy as a partner? The whole dolls come to life idea is another cheesy idea (coming off about 5 Puppet Master and Child's Play movies) and if anyone else was playing the role, I would have hit the fast forward button.Tale 4 is my personal favorite...it involves a young black gangster who will kill everyone and anyone with no remorse or fear. After murdering some homeboy, the cops catch him and throw him in jail. This is where he meets a white supremacist who thanks him for doing his job for him. which leads to one of the most sickest, eye opening montages in film history. Basically the moral is, what's the difference between white lynch mobs of the 19th and 20th century and gang bangers from today? Gang violence is murder any way you look at it, and it doesn't matter if the parties are black or white, people suffer and die just the same.The film is done incredibly well but it does portray the white race as the bad guys with all the characters being racist (3 cops, politician, prisoner in the cell), but I guess that's payback for all the black characters being petty thugs and thieves in the Dirty Harry series.The tales themselves offer morals that people in every day life deal with, whether it was cheesy or not. Child abuse, crooked cops, corrupt politicians and gang warfare are an unfortunate but very real situations that this movie shines the light on beautifully.I won't give away the ending but Clarence Williams is the man of the hour and the one with the power, too sweet to be sour.I guess the highlight for me was when Corbin Bernsen calls the media spooky reporters 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 May 2008","score":"","review":" As a white American, I view this movie a lot differently than its intended audience...lemme tell you why.The movie is basically a Tales From the Crypt like setting with a black cultured twist.

Other reviewers berate the director, Hitchcock, but directors only tell the story, they don't write it. How did such a poor script get put on celluloid?

Cary Grant's line of dry humour under adversity is entirely lacking and he is less convincing as the police agent torn between love and duty - the less-than-sharp and rather misogynistic script unhelpful.

It did though serve one of its stars well enough - Ingrid Bergman was scarcely ever more lovely or, as a loving, abused and endangered heroine, ever tugged so at male audiences' heart-strings (exactly as she does the Cary Grant character) other than perhaps as she had done in Gaslight. The casting otherwise did seem less than sure-footed. Cary Grant's line of dry humour under adversity is entirely lacking and he is less convincing as the police agent torn between love and duty - the less-than-sharp and rather misogynistic script unhelpful. Claude Rains was simply too nice to be a Nazi - and too old to be the mother-dominated son of a woman played by an actress in reality just 3 years his senior.Taken as a thriller it suffers from various defects. Filmed biographies of real life figures such as Odette (1950) have left little creditable room for soapy variations on the theme of the woman spy facing extreme danger and death. Common sense insists that such heroines' motivations required to be of the very strongest kinds in order to undertake such dangerous and distasteful work yet here plausible motivation is entirely lacking. And the agents who set her up seem to take her extreme commitment for granted. The plot was decidedly leaky - Grant and Bergman meet publicly, sit and embrace on a park bench in the city where she lives a lie with her Nazi husband as if there was no danger of being watched. And finally, the coup de grace for a thriller - it distinctly lacked tension.Take away the top line stars and director and this would have been a pot-boiling B movie. Indeed take away Ingrid Bergman and not that much worth watching would have been left.

Unfortunately, throughout his prolific career, he did make a couple of clunkers, and Lolita is definitely one of them.The comedy was misplaced and unfunny, the creepiness was corny and uncreepy, and the overall mood was as dry as sandpaper. The deepest, and the most artistic, scene in the entire film was the introduction. Aside from that, barely anything was impressive or accessible enough to draw me in. For most of the 2 1\/2 hours, I watched each scene lumber by, and barely cared for what I was seeing.Why was Clare Quilty such a front and center character? Was it because Peter Sellers agreed to play the part, and they wanted to see as much of him as possible? Is that why they chose to over-develop his character, give him more lines than anyone, have him play two characters, and stray completely from the poetic chords that made the book so moving? And why was Humbert Humbert's background so under-explained? If you had never read the book, the deeper reasons behind his sickness, and everything else, would be mostly unknown.The story and the character development jumped about with hardly any subtly. For example Humbert, out of the clear blue, begins to rant about his controlling wife, and a few moments later, he contemplates on ways to kill her with a gun. There were no hints about him having murderous tendencies within the story's chronology, but all of a sudden he does? And there is no sexual tension or chemistry between Humbert and Lolita; you can barely tell that they have a relationship at all. Maybe the 1960s censors are to blame for this. Nevertheless, the relationship still feels very shallow, unbelievable, and unjustified. Why would a beautiful young girl want to have sex with a man who was as old and as ugly as James Mason? This is never explained.As a longtime Kubrick fan, I'm not afraid to say that this film downright sucked. I only give it a 5 out of 10 because it wasn't entirely awful.

In this beautifully filmed 1998 film directed by Walter Salles, she offers a superbly realistic portrayal of an aging, embittered spinster named Dora, who earns money by writing letters for illiterate passers-by at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station. At the outset, she is a petty thief who takes the letters and decides with her friend Irene which ones to post if at all. Her dull world changes when Josué, the nine year-old son of a woman for whom Dora has written a letter, suddenly becomes orphaned when the woman is killed by a speeding bus. The letter was to be sent to Josué's father to reunite the family. Now his plight gradually becomes Dora's concern, and over the course of the film, her destiny.What Salles does with great dexterity is show the gradual closeness between Dora and Josué without resorting to any obvious sentimental plot devices, as neither is particularly sympathetic at the beginning and use their surly, obstinate personalities as protective shells. Even though this story has an overly familiar structure, Salles and screenwriters João Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein bring a heavy dose of neo-realism within the unfamiliar, non-tourist locales used. It's all reminiscent of Vittorio de Sica's and Roberto Rosellini's classic post-WWII work in Italy like The Bicycle Thief and Open City. With his later film, 2004's wonderful The Motorcycle Diaries and now slated to film Jack Keroauc's seminal On the Road, Salles is obviously becoming known as a master of the road movie, and it is easy to see why with this work. Helping considerably is the stunning cinematography of Walter Carvalho, who presents vividly inhabited tableaux with each new phase of the journey from the bustle of inner-city Rio to the open roads to the religious pilgrimage to the new shoebox-style settlement.But it is Montenegro who dominates the proceedings as she gradually develops a character who earns our sympathy economically and honestly as she makes every moment count. For example, as she senses herself becoming attracted to Cesar, the religious truck driver, she applies a stranger's lipstick with a quivering hesitation that is almost as heartbreaking as the realization she faces moments later that he has left for good. A real shoeshine boy picked by Salles, Vinícius de Oliveira plays Josué with equal economy and responds to Dora's actions with realism that alternates between touching and frustrating. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Marília Pêra amusingly ebullient as Irene and Othon Bastos compellingly conflicted as Cesar. The climax comes a bit out of left field with the introduction of new characters that provide some amount of closure to Josué's fate and wrap up many of the open plot threads, but the somewhat pat turn does not undermine the genuine strength of the film.The DVD provides a nice extra with Montenegro, Salles, and producer Arthur Cohn contributing invaluable audio commentary in English. Salles and Cohn talk about the sources of inspiration for the movie as well as the more technical aspects including the rigors of location shooting with masses of amateur actors and a minimum of art direction and constructed sets. Montenegro speaks less, but like her performance, makes all her comments resonate. It's interesting how variations of the film's basic plot have come up in recent years - for instance, Jan Sverák's 1996 Kolya from the Czech Republic and Takeshi Kitano's 2000 Kikujiro from Japan - and this one certainly holds up well as a prototype.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"17 May 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of those very rare movies in which every detail meshes. It's a whole piece. A comparison that comes most readily to mind is 'The Usual Suspects'.From the beautifully evocative orchestral music onwards, you just know you're about to witness something special. The camera-craft and lighting are at times quite sublime, the acting entirely believable. For those with a decent sound-system, one can almost feel the changes of ambiance. Take, for example, Clarice Starling's first encounter with Hannibal. A slight echo typical of the prison facility above ground, is lost as she descends into the catacomb-like dungeon of the most dangerous inmates. Now there is no resonance at all. Instead we have a thick, claustrophobic silence that is frighteningly intimate. This is a nerve-racking aural prelude to their first meeting at the other end of the chamber. It is wonderfully crafted. And because it serves our expectations so well, we take it for granted. For this reason, good quality sound-engineering is often overlooked.And so the movie goes on. Dr Lecter is standing in the middle of his cell. It's a strange, unnatural posture, as if momentarily paused from some action. But he just remains, quiet, still, fixedly watching. The exchanges between nervous Clarice and himself are amongst the classics of cinema. Jodie Foster is ideal with her nervous palpitation, but still driven by pride and ambition to achieve something, whilst Anthony Hopkins, playfully enigmatic, intelligent, and with a barely-restrained madness, sets her a perfect foil.The plot twists are numerous and clever. The discovery slow, slick and often shocking. The script is arch, witty, but still entirely believable, and delivered by a cast of actors who never put a foot wrong.Small town America is depicted as a sad failure. Properties are neglected. The people appear defeated. The lighting is always dull, with the colours washed-out. It's grim. The sun never seems to shine. The music is pensive and thoughtful. A great deal of attention went into describing emotion by light and sound, and once again we can easily take it for granted. But someone thought it all out, piece by piece.Fast forward to Buffalo Bill's lair. We meet the man himself at last. He is naked, obsessing over his pathological delusion. In the mirror he conceals his genitalia between his legs as metamorphosis into femininity. A different music is playing - heavy metal.Clarice has found him out. But he has descended into a sub-basement hell and she must follow and find him. Groping in absolute darkness amongst unimaginable ghastly relics of wickedness we see her at last from Bill's perspective. He has an image intensifier and can observe her every move.

You see, I got a copy of this Disney cartoon on DVD as part of the Walt Disney 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD series that showcases some of Disney's greatest animated films as it was said in some DVD booklets that came with the Disney DVDs themselves. You see, Beauty and the Beast is the very first Disney cartoon to use computer animation techniques, notably the backgrounds.Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and based on the well known fairy tale, it all begins in a peaceful village, and a young girl named Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) takes a stroll around, and at one point when she reads a book by a fountain, one of the sheep tears off a page and eats it. Later on, Belle's father, Maurice (voiced by Rex Everhart), shows her his latest invention that he will take it to a local fair. When he gets lost in the middle of the woods, Maurice escapes from a pack of wolves and ran into a castle complete with gargoyle statues and everything else.When Maurice says Hello? Hello? Is someone there?, he gets welcomed by a candelabrum named Lumiere (voiced by Jerry Orbach), a clock named Cogsworth (voiced by David Ogden Stiers), a teapot named Mrs. Potts (voiced by Angela Lansbury), and a teacup named Chip (voiced by Bradley Pierce). But just as Maurice was about to settle down for a cup of tea, he gets imprisoned by a hideous Beast (voiced by Hal Smith), who happens to be a handsome Prince (voiced by Robby Benson) under a magical curse, and a spoiled, selfish, and unkind one too. The result many years ago of a winter's night, an old woman came to the castle's entrance and offers Prince a rose, but Prince refuses and tells her to go away. The old woman then changed herself into a fairy, tells Prince that he had no love in his heart, and turns him into the monster of the same name. It's up to Belle to make Beast learn the true meaning of love just by angering him at a couple points, and such.Meanwhile, back at the village, Belle's macho fiancé, Gaston (voiced by Richard White), who is that much of a game hunter, makes several attempts to make Belle his wife, and thinks Maurice is a crazy old man when Maurice shouts, He's got her locked in a dungeon! A Beast! A horrible monstrous Beast! And that's not all. In just a couple moments later, towards the end of this Disney cartoon, Gaston wants to kill Beast, and have his head mounted on his wall...The supporting characters in there also include Philippe the Horse (also voiced by Hal Smith), Gaston's goofy looking sidekick, Lefou (voiced by Jesse Corti), a Wardrobe (voiced by Jo Anne Worley), and Monsieur D'Arque (voiced by Tony Jay). In Beauty and the Beast, the characters can be distinguishing just by judging by their personalities as well as their habits. For instance, Beast is a powerful character much like Stromboli from another Disney cartoon, Pinocchio, and Monsieur D'Arque is much like Coachman from Pinocchio as well.The songs wrote by composer Alan Menken are very catchy, including Be Our Guest, Gaston, The Mob Song, Human Again, and the most memorable, Beauty and the Beast. Everybody loves this Disney cartoon's humorous moments (Wardrobe landing on a villager for example, and a couple others to name a few), as well as touching scenes (at one point, for instance, before turning back into Prince's old self, Beast dies in Belle's arms before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls off) for many years to come just like the other Disney cartoons did.By the way. In the Disney cartoon\/video game Kingdom Hearts series, Belle, Beast (now voiced by Robby Benson since Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas and Belle's Magical World, even with a little help of some equipment and devices that they used in the 1996 film Ransom which starred Mel Gibson), Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Wardrobe, and Prince (appearing at the Kingdom Hearts II end credits) cope with Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy as Sora, Donald, and Goofy battle the Heartless, Nobodies, and the Orginization 13.

On the one hand it's a fast going action flick that is always on the movie and on the other hand it's a movie with a real muddled main plot that makes some odd choices with its characters and story elements.Here we have two tough convicts that escaped but are still friendly enough to save a little boy from being run over and they bring a man to the hospital who tried to shoot them but than got an heart attack in the process. There are some moralistic elements in the movie that seem highly out of place, especially when the main characters in the progress of the movie shoot around a lot without worrying too much about any innocent bystanders. It's such a ridicules contradicting contrast. it's just one of the story elements that makes Fled a pretty weak movie to watch.Also it's main plot line just never really seems to get off the ground. It's one of those stories you simply couldn't care less about and simply pay very little attention to it.Because of this also not all of the characters really work out in the movie. Actors such as Will Patton and Robert John Burke walk around in this movie but you can wonder why really. Their characters were potentially good ones but they simply got not used very well and only pop up once in a while, causing them to also make a pretty redundant impression.Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor and he really shows that in this movie. He gives away one fine performance, that alone still makes this movie still somewhat worthwhile. Stephen Baldwin is also not too bad in this movie and he forms a good duo with Fishburne.It's overall style also made the movie seem as if it was not to sure what it wanted to be. At times it showed the signs of a mismatched buddy comedy flick while at other times it was a pure violent action flick. So no, the movie also lacked a real clear consistent style, which also makes the viewer a bit uneasy on how to watch and approach the movie.It on the other hand is a fast going action in which basically always something is happening. No it's not always something good or interesting but at least it's not a slow or boring movie. It gives the movie definitely some watchable value. The action itself also isn't too bad and mostly consists out of shooting and a couple of chases.

The performances in Magnolia are its strongest and weakest points. For example, Tom Cruise really is awesome as the misogynistic Frank T.J. Mackey. John C. Reilly is amazing as the Christian cop and Melora Waters definitely holds her own in the scenes she shares with Reilly. However some of the other actors - actors known for their talent - are performing well beneath par. The scene where Jason Robards goes on about the difficulty of dying is not heart-wrenching at all. All I could think about during the scene was William Shatner as Captain Kirk screaming, The pain! The pain! The pain! Many people find Julianne Moore's performance one of Magnolia's saving graces. I beg to differ. Her performance was contrived, calculated, and just way over the top. When she is visiting the lawyer and starts going on about her illicit affairs and says, i sucked other men's c****, I honestly laughed out loud! The riveting scene in the drugstore too, provides Moore with another opportunity to leap off the over-acting ledge. Her bad performance is surprising to me because I think she is a great actress and the Magnolia role is not that different from her Boogie Nights role. She played the part of a drug addict in 'Boogie Nights beautifully and with complete understand of an addict's frame of mind. It appears though, that playing the part of a guilt-ridden, loaded, gold-digger just doesn't work for her.

From this opaque, grisly discovery we fade into the gritty streets of New York, the underbelly of the underbelly, a place where gay men go to eke out their frustration by donning a uniform of leather and chains, police uniforms and mirrored shades; a dangerous place where lust can get the better of you. The world that director William Friedkin creates here is an ever-contrasting one. We weave between the everyday, of meaningless sex and paper-work, diverging into the polite society of Greenwich Village and its bubbling gay community, before finally converging in hell; into the deepest pits of violence, aggression and degradation. This is a film that hides, much like its central character, behind a mask; behind false identities and confused emotions. Within the mire of homosexuality we find the beacon of light, our protagonist Steve Burns, an inexperienced detective willing to do anything for the respect of his captain. Thus begins an odyssey that will take Steve deep into these three contrasting worlds in a search of a serial killer not unlike himself.Here Friedkin pushes his themes of sex and death, identity and false identity to their extremes, predating, as many others have said, the horror of the AIDS epidemic and the metaphorical 'gay-killer'. The subtext is overflowing with ideas, some complimentary, others simply confrontational. Friedkin's notion of a gay killer, manifested as a tortured young grad-student, whose complex relationship with his late-father masks a troubled childhood - one that in never fully explained - became THE controversial talking point of the decade. Pickets were elected, voices heard, even the cast have since turned their backs to the film, with Pacino's discomfort clearly evident in his tortured performance herein. Richard Heffner, head of the MPAA ratings board even declared that there weren't enough X's in the alphabet to rate the damn thing. The resulting cuts, apparently clocking in at around 40 minutes worth of exorcised footage, have only made a confused film all the more confusing; with Pacino's character going from clean-cut cop to implied homo-slasher in the time it would take most mainstream films to reach a neatly-formed dénouement. Friedkin has confirmed that the cut scenes would have prolonged Burns' journey into the underworld, giving greater insight into the relationship between himself and his father, and his apparent similarities to the actual killer. Also thrown into the mix would have been a graphic fisting scene (part of which still exists in the 100-minute cut) and the sight of Burns participating in a golden shower. Singing in the rain this ain't! Also gone from the version screened by Britain's Film-Four are the hard-core subliminal images that Friedkin cut into the more graphic scenes, including a brief glimpse of anal-penetration inserted into the first knife attack.With such a degree of censorship, the film is understandably hard to rate. What we are left with is a stale, confused, possibly offensive detective story, with some odd touches of genius permeating through the left over nuggets (those left un-touched by the censors and the studio that is). However, it is my belief that, if released in some kind of restored director's cut, Friedkin's dark vision would be so much more. A two-hour-plus epic of dehumanisation that would not only scratch the surface - and believe me this truncated version does just that - but would get right under the viewer's skin. In the remains we have left, Friedkin creates some lasting images. The use of sound in the opening scenes, completely lacking any sort background action, gives the film a dreamlike feeling of floating, just as the raucous chanting and rockabilly chic of the S&M scenes creates a feeling of savage debauchery and indiscriminate abandon. The murder scenes are also highly impressive. Sadistic, yes; and sometimes bordering on exploitation, as knives are thrust into sweaty, muscular flesh, which begs the question; is this is what they left in imagine what they took out?With Cruising, we have the basis for a great film. Direction is strong, with a good use of documentary realism; performances are believable, with fine support from Paul Sorvino as captain Edelson and Karen Allen as Pacino's girlfriend and yes, despite the seeming ambivalence he's shown towards the film in recent years, Pacino too gives a fine performance as our confused protagonist Burns. However, despite this, the film - as a result of the missing footage - is a bit of a mess. Still, there are some interesting ideas half-developed, and we can only assume that the full director's cut would clear up that ending, give us more information on the murder of the writer and the disappearance of his lover and any information as to the inclusion of the jock-strap wearing cop would be very welcome indeed. The final shot hints at mental breakdown, as we fade back to that grey and dreary harbour; what will be discovered there? Is this a circular narrative unfolding in flashback? Is Burns a killer? All these questions need answering; in a film as controversial as this, understatement is not a virtue.

Direction is strong, with a good use of documentary realism; performances are believable, with fine support from Paul Sorvino as captain Edelson and Karen Allen as Pacino's girlfriend and yes, despite the seeming ambivalence he's shown towards the film in recent years, Pacino too gives a fine performance as our confused protagonist Burns. However, despite this, the film - as a result of the missing footage - is a bit of a mess. Still, there are some interesting ideas half-developed, and we can only assume that the full director's cut would clear up that ending, give us more information on the murder of the writer and the disappearance of his lover and any information as to the inclusion of the jock-strap wearing cop would be very welcome indeed. The final shot hints at mental breakdown, as we fade back to that grey and dreary harbour; what will be discovered there? Is this a circular narrative unfolding in flashback? Is Burns a killer? All these questions need answering; in a film as controversial as this, understatement is not a virtue.

While Batman is mostly one man show (Jack Nicholson) coupled with capable direction of Burton; this one full field my every expectation and I think it is even better then the first and holds a nominee for best Batman movie ever made. Let me tell you why...Batman Returns has a great story and every character is elaborated to tiny details. Batman's enemies are Penguin and Catwoman and by entrance of new and interesting characters Batman Returns gained only pluses. Here, I must say that all the cast done their job with no stains. Michael Keaton had tougher role then in first one and he passed the test. As always Batman movies is as good as the villain is. Danny DeVito in role of Penguin is amazing, just like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman who had acting transformation from boring secretary to a deadly Batman opponent and love. If only makers of the Catwoman and Halle Berry watched what real Catwoman should be, maybe they wouldn't make one of the worst movies ever. To round this excellent casting I will mention Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Classic staff and here Walken is memorable.But what movie would Batman be without dark genius, and my favorite director, Tim Burton. Burton created Gotham city that none of the directors after managed to copy (we've all witnessed on how low branches Schumacher took it and how Nolan tried to raise it from dead with success). So dark, creepy and atmospheric. He plays with light in scene where Walken decides to get rid off Pfeiffer, he creates mean Penguin with classic Burton bright side (benneath all he's a good person that is always abandoned from people). There he reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, another Burton's 'child'. So till now you've realized that I like this movie, cause it's a comic brought to life thanks to Tim Burton and his never ending creativity. He managed to round the picture with no holes and if you don't understand Burton's work then you probably won't be able to enjoy in this Batman fully. Cause this one has Burton signature all over it and now it's official that Batman returned with style.

Nick (Dylan McDermott) grew up in a dysfunctional family and, consequently, wears no rose colored glasses to look upon life and romance. There is one common denominator between the two of them, they both loved a Brady Bunch type show called One Big Happy Family when they were young. The child star of the show, Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker), grew up to be a troubled adult, with drug problems, who now lives on investments that were made for her during her young acting days. Thus, she owns a beautiful old apartment building in Los Angeles, which once housed Louise Brooks, and where Gwen now resides, that she is selling for big bucks. The plan is to raze the building and erect something new. As luck would have it, Nick is the architect of the project and Francesca likes what she sees and the two start a sexually-charged thing. The luck continues when Gwen, an author, is assigned to ghost write Francesca's autobiography. Thus, the two of them have connections to Francesca, a happening to add to the string of chance meetings and near misses between Nick and Gwen throughout their lives. As Gwen fights for her beloved building, Nick has second thoughts about his role in its destruction and Francesca remains a petulant, mostly unlovable eccentric, how will the film play out? This is a sweet story with attractive, talented performers but its pace is so slow that some viewers may turn it off. Certainly, Tripplehorn, McDermott, and Parker give nice performances, especially Parker, who makes a believable, mixed-up child star all grown up. Then, too, the L.A. scenery, costumes, and amenities are fine indeed. But, the script, which contains many good ideas and themes, moves along very slowly and the direction is far from snappy as well.

At least the performances are first rate without all the overlapping dialog that one had to endure in GOSFORD PARK, but the satire is laid on pretty thick even after the brutal accidental murder scene.TIM ROBBINS plays a Hollywood producer who is unable to shake off the persistence of an aspiring writer without resorting to killing him in a moment of desperation and anger. He gets control of himself thereafter and is able to play innocent, especially after a line-up of suspects including him fails to produce a witness who could identify him as being near the scene of the crime.The biggest in-joke of all is Altman's decision to have a marathon lineup of stars on the sidelines, popping up at every other moment when least suspected, and often with no more than a few seconds of screen time. The film within a film (a sub-plot bearing resemblance to the real film plot) is cleverly used to provide a neat finish to the tale. And in doing so, it utilizes (very briefly) the services of stars like SUSAN SARANDON, PETER FALK, JULIA ROBERTS and BRUCE WILLIS.GRETA SCACCHI, PETER GALLAGHER and DEAN STOCKWELL do well in the most prominent supporting roles but it's TIM ROBBINS who owns the spotlight throughout and he's excellent as the conflicted man who commits a crime and gets away with it in a Hollywood film colony that has no conscience.WHOOPI GOLDBERG's role as Detective Susan Avery is unforgivably coarse and totally unbelievable as a woman whose professional conduct borders on burlesque.

The movie has a nice feel to it (at first), with the family moving to the country, and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. It starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing.Louis (Dale Midkoff), his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), their kids Ellie and Gage, and their cat move to a new home in Maine. They are warned by the loony farmer neighbor Jud (Fred Gwyne) about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed. Louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed. He bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life, constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone. One day, infant Gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck, and Louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery. When Gage comes back to life, he is changed and wants to murder.With many of Stephen King's works that don't translate well into films, I blame the directors and screenwriters. In this case, Mr. King was the screenwriter, but I'm going to blame him for his awful story. By the end it's so pointless, and though unfunny, the premise is laughable.

I know this isn't set in reality but seriously, how stupid can this get? The scene where Louis injects his deceased, now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad, because the cat did not deserve this. All it did was go around minding it's own business and he killed it. The scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable. Not unbearably sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think of. After being injected Gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead....why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant?

Not unbearably sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think of. After being injected Gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead....why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant? But...even worse, the actual ending of them film involving Louis burying someone else (Not going to give away who) in the cemetery after Gage kills them....what did he expect? Why did Mr. King write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie? It's depressing and pointless!My rating * out of ****. 90 mins. R for violence.

Some movies, by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through...here you just feel depressed. The movie has a nice feel to it (at first), with the family moving to the country, and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. It starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing.Louis (Dale Midkoff), his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), their kids Ellie and Gage, and their cat move to a new home in Maine. They are warned by the loony farmer neighbor Jud (Fred Gwyne) about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed. Louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed. He bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life, constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone. One day, infant Gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck, and Louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery. When Gage comes back to life, he is changed and wants to murder.With many of Stephen King's works that don't translate well into films, I blame the directors and screenwriters. In this case, Mr. King was the screenwriter, but I'm going to blame him for his awful story. By the end it's so pointless, and though unfunny, the premise is laughable. A little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel, and not only that, but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case, carry a body from the ground to the attic!(?) I know this isn't set in reality but seriously, how stupid can this get?
