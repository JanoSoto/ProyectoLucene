There doesn't seem to be any middle ground. It could have benefited from some minor editing to help with the pacing, but I love the dialogue and characters so I can forgive this flaw.Parker and Longbaugh are drifters and petty crooks, although they appear to have served in the military as judged from their training. While donating sperm for money, they overhear a doctor gossiping about a woman who is being paid $1 million to carry a wealthy couple's child to term. They quickly hatch a very poorly thought out plan to kidnap her and hold her for ransom.The attempted kidnapping is ultimately successful only because the woman is trying to get away from the icy bodyguards who escort her everywhere she goes. After taking her, Parker and Longbaugh encounter one unforeseen complication after another. The wealthy patron who is the father of the unborn child brings in a bag man to adjudicate the entire situation, and Parker and Longbaugh are hamstrung by their own incompetence.This is a talking heads movie punctuated by a few brief action scenes, and luckily it is populated by a great cast. Benicio del Toro and Ryan Phillipe are very good in this film, which is half of a surprise. Who knew that Phillipe had the range to pull this off? Juliette Lewis is, well, Juliette Lewis, as she sympathetically portray's Robin. James Caan nearly steals the movie as Joe Sarno, the bag man. There are a lot of great character actors at work, in fact there are too many to name. The dialogue is occasionally over written and writer \/ director Chris McQuarrie over indulges himself in the way these scenes play out. That said, there are a lot of beautifully crafted scenes in the film. The plot is really about the various family relationships that are slowly being revealed, and culminates with a surprising revelation about Joe Sarno's connection to Robin.I love the metaphor used during the game of hearts speech, as well as the compassion that the two kidnappers show for their hostage. I love that the bodyguards are plotting against their boss in his own kitchen, while his scheming wife eavesdrops. Joe Kraemer delivers a beautiful orchestral score, and I particularly enjoyed the music which accompanied the ultrasound viewing. The piece of music which accompanied Sarno's receipt of the money was the other highlight in the film. One reviewer asked why the score was so prominent here I will opine that it's because the scene sets up the final act wherein the characters' fates will be decided.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Sarah Silverman's hilarious and profane diatribe during the opening scene, which leads to a fight where Parker and Longbaugh are left bleeding on the ground. It's an image that bookends the film. I will also compliment McQuarrie on the fantastic weapons handling from all of the actors. Apparently his brother is a Navy SEAL, and he trained all of the actors. That man should become a full time technical adviser. We see Parker and Longbaugh use a perfectly executed bounding overwatch to break contact and escape the first failed kidnapping attempt, as well as outstanding room clearing skills and even a 'rolling T' when they sweep through the brothel. They also perform tactical reloads, weak hand magazine exchanges, and immediate action drills like complete pros. Very, VERY few films display this degree of technical accuracy, so for me it's noteworthy.If you enjoy hard boiled dialogue and gritty realism, and you can enjoy a relationship based drama, then you probably already love 'The Way of the Gun.' It's a shame that it wasn't more commercially successful, because I'd love to see McQuarrie make another film like this.

A score that's at times frenetic, and others haunting and totally unforgettable. Director\/co-writer Aronofsky does an incredible job of telling the story by use of multiple camera tricks and symbolism that serve a purpose. Nicely photographed.

'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works.Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints).Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire.John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling.Two scenes stand out for me.

'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works.Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints).Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire.John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling.Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm.

Bryan Singer's second film, from an Oscar winning script by Christopher McQuarrie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It's topped off by a fantastic score by John Ottman (I agree with the many other posters who said that it was one of the best scores of the 90s).For a film with so many disparate characters, it all comes together beautifully, a credit to both the actors and the film makers. Five career criminals are brought together in a police lineup in New York City, apparently so that a man one of them robbed at gunpoint can identify the perpetrator. In the holding cell afterward, they decide to work together.The film is (unreliably) narrated by Roger 'Verbal' Kint, played in an Oscar winning turn by Kevin Spacey. Not only is his character well fleshed out, but Spacey makes an inveterate liar and con man into a sympathetic figure. Gabriel Byrne, playing a disgraced former cop named Keaton, deserves equal praise for his pitch perfect delivery of every line of dialogue he utters. All of the characters have a life and a back story, even Fenster (a then unknown Benicio Del Toro). His bizarre and inspired performance allows him to make the most of his limited screen time. Comedian Kevin Pollock is a thief with a Napoleon complex, who butts heads with fellow tough guy McManus (Stephen, the most obscure of the Baldwins).The script concerns these five men being blackmailed into taking down an ocean liner allegedly carrying $91 million in cocaine, which is guarded by dozens of heavily armed men. What separates this from other crime thrillers is the shadowy presence of the never seen Keyser Soze, an almost supernatural Turkish crime lord. He is represented by an Asian \/ English attorney 'named' Mr. Kobayashi, who forces the five anti-heroes into this nearly impossible crime. Pete Postelthwaite (sp?) injects icy politeness and fascinating mannerisms into the role.What I love most about this film, aside from the brilliant build-up and off kilter dialogue, are the little moments that Singer gives to the actors. Its when the film breathes that it is at its strongest. For instance, the scene outside the police precinct where Keaton looks at each of his future partners in crime as he hugs his girlfriend Edie, or the moment in his apartment when he looks down at her from the balcony before leaving for L.A. My favorite is the image of Keaton's reflection outside the conference room where Kobayashi meets with Edie (a lovely and unknown Suzy Amis), and second to that is the moment in the van where the criminals discuss the near impossibility of taking down the ocean liner. The use of music and sound in each scene is perfect.The reveal of Kint's true nature has been often imitated, but in this film it is not a mere gotcha moment as Roger Ebert seemed to think it was in his review. The entire film led to that moment. The Customs agent arrogantly stated that he was smarter than Kint and could get the truth out of him, goading him into constructing the elaborate fantasy. And as Kint himself said early on in the film, he talks too much. Ottman's editing is a crescendo which gives the final revelation all of the impact it deserves.It's up to the viewer to decide whether Keyser Soze is real, or a mere story, but it's a fascinating question to leave to the viewer. This is a rare case of everything coming together just right in a low budget film. Singer makes the most out of a small budget and delivers both great action and great character moments. Newton Thomas Sigel's stunning lighting and camera work make the film look better than any Hollywood blockbuster that came out in the same time frame, a tribute to what an independent film can accomplish with the right craftsmen.As I said earlier, this is a masterpiece.

Like its predecessor, Help! features the band members playing themselves in a fictional story, and was directed by Richard Lester, but this time, instead of exaggerating the band's real lives at the height of Beatlemania, the band was put into a James Bond spoof. This all happened more than twenty years before I was born, but I clearly remember seeing both films in the late nineties, when I was around eleven years old. After watching the first of the two again in 2007 and this year, I finally watched this follow-up again, for the first time in over a decade. It turns out that I still think both efforts are good.A certain Asian cult believes in a goddess named Kaili, and believes in sacrificing people to her. A woman in this cult is about to be sacrificed when it is discovered that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Beatles drummer Ringo Starr happens to be the one who is currently wearing this ring, so several members of the cult go to London so they can retrieve it! However, all their attempts to get it off of Ringo's finger fail, and the world-famous drummer eventually learns that if he doesn't get the ring off soon, he will be the cult's next sacrifice! Obviously, he now wants to get rid of the ring, but no matter what anybody does, they cannot get it off! It doesn't help when after they get a mad scientist named Foot and his assistant, Algernon to try and remove the ring and the two of them fail, Foot decides he wants it for himself! All this trouble sends the Beatles on a wild adventure, taking them out of England and to different parts of the world, with cult members and the two mad scientists pursuing them! John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr all did a very good job portraying themselves in a comical manner in A Hard Day's Night, and fortunately, they hadn't lost any steam by the time they starred in this follow-up. The quality of this 1965 comedy is definitely helped by their performances, and there are other cast highlights as well, such as Leo McKern as Clang, the cult leader. As the Fab Four make their first appearance in the film, going into their separate sections of their flat as two women on the street watch and talk about them, the humour looks promising, and then there are lots of funny moments as we watch them inside. The film may soon go downhill a little, as the writing and humour sometimes show that they could have been better, but there certainly are more good laughs. There's some good humorous dialogue in Help!, even if it doesn't get as funny here as it does in A Hard Day's Night. This second Beatles film is more about slapstick than the first, but this usually works here. The plot of this movie also impressed me, and the adventure takes the band members to some nice locations, such as the Austrian Alps. Like its predecessor, this film also features a good bunch of Beatles tunes to add to the entertainment.A Hard Day's Night and Help! were apparently both successful back when they were originally released in the 60's, but it appears that today, the former is more popular. Personally, I'm not 100% sure which one I think is better. In my opinion, maybe the 1964 release is just a bit better as a comedy than this follow-up is, but both of them are entertaining for the most part. Also, as a film that parodies James Bond, Help! is much better than certain other films that do the same, including the spoof version of Casino Royale, which was released within the next couple years after this second film starring the Beatles. I haven't seen every single Bond spoof, but of the ones I have seen, some are funny and some not some much, and this one is basically one of the former. I would say it's also better than Thunderball, the Bond film which came out the same year. If you're a Beatles fan and want to hear some of their songs with some wacky humour and adventure to go with them, this 1965 comedy is probably a good movie for you to check out, even if you find that it's inferior to the Fab Four's film debut.

This second Beatles film is more about slapstick than the first, but this usually works here. The plot of this movie also impressed me, and the adventure takes the band members to some nice locations, such as the Austrian Alps. Like its predecessor, this film also features a good bunch of Beatles tunes to add to the entertainment.A Hard Day's Night and Help! were apparently both successful back when they were originally released in the 60's, but it appears that today, the former is more popular. Personally, I'm not 100% sure which one I think is better. In my opinion, maybe the 1964 release is just a bit better as a comedy than this follow-up is, but both of them are entertaining for the most part. Also, as a film that parodies James Bond, Help! is much better than certain other films that do the same, including the spoof version of Casino Royale, which was released within the next couple years after this second film starring the Beatles. I haven't seen every single Bond spoof, but of the ones I have seen, some are funny and some not some much, and this one is basically one of the former. I would say it's also better than Thunderball, the Bond film which came out the same year. If you're a Beatles fan and want to hear some of their songs with some wacky humour and adventure to go with them, this 1965 comedy is probably a good movie for you to check out, even if you find that it's inferior to the Fab Four's film debut.

Like its predecessor, Help! features the band members playing themselves in a fictional story, and was directed by Richard Lester, but this time, instead of exaggerating the band's real lives at the height of Beatlemania, the band was put into a James Bond spoof. This all happened more than twenty years before I was born, but I clearly remember seeing both films in the late nineties, when I was around eleven years old. After watching the first of the two again in 2007 and this year, I finally watched this follow-up again, for the first time in over a decade. It turns out that I still think both efforts are good.A certain Asian cult believes in a goddess named Kaili, and believes in sacrificing people to her. A woman in this cult is about to be sacrificed when it is discovered that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Beatles drummer Ringo Starr happens to be the one who is currently wearing this ring, so several members of the cult go to London so they can retrieve it! However, all their attempts to get it off of Ringo's finger fail, and the world-famous drummer eventually learns that if he doesn't get the ring off soon, he will be the cult's next sacrifice! Obviously, he now wants to get rid of the ring, but no matter what anybody does, they cannot get it off! It doesn't help when after they get a mad scientist named Foot and his assistant, Algernon to try and remove the ring and the two of them fail, Foot decides he wants it for himself! All this trouble sends the Beatles on a wild adventure, taking them out of England and to different parts of the world, with cult members and the two mad scientists pursuing them! John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr all did a very good job portraying themselves in a comical manner in A Hard Day's Night, and fortunately, they hadn't lost any steam by the time they starred in this follow-up. The quality of this 1965 comedy is definitely helped by their performances, and there are other cast highlights as well, such as Leo McKern as Clang, the cult leader. As the Fab Four make their first appearance in the film, going into their separate sections of their flat as two women on the street watch and talk about them, the humour looks promising, and then there are lots of funny moments as we watch them inside. The film may soon go downhill a little, as the writing and humour sometimes show that they could have been better, but there certainly are more good laughs. There's some good humorous dialogue in Help!, even if it doesn't get as funny here as it does in A Hard Day's Night.

There are too many story lines going on with no clear direction or focus to it. It is a crude mishmash of story lines, all of which are equally uninteresting. School Daze is Spike Lee's second feature film. It is set at the fictional black college Mission University where there are two opposing groups of students who can't accept the differences between each other. Laurence Fishburne plays an unpopular student who opposes pledging to fraternities in a school where that kind of thing is the social norm. The most prestigious of these fraternities is the Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity which Spike Lee's character, Half Pint, is trying to become a part of. There are many other story lines about other underdeveloped characters, but in the end I got no entertainment out of a single one so they are hardly worth noting or remembering.School Daze is a poorly stirred mixture of genres that confuses more than entertains. It is dominated by aspects of drama with some unfunny comedy mixed in. The jokes for the most part aren't even amusing and the drama is useless and uninteresting. Oh yeah and it's also a musical. I knew almost nothing about this film going into other than the fact that it was a Spike Lee film, so I engaged in some hefty head scratching when the first musical number kicked in about 25 minutes into the film, which should be a big no no in the musical genre. School Daze is the only musical I can think of that doesn't open with a big production number. However, what songs there are in this film are sparse and unmemorable. All the dance numbers seem awkward and every song feels out of place. I think this film could have done slightly better if the musical aspect had been dropped completely. The songs appear at the most random and scattered moments of the film and contribute nothing to the film, story wise or artistically.Honestly, School Daze is a pretty boring film. Nothing much happens and scene after scene makes the film as a whole feel more pointless and misguided. I felt like I was accomplishing nothing by watching this film, which can be OK as long as the film has some entertainment value, which School Daze has none of.

Maybe I missed some of the more important aspects of the film amidst my boredom, but it was hard to stay mildly interested in these mediocre characters and dull story lines.Overall I can respect Spike Lee for trying to make an important and relevant film, but the execution of his idea went horribly wrong. I couldn't get into this movie at all. There was nothing interesting about School Daze. It was a jumbled mess of story lines and characters that had little motivation or development. There were times when a certain character that we hadn't spent any time previously developing would all of the sudden pop up and be important.

It is dominated by aspects of drama with some unfunny comedy mixed in. The jokes for the most part aren't even amusing and the drama is useless and uninteresting. Oh yeah and it's also a musical. I knew almost nothing about this film going into other than the fact that it was a Spike Lee film, so I engaged in some hefty head scratching when the first musical number kicked in about 25 minutes into the film, which should be a big no no in the musical genre. School Daze is the only musical I can think of that doesn't open with a big production number. However, what songs there are in this film are sparse and unmemorable. All the dance numbers seem awkward and every song feels out of place. I think this film could have done slightly better if the musical aspect had been dropped completely. The songs appear at the most random and scattered moments of the film and contribute nothing to the film, story wise or artistically.Honestly, School Daze is a pretty boring film. Nothing much happens and scene after scene makes the film as a whole feel more pointless and misguided. I felt like I was accomplishing nothing by watching this film, which can be OK as long as the film has some entertainment value, which School Daze has none of. The film supposedly has a deep seated and heartfelt message about African American relations, but I didn't feel this at all until the cheesy and abrupt ending of the film where I once again proceeded to scratch my head in confusion. Maybe I missed some of the more important aspects of the film amidst my boredom, but it was hard to stay mildly interested in these mediocre characters and dull story lines.Overall I can respect Spike Lee for trying to make an important and relevant film, but the execution of his idea went horribly wrong. I couldn't get into this movie at all. There was nothing interesting about School Daze. It was a jumbled mess of story lines and characters that had little motivation or development. There were times when a certain character that we hadn't spent any time previously developing would all of the sudden pop up and be important. But really everything towards the end of this film didn't resonate with me in any way because I was already fed up with the movie and wanted nothing more than for it to end. I truly wanted to enjoy this film, but it was just impossible. School Daze was a major disappointment.

Well, outside of it, to be more precise. He goes over the side of the roof. An FBI agent is sent in to investigate, and discover if it was a murder or suicide. We will find out before it ends, but it really isn't the focus(and don't expect a thriller, it isn't and never tries to be). This is not for everyone, and I won't claim I understood everything about it; I will explain what I did get. It holds a look at the losers in this environment, the freaks. Sociology and the current state of relationships are important aspects of this. This is the only thing by Wenders that I've watched, and I don't know if this is a typical example of his work or not. Some have pointed out that there is no subtlety to the portrayal of the mentally ill(who all stay in this one dump as they cannot afford medical insurance), and one could call the characters irritating. They are strange, and this doesn't shy away from that or downplay it. There are those that will hate it just for that. We have one who thinks he's in The Beatles(without it being acknowledged officially), and I suppose you either love or hate Tom. He's the happiest person in this, very naive, and he gets a huge crush on Eloise(something I can certainly sympathize with, as I got this purely for Milla, and she is cute in this in a role with not much dialog), and their romance is pretty impossible to resist, for its realism and how incredibly heartfelt it is(this film *really* gets to you). And the first thing we see is him leaping from the hotel, and the rest of this is narrated by him, in retrospect. Gibson's performance is deadpan or tongue in cheek. He's one of the names in this. They tend to give great acting performances. The style very effectively builds an atmosphere; not everyone will enjoy it. This was thought up by Bono, and U2 do songs for it. There is a little sexuality, disturbing content and strong language in this. The DVD comes with two sets of good interviews, about the cast(with a running time of 27 and a half minutes) and the movie itself(14 minutes long), and a trailer. I recommend this to those open to a slightly different kind of picture, and a sad and genuine lovestory. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 December 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In a dirty, cheap urban hotel, a man dies.
