I am going to be completely honest and say those who say that are clearly missing the point.Scarface is a great film, and one I revisit often because if you take away the reputation it's received since it was released(with rappers and just the related) it truly is a well made movie with some of the best acting in the genre. But I do believe it is necessary to address the aforementioned most common criticism. First of all, the violence in the film(and indeed, the three main shootouts are some of the finest in the decade) is not completely over the top and unreal as some believe because though it is exaggerated slightly, you got to remember gangsters kill people. And people who try to get them are killed often. The movie is gratuitously violent because the characters and their personalities are gratuitously violent. What do you want them to do, pretend this doesn't happen? This is a movie like The Godfather that is honest about who and what it is discussing. But while The Godfather was about a family, and how a family in the wrong business can affect the sensibilities and lives of both the family members and the people who are victims of their bloody business, Scarface is about what happens to a person when nothing matters to them anymore except immediate satisfaction of their deepest, and often darkest desires. Al Pacino's performance in the film is over the top yes, but the character he is portraying can be nothing but over the top because he has no substance in him to be subtle or even fairly human for that matter, and because of that the film contains a classic Pacino performance.The film also hints that perhaps Tony Montana himself isn't totally happy or engaged in what he is doing. The famous scene when he inhales the cocaine face first in the prelude to the finale, shows in a strange way, just how he realizes he ruined his life up to that point. There is nothing left for him at that point. There are scenes when elements of humanity come through though, but it's coming through a man who is a complete and utter louse at this point, and so everything is more extreme than a normal person would have dealt with it.For example, his attempts to protect his sister from losing her virginity by beating any man who makes the attempt, shows how he wants her to be with a good person and be happy, but coming through the disgruntled mind of Tony Montana he deals with it in the only way he knows how through violence.He also still has certain reservations about himself. He won't kill children for example when a certain kind of mission is presented to him in the film, and he attempts to heal the wounds of his mother after all these years of him being a gangster even if in the way he does comes across as crass and perhaps desperate(even though the visage he adopts is of carelessness). But again that's the only way he knows how to act at this point. You see, Pacino's performance is so good that even though a fair amount of this is only hinted at(though some of it is pretty direct I think) you can see it in his face and hear it in his voice, which is so extravagant it's almost as if he's trying to prove something.The other characters in the film are all there to support Montana, but they are all quite memorable. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gina Montana is chilling in the role of a normal young woman being abused mentally by her over protective brother, and starts to lose it herself later on. Steven Bauer who plays Manny, isn't a particularly well developed character, but that's because he exists more to help develop the other characters and in that regard Bauer does a fine job. And of course who could forget the beautiful and talented Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira, who in her own way is just as flawed and miserable as Montana, but rather then exploding into drug dealing and violence she implodes in a sense to where nothing she says is exactly what she thinks, and almost seems to feel there's no point to her existence. But it's not only the actors that are important to Scarface. Brian De Palma's fantastic directing showcases each character in memorable fashion and all the faster paced sections are handled well too. And of course Oliver Stone's 4 letter word laden script is vulgar and foul, but memorable and effective providing many classic lines, but I do also want to point out the great soundtrack, put together and composed(partially) by Giorgio Moroder. Sure it's full on 80's synthesized new wave esquire music, but it fits the mood surprisingly well and is fun to listen to with the movie. And the haunting melody at the very end of the movie sums it all up perfectly.I have probably gone on too long, but I wanted to wash away any misconceptions people who perhaps are not sure they want to see the movie either because of it's obnoxious pop culture references and relations or because of common criticisms. I won't say it's the best in the genre(in fact there are many that are better and a tad more focused on story) but certainly manages to blend entertainment(because the story itself is intriguing, and the film is just fun to watch) and message together effectively without over doing either. If you like your mafia movie dark, gritty, realistic, honest and meaningful, then you could do a lot worse than choose Scarface. Check it out.

Luckily, Steven Spielberg saw the film and enjoyed it, subsequently lending Dante a producing hand on Gremlins and offering him the chance to direct a segment of the Twilight Zone movie. All that for good reasons perfect it may not be, but Piranha is a lot of fun.Instead of the ocean, Piranha situates its action on the shores of a lake, where insurance investigator Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) is sent to find two missing teenagers (no prizes for guessing what happened to them). With the help of a local drunk (Bradford Dillman) she finds an abandoned compound, and through her encounter with a scientists Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) and Dr. Mengers (Barbara Steele), she uncovers the location's terrible secret the military was engineering a particularly lethal strain of piranha to use in Vietnam (!), but the project was shut down. However, the fish are still there, and they have found their way to the lake...Being a Roger Corman production, Piranha was obviously made more on the cheap compared to Jaws, but it does boast a certain ambition, thanks to John Sayles' script, filled with anti-militaristic subtext, and Pino Donaggio's score, showcasing the knack for suspense he went on to develop with Brian De Palma. As for the visual and practical effects, they suffer the most from the low budget, which explains the wise decision to leave the piranha unseen most of the time, using (slightly campy) sound effects to produce thrills, although the cheap-looking creatures sort of fit the film's overall irreverent tone.As far as the acting is concerned, it embodies another Corman staple not much to write home about, with cardboard characters played by relatively unknown actors, with the major exceptions of Dillman, who specifically asked to have his role properly developed, and Steele, evidently happy to help out another first-time director after her deranged performance in David Cronenberg's Shivers. That said, McKeown isn't too bad either, although most people are more likely to remember her for one specific scene that doesn't require that much acting talent.So yes, this is a pretty cheap knock-off of a much superior film, and even by Dante's standards the effort comes off as sub-par at times.

Within the first ten minutes, weaved in with incredible cinematography, we are already weeping for the character. For the whole 93 minutes, we get to experience an almost heart breaking plot, portraying the cruel attitude of close-knit, isolated American villages to outsiders. What begins as a simple, though awkward encounter between Rambo and a police chief, ends as a private war of emotions and personal grudges. Although this is upsetting, as the majority of audiences will side with Rambo, it's also disturbingly great fun to watch, with the well crafted dialogue and suspense. Watching Rambo execute his survival techniques is exciting, and educational. Sort of an every-boys-dream thing. Amongst all of this &#x96; there is more! Rambo's experiences in Vietnam come back to haunt him, further causing us to understand his situation and sympathise with him, and hating the police forces.

One thing that surprised me is the relative one-dimensionality of the characters, especially when compared to Toy Story 2, which has been my mental standard for the characters for many years, and Toy Story 3.

A great, great many things. It's one of those movies that grips you by the head and forces you to pay attention regardless of whether you hate it or love it. And I think people will hate or love it for the exact same reasons. But the one question that I think gets asked the most about Amelie is how can a movie be so unpredictably erratic, so slaphappy in its motives, and so over-the-top and yet all the same time by a brilliant, mind-tickling masterpiece? The answer I think is that it knows what it's doing.Amelie is the story of a young, goodhearted French girl and her adventures in modern-day society. I am almost tempted to say misadventures but I won't because Amelie, like the filmmakers, is aware of what she's doing and is aware of all that goes around her. She is fascinated by a great many things, but the one thing that fascniates her most is love and sex. She fantasizes about others' sex lives but does not have a genuine one of her own. As she helps others with their lives through her own creative and fresh ways, she becomes transfixed with a young man (Mathieu Kassovitz) and begins to work her whismical tricks to help him and help herself.Right from the start, one is given the clear message from the director that you are in for two hours of bizarre twists, turns, images, and sequences. So if the opening image compels you to leave, you might as well do so. If it holds your attention despite its awkwardness, sit down and enjoy the show. Yes, it is a vastly over-the-top film. Even when you can get a fairly good idea of what the end result of a scene will be (which is seldom here) the final result nevertheless gives you a shocking sensation. Even if I were to give you a synopsis of the entire film and told you exactly what to expect - even if you believed me - seeing it for yourself would still surprise you.But even though it is sporadic, sometimes preposterous, overly silly, and more free-living than any film I've seen in a long, long time, Amelie never fails to lose your attention and bring a charmed or amused smile to your face. Watching it is like conusming a bizarre foreign dish. It is unusual and perhaps not one you'd want to be caught eating by your friends, but in your own moments of privacy, you want to scarf it all down. There are lots of jokes in the movie and they are hilarious. The protagonist Amelie, played with great enthusiasm by Audrey Tatou, becomes a lovable heroine and you really end up rooting for her in the last half-hour of the movie. Here is a point where it still preserves humor, but takes an effective turn for drama. I'm still very surprised at how I could have been rolling on the floor laughing earlier and yet now was transfixed, quiet, involved in the romantic moments that followed.For those who care, yes, Amelie is a French film and it is not available (to my knowledge) in an English dub. You must see the French version with English subtiltes. But honestly, should this matter? After all, if it was dubbed it would probably not be in a controlled manner that the film's director Jean-Pierre Jeunet would have approved. Even though it's a slaphappy, whacky comedy, I think Amelie should be, in some ways, taken seriously. Why? Because it escalates from being kitsch and evolves into art.

Quite often when I encounter a movie-adaptation of a (famous) novel, there are always hundreds of people complaining about how awful the movie version was in comparison to the book. Well, I've never &#x96; and probably will never &#x96; read the book, so at least I don't have to feel ashamed about tremendously liking the film! It's like I don't know any better, you dig? This is also the case with Watchers, for example. Allegedly, the Dean Koontz novel differs enormously from the 80's horror film version, with characters and story lines altered left and right in favor to appeal more to contemporary horror loving audiences. Travis, the lead character, is originally a 40-year-old social outcast in the book, whereas he's a poignant 16-year-old rebel kid in the film, portrayed by Corey Haim who was quite big at the time thanks to the success of The Lost Boys, Lucas and Silver Bullet. That's the 80's horror film industry for you. Can you blame them? Either way, Watchers is a shamelessly entertaining and virulent late 80's creature-feature with a pleasingly high body count, gruesome special effects, an irresistible charming 80's setting and ambiance, cool acting performances and one of the best use of an intelligent dog in a film ever.

Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. Old Yeller is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you.In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller.There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute dog for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be Old Yeller. Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie My Dog Skip. But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of Old Yeller you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite.

Perkins never totally got his due as an actor. The man was brilliant, and Norman was of course his greatest achievement.One of the interesting things about Psycho now is the not-so-publicized trouble the film had on initial release. Reviews were mixed, to say the least. One British reviewer (C. A. Lejuene) actually quit her job because the movie so offended her. But it was a massive hit with the public, and then critics literally changed their minds. Different world.That Bates became such an iconic film character is no surprise. Perkins makes that happen in every shot. Norman is about as creepy a character as you can find. Despite being a murderer, he's no killer. He's an extremely nervous, anti-social, near-shell of a man so mentally and morally corrupted and broken that it's hard to imagine him doing anything else with his life. He waits at his dingy motel for the rare occupant. Surely, he doesn't have much at all to do with most of them. It's the ones who want to talk to him that find trouble, as he's incapable of interacting peacefully.There is a shame to Norman. He is constantly embarrassed by his own perceived shortcomings, despite being a tall, good-looking man. Given that everyone and their mother has seen and discussed this film, we know the reason for his eternal agony with himself, but just in case someone stumbles upon this and has not seen Psycho or doesn't know the ending, I'll avoid going into it, because I'd hate to be the person who ruins this movie.I saw this movie first when I was eight years old. It thrilled me, and that is really the only time I've ever been truly and completely detached and sucked into a film's world. I am not saying this is the greatest film of all-time (it would be up there on my personal list, in part because of my attachment to it), but I was born 22 years after this movie was released. A lot changes culturally in 30 years, especially when the start of that was in 1960. Since I was just a kid and movies from 1960 weren't exactly lunch line talk, I didn't know anything at all about Psycho. It just happened to be on TV, and I fell in love with it. It was gripping, I probably had the sense that it was beyond me (or however you'd put that at eight), and Perkins' performance mesmerized me. I'd never seen anything like that. I started watching non-kids movies and TV a lot earlier than a lot of folks did, because supervision of TV was never a big thing for my family. It was just assumed that if I saw a bad guy kill a broad, I would have the common sense instilled in me to not go out and do that myself. But I'd never seen anything like Norman Bates.And really, I still haven't.This is a film people will still be watching in another 50 years.

I don't think there's a single person who has seen Rocky whether or not they enjoy it who would disagree with him. I don't even think the movie's makers, including writer\/star Sylvester Stallone would strongly argue against that. It is sort of an old-fashioned tale about the underdog trying to become somebody in a moment that is really a scandalous motive for publicity. But as much as I admire and will always admire Mr. Canby as a critic and thinking man, I cannot agree with his overall verdict of Rocky. Sure it isn't exactly fresh material in terms of its plot, but I think it is more than fresh (even today) in the way that it unfolds itself.Rocky, which has five sequels and countless wanna-bes, set the standards for the underdog story which even today is still being followed almost religiously. You can even see references in Clint Eastwood's daringly different boxing saga Million Dollar Baby a film which is only slightly better than this one. Sylvester Stallone plays the titular character of Rocky a goodhearted and world-wary boxer who is down-on-his-luck. He's got a talent, but no opportunity. That is until the world champion (Carl Weathers) needs a brand new opponent for his upcoming match. If his contender can beat him, he gains instant fame as the new world champion.But there's more depth and more character involved in this story. Rocky is described as a Cinderella story and not only is it about hope for change and eventual success, but it's a sweet little love story too. Rocky's freshly-written romance is to a shy petshop cashier played by Talia Shire. He's also got an on-and-off friendship with her persistent brother (Burt Young) and a cantankerous old pro (Burgess Meredith). The movie's themes about striving for success also unfold when the depths of these characters are explored. Some of them are almost like leeches; they want to suck off of Rocky's moments of fame, even if he is destined to lose the match.The movie really rests on the performance, however, by Sylvester Stallone and he never makes a wrong gesture. It's one of his two or three best roles in his career and if you ignore some dicey movies in the 80s and 90s, that's quite a showcase. Mr. Stallone plays his character sort of like a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. He goes for laughs, as the character is oftentimes trying to entertain other characters with cheap jokes. His antics often fall flat for Talia Shire, but draws a broad grin upon the faces of the audience. Roger Ebert compared Stallone's performance to the early works by Marlon Brando and I think it's a performance that is just as memorable as those, and even the immortalizing ones that Brando did later on films such as The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. In other words, yes, I agree with Mr. Ebert.But it *is* a movie about boxing...right? Well, that's just the excuse. That's the setup. A friend of mine once said that when he first saw Rocky as a boy, he hated it because he wanted to see the fights and couldn't have cared less about the love story or the relationships between the characters. Of course now as an adult, his opinion has vastly changed, but let's address the boxing scenes. They do work. In fact, they are very well-choreographed. I really appreciate how director John G. Avildsen avoided clichés such as slow-motion and rotating shots. He set up many angles, like a television match, and filmed the scenes like that. Mr. Avildsen's directing is especially effective here and is more than competently done throughout.Many have tried to be what Rocky has become and most have failed. But it's not a shocker to most that this film has become the subject of such praise and imitation. It does have a very unique charm in its otherwise familiar setup and plot that allows it to work wonders on the audience's emotions.

Rocky is one of the two or three best sports dramas I've ever seen and one incredibly entertaining motion picture. I've seen it many times and look forward the many times I will watch it again in the future. ","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"3 October 2010","score":"","review":" The New York Times critic Vincent Canby dismissed Rocky as being pure 30s make-believe and being the intelligent, knowing critic that he was, he had a solid point in his review. I don't think there's a single person who has seen Rocky whether or not they enjoy it who would disagree with him. I don't even think the movie's makers, including writer\/star Sylvester Stallone would strongly argue against that. It is sort of an old-fashioned tale about the underdog trying to become somebody in a moment that is really a scandalous motive for publicity. But as much as I admire and will always admire Mr. Canby as a critic and thinking man, I cannot agree with his overall verdict of Rocky. Sure it isn't exactly fresh material in terms of its plot, but I think it is more than fresh (even today) in the way that it unfolds itself.Rocky, which has five sequels and countless wanna-bes, set the standards for the underdog story which even today is still being followed almost religiously. You can even see references in Clint Eastwood's daringly different boxing saga Million Dollar Baby a film which is only slightly better than this one. Sylvester Stallone plays the titular character of Rocky a goodhearted and world-wary boxer who is down-on-his-luck. He's got a talent, but no opportunity. That is until the world champion (Carl Weathers) needs a brand new opponent for his upcoming match. If his contender can beat him, he gains instant fame as the new world champion.But there's more depth and more character involved in this story. Rocky is described as a Cinderella story and not only is it about hope for change and eventual success, but it's a sweet little love story too. Rocky's freshly-written romance is to a shy petshop cashier played by Talia Shire. He's also got an on-and-off friendship with her persistent brother (Burt Young) and a cantankerous old pro (Burgess Meredith). The movie's themes about striving for success also unfold when the depths of these characters are explored. Some of them are almost like leeches; they want to suck off of Rocky's moments of fame, even if he is destined to lose the match.The movie really rests on the performance, however, by Sylvester Stallone and he never makes a wrong gesture. It's one of his two or three best roles in his career and if you ignore some dicey movies in the 80s and 90s, that's quite a showcase. Mr. Stallone plays his character sort of like a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. He goes for laughs, as the character is oftentimes trying to entertain other characters with cheap jokes. His antics often fall flat for Talia Shire, but draws a broad grin upon the faces of the audience. Roger Ebert compared Stallone's performance to the early works by Marlon Brando and I think it's a performance that is just as memorable as those, and even the immortalizing ones that Brando did later on films such as The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. In other words, yes, I agree with Mr. Ebert.But it *is* a movie about boxing...right? Well, that's just the excuse. That's the setup. A friend of mine once said that when he first saw Rocky as a boy, he hated it because he wanted to see the fights and couldn't have cared less about the love story or the relationships between the characters. Of course now as an adult, his opinion has vastly changed, but let's address the boxing scenes. They do work. In fact, they are very well-choreographed. I really appreciate how director John G. Avildsen avoided clichés such as slow-motion and rotating shots. He set up many angles, like a television match, and filmed the scenes like that. Mr. Avildsen's directing is especially effective here and is more than competently done throughout.Many have tried to be what Rocky has become and most have failed. But it's not a shocker to most that this film has become the subject of such praise and imitation. It does have a very unique charm in its otherwise familiar setup and plot that allows it to work wonders on the audience's emotions. Rocky is one of the two or three best sports dramas I've ever seen and one incredibly entertaining motion picture. I've seen it many times and look forward the many times I will watch it again in the future.

When I first came across a copy of it in the video store over a decade later, I saw that the lead role was played by Jon Lovitz, a comedian I was familiar with. The film was also written by David Zucker, Robert LoCash, and Pat Proft, and I had previously seen comedies which they were involved in. Before seeing High School High, I knew it wasn't a very popular spoof movie, but there was still a chance I could find laughs in it, especially with Lovitz in the starring role, and I did. However, unsurprisingly, most of these laughs were small ones, and in the end, I was not left very pleased by the movie.Richard Clark is a teacher who leaves Wellington Academy with another teaching job waiting for him at Marion Barry High School. Unfortunately, he quickly learns that working here will not be a pleasant experience, as this is a very dangerous school full of crime, where the students in general are deeply troubled and constantly get poor marks, and it doesn't look like they have a bright future ahead of them. After arriving at the school on his first day, Clark soon meets the hotheaded principal, Evelyn Doyle, and his first conversation with her turns out to be an embarrassing one, but he then meets an administrative assistant named Victoria Chapell, and falls in love with her. Despite how much trouble Clark's class puts him through, he remains determined to somehow guide them in a different direction, and has his new girlfriend to help him, but obviously, he's going to face more than one problem along the way!Around the time I started watching this high school movie spoof, I certainly wasn't always keeping a straight face, but it didn't exactly look that promising. The first part that made me laugh fully might have been the protagonist, on his first day teaching at Marion Barry High, getting rivals to shake hands in the hall, and unfortunately, not too many gags made me laugh that hard after that.

There certainly were a number of scenes that made me at least smile or laugh just a little, which may not have been the case without a talented comedian like Jon Lovitz in the starring role, and eventually found at least one touching moment.

Before we shipped a few thousand Stinger missiles to the Afghan rebels, those gunships were practically invulnerable.As a movie, it's pretty darned good. My Harvard-educated lawyer wife saw it for the first time last night and asked me to look it up. There aren't any Rambo characters in it. The guerrillas inflict some pain on the occupiers, but the occupiers retaliate big-time, and eventually hunt down almost all of them--pretty much like The Battle of Algiers. Algiers is artier because it's in black and white, and was fully vetted by The New Left; Dawn has color and much better acting. The scripts of both spill over into purple (and politicized) prose sometimes, but both deliver the same underlying message Don't expect to impose your own system on another culture by force. And it does not escape my notice that that is basically what we're expecting to do in Iraq and Afghanistan now. Maybe you should watch both Dawn and Algiers. ","genre":"Action, Drama"}]
