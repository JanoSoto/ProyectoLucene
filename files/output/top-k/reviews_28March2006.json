However, as a fan boy watching his very favorite science fiction novel translated to the big screen, I have to say I couldn't imagine a cast less suited to the task.The best example of this in the film is the choice of casting Patrick Stewart in the role of Gurney Halleck. Stewart interprets the role as a pompous and boisterous swashbuckling type, an ever present aura of conceit and panache accompanying his instruction as he trains young Atreides in the martial sciences. Somehow, the grizzled mercenary who was tortured by the Harkonnen, serving out of gratitude for his rescue from their dread clutches, hard edged and mentally scarred, is translated into this Pirates of Penzance extra. This is a far cry from his portrayal in the novel, and serves as an example of just how far from the spirit of the book the film went.MacLachlan, Madsen, and Young just do not convince me in their respective roles, and while they deliver their dialog competently, I see their interpretations as being at odds with the complexity of the characters that Herbert created. Maybe my translation of the characters simply differed from Lynch's; I am unconvinced, however, as the later incarnation on SciFi channel seemed to fit my reading of the novel's dialog to a far closer (and much better acted) degree. I can only conclude that Lynch somehow fell victim to typical Hollywood-ization (rare for him) and cast the film according to what was seen as hip at the time. The exceptions to this rule are Sting and Dean Stockwell, who stood out amongst their contemporaries and fulfilled their roles expertly.To compound the problem, the cinematic devices used to tell the story fall short of doing so with any clarity. Even fan boys who know the story (like myself) would have trouble following events. An uninitiated viewer would be lost within 30 minutes, and if they felt anything like myself, they just wouldn't care. I can't even chalk up a worthy effort on this one; this film gets the flat end of this reviewer's frying pan.

First of all, what is with the monolith? It's significance is never really explained, which definitely leaves you hanging. Sure, for smart people it might be good that they don't tell you what it means because then you can figure it out yourself, but for high schoolers like me, it was just... queer. And what's with the music that they play when the monkeys are, like, attacking it? It sounds like a swarm of flies. And why did the monkeys attack it in the first place? Well, anyway. Another factor of this movie's weirdness was the pace of it in general. Because the majority of it takes place in outer space, all of the camera shots are very, very slow and the scenes are very, very quiet; to the point that it gives you the shivers and a tingle down your spine. Another weird thing in this movie is Hal, the droning robot that takes over and kills almost everyone. It's voice and personality are just so strange and awkward, that it's actually really funny, even though it's not supposed to be. The best part has to be when Hal starts singing Daisy, daisy... as he is being disassembled. Finally, the ending of the movie just freaked me out completely. What was with the guy turning into an embryo-ish bubble baby? And then there was the strange room that echos, where he ages really quickly. It gave me goosebumps because it made no sense at all and completely distorted any ideas that I have about human life and time travel. But overall, the weirdness really did end up making this movie one of a kind, in a good way. Even though it was not an accurate prediction of what the world would be like in 2001, it asked questions that no other movie would ever approach. And although this movie can really creep you it, it's in a good way. It forces you to think beyond your own life and your own theories about space, and it puts you in a weird state of mind that leaves you in a complete daze after watching it. This movie is definitely worth watching at some point, but it is not cut out for a slumber party. Prepare to be freaked out beyond belief.

Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.Although I originally had no intention of adding any comments, I have gradually become forced to change my mind by the flood of copies, near copies and look alike films that attempt in one way or another to trade on the reputation of Hitchcock's masterpiece. We have an almost shot for shot remake with the same title (1998), as well as Psycho II (1983), Psycho III 1986, Psycho IV (1990), and American Psycho (2000). In total IMDb now lists 97 films with Psycho in their title and many of these clearly hope to exploit the reputation of this 1960 film in one way or another. There are others which also exploit it, sometimes even more blatantly, without trading on its actual title; even though they may be released with titles such as The Psychopath or Psychotic. It is difficult to comment meaningfully on most of these films before my comments on Hitchcock's original are on record, so here goes Firstly I must take issue with those who imply that Hitchcock was the originator of horror films per se, or even that he was the first director who understood how to use a movie camera to create horror, suspense and tension. If you really believe this, go back and carefully look again at the early masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) in which the use of many techniques later so effectively exploited by Hitchcock can be found. Although Hitchcock actually directed one film in 1914, long before Dr Caligari was released, only part of this survives; and even his greatest fans would find it difficult to claim him precedence in the exploitation of these techniques. Hitchcock success was due to his mastery of cinematographic imagery combined with a very adept hand in using whatever technological or artistic developments were available to the maximum advantage. Most of his early work was carried out in the period when colour stock was not readily available or was very expensive and potentially unreliable. Until his reputation as a director was firmly established, Hitchcock was not free to make his films in colour and most of his early ones were shot in monochrome. But before he created Psycho he had filmed a long string of successes, in full colour, starting I believe with the period drama Under Capricorn in 1949. He had also experimented with one important film released in 3D format (Dial M for murder), and his choice of monochrome for Psycho was clearly made because he believed that it would be artistically more effective made in this way. This judgement was so accurate that even today when every movie goer has some familiarity with the story, it is almost universally agreed the visual impact from watching Psycho is far greater than that from a whole library of more recently made horror films.Psycho did not however become the classic it is simply because it is a very effective horror film. The horrors of World War II and the fears associated with the development of the atomic bomb provided more than enough material to occupy most movie makers during the period immediately before 1960, but these horrors remained remote from everyday life in normal North American communities.

Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.Although I originally had no intention of adding any comments, I have gradually become forced to change my mind by the flood of copies, near copies and look alike films that attempt in one way or another to trade on the reputation of Hitchcock's masterpiece. We have an almost shot for shot remake with the same title (1998), as well as Psycho II (1983), Psycho III 1986, Psycho IV (1990), and American Psycho (2000). In total IMDb now lists 97 films with Psycho in their title and many of these clearly hope to exploit the reputation of this 1960 film in one way or another. There are others which also exploit it, sometimes even more blatantly, without trading on its actual title; even though they may be released with titles such as The Psychopath or Psychotic. It is difficult to comment meaningfully on most of these films before my comments on Hitchcock's original are on record, so here goes Firstly I must take issue with those who imply that Hitchcock was the originator of horror films per se, or even that he was the first director who understood how to use a movie camera to create horror, suspense and tension. If you really believe this, go back and carefully look again at the early masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) in which the use of many techniques later so effectively exploited by Hitchcock can be found. Although Hitchcock actually directed one film in 1914, long before Dr Caligari was released, only part of this survives; and even his greatest fans would find it difficult to claim him precedence in the exploitation of these techniques. Hitchcock success was due to his mastery of cinematographic imagery combined with a very adept hand in using whatever technological or artistic developments were available to the maximum advantage. Most of his early work was carried out in the period when colour stock was not readily available or was very expensive and potentially unreliable. Until his reputation as a director was firmly established, Hitchcock was not free to make his films in colour and most of his early ones were shot in monochrome. But before he created Psycho he had filmed a long string of successes, in full colour, starting I believe with the period drama Under Capricorn in 1949. He had also experimented with one important film released in 3D format (Dial M for murder), and his choice of monochrome for Psycho was clearly made because he believed that it would be artistically more effective made in this way. This judgement was so accurate that even today when every movie goer has some familiarity with the story, it is almost universally agreed the visual impact from watching Psycho is far greater than that from a whole library of more recently made horror films.Psycho did not however become the classic it is simply because it is a very effective horror film. The horrors of World War II and the fears associated with the development of the atomic bomb provided more than enough material to occupy most movie makers during the period immediately before 1960, but these horrors remained remote from everyday life in normal North American communities.

I feel that's an accurate assessment. The movie just devolved into a shouting match between all of the principle characters. It was very disappointing to see, especially considering how good the radio production with essentially the same cast had been.Riding on the tails of his previous successes with Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing, Branngh clearly tried to pull out all the stops with this production, and that may have also worked against him. A huge number of big name stars were signed up to do cameos, and I found such excessive stunt-casting to be disconcerting. In every scene there seemed to be another celebrity trying to make the most of his or her couple of minutes of screen time.I did enjoy the cinematography, which seemed to put you right in the middle of the action. In retrospect, I remember it almost as if I had been watching a 3-D movie. The sets were beautiful, and some of the scenes were genuinely stunning -- I think in particular of the scene at the end where Fortinbras' (sorry if I mispelled it) troops invaded Elsinore.Brannagh seemed to have been staking his reputation on this movie, which I suspect he wanted to be viewed as his masterwork. The trouble was that he seemed to try too hard, and the movie came across as forced. There were many good points to the movie, but I feel they just could not overcome the poor direction and lousy acting which was present.

Conan the Barbarian is my favorite movie. I don't remember the first time I saw Conan the Barbarian; it was before elementary school. However, this film has stayed with me throughout the years when so many sword & sorcery films miserably miss the mark. Why? First of all, the imagery is beautiful. Unlike Conan the Destroyer, Red Sonja, Kull the Conqueror, and the myriad other fantasy films out there, Conan the Barbarian features beautiful outdoor imagery and sets that were obviously painstakingly created for that dark gritty feel of the written series. The costumes are well done. One sees earth tones prevailing, none of the incredibly silly colors or fabrics seen in the afore mentioned movies. In other words, the costumes don't look cheap. The outside locations were positively beautiful. They filmed outdoor sequences in Spain instead of on indoors set like many films. The range and beauty of the landscapes are stunning. The music is haunting. Basil Poledouris' score is incredibly moving, and, in a film with little dialog, the music helps to move the movie along. As for the script. For a fantasy movie, it is incredibly well written. (Actually, compared to many movies of the late 1990's and early 2000, it is superb in comparison.) They do change Conan from the books though. He is much more honorable in the movie (trust me) than in the books. He is also well taught both in fighting and in learned pursuits (no, he isn't a scholar, but he is literate). Most people think this is a hack and slash movie. Maybe so, but it also has a deep message; revenge does not bring peace. All throughout the movie, Conan searches for revenge for a terrible wrong. However, his quest for revenge costs him dearly...too dearly. In his final scene where he is alone, where does the culmination of revenge lead? It doesn't regain him what he lost, but it was also something that he had to do. However, not all feel about it that way, and that is only the way I choose to view it. The acting is a bit wooden here, at least from our heroes. However, Conan is supposed to be stoic and Arnold's face does capture a wide array of emotions without ever having to speak. Sandhal Bergman does a surprising credible job as Valeria, fellow thief and companion. However, it is James Earl Jones who over powers the audience with his lush voice and expressiveness. As Thulsa Doom, the main villain, he shines. The gore factor here is fair, so you may not want to let your kids watch it. Also, a little bit of nudity is here within as well.

Five years later both minds teamed up again, with the difference that Romero limited his participation to adapt King's stories, leaving the director's chair to fellow Michael Gornick.Creepshow 2 features three stories by Lucille Fletcher and Stephen King, in a manner similar to its predecessor. While the result is inferior to the first one, it still packs good entertainment and surely will please horror fans due to it's 80s vibe and imaginative stories. With the comic book style so characteristic of its predecessor, Creepshow 2 keeps the tone of the previous movie and the host, the aptly named Creep, is as funny as creepy.The first segment deals with the ancient spirit of an Indian Chief looking for revenge. It has very good special effects but the story is quite typical. The sub-par acting doesn't help but it is lovely the rusty old western look it has. A huge improvement is the second segment, named The Raft, which revolves around a group of friends trapped in a raft by a mysterious creature who lives in a lake. Suspense and horror are the main characteristics of this tale and it easily is the best of the three.However, the third segment, The Hitchhiker has quickly become a fan favorite due to it's imaginative and unpredictable nature. A woman runs over a hitchhiker in the middle of the night; after she runs away from the accident, she begins to loose her mind as the killed man seems to return to haunt her. While not as scary as The Raft, this segment is very entertaining and really funny.Director Michael Gornick had mastered the genre with his TV series Tales from the Darkside, so he was not a bad choice for this film and does the job very well. The three segments are very well constructed, particularly the second one, which despite being set in a limited space manage to keep the suspense and the tension to the max. The Raft is an amazing display of how the only thing needed for a good movie is imagination.The acting is quite average for the most part, but I was really surprised by the cast of The Raft, who put out truly believable performances that really transmit the horror of the tale.

And that's totally understandable knowing what he's been through. So both the bad and the good guys are real extremes also in their sickness (in these movies). You have to be freakin' crazy to fight these crazies. Fight evil with evil. If you have to fight, you have to fight dirty. Because war in itself is bad, evil and crazy. (These citings are not from this movie, they're just clichés.) Is there any other way? But compared to the bad guys Bronson's character is also very, very sad and sympathetic. It's sad that some people have to see and experience so much evil in this world. It is a very interesting character and portrait of a time and a frame of mind.And the bad guys are not as comical as in some other Death Wishes, they are somehow more realistic.From the start setting of this film some mental professional would suggest that Bronson's character is begging for blood and violence in his life He has hooked up with some psycho-sadist-mob boss's ex-wife, who has a daughter with the mentioned. But let's not be shrinks. Shrinks (both amateur and pro) seem to be wrong very often, maybe as often as non-shrinks. Maybe it's just because they have fallen in love. And maybe Bronson\/Kersey has heard about this only later.One of the most important questions that these movies rise is What would YOU do? Would ethics and philosophy of forgiveness be enough, if some person would for example kill some of your loved ones with no reason. Would you think that that person has deserved forgiveness and is worth of that? If that person would be a repeated killer, who has been in jail a couple of times already for his\/her former crimes\/killings? Would you think of that person as an equal to some person you love, and who you know is trying to be as good person as he\/she possibly can? The movie is very well directed, shot, acted. Good editing and music. The atmosphere is whole. Some nice pictures. It's also more sexy than all the other parts combined. This might be one of the 3 best of the 5 Death Wishes, but wouldn't 3 have been enough? Obviously not, because these movies are just a small glimpse of the vigilante\/revenge-movies genre... Worth seeing.
