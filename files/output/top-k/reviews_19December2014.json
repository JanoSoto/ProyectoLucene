Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind and Blanche Duboise in Elia Kazan's adaptation of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire are both southern belles with an appetite for men. Both find that their pursuit of men get them into trouble and both end up paying for their indiscretions. Some have said that Blanche is Scarlett in rags and tatters, as if the return to Tara didn't work out.The major difference between Scarlet and Blanche is that Blanche has lost her fighting spirit. While Scarlet had a fierce determination to survive and to win the hearts of men, Blanche is completely unguarded. When we meet her, she is at the end of her rope. She arrives in New Orleans from Auriol, Mississippi to stay with her sister Stella (Kim Stanley) and her brutish husband Stanley (Marlon Brando), claiming that their ancestral plantation home has been lost, due to epic fornications. Stanley doesn't like her. He is a simple guy, a lion who likes his den to stay the way he likes it. Blanche, with her perfumes, paper lamp shades, phony politeness and pretentiousness gets on his nerves. He senses that something isn't right about her and confirms it with several of the guys he works with who have been through Auriol.It turns out that he is right about her, she does have a past. Blanche once had a lover who killed himself; She was fired from her teaching job when she had an improper relationship with a teenage boy; She was thrown out of a hotel called The Flamingo because of her sexual dalliances. She has come to her sister's home because she has nowhere else to go. She has no job and no life back in Mississippi. What doesn't become immediately clear is that she is beginning to crack up.While Stanley hates her for her pomposity and pretentiousness (and later, her past), his co-worker Mitch (Karl Malden) is charmed by her. He steps out with her and is on the verge of proposing marriage when he finds out the truth about her past. He turns her away because she is unclean.Blanche is her own worst enemy. She has a need to be loved but she goes about it in ways that get her into trouble. This has helped her to burn her bridges back home and so she now has no life, no hope, nowhere that she can go. We can see that, in youth she was a charming girl with a pretty smile, wide eyes and a soft coquettish voice. She still carries remnants of that old life, sporting a chiffon dress that makes her look like she's ready for the prom. She brushes her hair and sings to herself like a girl getting ready for a date. She comes to Stanley and Stella's place with a trunk full of dresses and pearls and furs, all fancy things, nothing practical, no evidence of a routine life.The image that she displays is that of the remnants of her teenage years. It may have worked when she was a teenager, but now she is pushing 40 and her refusal to mature feeds what will eventually turns into a nervous breakdown. Blanche's mind blurs the line between fantasy and reality. When Mitch confronts her about her past, he demands the truth. Her response shocks us I don't want realism. I want magic! Yes, yes, magic. I try to give that to people. I do misrepresent things. I don't tell truths. I tell what ought to be truth. I don't think this is true, I think that by this point, her mind is so far gone that she simply doesn't know the difference between what is true and what she tells everyone is true.Blanche is one of the saddest characters that I have ever encountered. She is clearly mentally ill and feeds off the half-truths she tells. Unlike Scarlet O'Hara, who fought hard to get what she wanted, Blanche has no ground on which to stand. We see nothing of her past, no flashbacks, she steps into our field of vision in beginning stages of her breakdown.It is well known that Vivien Leigh suffered from manic depression. She was bi-polar, and we can see that she brought a great deal of what she experience in real life to the role. This is a difficult role to play, because Leigh isn't allow to let Blanche grow into her madness. She is at the beginning stages of her meltdown from the moment we meet her. In the early scenes, we can clearly see that Blanche's persona is an act. She speaks in broad strokes, moves in grand gestures and wears her pretenciousness right on the tip of her nose. She has a desperate need to be loved, to be admired and she wears her own image as a mask of what is really going on inside.

The opening scene where Robin Williams (as the car salesman Joey) tries to sell a car to woman who is about to bury her husband cracks me up every time I see it. Its clever writing (or is Robin ad libbing?) and scene setting.For whatever reason, Robin is perfectly suited as a car salesman. As another reviewer noted, there are not many times when a car salesman gets to be a hero and Robin is terrific. He exudes the I love to sell line despite his nutty life as a quick witted womanizing salesman. He has two girlfriends, owes money to a Mafia character, and is about to lose his job. All this gets fixed by Tim Robbins (Larry) taking hostages inside the car dealership where Joey works. But the story itself is secondary to the fun the cast seems to have with the creation of the whole movie. The chemistry between Pamela Reed (who plays Robin's ex wife) and Robin make for some sizzlingly (if that's a word) funny interactions. Its almost as though there are little bits of truth hidden inside the lines. Another funny moment comes when the Chinese restaurant staff who serve the SWAT team thats situated across the street from the dealership insist that the police can only use the restaurant if they're going to order food.

Everyone I know who has seen Ace Ventura raves on about how it is a Must See Movie'. Is it though? Well, sorta. The film is VERY funny, but nearly all of the comedy stems from one man, Jim Carrey. Thankfully, and unsurprisingly, Carrey's performance is spot on. Like always, his unique comic style makes us laugh, and his incredible and over-the-top performance makes this film. Jim Carrey is the strongest presence on the screen, and thats not a bad thing, but it does overshadow the rest of the characters. What makes this film good is Jim Carrey, and that's the problem. The Story doesn't stand out on its own, and is hindered by a fair few outrageous plot devices, which is only saved by Carrey's equally as outrageous body language. None of the other characters made me laugh, and in a comedy that is a problem. Its not like the rest of the actors do a poor job, but there average performance is buried under loads and loads of Carrey's insane dialogue. However, Jim Carrey is still widely entertaining and hilarious. I genuinely laughed throughout this film, and would defiantly rate it much better then many other comedies out there. This might as well be a Jim Carrey solo performance, but at least he is funny enough and has a strong enough stage presence to really make this movie laugh-out-loud good.

I decided Okay if by this point the series was just going to keep doing this I'll be safe and go to the Tim Burton remake and... while it's not an entirely bad movie it leaves a lot to be desired.So basically the movie is about how Mark Whalberg plays an astronaut that decides to travel into the unknown to save their test chimpanzee and he crash-lands on a planet... I'm not going to tell you what he finds there because it's in the title. Treated a little more like a slave then the He's an animal thing the original was going for, he - along with an ape named Ari, a few more humans and Ari's... bodyguard or something. They decide to fight for their own share of the world rather then being slaves.Now my biggest problem with the movie is that the movie makes things obvious from the get-go. I mean Tim Roth plays the bad guy and I swear, he delivers all his lines as a snarling, angry, obviously evil bad guy. I don't see how that character in the Ape world or otherwise could have gotten a position of authority. And with Ari, instead of in the original (I'm not comparing... well, I am - I'm just citing a movie that does this better) of Wait a minute these humans might not be what we thought it's obvious from the start with almost every second line being that.Another complaint I have is the pacing. It just goes slow and all over the place. I wouldn't mind if there was something to ground in it like in the original with the discussion of evolution vs faith but there's barely that in it either. It goes on for an hour and fifty four minutes but I feel that there isn't enough in what's going on to keep me interested in the plot or characters and a little too much to be explained.And the icing on the cake is the ending. It's trying to top Rod Serling in a twist ending, which may not have been easy to top but where Whalberg ends up is an Earth that is overrun by monkeys where everything else is the same. Okay, SUPPOSE if you are to tell me that he ends up in an alternate world where this happens then this scene is not foreshadowed. It's like Bang! Monkey planet which warrants nothing on first viewing other then saying it makes no sense. Which if they didn't consider the alternate world possibility, it doesn't.Okay, I'm going to say it. I LOVE the visuals of this movie. The make-up is done by Rick Baker, so you know the Apes are going to look fantastic. It actually overshadows the Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes effects. I could rave on about this make-up for literally days on end. Add to the fact that you have Tim Burton, arguably one of the directors with more visually appealing movies then on a strictly visual term, it's probably one of the better movies of the 2000's, As I said - only on a strictly visual term.So while there is a lot to harp on about this movie. It isn't entirely awful. I think this movie should have been great. Just seeing some of the sets and make-up made me know that there was a lot of time and effort put into this but I just think that it should have had a much stronger script before release, maybe if they did that then we would have probably had a movie that would be considered a great sci-fi classic alongside the original.

It goes on for an hour and fifty four minutes but I feel that there isn't enough in what's going on to keep me interested in the plot or characters and a little too much to be explained.And the icing on the cake is the ending. It's trying to top Rod Serling in a twist ending, which may not have been easy to top but where Whalberg ends up is an Earth that is overrun by monkeys where everything else is the same. Okay, SUPPOSE if you are to tell me that he ends up in an alternate world where this happens then this scene is not foreshadowed. It's like Bang! Monkey planet which warrants nothing on first viewing other then saying it makes no sense. Which if they didn't consider the alternate world possibility, it doesn't.Okay, I'm going to say it. I LOVE the visuals of this movie. The make-up is done by Rick Baker, so you know the Apes are going to look fantastic. It actually overshadows the Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes effects. I could rave on about this make-up for literally days on end. Add to the fact that you have Tim Burton, arguably one of the directors with more visually appealing movies then on a strictly visual term, it's probably one of the better movies of the 2000's, As I said - only on a strictly visual term.So while there is a lot to harp on about this movie. It isn't entirely awful. I think this movie should have been great. Just seeing some of the sets and make-up made me know that there was a lot of time and effort put into this but I just think that it should have had a much stronger script before release, maybe if they did that then we would have probably had a movie that would be considered a great sci-fi classic alongside the original. But sadly, we have this.

When Herb protests that neither of them can afford a cruise, Charlie assures him that he managed to wrangle free tickets. Herb grudgingly agrees.Of course there's a catch.

Besides avoiding Gil, Charlie keeps busy by playing poker against the snobbish, wealthy card expert Cullen Carswell and doggedly wooing the apparently glamorous, well-to-do Liz LaBreche (a still stunning Dyan Cannon), traveling with her ornery, cantankerous mother Mavis (Elaine Stritch) who wants her to marry someone worthy of her social station and who instantly disapproves of Charlie. Meanwhile, the more subdued Herb finds his own romantic interaction with Vivian (Gloria DeHaven), a fetching widow traveling with her grown daughter and son-in-law. They are mutually attracted to each other. Problem is, Vivian, through Charlie's interference, believes Herb is a doctor. Herb is actually a retired Gimbel's sales clerk, but is afraid to tell Vivian the truth because he doesn't want to disappoint her. Besides, Herb still stubbornly yearns for his deceased wife of 46 years, Susie.Again, the plot is straight out of any Love Boat episode, but Matthau and Lemmon are consummate, confident pros who can squeeze laughs out of the most outlandish doings. Through both physical slapstick and quick and sharp dialogue, Matthau and Lemmon seem to be having a ball in OTS and therefore let us have fun, too. And yet, good comedies always have a core of emotion and pathos. Both Matthau and Lemmon have it in OTS and so we hope that they can rise above the sticky deceptions and white lies they have built and find love and fulfillment. Do they?

Guillermin was responsible for two other excellent war films 1964's Guns at Batasi, a fairly complex look at the end of British colonialism, and 1958's I Was Monty's Double, a clever comedy, albeit one which never rises above the level of war-time propaganda.Remagen opens with an amazing sequence a convoy of American tanks are hurtling across Europe at breakneck speed. Crashing through villages, skidding along hilltops, they're also tracing the bank of the River Rhine. Up ahead is the still-intact Dusseldorf-Oberkassel bridge. Lieutenant Hartman (George Segel), leader of the American convoy, wants to take the bridge. The German Army is in full retreat on the other side. If he crosses, he can hit their flanks, penetrate German lines and press toward Berlin.Hartman's plan fails. His convoy is ambushed by German forces on the opposite side of the river. Shots are exchanged and the Dusseldorf-Oberkassel bridge is destroyed. This is where The Bridge at Remagen gets interesting. On Hartman's side of the river are several large groups of stranded German forces. They're racing down the river in an attempt to reach the last surviving bridge on the Rhine the Bridge at Remagen. Hartman's racing them to that bridge. On the opposite side of the Rhine, meanwhile, German Major Paul Kruger (Robert Vaughn) is doing the same.Time is thus crucial in The Bridge at Remagen. German and American forces are granted no sleep, no rest, no time for reloading or resupply. Everyone's fighting a running battle, everyone racing desperately toward Remagen. Once there, the film essentially becomes a siege movie, German and American forces slugging it out over the Rhine. Eyeing each other through binoculars like arch enemies, Major Kruger and Lieutenant Hartman quickly become locked in a battle of wits.Remagen is remarkably brisk for a film released in 1969. Shot like a Sam Peckinpah movie, but without the facile nihilism, Guillermin's film is all rapid editing, snap-zooms, audacious crane-shots, amazing helicopter-shots and stylish hand-held. The film's pyrotechnics, hardware and the blunt immediacy of its gun-battles, are likewise head and shoulders above most blood-and-guts war flicks of the 1960s. With a premise that demands urgency, there's no other war movie from the decade which looks and moves like this.Thematically, Remagen offers a strange mix of World War 2 pulp fiction, Vietnam era revisionism and counterculture sentiments. Like the works of Sam Fuller, it adopts the tone of the combat comic-books of the 1940s and 1950s - which were aimed at adolescents - but then attempts to inject some sophistication. Like the zany war films of the sixties (Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Castle Keep, MASH, Catch 22 etc), the film's spirit also wholly belongs to the Beat and Hippie generations. Should I care? an American soldier asks, when matters of victory are discussed. Who's the real enemy? a German mumbles on his deathbed. Axis and Allies, then, are not mortal enemies but brothers in arms. Explicitly referring to one another as friends, both are but pawns cynically offered as fodder by cruel commanders and waging Imperialists. Elsewhere the film subverts the usual dehumanising portrayals of German soldiers by lingering on dead German kids, mournful fathers, crowds of refugees, the bravery of the Wehrmacht and the many German sons and daughters tragically wasted on war.The Longest Day (1960) was perhaps the most famous WW2 war film released in the 1960s. Aesthetically spectacular, but thematically dumb, the film kowtowed to America's rather mythological understanding of World War 2. Remagen's too generic to engage in any meaningful historical or political revisionism, but it does draw constant parallels between Major Kurger and Lieutenant Hartman, between German grunt and American grunt. And where most Western war films engage in games of victimhood &#x96; our brave heroes always a small band outnumbered by hordes of savages (Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, 300 etc) - Remagen does the opposite. It is Major Kruger who is outnumbered, out-gunned, and under siege. It is Major Kruger who must bravely hold back a seemingly unending flow of enemy tanks and troops. In The Bridge at Remagen, both German and American grunts are simultaneously glorified and pitied. The Bridge at Remagen was filmed in Czechoslovakia. It boasts a fine score by Elmer Bernstein and some picturesque location photography. George Segel, excellent as an American officer in King Rat, is called upon to play a simpler character here your archetypal American hero, only more jaded. Remagen also conveys well large scale tactics, geography and the spatial relationship between vying armies. Of all the WW2 movie of the 1960s (Anzio, Patton, The Longest Day, Battle of the Bulge etc), it's arguably the best.8.5\/10 - See Decision Before Dawn, The Victors (1963) and The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.

","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"19 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die. - Sartre One of the best war films you've never heard of, The Bridge at Remagen (1969) was directed by John Guillermin. Guillermin was responsible for two other excellent war films 1964's Guns at Batasi, a fairly complex look at the end of British colonialism, and 1958's I Was Monty's Double, a clever comedy, albeit one which never rises above the level of war-time propaganda.Remagen opens with an amazing sequence a convoy of American tanks are hurtling across Europe at breakneck speed. Crashing through villages, skidding along hilltops, they're also tracing the bank of the River Rhine. Up ahead is the still-intact Dusseldorf-Oberkassel bridge. Lieutenant Hartman (George Segel), leader of the American convoy, wants to take the bridge. The German Army is in full retreat on the other side. If he crosses, he can hit their flanks, penetrate German lines and press toward Berlin.Hartman's plan fails. His convoy is ambushed by German forces on the opposite side of the river. Shots are exchanged and the Dusseldorf-Oberkassel bridge is destroyed. This is where The Bridge at Remagen gets interesting. On Hartman's side of the river are several large groups of stranded German forces. They're racing down the river in an attempt to reach the last surviving bridge on the Rhine the Bridge at Remagen. Hartman's racing them to that bridge. On the opposite side of the Rhine, meanwhile, German Major Paul Kruger (Robert Vaughn) is doing the same.Time is thus crucial in The Bridge at Remagen. German and American forces are granted no sleep, no rest, no time for reloading or resupply. Everyone's fighting a running battle, everyone racing desperately toward Remagen. Once there, the film essentially becomes a siege movie, German and American forces slugging it out over the Rhine. Eyeing each other through binoculars like arch enemies, Major Kruger and Lieutenant Hartman quickly become locked in a battle of wits.Remagen is remarkably brisk for a film released in 1969. Shot like a Sam Peckinpah movie, but without the facile nihilism, Guillermin's film is all rapid editing, snap-zooms, audacious crane-shots, amazing helicopter-shots and stylish hand-held. The film's pyrotechnics, hardware and the blunt immediacy of its gun-battles, are likewise head and shoulders above most blood-and-guts war flicks of the 1960s. With a premise that demands urgency, there's no other war movie from the decade which looks and moves like this.Thematically, Remagen offers a strange mix of World War 2 pulp fiction, Vietnam era revisionism and counterculture sentiments. Like the works of Sam Fuller, it adopts the tone of the combat comic-books of the 1940s and 1950s - which were aimed at adolescents - but then attempts to inject some sophistication. Like the zany war films of the sixties (Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Castle Keep, MASH, Catch 22 etc), the film's spirit also wholly belongs to the Beat and Hippie generations. Should I care? an American soldier asks, when matters of victory are discussed. Who's the real enemy? a German mumbles on his deathbed. Axis and Allies, then, are not mortal enemies but brothers in arms. Explicitly referring to one another as friends, both are but pawns cynically offered as fodder by cruel commanders and waging Imperialists. Elsewhere the film subverts the usual dehumanising portrayals of German soldiers by lingering on dead German kids, mournful fathers, crowds of refugees, the bravery of the Wehrmacht and the many German sons and daughters tragically wasted on war.The Longest Day (1960) was perhaps the most famous WW2 war film released in the 1960s. Aesthetically spectacular, but thematically dumb, the film kowtowed to America's rather mythological understanding of World War 2. Remagen's too generic to engage in any meaningful historical or political revisionism, but it does draw constant parallels between Major Kurger and Lieutenant Hartman, between German grunt and American grunt. And where most Western war films engage in games of victimhood &#x96; our brave heroes always a small band outnumbered by hordes of savages (Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, 300 etc) - Remagen does the opposite. It is Major Kruger who is outnumbered, out-gunned, and under siege. It is Major Kruger who must bravely hold back a seemingly unending flow of enemy tanks and troops. In The Bridge at Remagen, both German and American grunts are simultaneously glorified and pitied. The Bridge at Remagen was filmed in Czechoslovakia. It boasts a fine score by Elmer Bernstein and some picturesque location photography. George Segel, excellent as an American officer in King Rat, is called upon to play a simpler character here your archetypal American hero, only more jaded. Remagen also conveys well large scale tactics, geography and the spatial relationship between vying armies. Of all the WW2 movie of the 1960s (Anzio, Patton, The Longest Day, Battle of the Bulge etc), it's arguably the best.8.5\/10 - See Decision Before Dawn, The Victors (1963) and The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.

All of those elements make Harlem Nights a memorable film that is Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor at their best.Set in Harlem,New York during the late 1930s,Harlem Nights tells the story of Quick(Eddie Murphy)and Sugar Ray(Richard Pryor)who both run the nightclub Club Sugar Ray and the club is doing well until Gangster Bugsy Calhoune(Michael Lerner)and corrupt cop Phil Cantone(Danny Aiello)want to embezzle money from the club. With their backs against the wall Quick and Sugar Ray come up with a plan to rob Bugsy Calhoune of his money and try to survive on the streets of Harlem.During the period between Coming To America in 1988 and The Nutty Professor in 1996 Eddie Murphy's career was at a crossroads with two categories of movies that were not critical successes but Box office hits(Boomerang,Another 48 Hrs,The Distinguished Gentleman)and movies that were critical and Box Office failures(Beverly Hills Cop III and Vampire In Brooklyn). A film that falls into the former category is Harlem Nights in 1989,a terrific and memorable Comedy\/Crime Drama that was the directorial debut of Eddie Murphy that was a passion project for Murphy and was the first and only film with his idol Comedian Richard Pryor. While Harlem Nights was a Box Office success it was panned by critics which is a shame because Harlem Nights is one of Murphy's best and most underrated movies and is a movie that Eddie should be proud of. Harlem Nights is an hilarious movie and one of the funniest films I have ever seen that is entertaining from start to finish a movie that combines laughs,period piece and a Crime genre all in one film a movie that mixes jokes and laughs with violence and intrigue. The Comedy and laughs in Harlem Nights are funny and amazing mixing silliness and black humor with some scenes and dialog that are over the top that is done like a Coen Btothers film or A Rage In Harlem. But while the Harlem Nights has a lot of funny and over the top moments there is also a lot of serious and dramatic moments to the movie thanks to the atmosphere and Crime Drama\/Gangster elements that make the movie work. Murphy gives Harlem Nights the right tone and feel for the film with a great balance without making the movie feel uneven. What I also enjoyed about Harlem Nights is the photography(Woody Omens),production design(Laurence G. Paul),Costume Design(Joe I. Tompkins,who received on an Academy Award nomination for his work on the film). All of those elements make Harlem Nights feel authentic and accurate making viewers feel like they are in Harlem during that time in the 1930s and giving the movie a beautiful and glossy look. As stylish as Harlem Nights looks there is plenty of substance especially with the two main characters Quick and Sugar Ray who are great characters while they are both business partners they are very much like Father and son. While there is differences between the two(Quick is young and ambitious,Sugar Ray is older and more patient)Quick and Sugar Ray find common ground when the Mob decides to come after them the to come together against all odds and defeat their enemies. The relationship between Quick and Sugar Ray is fascinating and is one of the many things that drives the film. The ending of Harlem Nights is wonderful and is filled with laughs and surprises that will greatly satisfy viewers. A terrific conclusion.The cast is amazing. Eddie Murphy is is excellent,hilarious and at his best as Quick,with Murphy bringing laughs and playing it straight. Richard Pryor is outstanding and at his best as Sugar Ray,Quick's Father figure and has great scenes with Murphy. Redd Foxx(in his last movie role)is terrific and funny as Bennie,a man in charge of Dice games. Danny Aiello is amazing as Phil Cantone,a corrupt cop. Michael Lerner is fantastic as Bugsy Calhoun,a vicious Gangster. Della Reese is delightful as Vera,a madam who works at Club Sugar Ray's. Jasmine Guy is terrific and beautiful as Dominique La Rue,Calhoun's mistress. Arsenio Hall is very funny in his small role as Crying Man. Vic Polizos(Richie),Lela Richon(Sunshine),Stan Shaw(Jack Jenkins),Berlina Tolbert(Annie),David Marciano(Tony),Thomas Mikal Ford(Tommy Smalls),Miguel A. Nunez Jr.(Man With Broken Nose) and Desi Arnez Hines II(Young Quick)give good performances as well. Also,Lookout for cameos by Robin Harris(Jerome)and Charlie Murphy(Jimmy)The direction by Eddie Murphy is fantastic and stylish,with Murphy moving the camera and giving the movie a visual stunning look and pace. Great direction,Murphy.The score by Herbie Hancock is outstanding,intense and beautiful and truly adds to the film. Wonderful score,Hancock. There is also plenty of great Jazz songs on the soundtrack including Drop Me Off In Harlem by Louis Armstrong and Dike Ellington.In final word,if you love Comedies,Crime Dramas,Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor,I highly suggest you see Harlem Nights,an excellent,hilarious and underrated Comedy\/Crime Drama that is Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor at their best.

He's relatively unhappy with his life and suspects that his wife Doris Crane (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss Big Dave Brewster (James Gandolfini). Ed gets talking to one of his customers who offers him a stake in his dry cleaning business if Ed stumps up $10,000. Ed doesn't have the money, but hatches a plan to get the money. However, Ed quickly learns that his simple and seemingly flawless plan ends up having far reaching consequences.I know that the Coen Brothers have a die hard cult following of fans, but I've never really been one of them. In fact, I've actually disliked nearly all of their films that I've seen. However, this film is different - this film really impressed me.This film is basically a Cautionary Tale - the Coen Brothers have actually made their audience consider the devastating consequences resulting in being greedy. They also make the audience consider the devastating consequences that one poorly judged action can have on many different people.The Coen Brothers have also created many characters that are not only well developed, but that we can also identify with. Ed Crane is probably the best example; for me he's an idealist, someone who wants to be recognised and remembered, someone who wants to be somebody. This becomes more apparent when he meets Birdy Abunbdas (Scarlett Johansson). Birdy becomes his project or possibly even his redemption. What I liked about Ed is that he was a flawed person rather than a bad person which meant that it was easier to relate to and care for his character. Birdy was an interesting character and it was a shame that her character wasn't developed quite as much as I hoped for - there was a lot of potential with her character which the Coen brothers didn't explore for some reason.I'll admit that in the early stages of this film that I thought the narrative was a bit shaky and found it a bit nonsensical, but as the film progressed I found myself more and more engrossed and thought that everything ended up being tied together nicely. As mentioned. it's a Cautionary Tale and is a film that will certainly make you think.The film is well-shot and the 1940's era has been captured well. Acting was roundly good across the board with Gandolfini and Coen brothers favourite McDormand arguably putting in the best performances.Overall then this is a very good film (and that's coming from someone who isn't a big Coen brothers fan). I thought that the writing was sharp, the acting was good, the plot was interesting (after a bit of a plodding first half). This is a good piece of noir and a very good film in general.

Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, staggers me. He further critiques Hammond You packaged (your discovery), slapped it on a plastic lunch-box and now you're selling it ... What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world. So there is a bit of depth to the film, if only in passing.By far the best element is the visual effects, truly spectacular. The dinosaurs look realistic and believable. These visuals are enhanced by sound effects accompanied by a subtle echo. Which, when combined with the rain forest background, create a faraway feel, consistent with the historical remoteness of the Mesozoic era in which the dinosaurs lived.Casting is acceptable. Acting trends a bit overblown. Production and art design are almost as good as the special effects. But I did not like the overbearing and manipulative background music.With a huge budget and a famous director, this Hollywood blockbuster aims at a mass audience. Though the visual effects are spectacular, the script gives us a childish story, with childish characters, that I find mildly insulting to the study of such a fascinatingly alien era in Earth's history.

For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another. It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers. There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti. Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion. I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere.

Where Fargo is dark, The Big Lebowski is a parody. Hidden in the jokes, satire, idiosyncratic characters, and musical numbers, the story is about a hippie bum, geniusly portrayed by Jeff Bridges, who is unwittingly sucked into becoming a pawn in kidnapping and embezzling scams. As the narrator, The Stranger (Sam Eliot) roundaboutly puts it, Sometimes there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. And I'm talking' about the Dude here--sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude (The Big Lebowski). In some ways a monomyth, The Dude takes us on an anti-hero's journey. The Dude's legal name happens to be the same as a bigwig whose trophy bride and former porn star, Bunny (Tara Reed), owes money to a porn producer, Jackie Treehorn. The producer's goons confuse the two Jeffrey Lebowskis and micturate on the Dude's room-tying-together rug. This sets off a chain of events that begins with The Dude seeking reparations from the Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) on the advice of his bowling buddies Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). This leads into him becoming the wealthier Lebowski's patsy in his plot to embezzle funds from his wife's foundation, because the Big Lebowski replaces his wife's ransom money with a ringer, intending to frame The Dude for its loss. The Dude ultimately and unwittingly undermines the scheme by solving the mystery after determining that they had replaced the ringer with a ringer. He further subverts The Big Lebowski by knocking up his only daughter, Maude (Julianne Moore). A major theme of The Big Lebowski is masculinity, its stereotypes, and their deconstruction. The Big Lebowski analyzes his masculinity, asking The Dude, What makes a man? Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man? To which, The Dude quips, Sure, that and a pair of testicles. The motif of masculine stereotypes is repeated throughout the film and each character the Dude encounters on his journey is a different stereotype, even caricature, of manliness, most of which are expertly subverted. Jeffrey The Big Lebowski appears wealthy and powerful, but is physically confined to a wheelchair and we learn that the money belonged to his wife and is wrapped up in a charitable foundation, so he actually has relatively little control. His bark is significantly worse than his bite. Brant (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is educated with what is potentially a high-powered position, yet is a sycophantic flunky. You can almost see his tail tucked between his legs. Walter is a trigger-happy, ultra-militaristic war hero, stuck in the Vietnam era. He destroys a shiny, new Corvette with a baseball bat while shouting, This is what you get when you f*** a stranger in the ass. The Jesus is a hyper-sexualized, pederast, who literally licks a ball during his introduction. The Stranger is a Cowboy. Jackie Treehorn is a wealthy pornographer, surrounded by scantily-clad women. Karl Hungus\/Dieter\/Lead Nihilist is Bunny's porn costar, and his fellow nihilists\/pretend-nappers are over-the-top aggressive and obsessively attempting to castrate The Dude. The only two female characters are also a mishmash of stereotypes. Bunny is a porn star, trophy wife, farm girl, and runaway.

And I'm talking' about the Dude here--sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude (The Big Lebowski). In some ways a monomyth, The Dude takes us on an anti-hero's journey. The Dude's legal name happens to be the same as a bigwig whose trophy bride and former porn star, Bunny (Tara Reed), owes money to a porn producer, Jackie Treehorn. The producer's goons confuse the two Jeffrey Lebowskis and micturate on the Dude's room-tying-together rug. This sets off a chain of events that begins with The Dude seeking reparations from the Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) on the advice of his bowling buddies Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). This leads into him becoming the wealthier Lebowski's patsy in his plot to embezzle funds from his wife's foundation, because the Big Lebowski replaces his wife's ransom money with a ringer, intending to frame The Dude for its loss. The Dude ultimately and unwittingly undermines the scheme by solving the mystery after determining that they had replaced the ringer with a ringer. He further subverts The Big Lebowski by knocking up his only daughter, Maude (Julianne Moore). A major theme of The Big Lebowski is masculinity, its stereotypes, and their deconstruction. The Big Lebowski analyzes his masculinity, asking The Dude, What makes a man? Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man? To which, The Dude quips, Sure, that and a pair of testicles. The motif of masculine stereotypes is repeated throughout the film and each character the Dude encounters on his journey is a different stereotype, even caricature, of manliness, most of which are expertly subverted. Jeffrey The Big Lebowski appears wealthy and powerful, but is physically confined to a wheelchair and we learn that the money belonged to his wife and is wrapped up in a charitable foundation, so he actually has relatively little control. His bark is significantly worse than his bite. Brant (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is educated with what is potentially a high-powered position, yet is a sycophantic flunky. You can almost see his tail tucked between his legs. Walter is a trigger-happy, ultra-militaristic war hero, stuck in the Vietnam era. He destroys a shiny, new Corvette with a baseball bat while shouting, This is what you get when you f*** a stranger in the ass. The Jesus is a hyper-sexualized, pederast, who literally licks a ball during his introduction. The Stranger is a Cowboy. Jackie Treehorn is a wealthy pornographer, surrounded by scantily-clad women. Karl Hungus\/Dieter\/Lead Nihilist is Bunny's porn costar, and his fellow nihilists\/pretend-nappers are over-the-top aggressive and obsessively attempting to castrate The Dude. The only two female characters are also a mishmash of stereotypes. Bunny is a porn star, trophy wife, farm girl, and runaway. Maude is a privileged, educated, feminist and creator of strongly vaginal artwork. She tests The Dude's masculinity by saying vagina and several synonyms in an attempt to unnerve him.
