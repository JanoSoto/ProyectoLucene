I read a few other reviews on this site and a few of them said that they weren't impressed with the animation?  Are you serious?  What is wrong with you?  This animation is absolutely mind-boggling!  I think people that say they aren't impressed with the animation are people that have NO idea how much time, effort and work it takes to create just a single frame of this film (although, I'm no expert either, but I can at least imagine how hard it is).  Anyhow, don't listen to these people, the animation is excellent!!!The voice-acting is great on all accounts.  Mike Myers does a great Shrek, Cameron Diaz plays the perfect Princess Fiona, John Lithgow is awesome as Prince Farquaad, and Eddie Murphy completely steals the show as Donkey.  It really pains me to read other reviews and read that they didn't think the film was funny?  I don't know what to say to these people, I thought the film was hilarious!!!  Just different tastes I guess.I think this in one of the few films these days that can be enjoyed both by younger kids and adults, there's a lot of good stuff to this film.  I thought this film was excellent and can't wait for a sequel (hope it's good though).  I hope you enjoy the film when you see it, and you will!

Don't worry I'm not a christian puritan or anything like that. More the oppocite..but I do have common sense. I really don't know where to begin, but first of all I've lost a LOT of respect for Gene Hackman. I thought he was a serious actor. The plot isn't even worth a mention here. Oh well..Ok, the first thought that really hit me after seeing this was that it had to be a movie made to make people join the army. But no, it probably haven't gone that far. But yes, after I talked to a friend that have been in the army over there, he could tell me that parts of it actually has been used in the US military's promo videoes. Unbelivable really, when they do almost every mistake they could do in that movie when it comes to military tactics and common sense. When you have a whole army looking for you, you don't go to the biggest clearing in the forest or sit on a big rock on a high mountain top. And you don't clear mines by walking up to them and shoot them with your gun standing 5 meters away. Those mines have a kill radius of 40-50 meters..and the hero runs through probably the stupidest made mine field ever btw. He's at best 10 meters away from them, and runs through them all without even a scratch. Okay, this is nitpicking, but still a little serious when you think about it. There's just hundreds of stupid errors in this film and all to make war look like something cool. The ending just tops it all of course. This film is mindnumbingly stupid and for those who wants to join the army after seeing it...well you will never read this, so you'll probably die a horrible death anyway. It scares me really to see how many people think this movie is soo cool. It's the perfect propaganda machine really...perfect.

The closing song to one of the more brilliant movies I have seen in quite a while. First, let's clear some things up. Yes, I am a girl. I am under the age of 18. And yes, Fight Club is one of the best movies I have seen in quite a while. And it's not because of Brad Pitt or Edward Norton (although I do admit both are quite tasty here). No, this movie speaks about truth. The type of truth that people hate to admit about their sorry little lives. So what is the truth exactly?I believe truth in this movie is that people spend too much of their time following rules, believing they are whoever someone tells them they are. Take for example the Narrator in the beginning of the movie. Life was unlivable for him. Why? Because he took so much time listening to what others told him he should be. He could not form any opinions for himself. And isn't it true that we all are like that? We can admit to changing who we are just to be accepted by society, right? The cause of his insomnia.So the Narrator starts to attend groups for people who are dying of disease. Why? Because these people really listen to what YOU have to say. They don't try to change you because they know you're going to die anyway, so what's the point? Here, the Narrator can really express himself, till in walks Marla Singer. The tumor for our poor, insomniac Narrator. The turning point of the movie, and the start of a very interesting plot that I don't think I'll carry onward with.Fight Club. A new plot, with complex characters that are developed and keep you entertained. Yet this movie makes you think about the life you are living. Is it worth it? What you are going through? Do you really need all that crap as Tyler Durden would say? Probably not. Want something life changing to happen in your miserable life? Watch this movie. I don't even think it should be labeled a movie. It's too good for that.MJR ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 October 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie really is a great movie. One of the better animated movies I can think of. The stop-motion animation in this movie is incredible. I also think Danny Elfman's score, music, and lyrics are outstanding.

He discovers Christmas Town, and immediately falls in love with it. He wants everything to do with it, and attempts to bring Christmas to Halloween.For a movie that is supposedly aimed at children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is actually quite dark at times. Just listen to one of the songs from the movie called Kidnap the Sandy Claws and you will see what I mean.To sum it up The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite family movies, if you want to call it that.

I am amazed at some of the brilliant films they have produced within the last few years.Spoilers.Monsters, Inc. is a great tale that strives for action and adventure as well as heart-felt emotions and good morals.  James P. Sullivan is a scary monster at its best in the industrial power plant of Monsters, Inc. and intends to keep up his good reputation.  Mike Wazowski is the comical, witty little one-eyed... thing... who intends to keep Sulley up on top.  However, Randall, a creepy, lizard-like monster, is out to do more than just get on top.  His plans are much more dire, and I think this is one reason I liked Monsters, Inc. so much.First of all, the characters, although monsters, can easily be connected with.  We understand what Sulley is feeling when he gets attached to Boo.  We understand why Mike is upset with Sulley when they're stranded with the Yeti.  The characters are so real that it's like I could reach out and feel them there.I was a bit skeptical at first.  I thought that Monsters, Inc. would take place in a strange world with different physics and absolutely incomprehensible functions.  However, the movie tries its hardest to be as human-like as possible and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all with it.  It kept me in the loop on how things work.The plot is very unique.  The toddler, whom Sulley names Boo, somehow gets into the power plant and starts to wreak havoc on Monstropolis.  In reality she is not harmful, and the events that take place before she is finally returned are downright hilarious and intense.The actual story was indeed excellent.  The problem amounted to unnerving heights as soon as they had Boo in the apartment, and even after that it continued to grow more and more.  I found myself hoping they wouldn't be caught, telling the characters not to go there, and I was even compelled to bite my nails.  The final conflict involving Randall and many doors is humorous yet, once again, intense (I especially liked the part when Mike and Sulley dive down into a door only to find that they're no longer falling...).The music, composed by Randy Newman, starts out in the credits with a light jazz composition.  Usually I find jazz annoying, but this wasn't so bad.  Once it got into the movie, though, he switched to a nice composition.  It wasn't a major factor in the movie, but it held up in the end when Sulley is searching for Boo.There were some things I didn't like about Monsters, Inc.  For one, the evil villain, Randall, did not have a decent enough end.  I felt his story was unfinished as he was thrown through a door and beat down like an alligator.  But, like it showed in the end, he could easily leave that house and find another, enter a closet, and easily return to the monster world.Also, the end had two things wrong with it.  First, it was a happy ending.  In real life, it's a half and half chance of things turning out to be good.  But in Disney, it always seems to end nicely.  I think it would have been more emotional if, when Sulley said goodbye, it was for forever.  But I suppose that wouldn't appeal to some of the younger children.Second, it was a little stretched out.  I felt that the movie did not wrap things up quickly.  Instead, it added more stuff in the end that I felt was not necessary.Altogether, despite those little annoyances, Monsters, Inc. is a marvelous tale.  Its setting in a different world makes it so interesting, the characters add depth to the story, and the events are mellow and intense at the same time.  It's a great film.

Then again, its about the moments fore and aft of two peoples' frustrations over their spouses' lack of interest for them and what they do about it.  Therefore, one would think that there might be some sort of -what the French call a certain -I don't know what.  Whatever the plot to this story needed -- it wasn't there.Keep in mind, when I see a movie like this I've already decided that I need to be in the mood for lots of dialogue and scenery and deceptions.  However, this movies lacked intrigue.  One (at least I) already knew what was going to happen right near the beginning when we find thar person A finds out that person B is getting married and they've had a past relationship.  What we get is a disecting of something that need not be dissected.  Here's the fine line  1) It was kind of cool to see Nick Nolte in such a different role for him.  He proves once again that he's a very diverse actor.  2) All the performances were right on for projecting the emotions of their characters; and I mean all the performances... very well done.What worked  Like I said, the performances.  Beautifully done and quite an accurate portrayal.  In fact, I debated giving this film more points for the actors' work, alone.  However, good acting alone does not a great film make.What didn't work  The story had the skin of a plot and with that plot great potential that was untapped.  I think a story should have twists and turns and things happening out of the blue to keep the audience interested.  But nothing, in my opinion, happened out of the blue.  It was all quite straight-lined right to the end with no ups or downs or mystery.  Having said that, if you want to see a film on how people lived in the early 20th century; this movie should fulfill you.I'm reminded of the scene in 'The Sixth Sense' where Bruce Willis tells the story of the man who got in a car and drove and drove and drove and drove.  Then, he stopped and though he'd drive some more.  So, he drove on and drove...  You get the point.  Then, Cole speaks up and suggests that the doctor needs some twists and things to make the story interesting.5\/10 - all five points go to the performances of every artist in the cast for doing the parts they were given.thank you ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"5 October 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have no idea what to write for this review, because Gattaca literally left me speechless the first time I saw it 5 years ago. I left me speechless every other time I've seen it since. This is perhaps the most perfect film of the decade of the 90s. There have been so many movies in the past that have attempted to show a grim look at the future. The 13th Floor, Soylent Green, 1984, Logan's Run, THX-1138, any of the original Planet Of The Apes films. Gattaca does it just as well, if not better than all of those.The writer and director, Andrew Niccol, who wrote The Truman Show and wrote and directed Simone, is arguably the most imaginative film-maker to emerge in years. Niccol is like a super genetic cross breed between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg.The world of Gattaca is one where most humans are genetically altered and enhanced before their birth, making them stronger, smarter, better looking. Ethan Hawke plays a man who never was genetically altered. People like him in the movie are called God Children or De-Gene-erates. He takes on the identity of Jude Law's character to get into the space program of Gattaca. Fooling everybody, he's days away from going into space when the Mission Director is killed. At that point the movie becomes a bit of a futuristic murder mystery. There is next to no action in Gattaca, yet I can't help but be tense and excited during the whole movie. The threat of Ethan Hawke's character being discovered as a fake (or borrowed ladder as they're called in the movie) creates so much tension that the movie doesn't need any real action. The themes of the movie are simply brilliant. Themes like accomplishing the impossible against all odds, and overcoming physical setbacks to defeat those who are made to be better than you. One line in the movie sums all these themes up best.I was never more certain of how far away I was from my dream, then when I was standing right next to it.I also love how Jude Law's character of Eugene\/Jerome, was made and engineered to be almost superhuman, yet he's all but failed at everything in his life. There's a perfect contrast of the two sides of characters in Gattaca. Gattaca avoids being preachy or making the engineered humans clear cut bad guys. It's so refreshing to see a movie with a real great idea behind it, and a small degree of intelligence and thought, instead of these stupid dopey sci-fi action films like Tomb Raider or the remake of Rollerball. In my mind, Gattaca holds up as the best film of the 90s and one of the all time greatest Sci Fi films.

This changes when an American rooster flies into the compound and Ginger realises that he can teach them to fly out of the farm.From the makers of Wallace and Gromit came this first feature which I was greatly looking forward to.  W&G manage to be imaginative and hilarious without resorting to smutty humour to please the adults, they really did transcend ages.  Chicken run takes the same approach but expands to 80 minutes or so.  The plot is very clever &#150; imagine The Great Escape set on a poultry farm and you've got it.  The film isn't afraid to show the dark side of this life and it is quite obvious considering it's a kids film.  It's moves nicely along with the energy covering the plot sagging a bit in the middle, however in terms of humour it is a little of a let down.The jokes are mostly very good, whether it be funny movie references or the chickens falling around or being silly.  However at 80 minutes the stretch marks do so and it isn't as consistent as I'd hoped it would be.  That's not to say it's not funny (it is!) but minute for minute it doesn't match other Ardman films.  The movie references are all good &#150; from the Colditz Story, The Great Escape, Indiana Jones and a wonderful Braveheart joke that heralds Rocky's arrival.The cast are good and really bring life to the animals.  Sawalha is well cast as Ginger and Horrocks brings a lot of laughs as Babs.  Gibson is pretty good as Rocky and sends himself up well despite wandering off in the middle for a bit.  Daniels and Spall are good rats but I felt their jokes were weak and more could have been done with their characters.  Richardson and Haygarth both hold well as the Tweedy's.Overall this isn't as hilarious as I'd hoped but it was still very funny indeed.  It is stronger for not being afraid to show it's dark side a little and the movie references only help to hold adult interest when the humour does slightly drop.

Just simply the fear of the unknown is enough. But just in case that's not enough for YOU, you will also get creepy sounds & very frightening situations. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that some of the stuff that is on the news on the TV in the movie is some of the scariest material in the movie. While all the things on the news in this movie are pretty freaky, there is one news clip in particular that I think really scared mostly everyone (maybe everyone) in the audience. So basically, don't go to this movie expecting to see a bunch of man-killing freaky-looking aliens. If you want something like that, rent Alien.All of the actors in this movie do a terrific job. The kids were great, which was unexpected for me. And as for the director...well, M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. He is the Alfred Hithcock of our time (note that he is nowhere as even remotely great as Hitchcock, I was just saying for our time). And he is now one of my favorite directors. With The Sixth Sense and Signs, he manages to make movies that can truly terrify the audience, and he doesn't use blood & gore, he uses suspense and just simple horror. They are both only rated PG-13, and are both real crowd-scarers, which tells you this guy is really something.To sum it up This is one of VERY VERY few movies that had me laughing out loud one minute, and then jumping out of my seat in shock the next. Lots of laughs, great acting, awesome directing, truly terrifying material, shock value, all the suspense you can handle and then some, what more do you want from a movie? Little kids saying the darndest things? Excellent character build-up? Drama? Well you get all of those too. Signs is one of the best movies of 2002 so far.
