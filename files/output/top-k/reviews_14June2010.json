Sure, on principle, everything could be done, and it almost was. Indeed the story of the making of the film is what is on anyone\/everyone's mind when it comes to this film, which is the poster child for cinematic (that is auteur) excess in Hollywood, where a director who was too high on himself following just two films- one of them a best picture\/director winner- gave him carte blanche to do anything.The ultimate shame was that Cimino was a good director who just became way too full of himself, and while not entirely his fault- certainly studio encouragement to indulge didn't help- the spiraling of an originally 7-8 million Western to 36 to 40 million made it a scandal celebre. That it sunk a studio is almost besides the point; it was used as THE example by Hollywood, already looking for an excuse for producers to take over and big tent-pole movies to reign, as to how artists were out of control. It is a notorious case, and certainly far from a flawless movie. Some, indeed, would say it is all-around, from its making to how it turned out, why the word 'fiasco' was created.And yet coming to the film some thirty years later, looking at it in its full 219 minute 'lust for glory' version, (not the 5 hour version, doesn't exist anymore), it can be looked at with fresh eyes, particularly from someone not alive when it was released. How does it stand as a film, on its own legs as it were? Well... it's not bad, really, not at all. What's good about it turns out to more often than not be mesmerizing, fascinating and fully epic in scope. In Cimino's mix of history and personal style, of a deconstructive look at how the West Was Won in a story of the Johnson County Wars, where immigrants were looked upon as anarchist rebels who had to be 'taken out' by the establishment who didn't want them in Wyoming, it's ambitious to say the least. It's got a dash of War & Peace with the violent velocity of Peckinpah at his nastiest and the captivating eye of Vilmos Zsigmond as director of Photography.Indeed if nothing else the film is completely gorgeous to look at. In that department Cimino spared no expense for good purpose, and many of the shots of Wyoming mountains and fields, and how he uses sepia and brown and dust in the shots is nothing short of a miracle. And the music is also, often, very sad and heartfelt, and sometimes very uplifting like in the masterful roller-rink dance sequence (both parts, the chaotic mass of people skating around to an upbeat tune, and then the slow-turning-fast crescendo of the song being played to James and Ella dancing by themselves). And the final battle sequence(s), when all told at about half an hour to forty-five minutes in length, is extraordinary to experience visceral, wild, out of control but seen with an eye and pace and passion that is almost enough to recommend the picture wholeheartedly... well, almost.Where does the picture come into trouble? On a few key points really. It's not that the script is always a bother, but when Cimino isn't focusing on the key plot, about the 'death list' that the Association has cooked up, or on the really necessary moments of James\/Nathan\/Ella's relationship (as strained as it can sometimes be, written that is, not so much performed since Walken and Huppert are terrific together), it meanders a lot, and there's only so much time that one spends with the one-dimensional immigrants that one tires of them. It's like, we get it immigrants, good, Association, bad. Gotcha. But sometimes, as sometimes happened in The Deer Hunter as well, Cimino has to put words in people's mouths when they're not needed (or, perhaps, just not the right words). A shame since an actor like Sam Waterston, when he's given something good, really nails it. Same with John Hurt, at least in his early scenes, before he becomes a strange parody, a guy who doesn't want any part of the War but staggers around making poetic declarations like a sage or something.Two other problems the length of certain scenes and sequences, and Kris Kristofferson. For the latter, I should mention that I like Kristofferson as an actor but here he seems sort of miscast as the main hero of the story (and, had Cimino cast an actual star who could carry the film much better, the B.O. would've fared slightly better). For the former... well, I wouldn't want to see the film any other way, as it is his director's cut, but in this cut, one can see what did and definitely didn't work in the pacing. It's almost as if Cimino filmed into a corner, and could only keep the pace as it was, at least in his mind. That he also lets the sound mix, ala Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller, become muddled and with one having to strain to sometimes hear the actors amid background noise, is a further annoyance.The pros for the film are high, almost, perhaps, in spite of what does not work in Cimino's 'final cut'. It's also interesting as an artifact of excess like James Cameron's Avatar, all of the money is up there on the screen, and it's a little painful to watch here and there, or a Western Xanadu built by CF Kane.

A guy who I knew then was obsessed with Jodie Foster and the Beatles -- I don't know which came first, or if that was why he watched the movie or if the movie was why he was a fan of Jodie Foster and the Beatles. But those two things seemed to dominate his life and they came together in this movie, and as his close friends we all shared in the enjoyment of this fine film.The main story of Five Corners is about John Turturro's character Heinz, a disturbed young man who has just been released from prison for attacking Jodie Foster's character Linda. In between Linda and Heinz are two other concerned young men her on-again off-again boyfriend Jamie (Todd Graff), who was crippled by Heinz in the fight, and the boy who actually stopped the rape by smashing a pitcher over Heinz' head, Harry (Tim Robbins), who has become a pacifist in the mean-time under the influence of Martin Luther King Jr. Heinz' reappearance puts Harrys' non-violence to the test and strains Linda and Jamie's relationship. There's also a side plot involving a pair of young women who get ditched by their protector and spend a night and an afternoon carousing and adventuring with a couple of strange boys. The continual cross-cutting between the different plots makes the film feel a bit like American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused, coming-of-age films of that genre. But this film has quite a bit more violence and perversity to it, and you don't notice the music nearly as much.All the young actors acquit themselves well in this film. Jodie Foster, although perhaps sadly typed at this point in her career (or forever?) as a rape victim, sheds all layers of movie star with this very believable humble girl who's more intelligent than she's been taught to reveal. Robbins gets some wonderful scenes with Kathleen Chalfant who plays his mother, and a really excellent first scene with Turturro. Of course it's Turturro who does the heavy lifting, coming off brilliantly in a very difficult role. It's a bit like watching a young DeNiro, seeing him in this movie. He's clearly got his psycho act down but he never fails to interact with all the other cast members in a believable way. His big pre-climactic confrontation with his mother could stand up under any comparison. In fact that was the main effect for me of seeing this movie; I kept my eyes out for Turturro after that, and have not been disappointed on the whole.The film's fabric is a bit shaky; screenwriter John Patrick Shanley was still a bit of an excited novice and it shows. There's a lot of talent here, a lot of good lines, but the structure of the thing doesn't really support the kind of dextrous switching between comedy and drama that his dialog demands. And the director Tony Bill, while bringing the film a pleasing intimacy and warmth, can't do anything to stylize the film and make it really propel itself along. We're always sort of waiting for what Turturro is going to do next, instead of just being carried along with the feeling of the whole piece. That makes the scenes in the largely unrelated sub-plot feel even more like filler or padding.On the whole however, this is a very good film and I highly recommend it. I was surprised when I came here on IMDb that there were so few comments and votes. I thought it was a pretty famous movie, but apparently my friends and I were part of a cult and we didn't even know it! Why not join up?

A guy who I knew then was obsessed with Jodie Foster and the Beatles -- I don't know which came first, or if that was why he watched the movie or if the movie was why he was a fan of Jodie Foster and the Beatles. But those two things seemed to dominate his life and they came together in this movie, and as his close friends we all shared in the enjoyment of this fine film.The main story of Five Corners is about John Turturro's character Heinz, a disturbed young man who has just been released from prison for attacking Jodie Foster's character Linda. In between Linda and Heinz are two other concerned young men her on-again off-again boyfriend Jamie (Todd Graff), who was crippled by Heinz in the fight, and the boy who actually stopped the rape by smashing a pitcher over Heinz' head, Harry (Tim Robbins), who has become a pacifist in the mean-time under the influence of Martin Luther King Jr. Heinz' reappearance puts Harrys' non-violence to the test and strains Linda and Jamie's relationship. There's also a side plot involving a pair of young women who get ditched by their protector and spend a night and an afternoon carousing and adventuring with a couple of strange boys. The continual cross-cutting between the different plots makes the film feel a bit like American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused, coming-of-age films of that genre. But this film has quite a bit more violence and perversity to it, and you don't notice the music nearly as much.All the young actors acquit themselves well in this film. Jodie Foster, although perhaps sadly typed at this point in her career (or forever?) as a rape victim, sheds all layers of movie star with this very believable humble girl who's more intelligent than she's been taught to reveal. Robbins gets some wonderful scenes with Kathleen Chalfant who plays his mother, and a really excellent first scene with Turturro. Of course it's Turturro who does the heavy lifting, coming off brilliantly in a very difficult role. It's a bit like watching a young DeNiro, seeing him in this movie. He's clearly got his psycho act down but he never fails to interact with all the other cast members in a believable way.

Former pro wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper is kicking ass because he's all out of bubble gum. What more do you need? But seriously folks, They Live is a mostly cool little B-Movie from famed director John Carpenter but it suffers from a bit of schizophrenia. Carpenter seems to want They Live to be both a balls-out action movie and a message movie all rolled into one film, and though he tries hard to envelop the viewer in creeping paranoia, by the end he's been more successful at the ass-kicking part.Piper stars as Nada, a mulleted drifter in a flannel shirt who wanders into L.A. looking for construction work. He takes up residence at a homeless shanty town outside a church where strange goings on seem to happen in the dead of night. One day the police show up, raid the church, and bulldoze the homeless encampment. Piper enters the now-abandoned church and finds a stash of special sunglasses. When he puts one of them on, his formerly Technicolor world is now a stark black and white, and he can see the subliminal messages hidden under every advertisement, on all TV broadcasts, and on every newspaper and magazine cover. Things like OBEY, STAY ASLEEP, NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT, THIS IS YOUR GOD (on a dollar bill). Even more shocking is that through the glasses, some of the people he sees aren't really people, they're bug-eyed, skull faced alien beings. It quickly becomes apparent that these alien beings have taken the places of the rich, the elite and the powerful, while regular Earthlings like Nada have been relegated to the bottom of the food chain. So what's a red blooded American to do when his eyes have been opened to the truth? Pick up a shotgun and start blasting away at every skull face he sees, of course! Now a wanted man after a shootout with police, Nada succeeds in turning a fellow construction worker (Keith David) to his point of view thanks to the special sunglasses (the epic length fight scene between them that leads to David's conversion is already legend and needs no further discussion here), and our heroes hook up with an anti-alien resistance movement determined to find the enemy's broadcast signal, destroy it, and reveal the impostors to the world. I will leave it up to the viewer to find out for themselves if they're successful.As with most Carpenter films, there's a healthy dose of goofy humor underneath the skin of They Live. The scene when Piper first dons the magic glasses and sees what's hiding underneath everything is both creepy and hilarious at the same time. The film does have some pacing problems; it takes seemingly forever for the action to kick into gear but once it does They Live is a white knuckle ride to the very end, packed with shootouts, fist fights, and one-liners aplenty. Piper may not be much of an actor, but he doesn't really need to be in a film like this, and he's given suitable backup in David.Intended as a satire of 1980s materialism and consumption, They Live pretty much went over the heads of most viewers when it was current, but nowadays it holds up as a pretty decent gouging of everything that was wrong with that decade. Even scarier is that given the current world economic situation, the story could even take place today. Small wonder, then, that a remake of They Live is reportedly in the works. I hope they leave in the line about the bubble gum. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 June 2010","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" How can you not love this movie?

Then along comes a woman who enters their world and turns it upside down by allowing them to experience life to the fullest after opening a chocolaterie. As the villagers become more and more tempted to visit her shop, she is able to open their eyes through her chocolate to a world completely different from what they know and trust. At the same time, Vianne, the owner of the chocolaterie, struggles with her own desires as she is forced to follow the North wind as her mother did. Only when she decides to allow her mother's spirit alone to move on, does she begin to experience her own happiness. The theme of the story is about love and the experiences of life even if we must go against the ways of tradition and the past. It's about finding out what makes us happy and working towards it while respecting others. The major characters include the mayor (Alfred Molina) of the village who is always trying to do what is right even though his own private world is that of despair.

Then along comes a woman who enters their world and turns it upside down by allowing them to experience life to the fullest after opening a chocolaterie. As the villagers become more and more tempted to visit her shop, she is able to open their eyes through her chocolate to a world completely different from what they know and trust. At the same time, Vianne, the owner of the chocolaterie, struggles with her own desires as she is forced to follow the North wind as her mother did. Only when she decides to allow her mother's spirit alone to move on, does she begin to experience her own happiness. The theme of the story is about love and the experiences of life even if we must go against the ways of tradition and the past. It's about finding out what makes us happy and working towards it while respecting others.

There are some definite flaws, but they are either forgivable, or they come with the territory. That being said, this is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen.Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) is a sixteen year old who after spending most of her life living with her mother, has moved to Canada to live with her father, Steve (William Peterson), his new wife Laura (Amy Brenneman) and Laura's son, Toby (Christopher Gray). While at a rave, she meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg), a hot older guy with whom Nicole quickly becomes smitten. But as with every relationship, the smitten learn that even those who seem perfect have their flaws. Before long, Nicole is wishing she'd never met him.Part of the reason why this film works so well is that the script is brilliant. The dialogue and the characters are so real that the characters become real individuals instead of pawns to be terrorized by the nice guy-turned-psychopath. Even the character establishing moments, which most thrillers treat as obligatory, are just as engaging as the terrifying ending. It is genuinely refreshing to watch characters who are so real. This isn't an artistic screenplay, but credit must go to Christopher Crowe for creating dialogue that is so naturalThe other reason why this film works so well is because the actors populating it are wholly believable. I've never been a die-hard Reese Witherspoon fan. She's a good actress, but there's something off-putting about her, as if she's trying too hard to be natural. Not here. Playing the part with equal amounts independence and naiveté, Witherspoon is dynamite. Mark Wahlberg is terrific as David, playing the sweet guy and psycho equally well. In movies like this (like The Hand that Rocks the Cradle), the villains run the risk of becoming pawns of the script. Not here. David is a living, breathing human being, albeit a very twisted one. William Peterson has no problem essaying the part of a dad trying to raise a teenage daughter. Amy Brenneman is especially interesting as the new mom, whose attempts to get on the good side of her step-daughter may cloud her judgment.James Foley has created a near masterpiece of the genre. He lets everything unfold naturally, and aside from a few minor instances and one over-the-top scene, it's a perfect film. What occurs here isn't suspense, it's actual terror. It may be flawed, but I cannot let a movie that scared me this much go with anything less than a 10. This is a dark, brutal and scary film, and it will leave you shaken and exhausted by the end of it.

Also at the time I didn't really care for the animation, which I found to be rather cold and creepy (having no idea it was rotoscoped or even what rotoscoping was). However as the years have gone by and the Jackson adaptations come and gone, I feel more and more drawn to this rare piece of absolutism as I would a painting by Vincent Van Gogh or Salvadore Dali.Bakshi always had a flair for adult-oriented animation, and finally with this he found a subject befitting of his style. Lord of the Rings is some overall dark, intriguing material in comparison with The Hobbit and really was deserving of something imaginative and stylistic as only Bakshi's team could deliver. Most everything comes together quite well here with the bizarre rotoscoped animation, the characterizations, the voice performances, and Leonard Rosenman's supercharged score (one of his career best, up there and quite similar to his work on THE CAR and RACE WITH THE DEVIL). It's rather unfortunate that funding ran out and the project had to be hurriedly wrapped, quite a similar heartbreaking story as to what happened with his previous year's WIZARDS.The film is clearly unfinished in many regards. The most heinous act it commits is to end right in the middle of a major action scene with absolutely no resolution to speak of! Even ignoring its abbreviation of the books, one has to admit that narratively this film is a complete disaster. I can't imagine the marketing for this movie honestly claiming it to only be the first half of the book trilogy brought to screen. Needless to say I'd be surprised if angry audiences didn't get up and boo at the screen en masse back in 1978 witnessing perhaps the biggest cheat or, dare I say even, rip off in cinematic history.Similarly this film has a very rough feel to it in terms of animation and pacing and is entirely inconsistent. Things begin fairly polished and kid-friendly but get darker, drearier, more violent (with some surprisingly graphic gore), and sloppier as the film goes on. By the end we get the vast majority of the film not even properly animated and more or less just treated film material with undercranked smoke and clouds filling in the for the background plates. It's quite similar to the bizarre psychedelic cost saving measures Bakshi made when he took over the second season of the animated 60's Spiderman cartoons. This whole Joseph Conradian experience of a descent into hell is pretty overwhelming, oppressive, and possibly even emotionally scarring for young viewers, but it's something I've strangely come to love about this film over time.Yes, dare I say it, I just love this movie. You can't deny that it has its share of magical moments like Frodo's escape from the Wraiths, Gandalf opening the doors to Moria, and the showdown with the Balrog. Much like David Lynch's DUNE it created a vivid, creative, and whole-hearted realization of a world out of the severe butchery its source material. There's a small, artistic, and very personal loving feel given to this movie which I found lacking in Jackson's trilogy. Bakshi and his overworked team of animators may not have created the best film ever, but they did a lot with the little they had. I just wish they'd been able to see it through.

I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie.

With Margot being the rich one Tony fears that if she leaves him he will be broke even though the relationship is a front, since Margot has left her fortune to Tony in her will he decides to commit the perfect murder. Tony blackmails small time crook Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) into killing Margot, Tony says he has devised the perfect murder & that no-one will suspect anything but even the best laid plans can encounter problems & on the night of the murder it's not Margot who ends up dead...Produced & directed by Alfred Hitchcock this thriller was based on the 1952 Broadway stage play by Frederick Knott & he also wrote the screenplay here, very talky & exposition heavy with only one main indoor location you can certainly see the stage influence here & while Dial M for Murder is a solid film I personally don't think it's a classic. Although very talky barely a line of dialogue is wasted as a complex plot of murder, blackmail, adultery & detection is painted over it's rather excessive one hour & forty five minute duration. One big problem I have with Dial M for Murder is that there are no mystery elements here, nothing is ambiguous & it's all far too obvious whats going on as it's spelled out very clearly during it's numerous exposition scenes. While Dial M for Murder is a decent thriller the fact that nothing is ever a mystery & who did it & how it was done & exactly what happens is made perfectly clear I did sit there watching but not really getting involved. Also the climax in which Tony is very confusing as it's all about a key, where it has been, where it is, where it should be & the film just left me behind a bit here as you can't keep track of who has what key or or the movement of the key as again it's all talk rather than say a flashback which would have made things clearer. The character's are good & Inspector Hubbard reminded me of Columbo, in fact the film itself reminded me of a Columbo episode with someone committing an apparently perfect murder before a nosey & clever cop figures it all out as he pesters the suspect & has endless questions.Dial M for Murder was a stage play & it's easy to see here, there's only one main location & that's indoors & it has lots of people sitting or standing around talking with little action. Originally shot & briefly released in 3-D some of the compositions are obvious with strange placement of foreground objects although I doubt the 3-D changed the film much. Being from a more innocent time there's no swearing but someone is stabbed in the back with scissors. You know Dial M for Murder is rated number nine on the American Film Institutes ten greatest mystery films but again I will say that there is no mystery here, it's all made perfectly clear from the word go what going on & people's motives are also very black and white.With a supposed budget of about $1,400,000 this is unspectacular stuff, it's very static & stagy but I am sure that was intentional. Although set entirely in London this was filmed in California. The acting is alright, it's not terrible but again there's a lot of standing around.Dial M for Murder is a good solid thriller, I enjoyed it for what I was & can certainly see the Columbo influences here but there's no real mystery going on & there's no great twist either. I don't know, it's good but I certainly wouldn't cal it a classic or even one of Hitchcock's best. Remade numerous times for telly & as A Perfect Murder (1998) with Michael Douglas.

What became of him? He seems to have fallen victim to the seduction of the big budget martial arts genre (Hero and Curse of the Golden Flower). I could not but lament this on returning recently to one of the lesser known but nevertheless rewarding works of his earlier period, Shanghai Triad. What he once did was often quite remarkable. Although on the surface the plot reads just like another gangster movie with feuding gangs fighting for supremacy in drug ridden 1930's Shanghai, what raises it to a higher level is that we observe and try to make sense of the nefarious goings-on through the eyes of a 14 year old boy. The opening shot just after the start of the credits is a closeup of Shuisheng who has just arrived in the city with his uncle to be placed as the servant to the mistress of their Tang relative who is Boss of the most powerful gangster clan around. From then on the boy is seldom away from the action which includes all sorts of murderous deeds. It's quite plain that he is just as bewildered as we are, a fact emphasised by the continual return to his closeup with those quizzical staring eyes. Much has been written about the brilliance of Gong Li's performance as Bijou, the Boss's mistress, but for me this is the boy's film as the sense of audience identification with him is so complete. We even see his view of the world upside down in the final shots when he is trussed up and suspended from a pole as a punishment. The first half of the film set in the city moves at a furious pace, brilliant camera-work emphasising reds and the smoky atmosphere of the cabaret where Bijou performs. Thereafter the action moves to a remote river island where the main protagonists take refuge from those about to get them. Somehow this second half with its more leisurely tempo does not quite maintain the bravura of what has gone before, but who to complain after so much excitement.

It had to please the fans of the boy wizard, it had to please J.K. Rowling and it had to please those who enjoy the magic of cinema. The fact that it managed all of this is quite a spectacular trick in itself. The fact that it did it all so well is nigh on miraculous.We're in safe (perhaps too safe?) hands with director Chris Columbus, who brings to the screen the tale of Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe), his miserable life with the Dursleys and then his introduction to the fantastic Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry. He gets two instant best friends in the shape of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and a mix of guiding figures in the shape of the Hogwarts staff; including benevolent headmaster Albus Dumbledore (played by Richard Harris), Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith). Will school life be the best years for Harry or will he who must not be named find some way to return and exact his revenge upon The Boy Who Lived?I read the Harry Potter books when they first started becoming popular and by the time this movie came out I was more than familiar with the universe that Rowling had created so I was as pleased as anyone to see what a good job had been done in bringing Hogwarts and it's inhabitants to the screen.It's far from perfect though. Radcliffe is a bit wooden, Watson is just damned annoying and a lot of the other kids show their inexperience BUT hindsight is a marvellous thing. Watching the sequels allows you to see the youngsters grow comfortably into their roles and at least their awkward style in this first outing feels completely in character for a bunch of kids thrown into a new school together.Another failing is the rather weak villain this time round, though I must say that the movie's only real flaw here is following the book and any deviation would most certainly have failed so there was really no other approach to take.However, if the acting is bothering you and the pace isn't quick enough then take solace in the fact that you're never far away from a little touch of magic, be it in the shape of some better acting from the likes of Ian Hart and John Hurt or the fantastic recreation of the magical paintings that adorn the walls of Hogwarts school. Then we have the Sorting Hat, an enjoyably sneering Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton, very good from the off), the inevitable bit of Quidditch and much more that will please those who can let themselves go and enter a magical world contained within a movie screen.See this if you like Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix.

He actually merges them in such a way that it enriches the experience for the viewer. There are plenty of twists. The movie opens with a few glimpse of summer in New York city and then it quickly switches to Sonny and Sal taking over the bank. The reaction of the hostages is one of the most amusing sequences. At first they are in shock but this gradually follows with excitement. The hostages later on enjoy the attention.The theme of homosexuality is also introduced in a subtle way. Thankfully, it's not presented as an issue, it's just there. The relationship between Sonny and Leon is just like any other souring urban relationship.Al Pacino delivers yet another outstanding performances that easily ranks among his finest works. There are several sequences where he displays his gift through sheer raw acting. A restrained John Cazale is equally remarkable. The way he conveys fear through his eyes gives the viewer a sense that he might explode at any time or have a nervous breakdown (and he probably may have had the standoff proceeded any longer). The rest of the cast, especially the actors who play the hostages, are brilliant.Lumet and Pacino had done it again. Easily, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is one of the best heist movies (if not THE best). 'One that's not to be missed.

Al Pacino of The Godfather trilogy plays the eponymous Cuban refugee sent to America during the infamous Mariel wave of boat people when Castro emptied his jails. This lengthy but engrossing drama depicts how the protagonist made it to the top of the world. When they made this movie in 1983, the producers probably had no idea about either the controversy that would erupt during the lensing in south Florida or the ultimate cult status that this corrosive tragedy would generate. Eventually, the film stirred up so much ill feeling that Universal had to complete the shooting in California. De Palma and scenarist Oliver Stone took one of the three greatest crime movies of the century and exploited a historical event to make their gangsters reminiscent of the immigrant gangsters during the era of the first Scarface movie. Indeed, at one point, Tony Montana explains that he learned English because his American father took him to see Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney movies. Considering that the film runs just shy of three hours, the filmmakers do a good job of balancing the violent empire building scenes with Tony's domestic life. Composer Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack is surely one of the classics. Lenser John A. Alonzo's widescreen color photography is elegant. Squeamish people should probably avoid this trigger-happy, shoot'em up saga, the chainsaw scene in the bathroom of a motel is pretty gory stuff.Our protagonist Tony (Al Pacino) rises from the streets literally after he performs a murder for Miami drug dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia of Prizzi's Honor) and obtains a greed card for his closest pal Manny (Steven Bauer of Raising Cain) and himself. They start out a dishwashers for a street vendor, but it doesn't take them long to put on their suits and ties and then they never look back. Later, Lopez henchman Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham of Amadeus) offers Tony and Manny $500 to unload a marijuana boat. Tony thinks the deal stinks; he has heard $1000 was that the going price for unloading pot. Omar winds up offering them a bigger paycheck. If they can pick up twp keys of cocaine from a gang of Colombians arriving in Miami, Tony and Manny can earn $5000. Tony and Manny along with a couple of their Cuban buddies pull up to the Sun Ray Motel, and life is never the same afterward Tony enters the room. The Colombian and Tony play cat and mouse to start with, but things change quickly when the Colombians demand to see Tony's money is. They grab Tony's back-up man Angel Fernandez (Pepe Sernaat of Honeysuckle Rose) the door and cut him up with the chainsaw before Manny bursts in the room with a machine gun and blasts away at everybody in sight. The evil Colombian chieftain who wielded the chainsaw tries to escape, but Tony chases him down in the middle of the street in front of everybody and puts a bullet in his head. Not only does Tony bring Lopez the coke but also the money. Lopez takes an immediate liking to Tony, and Tony sets his sights on Lopez's slinky but gorgeous squeeze, Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer of The Hollywood Knights), but she seems more intent on snorting cocaine. Lopez assures Tony that if he flies straight with him that he will enjoy a long, happy life. He tells him that the biggest problem that Tony will face is what to do with all the stinking money. Lopez sends Omar and Tony to South America to talk with a major drug-lord Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar of The End of August) about cocaine. Sosa smells a rat and has Omar taken up in a helicopter and thrown out with a noose around his throat. According to Sosa, Omar had informed on a couple of drug dealers. Predictably, Lopez is furious when Tony comes back with Omar and has a deal of a lifetime for Lopez that the crime kingpin cannot afford to buy. Tony assures Lopez that he can make up any difference in the lack of money by going out and hitting the streets. When Lopez argues that the Diaz brothers won't take kindly to Tony's ambitious movie, Tony erupts in a rage at Lopez. He is prepared to kill anybody that gets in his way. Lopez puts a contract out on Tony and two killers try to mow him down at the Babylon Club. Tony and his men kill both Lopez and Tony takes Elvira as his wife. He buys an estate, sets up a real estate business, and lives large, installing a 24-hour security monitoring system at his home. Ironically, Tony's affection for children bring him down along with his ferocious coke habit. When the cartel finds itself in the spotlight because of an anti-narcotic activist, Sosa appeals to Tony to help them. Tony is facing a stretch in prison, but Sosa assures him that he will come out clean if he helps his non-English speaking killer murder the activist with a car bomb. Tony betrays Sosa and kills his man when the man tries to blow up the activist's car with the man's wife and two children. Sosa hits back with a gang of gunmen who descend on Tony's estate.The themes of trust, greed, betrayal and cocaine abuse permeate Oliver Stone's screenplay, and he has penned some memorable dialogue. Nothing exceeds like excess, Elvira observes as she snorts some coke. The performances are all excellent, especially Loggia. De Palma and Stone carefully stage a terrific finale when dozens of armed Colombians attack his home and he breaks out a deadly assault rifle with a rocket launcher.

The plot is a merger of Critters and ET, in which a little girl befriends an alien and learns various life lessons. Though at times generic, the film has enough interesting flourishes to differentiate it from most other Disney flicks.3. The alien at the heart of the picture is not a cutesy creature, but a military weapon designed to destroy planets. Half the fun of the picture is watching this thing crawling about, cleverly adapting to situations and juggling its biological need to destroy with that of self-preservation.4. The character of Lilo is not your typical Disney kid, but a truly bizarre little girl who mutters matter-of-fact statements about a fish who controls the weather and a stuffed doll whose days are numbered because a bug laid eggs in its ear.5. The film tries hard to mimic the style and tone of Hayao Miyazaki, but doesn't quite manage.6. There's some neat psychology in the film. Stitch is like the embodiment of Lilo's self-destructiveness, her need to destroy everything, lashing out because she's an outcast and lost her parents in an accident. By taming Stitch, Lilo tames her own inner turmoil.7. Like ET, the alien is a sort of surrogate family member who heals the family unit.8. The opening coda and the final act are weak.
