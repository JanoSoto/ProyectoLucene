[{"date":"30 December 2013","score":"","review":" Shrek is an irascible ogre who lives in a swamp and enjoys his isolation. Much against his will, he is pressured into journeying with a donkey to save a Princess from a dragon. The journey turns out to be one of self discovery.Let me say at the start that I am not a big fan of Mike Myers' voicings here. He is OK, but I've heard better. Having said that, everything else about this film is perfect. It would be very good as a straightforward fantasy adventure, but when you factor in the constant, and spot on, potshots at movies in general (and Disney in particular), it raises the game substantially. Factor in CGI of a standard not previously seen, non-stop gags, exhilarating action, and inspired voice talent - especially Eddie Murphy - and you have a classic.I repeat - a classic, and highly recommended.
