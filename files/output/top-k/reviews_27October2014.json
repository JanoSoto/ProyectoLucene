During the course of the movie, Bela Lugosi provides narration.Ed Wood made is directorial debut with this masterpiece of the bad movie genre. Similar to some of Ed Wood's other movies, this film is loaded with everything that you would expect to see in his movies, with bad directing, laughable acting, corny dialogue, and several plot points that make no sense whatsoever. First off, I'll admit that I do have a thing for Ed Wood's movies, particularly his 1950's projects, before his sexploitation years. As a result, I decided to watch all of his movies that he made in the 1950's. In my honest to goodness point of view, I'll admit that although this movie is your quintessential Ed Wood picture, that means that it's on the level of so bad it's good. Ed Wood not only directed this movie, he also starred in it, playing the titular character(s). And when I watch this movie, I was not disappointed at all, it was everything that I was expecting it to be, in some sort of way, I guess you can say that Ed Wood was something of a genius, nobody, I repeat, nobody could take bad movies to the so bad it's good level that way that he could.In this movie, the acting is as bad as it could be, although I did enjoy it, I enjoyed laughing at it that is. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who provides narration for the film, although it makes little sense, such as Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep and eats small boys, or something along the lines of that. And how could I forget the infamous Pull the string! Pull the string! line? I haven't forgotten it I'll tell you that, as that line is immortal. Ed Wood gives a very famous (or infamous) performance as Glen\/Glenda, and in addition to his superb directing skills, he also proves that he could be a superb actor as well. Although I will say one thing, his acting skills leave much to be desired. And to add to that, everybody else in the movie does superb jobs as well. By the way, I guess you probably know that I'm being sarcastic right there.To all fans of Ed Wood This movie is legendary, it's the legendary beginning of the career of a director whose career defined the meaning of so bad it's good. When you watch Glen Or Glenda, you'll laugh at all of the cheesy qualities that this movie has. But like I said, considering that it's Ed Wood, he takes the cheesy qualities and elevates it to the level of an art form. The bottom line, is that Glen Or Glenda is a masterpiece of movies that are so bad they're good, and it's also a must see for your education on B-Movies. Needless to say, you should also check out Ed Wood's other 1950's films, particularly he most infamous one, Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ed Wood, you were a genius, if you were still alive, I would thank you for entertaining me with your genius works of art.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2014","score":"","review":" Glen Or Glenda focuses on two people, a transvestite named Glen\/Glenda, and then a trans-gender person named Alan\/Ann.

Where is the big battle against the Indians or fast galloping posse following an outlaw, thats the question. The answer is simple, less is more if you know how to do it right. And that opening scene does that brilliantly, it shows the viewer exactly what to expect. Almost cartoonish characters, rough atmosphere and suspense, you just know there wont be John Wayne type hero coming to save the day.As the movies progress, the plot and questions are being answered in a slow but very rewarding way. The protagonist played by Bronson is interesting and almost mysterious character because at times you have no idea about his intentions but then again just a look in his eyes or note played from his harmonica can tell you a lot. The first time when I saw him play that harmonica instead of talking, I found it a bit ironic but as the movie went on I started to understand it, because the only purpose he is there is to have payback with frank, so he doesn't want business with anyone else.Henry Fonda is great as the antagonist and Jason Robards adds so much to the movie, his character can be liked but also disliked at times, what makes it so enjoyable to watch. Claudia Cardinale's Jill brings credibility and puts the whole story together. And Morricone's music makes the scenes come alive, its a shame that nowadays movie soundtracks doesn't support the movie the same way as they used to.As conclusion, Once Upon a Time in the West is in my opinion Leone's most complete work and a great achievement in movie making. There is only one question left, could this story really have been true or is it only a fairy tale. As the title says Once Upon a Time...so its up to the viewers to decide that.

In fact, the movie is so lacadaisy that I think even the stars were checking their watches.The movie has all the earmarks of what could have been. It stars Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short whose brilliant individual work on 'Saturday Night Live' is completely missed here. They play The Three Amigos; a comedy team whose recent box office receipts has caused the studio to hand them their walking papers.Meanwhile down in Mexico a woman sees one of their movies and thinks they are the real deal. She sends a fractured telegram hiring them to save their village from banditos and being in need of work they oblige. Unfortunately they misread the cry for help and think that they are being called to do a publicity show which leads to a long (and I do mean long) series of misunderstandings until very late in the film when they begin to realize that the banditos aren't kidding around.Steve Martin whom I liked in some of his more critically panned films like the underrated 'The Man With Two Brains' seems too in on the joke. Martin Short does almost nothing and Chevy Chase gets one or two moments right and then stands to the side of the screen looking on at the moment.Maybe the problem is that the film feels too safe. We get the feeling that Martin, Chase and Short are in on the joke and that kills the spontaneity of the comedy. The Three Amigos have a trademark gesture which ends with them thrusting their hips forward and coughing. That's not funny because it feels rehearsed. I like it when comedians don't play the moment for laughs. Watch Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein' when he is trying to figure out how to work the revolving bookcase and you'll see what I mean.

The story involves a New York cop named John Mcclane(Bruce Willis) who is coming to California to meet his estranged wife on Christmas Eve at her office. Mcclane comes off as a rugged American cop from the 20th century who can't tolerate the life and the youth of California nor is he very well versed in high culture and art.He is a down to earth fellow who is not pretentious and says what he thinks without much complication. As luck would have it, on that very day i.e. on the Christmas Eve,a gang of German terrorists decide to break into the building and take hostages led by the infamous Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman. Gruber is suave,sharp and well educated, so pretty much like the opposite of Mcclane. Mcclane gives the terrorists the slip and thus begins one man's fight to outsmart a whole gang of terrorists and save the day.I know this is not the popular opinion, but I found this film very dull. It uses the clichéd story arc of a main character who has marriage problems and then by using unbelievable bravery in larger than life situations helps save the lives of people and again get into the good books of his wife. There are so many scenes which look unrealistic and cheesy. So many characters in this movie are downright idiots like the Deputy Police Commissioner, the FBI officials, Mcclane's Limo driver,etc. Some of the lines spoken by the Deputy Commissioner are almost laughably silly. I know action film scripts are supposed to have conveniences, but this film takes the benefit of too many of those. The ultimate encounter at the climax of the film ends with another silly set piece that only points to bad writing.However having said that the film has a few things going for it. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are extremely good in their roles. Willis completely commits himself to the role physically and successfully sells the desperation of Mcclane's character. Rickman marvelously plays an intelligent and intimidating villain who has the ability to match the wits of our hero at every step. Lastly among the positives it has to be admitted that some of the action scenes and effects were very well executed considering it was the eighties.But overall I found this to be an average action film and had it not been for Willis and Rickman, my rating would have been lower than 5\/10. Some people will say that since I have watched so many films that have come after Die Hard which have used the plots and techniques used originally by Die Hard,I might not be able to appreciate the movie as much as I should, but I completely dismiss that thought. Seinfeld is a sitcom whose material has been used and reused in so many other sitcoms later, but when I still watch Seinfeld it looks and feels as witty and as sharp as ever. But unfortunately Die Hard doesn't pass that test. If this is the best out of all the films in the franchise, then sadly I have to bid farewell to John Mcclane as I am not interested in checking out the sequels anymore. Our paths won't converge again in the future.

Derek from the opening scene is almost looked at as a Christ like figure when the cops arrive they ask him to drop the weapon and turn around. The camera angle is upward and it goes slow motion. This scene makes him appear like a superhuman or God like figure especially when he puts his arms out like he is on a cross. Derek's tattoos are very noticeable in this scene you see the D.O.C tattoo which normally means department of corrections. But if you really think of it as a struggle to change to help his brother Danny than you might say it could stand for die on cross like God did.After the opening scene the story is told from Danny's point of view. Their father was a fire fighter that had been shot while on duty trying to put out a fire at a possible drug house. Their father seemed to plant a racist seed in Derek and Danny's brain at breakfast one morning when Derek had brought up about his teacher having them read a book about affirmative action. From their on he flashed back to the coming of power of his brother in the DOC. Everyone in the DOC seemed to look up to his brother as a leader. On the basketball courts the DOC play an all-black basketball team for the rights to stay on the courts. Derek ends up slam dunking a basketball to win the game he then hangs on the rim. This is shot in slow motion once again peering up at him hanging showing him as a power figure once again. While in prison Derek starts to become friends with a black man Lamont. They become friends while working in the laundry room at the prison. While Derek is locked up Danny starts to get into the DOC heavily and following after Cameron. Dr. Bob Sweeney was a teacher of Derek's in high school, and is now Danny's teacher. He ends up helping to get Derek out of prison early after he had been raped by other White Supremacist for becoming friends with black people in prison. Dr. Bob Sweeney wants Derek to help get Danny back on the straight and narrow. Once out Derek breaks ties with the DOC and starts to get Danny turned around. Everything seems to be looking up for Danny, Derek and their mother until the closing scene of the movie Danny has had a run in with a black student from his school in which this time the other student is finally going to get the last word. American History X in my opinion is very similar to Menace to Society in the way that the characters end up being fairly innocent in the start of the movie turn for the worst and start to make a turnaround for the better again and in both movies end up dying.Like I have pointed out I think the slow motion scenes along with the angle are two techniques to help show the theme of this movie. Everyone seems to look up to Derek and the slow motion throughout the different scenes adds to his power and authoritativeness of his character in this movie, by looking at him at an upward appearance along with panning over\/ at him and his muscular physique in slow motion to make sure he is given attention.No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. -Nelson Mandela ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2014","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A former skin head in L.A recently released from prison and now reformed, attempts to change his ways and correct his past battles, to better his brother that is following down the same dark path he had been down.The theme of American History X is struggle to change.

A highly amusing yet genuinely jolting mixture of comedy and horror, the film combined any number of disparate genres--the zombie film, the alien invasion film, the depressed\/suicidal cop-seeking-redemption film, the frat house comedy--into one highly satisfying stew, and yet, for some reason, failed to find its audience at the box office. With the advantage of hindsight, however, and in no small part thanks to the advent of the DVD revolution, Night of the Creeps, like many of its primary and secondary characters, is enjoying a very vigorous second life after having arisen from limbo, and is today appreciated for the highly entertaining, modest piece of work that it is.The opening sequences of the film are perhaps the best. The viewer is treated to a pitched battle aboard an alien spaceship, during which one of the diminutive ETs manages to jettison a canister of...something, which promptly plummets down to planet Earth, in the year 1959. Although the entire film can be regarded as a pastiche of and homage to the sci-fi B movies of the 1950s, the next sequence, filmed in B&W, is especially reminiscent. In a scene straight out of The Blob, two necking teenagers see a streaking meteor fall to the ground, and go to investigate. The male youth, Johnny, is attacked by something from the fallen canister, while his poor galpal, nervously waiting back at the car, is hacked to bits by an escaped ax murderer. Flash forward 27 years, to 1986, when we meet two college students, Chris (Jason Lively, who had appeared in European Vacation the year before) and J.C. (Steve Marshall), his handicapped best friend. When Chris develops an instantaneous crush on sorority girl Cynthia (Jill Whitlow), the pair decides that the only way to impress the young hottie is for the two of them to apply to the superhip Beta fraternity. The two break into a cryogenics lab in order to purloin a cadaver, as part of their hazing ordeal, but when the corpsicle suddenly comes to life, the two youths flee in fear. Too late, however. Before long, the awakened cadaver--soon revealed to be Johnny himself--begins to lumber around campus, and even worse...his body soon disgorges a swarm of scuttling, sluglike creatures, which only serve to spread the zombie contagion even further....Fans of so-called B movies will especially enjoy all the cinematic and directorial references with which writer\/director Dekker has filled his movie. The bulk of the film transpires at Corman University, and Chris', J.C.'s and Cynthia's surnames are, respectively, Romero, Carpenter Hooper and Cronenberg! Four of the detective sergeants on the zombie case are named Dante, De Palma, Landis and Raimi (Raimi is played by Bruce Solomon, who many will recall as another sergeant, Sgt. Dennis Foley, on TV's Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman), while veteran character actor Tom Atkins (who many will recognize from such films as John Carpenter's The Fog and Escape From New York, as well as from Lethal Weapon) plays that depressed\/suicidal head detective previously mentioned, a character named Cameron. And if all these wonderful wink-wink mentions aren't enough, one of the zombie victims in the film is shown watching the Ed Wood classic Plan 9 From Outer Space on TV, and B-movie legend Dick Miller pops up in a very amusing cameo, playing a police armorer. The film contains any number of memorable scenes, and the one in which the crippled J.C. is trapped in a bathroom with a swarm of the scurrying creeps should do for toilet stalls what Psycho did for showers and Jaws did for the beach. Those creeps, by the way, should really strike a chord in anyone who has ever been startled by a mouse or water bug speeding through his or her apartment or between their legs. Zippy as a rodent yet undeniably sluglike, they are memorable horror creations indeed. And in a film with consistently ingratiating performances from its largely no-name cast, Atkins really does shine, and gets to deliver the lion's share of the picture's best lines. His constantly repeated refrain, Thrill me, should have become some kind of cinematic catchphrase, on the order of Dirty Harry's Make my day (Dekker, in one of the deluxe DVD's copious extras, reveals that it was this line, which came to him as he slept, that served as the basis for the entire rest of the film), but is just one of a dozen great others that Det. Cameron amusingly grates during the course of his job here. A smart, audacious film says author Glenn Kay while describing Night of the Creeps in his Zombie Movies The Ultimate Guide, and darn, if that isn't ever the truth! Dekker, over the course of the next six years, would go on to direct Monster Squad and, um, RoboCop 3, neither of which this viewer has seen. Still, I very much doubt if either of those films provides such a deft balancing act of chills and laughs as does Night of the Creeps. The film is an unexpected winner from beginning to end (this viewer prefers the director's cut, by the way, with its returning-spaceship finale), and might leave you open mouthed with surprise. Better to tape that mouth shut, hence, in order to prevent an entry point for any of those darn creeps!
