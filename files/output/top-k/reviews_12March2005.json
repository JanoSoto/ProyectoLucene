We have all seen one of these before, whether flicking through the channels through insomnia, or through plain boredom and seem to catch the first five minutes of the film. So I could not get any sleep, since my circadian rhythms is gone to pot, and the TV was my only source of entertainment of that day, due to the lack of motivation of going out and money I have. What can i say, I am a university student? Watch out for Spoilers.The main character Pecker, is a amateur shutterbug, who would take any pictures of his humdrum but quirky life. He takes pictures of his bizarre family, which would consist of a ADHD little sister, a female sibling who is an MC for a gay strip club, a grandma who is seems to hear the Virgin Mary speak to her, even though it is her who provides the voice for her, a philantrophic mother and a father who wants to boycott the lesbian strip club next door to his bar. The little world that he lives in gets the camera treatment and the local people get involved as well. Pecker decides to hold his photographs on show in his work place, whereby a high profile art collector sees his work and absolutely loves it. This is where the roller-coaster of Pecker's life begins. The art collector begins to show Pecker's work in the big art galleries, and he is a darling in the modern art scene, to the dismay and disgust of his townsfolk.The story is pretty basic with some gaping plot holes and a pretty easy ending to tie it up. However it is not the plot which gives it the enjoyment, but the characters and the predicaments that occur with them. I think Edward Furlong is perfect as the main character, however this is not a career defining movie for him, but somehow he did enjoy it. The indie darling Christina Ricci did not have enough to play on this role of Pecker's annoyed girlfriend, but she did what she could. The other characters were a little bit bizarre but seemed to fit into the movie quite well. Though there is one character I liked a lot, which was little Chrissy. She may have had probably one of the funniest scenes in the movie, where she is off the sugar and chocolate and onto the vegetables. She just snorts a piece of vegetable. That got me in stitches that no one can imagine.In conclusion, I think this movie does have to get some recommendation for at least trying hard to be funny, and the characters are quite amicable. However I wish they did not have a really fluffy ending. That was a let down.

I could tell after the opening monologue\/narration that this was going to be comedically horrendous, and only kept watching to see how much worse it might get.Having just sat and read through loads of pages of good reviews here, I cannot work out from where these positive comments are coming. From the first scene to the last, everything about it just seemed utterly ridiculous. The predictability, accents, costumes, set design (how is all of this 1975??), and, perhaps worst of all, the script. Completely over the top, all of it. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously, and simply could not believe what rubbish dialogue they were given to spout. Poor Viggo Mortenson - how can he not be ashamed? ('you no hear?' Please!). Poor everyone...I don't necessarily feel I'm including any spoilers, but have ticked the little box just in case; therefore, to further say The theme of time\/mayhem was slightly clever (ie 'we'll only be in there ten minutes', '30 minutes, tops', and 'i'll be 5 minutes, trust me' - and then of course, madness and violence ensues. But these were all as predictable as a character in a teen horror film saying 'I'll be right back' - we all know what's going to happen. Also found the station\/stairs(escalator)\/shoot-em-up correlation between this and The Untouchables (also DePalma) to be crossing the 'auteur' line bit too much - I kept waiting for the baby buggy to turn up. Yawn.Speaking of which, I note that in the 'goofs' section here, there is no mention of the moment where, after calling him Charlie (far too many times) in a scene in her apartment, at one point Penelope calls him Tony. And for any caption\/subtitle users (I sometimes watch with them, as the house where I live can tend to be loud), in the scene where Pacino, Penn, and Steffie (gal from the bar) are at the posh country house, for one line of Steffie's dialogue, the subtitles mistakenly note that her character is called Gail. Nice.The only almost-remotely, almost-redeeming scene involved a certain peering through an apartment door and a mirror; but even with that, we are given Penelope Ann Miller. Really bizarre choice.In all my years of using IMDb and voting for films, I believe this is the only '1' I've given, and definitely the only review I've felt compelled to post.

She's a good student who wants to go to college, but she's having trouble getting approved for financial aid, which she desperately needs. If she can only finish her senior year as class valedictorian, she knows she can get a scholarship. Enter the source of conflict of the film, Mrs. Eve Tingle (Helen Mirren), history teacher. Mrs. Tingle doesn't seem to like Leigh Ann. In fact she doesn't seem to like anyone except Trudie Tucker (Liz Stauber), a trust fund kid on her way to Harvard regardless of her senior class standing. Leigh Ann needs Mrs. Tingle to give her an A+ to become valedictorian while giving Trudie a lesser grade. How far will Leigh Ann and her friends go to convince Mrs. Tingle? The premise of the film may sound a bit silly and unrealistic, and it is. But the focus of the film isn't the premise. This is not a plot-driven film in any traditional sense. It's an exploration of particular kinds of character dynamics for which the plot is merely an excuse to get to the necessary situations. As for realism, I don't require that in my films for any particular facts. On the other hand, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is incredibly realistic in terms of many of those character dynamics. So I don't subtract points just because something is realistic either. Realism is a consideration that writers and directors of fiction films are free to play with as they choose.Although marketed as a thriller, and it certainly has those aspects as well as other subtexts, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is much more a film about acting. If you analyze what acting is, you realize that it involves putting on some kind of false front, some kind of role-playing where the role isn't identical to your personal self-image and modes of behavior, and where you're feigning with the intent of selling others on the performance. In Teaching Mrs. Tingle, acting is explored in all its guises, from literal theatrical senses to public false fronts to attempts at deception for ulterior motives. So the film is really a study of how all people are actors with respect to each other in various ways, with very occasional moments of authenticity in personal dynamics inserted as contrast to underscore the idea. Writer\/director Kevin Williamson weaves this exploration of acting at least through every non-technical element of the film--relationships, scenarios, dialogue and plot.Leigh Ann's friend Jo Lynn Jordan (Marisa Coughlan) literally wants to be an actor, so we see her performing as Marilyn Monroe early in the film and later doing a scene from The Exorcist (1973). She also has a chance to act as Mrs. Tingle and later, during a pivotal moment in the climax, as a character she's created on her own.Leigh Ann's history project is an instance of an object having a false front (as if the object itself is acting), and we see Leigh Ann putting on false public faces, mostly to appease those she loves (Jo Lynn and her mom, Faye (Lesley Ann Warren)). In one case, she is also acting to push away someone she loves (Luke Churner (Barry Watson)), and later to deceive someone she loves (Jo Lynn again) and does not want to hurt.Luke's instances of acting are similar to Leigh Ann's.Coach Wenchell (Jeffrey Tambor) is acting to deceive his wife, and we also see him go through some fairly literal role-playing. Later, he's also the victim of deceptive acting and another case of object acting, directed by others.Principal Potter (Michael McKean) and Miss Banks (Molly Ringwald) are classic examples of publicly putting on false fronts for more political reasons.And of course there's Mrs. Tingle. Mrs. Tingle is both the target and source of much of the acting in the film. She's frequently the victim of various levels of deceptions. Characters are constantly acting to show her that they're something they're not in an effort to crack through her armor. Her armor is an act. She gives many deceptive performances herself. And she also literally references acting many times throughout the film in her dialogue, seeming especially fond of Shakespeare.There are many more examples, but that gives you an idea of the focus and complexity of the film on a character level. As I mentioned earlier, occasionally the acting is contrasted with bouts of authenticity, the two most important ones being the later relationship between Leigh Ann and Luke, and Mrs. Tingle's monologue, during which she cleverly mixes authenticity and acting. Given the theme and the fact that we're watching a film, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is something of a postmodernist tour de force. The performers must show various levels of their characters acting while as they're also acting as actors in the film. The two required to play the most levels--Mirren and Coughlan--are the most overtly impressive, but everyone is excellent.From this review, it should be clear that Teaching Mrs. Tingle is more of a straight drama that's not just a silly teen flick. In overall structure, the film is a black comedy (but where comedy is more the traditional dramatic sense of the term). It is also sometimes comic in the modern popular sense (where you expect to laugh out loud)--Ringwald as Miss Banks actually steals this film on this level at one point--and as mentioned earlier, there are also thriller aspects, so that the film is sometimes suspenseful, although not usually in traditional or clichéd ways. A nice pop soundtrack also accompanies the film, if you enjoy that.

Mrs. Tingle is both the target and source of much of the acting in the film. She's frequently the victim of various levels of deceptions. Characters are constantly acting to show her that they're something they're not in an effort to crack through her armor. Her armor is an act. She gives many deceptive performances herself. And she also literally references acting many times throughout the film in her dialogue, seeming especially fond of Shakespeare.There are many more examples, but that gives you an idea of the focus and complexity of the film on a character level. As I mentioned earlier, occasionally the acting is contrasted with bouts of authenticity, the two most important ones being the later relationship between Leigh Ann and Luke, and Mrs. Tingle's monologue, during which she cleverly mixes authenticity and acting. Given the theme and the fact that we're watching a film, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is something of a postmodernist tour de force. The performers must show various levels of their characters acting while as they're also acting as actors in the film. The two required to play the most levels--Mirren and Coughlan--are the most overtly impressive, but everyone is excellent.From this review, it should be clear that Teaching Mrs. Tingle is more of a straight drama that's not just a silly teen flick. In overall structure, the film is a black comedy (but where comedy is more the traditional dramatic sense of the term). It is also sometimes comic in the modern popular sense (where you expect to laugh out loud)--Ringwald as Miss Banks actually steals this film on this level at one point--and as mentioned earlier, there are also thriller aspects, so that the film is sometimes suspenseful, although not usually in traditional or clichéd ways. A nice pop soundtrack also accompanies the film, if you enjoy that.

I actually had a few expectations before burrowing down in front of the the TV set, discounting the low ratings it's gotten so far here on IMDb. But after watching for half an hour or so, I realized that Wendigo got the rating it deserved. It IS bad.Synopsis Big city photographer takes his family to a cabin in the middle of nowhere for a weekend. Big city family and small town folks don't go well together. Add to this that the photographer's son starts hallucinating about wendigos, creatures or spirits from Indian folklore. Then it all turns to the worse.One of the reasons for my fairly high expectations is that the story and setting in my opinion is ideal for the kind of horror\/suspense movies that I like. A good foundation to build a solid horror flick on. I like elements from traditional folklore, I like isolated settings, I like mysteries in the dark.But... NOTHING ever happens. No pace, no action, no scares. Just a lot of nothing. About half-way through the movie there are actually some mystery\/suspense starting to build up, and we get a crash course in the nature of wendigos. Then it's all downhill again.After watching for an hour so, it still felt as we were in the beginning of the story. Nothing had really happened. With about five minutes remaining, the story had ALMOST gotten half-way, something had happened that could get the pace going. And then, Wendigo ends. With nothing.Really a shame, as I feel that they could have done a whole lot more with this concept. The wendigo is well known since Pet Sematary (by Stephen King) went up on the movie theaters. But I somehow get a feeling that Pet Sematary is the reason for naming this movie Wendigo - People will recognize the name, and watch the movie expecting it to be somewhat Stephen King-ish.The biggest flaw is all time wasted on pointless talk. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against conversations between the characters, but there are no purpose with the talk in Wendigo. The movie is about 80 minutes long, and starts with a bunch of guys standing around a car stuck in a snow drift, arguing about nothing. For 20 minutes! A scene that could have been cut down to 5 minutes or less. And it is followed of 20 minutes of watching a family looking around the house they will spend their weekend in. Another scene that could have been shortened down a great deal. Followed by a quarter of an hour of watching the family go to the local village to buy some groceries, and THEN we're finally let in on the theme of the movie. A lot of time wasted, in my opinion.Wendigo is primarily supposed to be a horror flick, not a drama. Categories that are not easily combined into something believable or even watchable. Usually, you end up with combining the all weaknesses and none of the strengths. A slow-paced story that is hard to believe, that is.Pro's The acting is quite good. But good acting is just one part of a whole, and can rarely - although there are exceptions - compensate for a storyline found wanting.To sum it up, Wendigo had the promise of becoming a great horror\/mystery\/suspense movie, OR it could have been a drama, had the supernatural theme been left out. But it didn't, because it tries to combine elements that don't work well together, resulting in a slow-paced and hard to believe meltdown.To those of you who find something special about this movie - Sorry folks, I'm not going with it. Wendigo is plain bad. There are movies - that I happen to be quite fond of - that requires the viewer to think in order to understand, but Wendigo is not one of them.I rate this flick 3 out of 10.

Van Sant had written, directed and produced a number of films before this one; his experience evident in the films direction. Starring River Phoenix as Mike Waters and Keanu Reeves as Scotty Favor, van Sant received the best performance out of Phoenix, who's portrayal of the narcoleptic street hustler, Mike Waters, was inspired. Reeves' performance was not as powerful, yet van Sant seems to have gotten a much better performance out of him than most directors he had previously worked with. The film's writing included many excerpts from Shakespeare, and much of the dialog between the characters was untraditional, often sounding more like Victorian or Elizabethan English; which lends a slightly abstract sort of feeling to the film. Van Sant's grasp of the reality of the lives of gay street hustlers in fairly strong, a theme he has carried out in later projects in his career, such as Speedway Junky, which he produced in 1999. The direction of the film, its characters, its dialog and story were, for its time very original; and a dangerous undertaking by van Sant, who could have easily effected his career for the worse in making this film. The project however turned out to be a fairly incredible film, with a unique yet universal love story wrapped up in a world of street hustling, which lends a grittiness to the film and its story, which makes it great.Van Sant takes us along a journey through a period of Mikey's life, and Phoenix's portrayal of the character is beautifully acted, and engaging in a way that only Phoenix could be. An old traditional type of story, the love story, is brilliantly told in a refreshingly untraditional way, with unique characters in offbeat settings. The old story 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl' is given a new face with this film, and this face-lift is flawlessly applied by Gus van Sant with his creative and artistic direction and brilliantly quirky writing. The tone of the film, is both bleak and expressive, with many of the scenes taking place among damp and gray backgrounds and empty baron spaces, which all lend to the overall serious nature of the subject matter while not distracting from the story. This film is a refreshing change from the everyday hopeless love story; in which the characters are strongly played and the brief scenes, which expose the lifestyles of the people involved, are explicit without being a turn off to the audience. Van Sant strikes a good balance between the touchy subject matter and the touching and revealing story, which he hopes to convey to his viewers. I would recommend this film for it's artistry alone, and compound that recommendation based on the strength of its story and brilliance of it's combination of witty and unconventional dialog.

This news throws Gabe and Judy into a tailspin. It makes them reexamine their own marriage and find it lacking. Meanwhile Sally starts seeing a handsome, romantic man (Liam Neeson) and Jack is living with a girl at least 30 years his junior. This film follows what happens to them over the course of a year.A fascinating film. I'm not married (or even straight) but I don't think that matters--this is about love, sex and relationships and has dialogue and situations that anyone can relate to. Allen's script is right on target--the insights are just incredible, and we slowly begin to see exactly how all of the four main characters really are. During the film they are all interviewed by a never seen person--these interviews really help the story and reveals how everybody feels about the others. It pulls everything together.The acting is almost all great. Allen and Farrow were living together when this was filmed--when it was released they were in a bitter custody battle. This movie actually provides insight to WHY they broke up--their argument scenes are just a bit too realistic. Davis and Pollack are just superb in their roles. They let you feel their characters pain and confusion--just great acting. Neeseon isn't asked to do much but he is very affecting in his scenes. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as a college student. Her voice is nasal and whiny and her acting is pretty lousy--but it doesn't ruin the film.I saw this back in 1992 in a theatre and loved it. Twelve years later I STILL love it. A great film. I'm only giving this an 8 though. There are two big faults with this film the hand-held jittery camera work being the main one.

However Juliette Lewis is terrible as a college student. Her voice is nasal and whiny and her acting is pretty lousy--but it doesn't ruin the film.I saw this back in 1992 in a theatre and loved it. Twelve years later I STILL love it. A great film. I'm only giving this an 8 though. There are two big faults with this film the hand-held jittery camera work being the main one. My guess is Allen filmed it this way to make the film more immediate and give it a documentary feel. It works but it IS distracting. Also it gets a little repetitious towards the end. Still this is well worth seeing. Recommended.

He literally left his home base in Los Angeles, defeated, because of a particularly hairy case involving an unusually devious, crafty and risk-loving serial killer who went by the name of David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves). The Watcher begins with Campbell resettled in Chicago, trying to put his life back in order. But what will happen when Griffin shows up in the Windy City? This is an unusual film in many ways. Although on one level it's a fairly standard thriller with Reeves playing a subtly twisted baddie, it's really a complex psychological portrait that focuses more on Spader as Campbell.Campbell's life is a mess in Chicago. He can't work and he can barely take care of himself. He looks and feels miserable. His apartment reflects his life--though sparse in content, it's extremely unkempt and unhealthy looking. He is having continual nightmares. He has to inject himself in the stomach with prescription drugs to get over panic attacks and to enable at least a couple hours sleep at night. Of course Campbell is making regular visits to a psychiatrist, Dr. Polly Beilman (Marisa Tomei).He became such a wreck because of being wrapped up so long with the Griffin case. Griffin regularly toyed with Campbell, communicating with him and even giving him clues so that Campbell would be able to almost but not quite beat Griffin to the punch. Amusingly, director Joe Charbanic portrays Griffin as more well adjusted and much more focused than Campbell.As Dr. Beilman discerns, Griffin was Campbell's raison d'etre for so long--almost his sole concern--that abandoning the case resulted in Campbell effectively abandoning his life. Thus Charbanic gives us a clever, ethically gray twist. Griffin may be beneficial to Campbell; he may be the only one who can get him back on track. Likewise, Griffin is shown to be a bit lost without Campbell. It creates a fascinating psychological dependency in a twisted relationship that mirrors the two other male-female relationships that propel the plot, providing a subtext about co-dependency and slightly off-kilter, questionably healthy relationships in general.Although Reeves is often criticized for his acting ability, The Watcher is an excellent example of what that is unjustified. It's not that Reeves doesn't have range. It's that he's extremely subtle. He's not an actor to chew scenery. His Griffin is really just as psychotic as, say, De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976) or Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance in The Shining (1980), but Reeves isn't usually one to maniacally chop down a door with an axe and crazily intone Heeeere's Johnny, you have to watch him closer than that to see the character. Even when he's in full action mode, either as a killer, as he is here, or as a superhero, as in The Matrix (1999), Reeves is all about a kind of quiet control. It's not a better or worse style than De Niro or Nicholson, just different. Spader also gives a finely tuned performance. As the character requirements have it, he's a fine complement for Reeves, somewhat paralleling Reeves' style, somewhat providing a counterpoint.The film has interesting things to say about anonymity in modern societies, especially big cities. Griffin is able to play the games he does only because so many people are faceless and ignored.Charbanic films The Watcher with a unique visual style can be arty--especially during the flashbacks--and conventionally build suspense at the same time. He's also aided by a great score (including a couple brief snippets of Reeves dancing to Rob Zombie) and attractive production design.The Watcher isn't the typical 10 out of 10 film, as its surface gloss is more pedestrian than the usual film of that caliber.

King of the Hill is one of the most vivid film experiences I remember as a child. No, I wasn't lucky enough to catch it on the big screen. Instead I rented it and watched it one night and was totally absorbed into it. Jesse Bradford, despite his current film career, did a damn fine job as Aaron Kurlander, a young boy struggling to survive during the Great Depression. He uses his wits and imagination to make the best out of the worst of times. Bradford was 12 or 13 years old at the time he filmed the movie and as an actor it must've been a heavy burden. The main focus is on him as its his story and shown from his point of view. Bradford doesn't let the ball drop once and more than carries his weight. It's another one of those rare great child performances. Jeroen Krabbé plays Aaron's (Bradford) father who is a struggling traveling salesman. Lisa Eichhorn plays his mentally unstable mother who goes in and out of various institutions. Rounding out the cast of the interesting people that fill Aaron's life are Karen Allen as the warm and understanding school teacher, Cameron Boyd his younger brother, Adrien Brody as the cool big brother figure, John McConnell as the fat and troublesome patrol cop, Elizabeth McGovern as a prostitute working in the same hotel Aaron lives at, and Spalding Gray as her creepy, manipulative, and suicidal pimp. So yes the film is filled to the brim with worth while supporting players adding so much depth and dimension to Aaron's world.Soderbergh had double duty as writer and director. He scripted the novel by A.E. Hotchner and I think it's his best film. As I mentioned it takes place during the Great Depression in St. Louis Missouri. Watching Aaron fight for survival is one of the best charms of the film. It's done realistically. The audience is able to believe his methods. There's a nice mix of drama, dark somber humor and dire situations, but there's also enough humanity and hope in the movie to send an uplifting message. For those who enjoy Andy Dufresne's message of hope and persaverence in the more widely known The Shawshank Redemption, seek out this film. I would argue it's even superior to Frank Darabont's movie. It's one of the great and underrated modern films and ranks with the best using the Great Depression setting. Sadly King of the Hill isn't released yet on DVD and it's not very likely that you'll be able to find it at your local video store.

Jewison seems to find scripts that aptly match the actors he casts and tries to get all he can out of them, even if the script is horribly flawed. And believe me; he has had some flawed scripts (does anyone remember F.I.S.T?)

Fleming, played by John Forsythe. We get to see judicial largess and judicial activism work against innocent defendants (even though the circumstances upon which one of Kirkland's defendants is booked is not totally believable) and how Kirkland works around the system to find ways to free his clients, though his efforts are often futile.The script is barely more than a made-for-TV effort, and the music sounds like rejected background tunes for Charlie's Angels, but there are memorable acting performances in this film. I was surprised at how well John Forsythe played a thoroughly egocentric and conniving judge; Jack Warden as a suicidal adrenaline junkie cum judge creates one of his better characterization efforts on film.The Piece De Resistance of this 119 minute gem is Kirkland's opening statement during Judge Fleming's rape trial.

If there were an acting school out there that wanted to see a bit of method acting that challenges the best of what masters like Brando could do, that school should buy the rights to the last 10 minutes of And Justice for All, burn it to a CD, and make it required study.If they could just find a way to erase the disco music in this film, it would be even better, but that being said, I still think this film is worth a look.

Jewison has been responsible for cinematic garbage (anyone remember Rollerball?) and complete masterworks (Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck, Agnes of God), but one thing is distinct about his film-making. Jewison seems to find scripts that aptly match the actors he casts and tries to get all he can out of them, even if the script is horribly flawed. And believe me; he has had some flawed scripts (does anyone remember F.I.S.T?) This movie that pits an average but hardworking defense attorney, Arthur Kirkland, played by Pacino, and the entire justice bureaucracy run by power-centered judges like Henry T. Fleming, played by John Forsythe. We get to see judicial largess and judicial activism work against innocent defendants (even though the circumstances upon which one of Kirkland's defendants is booked is not totally believable) and how Kirkland works around the system to find ways to free his clients, though his efforts are often futile.The script is barely more than a made-for-TV effort, and the music sounds like rejected background tunes for Charlie's Angels, but there are memorable acting performances in this film. I was surprised at how well John Forsythe played a thoroughly egocentric and conniving judge; Jack Warden as a suicidal adrenaline junkie cum judge creates one of his better characterization efforts on film.The Piece De Resistance of this 119 minute gem is Kirkland's opening statement during Judge Fleming's rape trial. This might be the only truly well-written dialog in the film, and there is only one guy capable of delivering it in the most engaging and passionate means possible. That person is Al Pacino. Though Pacino has been known to do some pretty quirky and sometimes cartoonish character roles, those very quirky emotive properties make the last 10 minutes of this film one of the best scenes ever captured in American film. If there were an acting school out there that wanted to see a bit of method acting that challenges the best of what masters like Brando could do, that school should buy the rights to the last 10 minutes of And Justice for All, burn it to a CD, and make it required study.If they could just find a way to erase the disco music in this film, it would be even better, but that being said, I still think this film is worth a look.

Broccoli showed that he could make a dark and gritty film while keeping the necessary elements of a James Bond adventure. The audience at that time showed him that they didn't care, and LTK did not do as well as previous outings in the franchise, causing a 6 year gap between the next one, which eventually turned out to be GoldenEye, a weak venture that only proves how excellent Licence To Kill actually was in comparison.I know, I know But GoldenEye is great! It saved the series! Pierce Brosnan is the best James Bond! Blah, blah, blah. We're all entitled to our own opinion and while I appreciate what GE did to the future of James Bond, the film doesn't compare to earlier classics and doesn't know a cliché that goes unused. The entire affair is like a greatest hits package without the spark of The Spy Who Loved Me or the class of Thunderball.The main failing of the film is that all it does is seek to remind audiences that this is a Bond film, and while this was necessary at the time, watching it now, it's a huge distraction. Within 30 minutes, every possible trademark has been checked off a casino scene, the Aston Martin, Bond, James Bond, vodka martini, a femme fatale, a big stunt, evil Russians, and on and on and on. There might as well be a neon sign pointing everything out. At least something like Moonraker is content with the fact that it's a Bond film and doesn't need to remind anyone.The movie opens with a sequence that shows Bond in action with a fellow agent and sets up the character of Alec Trevelyan AKA 006 (Sean Bean), who's supposedly killed by Colonel Ourumov. The beginning could've been much better had it not contained so many continuity errors and a stunt at the end that is so incredibly lame and unbelievable you'll wonder if Bond has bent the laws of physics. Basically the serious tone of the Dalton era is ignored in favour of the same old Roger Moore-type nonsense.The movie continues with a good title song from Tina Turner, even though it tries to blatantly copy Goldfinger (which has, for some reason, become THE film to borrow from when one wants to be Bond-ish). After the main credits, though, we get an absolutely terrible car chase between Bond and Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) that has the worst musical cue in the series, consisting of some random beeps and honks. The movie plods along and basically everything until Russia is dull, filled with atrocious dialogue, and introduces nothing new to the Bond caper.When we do find out who the villain, Janus, is and what he's planning, the movie picks up and we get the action in a wild shoot-out, an exciting tank chase, a tense stand-off in a train, and an explosive finale in Cuba that's even more interesting than most because the relationship between Bond and Trevelyan was sufficiently developed to the point that we're rooting for the both of them to win. But to get there is not worth your time, and it's ironic that these set pieces are the highlight of the film, instead of it's drama or story.Then we get some bizarre attempts to make Bond relevant to the '90's by having the new female M (Judi Dench, who is better in every other Bond film after this) and Miss Monneypenny emasculate him to the point where I wanted to puke. Not only that, Monneypenny downright rejects Bond's advances and he stands there taking everything without comment. These few scenes, along with a score that sounds like it belongs in a B-grade '80's action film, immediately makes the flick lose 2 stars.What almost makes up for all this lacklustre material is the cast. Almost. Sean Bean gives a forceful interpretation of 006, providing a match for Bond at every turn and also getting some of the best lines in the movie, if not the series. Gottfried John as Ourumov is an imposing figure and completely believable, while the Bond Girl this time around, Natalya, is attractive and smart, while holding her own. She's probably the best out of the Brosnan era and can actually act. And Robbie Coltrane shows up as Valentin Zukovsky, one of the most inspired characters in years.Unfortunately, the other two leads, Janssen and even James Bond #5, Pierce Brosnan himself, don't stack up to the other actors. Xenia is just way to over-the-top and ruins any scene she's in. And the all-to-obvious fake accent doesn't help. The complete opposite is Brosnan, who is uneasy in the role and doesn't grab our attention. Plus, his haircut is too jokey to be taken seriously.And while the film's only 2 hours and 10 minutes long, it drags and feels longer, killing any replay value. So, even with some good acting, other elements work against the movie, and the useless updating does nothing but show that James Bond is a timeless character and shouldn't be placed in any specific era.

A labour of love for him, as a huge fan of the real Ed Wood, Burton set out to make a film that acted as many things at once; a biopic, a romance (not in the most likely fashion and in more than one way), a comedy and a drama. He succeeded on all counts.'Ed Wood' tells the story of the man who was voted officially to be the 'worst director of all time'. Johnny Depp gives a career defining, painstakingly accurate and sympathetic performance in the title role, taking the audience with him as he goes from one film to another. Starting with 'Glenn or Glenda?' (Wood's first film), followed by horror 'Bride of the Atom', then through to the fantastically inept, most famous 'bad movie' ever; 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. All the way through remaining enthusiastically optimistic, upbeat, and indefatigable.The film is technically efficient also, though the by far the best and most memorable aspect of the film is the performances.

I remember seeing it opening weekend way back in 1988! I was only 12, but me & my younger brother dragged my dad to the Granville multiplex after seeing an ad on t.v. We were just expecting a good action movie with some yucks(both kinds).Now, keep in mind, this was 1988. The whole concept of a horror movie also being funny wasn't as commonplace(or as stale) as it is now. I remember everyone in the nearly filled theater having a surprisingly fun time with this movie. We knew it was not on the same playing field as most of the major Hollywood action movies(Lethal Weapon, Die Hard)but Dead Heat managed to win over its audience with its combo of cheesy one-liners, insane(for 1988) action sequences, & truly remarkable f\/x work by Steve Johnson.A lot of people would watch Dead Heat & just shrug it off as a low-budget time waster(hey, that's part of it's charm for me) but I don't think I'm going too far to say that it deserves a 10\/10 rating.So why does it deserve a 10 out of 10 rating? Quite simply it's the only Zombie\/Cop movie that I've ever seen & that means it's the best of it's kind...I think. Plus it has a kind of weird cinematic irony going for it because screenwriter Terry Black is the brother of Lethal Weapon scribe Shane Black(who also makes a cameo as a cop). This film is very much a tongue-in-cheek counterpart that huge hit of a film.I think this was one of Vincent Price's last films too, so that right there gives it a little more allure as well(even if he's only in it for about 15 minutes). I'm really surprised no one's tried to remake this material, because with today's f\/x & a committed cast\/crew, this is the kind of oddity that could really make a lot of money(ie,Shaun of the Dead or Freddy vs. Jason). But who wants to remake a movie that bombed at the box office first time out? IF that EVER happens I'll be first in line with my popcorn.If you've never seen it and decide to check it out there's a chance you'll just shake your head in disbelief at how bad it is, but that's the whole point. It's the very definition of the term so bad, it's good, which is a fine line to walk for any film. So don't say you weren't warned...but I mean, come on, when was the last time you saw a GOOD Zombie\/Cop movie?
