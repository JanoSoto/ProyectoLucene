For the longest time my local Blockbuster didn't have it, and I couldn't locate it elsewhere either, until I stumbled upon a copy of it the other week.The acting in this movie is nothing short of superb. The remake had a big-name cast that, despite itself, didn't do all that much in terms of acting. Each character in the 1933 original, though, is outstanding in their role.Robert Armstrong plays the director Carl Denam very seriously and very dramatically (unlike the more comic performance of Jack Black in the 2005 remake), and much better suits the role. Denam is a serious character, and required a serious performance to live up to the role's potential.Fay Wray, as Ann Darrow, is pleasant and endearing. She's looks the part of the sweet naive girl she plays, and for the first half performs her role brilliantly. The latter half, though, is another matter. She degrades into almost no dialog save from senseless screaming and flailing about, although this is more likely a writing problem. Bruce Cabot does an excellent job as Jack Driscoll. Although the romance between he and Wray's character is awkward at best, he manages to show himself as a caring and endearing character, and helps to pull of the romance between them.The direction of the film is uneven, to the point where it seems more like the film was divided into two halves and directed by two very different people. The beginning is short and choppy, and comes across as almost amateurish. There's absolutely no transitioning from scene to scene, and very little is done in the way of giving it substance. When they arrive on the island, however, the direction takes a much different turn. It becomes very lyrical, very stretched. It adds substance and thickness, easing its way through the events and taking in as much of the island and the action as it can. The latter half is by far the best, and the beginning could have benefited from a like style. However, all of those really wide shots got annoying after a while, and gave the impression that something was being compensated for.The special effects in its day, I'm sure, was state of the art. It appears to be mechanical (or maybe stop-animation), and far above a man in a monkeys suit. However, by today's standards its entirely laughable, and in no way believable in terms of special effects. Kong is constantly jerking about uncomfortably or lagging like a bad computer, and the face has a comical expression soldered on no matter if its in love or enraged. The same can be said about the other creatures (the dinosaurs especially). The Pterodactyl was especially ridiculous looking. However, the direction of the film is so great, the magic of the story-telling so compelling, that after a short time you forget about the extremely dated and unconvincing special-effects, because the story itself convinces you, commands you to believe, its reality. And you do.The action sequences sometimes felt unnecessary. The rescue party's trek through the jungle-wilderness is the biggest case of this. You watch, and just wait for them to die off, because they seemed marked from the beginning to do so. The islanders never gave the impression of being dangerous, even when the kidnapped Ann or summoned Kong. They were victims of both the crew and the ape, and are even described as cowards who flee into their huts at the sound of gunfire. They were used as a plot device, and later discarded for Kong food. A lot more could have been done with them, a lot more.Regardless, the T-Rex wrestling scene is classic and engaging even by today's standards, and Kong's running about New York was just as riveting. However, the scene with him free in the city was disappointing. They had a great chance for an excellent action sequence, even with their limited abilities, but wasted the opportunity and seemingly made it as brief as possible. And that one scene where they suggest using planes to Kill him is needless. That could have been deleted and we would have realized what they were trying the moment that we saw the planes taking off. Despite it's flaws, though, it still stands as a classic and worthy sequence in cinema.In the end, this is a classic movie, and deservedly so. While it suffers by a few contrived scenes that could have been much improved upon, and special effects that are by all means severely dated, it is still an excellent film and a standard to live up to. This is not the tragic tale of mutual yet fatal love Peter Jackson made it. This is, instead, a tale of unrequited love by a creature who did not belong to our modern world. This isn't necessarily better or worse, just different (although I honestly prefer it Jackson's way). This movie has stood the tests of time despite a greatly changed and advanced state of movie-making technology, and for a fantasy\/adventure film this is no easy feet. This is a definite must-see for fans of classic films and for anybody who enjoyed Peter Jackson's 2005 remake.

Now on the director's chair, Widen attempts to create a similar experience mixing horror and fantasy in The Prophecy, giving us a world where Angels and Demons fight a war that has been going for the destiny of mankind.The Prophecy is the tale of the second war in heaven, a war that has been going on for centuries. Unlike the first war that happened when Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) attempted to become God, this one is led by Gabriel (Christopher Walken), whose only wish is to destroy mankind so angels can be again God's favorite creations. While the war has been balanced for centuries, now Gabriel has the chance to have the upper hand in the conflict as he discovers in Earth the most evil human soul ever created. The angel Simon (Eric Stoltz) discovers this and decides to find the soul first, for this he'll need the help of Detective Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas), a former priest turned cop. Now the battle is on Earth.Widen once again proves he has a talent for fantasy as he takes a familiar concept and expands its many possibilities. The concept of a war between angels is very interesting and Widen takes full advantage of the Judaic and Christian religious symbols to tell his story. While the plot is probably not as polished as his Highlander, Gregory Widen makes up for it with a collection of interesting and original twists to familiar biblical characters that together make a very enjoyable ride.On the director's position, Widen looks a bit unexperienced, although this is natural as his only previous job as a director was a Tales from the Crypt episode. Sadly, this takes its toll on the movie, as at times it has the looks of a straight to TV movie and this hurts the quality script he had developed. However, it is worth to recognize that Widen did a good job with his relative low-budget, and many of the special effects still look convincing despite its age.As many have pointed out, the film strongest point is the amazing cast. Christopher Walken does wonders with this pulp novel version of the archangel Gabriel. He completely creates a character that is both charming and frightening, with his suave persona owning the screen. Eric Stoltz is also wonderful as Simon, and his expressive face says more than the few lines his character has. The weakest link is definitely Elias Koteas, who ends up a bit flat and wooden, although in his favor one can say that Widen underdeveloped his character in comparison with the angels. Viggo Mortensen, Virginia Madsen and a wonderful Adam Goldberg complete the terrific cast that has earned the movie a cult-status.Despite all this, The Prophecy is not without problems, and the most notorious is the lack of experience of the director. While his story is considerably good and for his fortune, the cast does wonders with the material; his directing style is non-existent and very simplistic, very much like an episode of a typical TV series in the vein of the X-Files. Still, one can overlook said flaw due to the many other wonders this film has to offer.While it doesn't have the massive appealing of Highlander, this movie is a terrific addition to the fantasy\/horror sub genre and another prove of the very imaginative mind of Gregory Widen. On a word of advice, the sequels are not as good as the first one although if you enjoy this one the rest will be very attractive as Widen's new world seems very appealing.

And, as a first effort, there was much to be proud of. For the 1980s, this animation was better than the most recent Disney cartoon offerings--as the Disney animation studio was moribund and would not for several more years once again emerge as a giant in the industry.Richly textured backgrounds and smooth animations were seen throughout the film and yet it only merits a score of 5. Why? Because the plot is so horrid. It was a paranoid little story in which you find out NIMH refers to The National Institute of Mental Health (a subsidiary of the government organization NIH). As the story unfolds, it seems that the older mice in the story had escaped from the evil scientists at NIMH who were doing diabolical experiments on mice!! This was like a propaganda film from either PETA or the Scientologists, as the mice discuss the horrors that the experienced at the hands of the government!

It's more a film inspired by FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, as the same chief bad guy (Gian Maria Volontè) is killed in both films and Clint Eastwood is not the same amoral bounty hunter he is in the sequel. However, he looks the same and acts almost the same, so why be picky? Especially since if you like one of these movies, it's certain you will like both,...though I think overall FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a slightly better film--mostly due to the appearance of Lee Van Cleef.FISTFUL OF DOLLARS is a reworking of the Kurosawa masterpiece YOJIMBO. And, while it's not quite as perfect as the original Japanese film (this would practically be impossible to achieve), it's a wonderful reworking of the plot by putting it in the old West. Plus, it does have an edge over the original when it comes to the always strange but always cool music from Ennio Morricone. Both Toshiro Mifune and Clint Eastwood play odd characters who the audience know very little about who wander into a town torn by a war between two rival gangs. And, in both, our heroes use their brains and fantastic fighting skills to wipe out both gangs for the good of the people.The movie begins with Eastwood coming to an unfriendly Mexican town and seeing a little boy trying to sneak in to see his mother who was kidnapped by the town's #1 bully. Although Clint (nicknamed the Man with no Name by fans) isn't visibly shaken when the kid is soon discovered and thrown out, he spends much of the movie trying to figure out why the baddies are holding her as well as how to get her safely back to her family. About the only real negative I saw in the film was some of the dubbing--in particular, the kid. He was SO whiny and shrill that I wondered why the bad guys didn't just kill the kid to shut him up once and for all! However, being a smart good guy (and yes, he is more of a good guy in this film than in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE), he doesn't immediately act but uses his brain to get the two rival gangs in town to wipe each other out instead of relying on his lightning fast shooting to kill everyone (something even this character probably couldn't do). To do this, he pretends to help both gangs by selling them information and playing tricks on them. At first, his two new friends in town can't understand several things he does--but Clint has a master plan.Like every early Eastwood Western I can think of, at some point Clint is captured and has the crap knocked out of him (it also happened in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY as well as in HANG EM HIGH). But, this is only just before Clint strikes back and finishes the job. In this case, with the aid of home made plate mail, he is able to beat Gian Maria Volontè and what's left of his gang in a dandy showdown.The movie has so many excellent touches that it's hard to figure out the negatives in the film--other than a few of the dubbed voices. In fact, this is the only problem. The music, direction, acting and script are all top-notch. A wonderful but violent early Spaghetti Western.

There are arguments about   whether Hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a   compulsive technician -- or was he really deep. Nobody knows   precisely what terms like that mean, but it's legitimate to ask if, at   his best, he could not have been all three things at once.    In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is   accidental. It abounds with doubt, ambiguity, and wit. And the story is   engrossing, Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to   Hitchcock's own.    I'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I won't   bother going into it. I'll just point out five on screen incidents that   Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for.    Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two   boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her.   She's noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by it.    1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through The   Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake. Walker   is right behind them, smiling, in his boat -- Pluto. Pluto. It's not   an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character. It's a reference to   Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman   mythology. This tiny touch can't be an accident. And the underworld   that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the underworld   of the human mind. I hate to say he's a Jungian shadow but that's   what he is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of   its release -- but probably not.) 2. Now, this is a deadly serious   sequence, right? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he   doesn't even know. Imagine the way this would have been laid out by   most directors. A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival,   stealing from shadow to shadow, the killer peering from behind the   canvas walls, and so forth. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker   first comes through the gates, concentrating on his victim, a little   boy in a cowboy suit, holding a balloon, runs up and shouts, Bang!   Bang! You're dead! Walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares   down indignantly at the kid. And when the kid starts to walk away,   Walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it, then continues   his pursuit without another glance. That's one way Hitchcock treats   impending doom.    3. The famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses, which has   been aped innumerable times.    4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound   with a big mallet, sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to   measure the strength of your blow. One of her boyfriend whams it and   the puck doesn't reach the bell at the top. Under Miriam's delighted   and admiring gaze, Walker smiles and rubs his hands together, then   picks up the mallet, slams it down, and the puck bangs against the   bell. She's thrilled. He puts the mallet down, looks at her, grins, and   WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS at her like a ten-year-old showoff! 5. After the   discovery of Miriam's body, while whistles blow and people shout,   Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the   curb. Walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the   intersection, gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic. A   macabre joke.    These incidents and others all take place during the ten or   fifteen-minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is   exceptional throughout.) It's essentially a kind of invitation to be   noirish. (Cf Ride the Pink Horse) But the menace of the scene is   undercut by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the   familiar noir techniques are employed. There's nothing really creepy   about it. And the murder itself is hardly a savage one. I don't think   that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he   did. It would have been all menace and shadows, hiding places, abortive   attempts, scowls instead of grins.    Not that it's an entirely flawless movie. A flawless movie is not yet   with us. Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley   Granger, although a nice guy, is stolid, dull, and rather stupid. His   new girl friend is just dull.    Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly   seriousness in The Wrong Man. I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought   about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter   was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. Original   sin -- you're BORN with it -- and all that. In filmed interviews, he   always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities   generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police   station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo. We're justified   in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory.   I hope you get the pun. I know, I know.

I don't think   that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he   did. It would have been all menace and shadows, hiding places, abortive   attempts, scowls instead of grins.    Not that it's an entirely flawless movie. A flawless movie is not yet   with us. Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley   Granger, although a nice guy, is stolid, dull, and rather stupid. His   new girl friend is just dull.    Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly   seriousness in The Wrong Man. I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought   about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter   was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. Original   sin -- you're BORN with it -- and all that. In filmed interviews, he   always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities   generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police   station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo. We're justified   in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory.   I hope you get the pun. I know, I know. It's strained and inept but I   spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up.

Therefore, in light of this, it's amazing that the film doesn't inspire blind hatred. But as flawed as it is, it's watchable, and it's watchable because of one person Kevin Spacey.Kevin Spacey here plays a sleazy movie executive called Buddy Ackerman. He's the kind of man who obsesses over his receding hair, who uses his job to score pussy and who steals other people's ideas. Plus his personal mantra is Shut up, listen and learn. So we're not talking about a very likable individual. But having said that, watching him humiliate people is rather enjoyable, especially when the main focus of his wrath is the bland, wishy-washy Guy (played by Frank Whaley).Guy is Buddy's new assistant and he enters his new job with all kinds of dreams and aspirations. But no sooner has he pulled into the parking lot than he's being abused by a female movie producer who tells him that he's taken her spot (even though the lot is almost empty). Right from the very first second Guy is out of his depth &#150; status means more here than high-minded ideas.But although we're meant to feel sorry for Guy (he's constantly mocked and abused by Buddy), it's hard to feel for him when he's played by Frank Whaley, an actor so bland, so limp, so devoid of charisma or screen presence that he sucks all the colour out of the screen and turns his part of the frame a battleship grey.But what's even more ridiculous is that as well as playing the downtrodden assistant, he has to play the wronged employee who gets revenge on his boss by tying him to a chair and torturing him. I guess I can buy the fumbling loser, even though it's not fun to watch, but it's painful watching Whaley try and play a crazed lunatic. He's just a bunch of adolescent facial ticks with a bad floppy haircut. I can no more buy him torturing someone than I can buy Tom Cruise being declared clinically sane.And Guy isn't made any more believable or sympathetic when he starts humping the female producer who abused him at the beginning of the film. Their relationship is just so sappy and juvenile. You'd think they were in High School. But what makes it truly absurd is that the producer is attractive and powerful. Which begs the question why would a lowly toad-faced PA fill her with lust? Perhaps she has brain damage.Thankfully there's one smart person in the film Buddy. I'm sure you're supposed to get a certain guilty amusement out of his antics, while generally disapproving of his behaviour, but I have to say, as vile a person as he is, I'm on his side all the way through the film. He's ruthless, he's funny and he's got balls (Guy may as well be a eunuch). Plus he doesn't fold under Guy's torture. He even laughs in Guy's face when he threatens him with a gun. You've got to respect a man like that.But Buddy, for me, is made even more likable by the fact that Guy behaves totally unreasonably. I mean, yeah Buddy shouts at Guy, throws things at him and has slept with his girlfriend, but if you don't like your job, either urinate in your boss's coffee or quit. You don't have to behave like a child. Or as Buddy says, Your job is unfair to you? Grow up. Way it goes. And Guy is made even more annoying because the torture is over a woman. Come on, so your girl's done the bone dance with another man; that's life.But as absurd as the whole torture angle is, I guess it sort of works as a commentary on movies &#150; it's exactly the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a film (Guy even calls it payback time), so it's apt that filmmakers would go to such absurd lengths to vent their fury. But as I've already said, it fails because Whaley is such a poor actor (Spacey, by contrast, is excellent).However, worse than the torture sequences is the ending. Again it's meant to be an ironic comment on the movies &#150; you have to kill to get the top; you have to sell your soul &#150; but it's just silly. After torturing Buddy and finding out that his girlfriend slept her way to the top, Buddy and Guy decide to engage in a conspiracy &#150; they make out that Guy's girlfriend did the torturing and then Guy shoots his ex to 'save' Buddy from her. And then at the end, Guy becomes a top executive and he and Buddy are united &#150; they close the office door on the world like the final scene in The Godfather. Maybe if the film were a more outrageous black comedy, I could accept this ending. But seeing as it's played completely straight (except for Spacey), it's just ridiculous. Again, I just can't believe that such a limp individual would do something so outrageous. And the film never hints that Guy is terribly ambitious. He even finds it hard to verbalise why he's attracted to the movie business &#150; he eventually says it's because of 'memories'. But really, even if you were obsessed with movies and desperately wanted to make it to the top, would you spare the man you loath and kill the woman you love? I doubt it myself.

Therefore, in light of this, it's amazing that the film doesn't inspire blind hatred. But as flawed as it is, it's watchable, and it's watchable because of one person Kevin Spacey.Kevin Spacey here plays a sleazy movie executive called Buddy Ackerman. He's the kind of man who obsesses over his receding hair, who uses his job to score pussy and who steals other people's ideas. Plus his personal mantra is Shut up, listen and learn. So we're not talking about a very likable individual. But having said that, watching him humiliate people is rather enjoyable, especially when the main focus of his wrath is the bland, wishy-washy Guy (played by Frank Whaley).Guy is Buddy's new assistant and he enters his new job with all kinds of dreams and aspirations. But no sooner has he pulled into the parking lot than he's being abused by a female movie producer who tells him that he's taken her spot (even though the lot is almost empty). Right from the very first second Guy is out of his depth &#150; status means more here than high-minded ideas.But although we're meant to feel sorry for Guy (he's constantly mocked and abused by Buddy), it's hard to feel for him when he's played by Frank Whaley, an actor so bland, so limp, so devoid of charisma or screen presence that he sucks all the colour out of the screen and turns his part of the frame a battleship grey.But what's even more ridiculous is that as well as playing the downtrodden assistant, he has to play the wronged employee who gets revenge on his boss by tying him to a chair and torturing him. I guess I can buy the fumbling loser, even though it's not fun to watch, but it's painful watching Whaley try and play a crazed lunatic. He's just a bunch of adolescent facial ticks with a bad floppy haircut. I can no more buy him torturing someone than I can buy Tom Cruise being declared clinically sane.And Guy isn't made any more believable or sympathetic when he starts humping the female producer who abused him at the beginning of the film. Their relationship is just so sappy and juvenile. You'd think they were in High School. But what makes it truly absurd is that the producer is attractive and powerful. Which begs the question why would a lowly toad-faced PA fill her with lust? Perhaps she has brain damage.Thankfully there's one smart person in the film Buddy. I'm sure you're supposed to get a certain guilty amusement out of his antics, while generally disapproving of his behaviour, but I have to say, as vile a person as he is, I'm on his side all the way through the film. He's ruthless, he's funny and he's got balls (Guy may as well be a eunuch). Plus he doesn't fold under Guy's torture. He even laughs in Guy's face when he threatens him with a gun. You've got to respect a man like that.But Buddy, for me, is made even more likable by the fact that Guy behaves totally unreasonably. I mean, yeah Buddy shouts at Guy, throws things at him and has slept with his girlfriend, but if you don't like your job, either urinate in your boss's coffee or quit. You don't have to behave like a child. Or as Buddy says, Your job is unfair to you? Grow up. Way it goes. And Guy is made even more annoying because the torture is over a woman. Come on, so your girl's done the bone dance with another man; that's life.But as absurd as the whole torture angle is, I guess it sort of works as a commentary on movies &#150; it's exactly the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a film (Guy even calls it payback time), so it's apt that filmmakers would go to such absurd lengths to vent their fury. But as I've already said, it fails because Whaley is such a poor actor (Spacey, by contrast, is excellent).However, worse than the torture sequences is the ending. Again it's meant to be an ironic comment on the movies &#150; you have to kill to get the top; you have to sell your soul &#150; but it's just silly. After torturing Buddy and finding out that his girlfriend slept her way to the top, Buddy and Guy decide to engage in a conspiracy &#150; they make out that Guy's girlfriend did the torturing and then Guy shoots his ex to 'save' Buddy from her. And then at the end, Guy becomes a top executive and he and Buddy are united &#150; they close the office door on the world like the final scene in The Godfather. Maybe if the film were a more outrageous black comedy, I could accept this ending. But seeing as it's played completely straight (except for Spacey), it's just ridiculous. Again, I just can't believe that such a limp individual would do something so outrageous. And the film never hints that Guy is terribly ambitious. He even finds it hard to verbalise why he's attracted to the movie business &#150; he eventually says it's because of 'memories'. But really, even if you were obsessed with movies and desperately wanted to make it to the top, would you spare the man you loath and kill the woman you love? I doubt it myself.
