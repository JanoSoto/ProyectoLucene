But you will be amazed at how quickly this will put you to sleep. Until that comet hits, baby, this is one slow ride.If you appreciate the talent of ILM and love special effects, this film won't disappoint except that you have to wait almost until the end of the movie to see the payoff. What a payoff, though. The tsunami, the con-trail as the comet headed over the ocean, the Statue of Liberty broken into pieces, the floods, etc. etc.And if, in your everyday life when you're still worried about how things work, you have a drop of libertarian blood in your veins - which is to say, you believe the federal government has a limited jurisdiction in the things it is authorized to do - you may very well have a stroke watching this. I mean, Good Lord. Naming a rocket Messiah and pointing it at the juggernaut of a comet without telling anyone. No congressional oversight. Building caves and holding a lottery. I'd love to see the outcry if George W. Bush does one-hundredth of this stuff, not matter what the situation.None of this stuff matters worth beans if you're going to blow $2.99 at Blockbuster. But it's kind of important because all of the strengths are compromised in some way. It shines in the department of character development, special effects, and Morgan Freeman. Well, the characters are all flawed, deliberately, and to excess. When Maximilian Schell's time came, if he was on fire I wouldn't have handed him a bucket. The special effects take too long, and won't save you from boredom. It could be fairly asked, if special effects don't spare the audience boredom, what's the point? Morgan Freeman is awesome, but unless you're naive enough to believe the President can repeal the law of gravity, his executive actions will bother you so much you won't be able to enjoy him.And if you are that naive - hey, why can't he simply order the comet to stop? He's the President.What's left? Robert Duvall's character is interesting, but his self-sacrifice is predictable. You should be able to see it coming an hour in advance. After all that, there's not much left to this film. It's a good chick flick. And one can't help but think, with the nation in an impeachment crisis as it was released, the product might have been tweaked to help Clinton's image and affect the outcome of things in Washington.I'd say if you have a liberal democrat girlfriend and want to get some results out of her, head on over to her place with this movie and a bottle of cheap ripple.

He has toned down the political side that seemed to consume much of MENACE, and I understood that a love story had to appear in some way shape or form, but he has made the most of screen time for non-stop action and brilliant special effects.I wont say a thing about what happens in this film, as I do not wish to spoil anything, but i'm sure by the time fans read this, half the population would have seen this movie (or should have). I will be back for repeat viewings.I cant wait till 2005 to see what George Lucas has created from his clever mind. What I wouldn't give for this guy to read me a bedtime story.

Artificial Intelligence, and others may think that masterpiece is not a strong enough word to explain how amazing this movie truly is. Either way, A.I. is incredible. Loosely based on the short story Supertoys Last All Summer Long, A.I. catapults you into a futuristic world with a spine-tingling prologue and an overview of the melted icecaps. It then kicks off its story immediately, moving at a fast and even pace with astounding visual effects and beautiful music by the master of movie soundtracks, John Williams. The plot is simple yet full of numerous philosophical and moral issues, which are not debated openly but instead left for you to examine on your own. I suppose I should have stated this earlier, but since I didn't, I'll say it now THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Haley Joel Osment's presence among the cast should not convince a pre-teen girl to go see A.I. for that sole reason. This is a movie made specifically for adults and sci-fi lovers, despite the fact that it has a PG-13 rating. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, allow me to continue. Since I already mentioned Haley Joel Osment, I suppose I should describe just how incredible his acting is if you were blown away by the talent he showed in The Sixth Sense, you will be even more surprised by his jaw-dropping performance as the mecha child David. It is simply remarkable to watch how he becomes more and more human throughout the film, never falling out of character (or even blinking, for that matter). And let's not forget Jude Law's minor yet perfect performance as Gigolo Joe, a mecha who (as the title implies) sells his body to women. If you have not already noticed, A.I. has a very dark theme if a robot were programmed to love a human, would that human love him back? I will not give away the answer or any of the events that take place in A.I., because if I did, Spielberg would be after me with a machine gun and a firing squad. What I CAN say, though, is that I think there are only two sci-fi films that have ever tackled this subject without a flaw the first is Blade Runner, and the other is A.I. I know that many people despised Artificial Intelligence, but I believe that it -- like Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' -- will gain greater appreciation as time progresses. Whether you regard it as a masterpiece or a total flop, A.I. is definitely worth a watch.Overall rating 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 May 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Some of you may call me crazy for using such a strong word as masterpiece to describe Spielberg's film A.I.

His mother was bitten when she was pregnant with him, and when he was born, he inherited all the vampire powers (strength, agility, and regeneration) and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, silver, garlic). But he is human in that his life goes at the same rate as all of us. Vampires tend to live a lot longer. His life is spent killing vampires, and searching for the one that infected his mother. The movie starts with a nasty birth scene, and quickly turns into a bloodbath. Literally. There's a very cool fight scene, and then the rest of the movie is spent following Blade. The major plot (killing vampires) is good, but the inner plot wasn't well developed. Stephen Dorff plays a vampire leader. He isn't a pureblood (meaning he wasn't born a vampire, he became one), and he wants vampires to take over the world. So he translates the ancient vampire Bible, and learns of a way to summon the blood god. Great, but what does that mean?   The whole blood god thing isn't explained. Why is that such a good thing? And when the blood god arrives, he isn't all that much better than any other vampire when it comes right down to it. So that was disappointing. Otherwise, I liked the movie. I enjoy these gothic\/action-adventure\/vampire\/thriller type films. They always have an awesome soundtrack, and pretty good fight scenes. And these days, the special effects are a compliment. Blade is no different. Some of the special effects are cool and revolting at the same time. But they get the point across. And Wesley Snipes does a great job playing Blade. Now I haven't read the comic books the movie is based on, so I don't know how faithful the movie is, but he was very cool, and very menacing. And what I really liked was that he didn't display a lot of emotion. Sometimes in these movies, the bad-ass good guy has a heart that comes out way too often. Here, Blade has a heart, but it comes out very, very rarely, and then only for a few seconds. The rest of the cast was adequate, nothing really special about them. The scenery was good looking, and the direction wasn't bad for someone I've never heard of.  Many quick editing and shaky camera movements, that worked well during the fight scenes. What I did like about the story, was how they made vampires seem more human than creature. They discussed how to kill vampires in a way that made it seem like you could actually kill them, and not just like they were invincible. And who would have thought that something that became famous during the O.J. trial, would have played such a big part of the climax? (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm talking about, and if you still don't get it, write me and I'll tell you about it.)Overall, Blade isn't for everyone.

How did it all go wrong?Up until 1999, Star Wars stood as a monument of almost perfection. Although the films had their little flaws (name a film that doesn't) they were almost perfect in terms of entertainment. These films were what film was invented for. And along comes the most hyped and badly titled film that tries to latch itself onto these classics and fob itself off as one of the boys. Well, no. Lucas' reasons for making Episode 1 are pretty evident. Cash. And lots of it. Grossing almost a billion world wide, and god knows what off the merchandizing (remeber 'Darth Maul - The Monitor Dust cover!') the Star Wars name was used and abused. The acting is terrible for starters. When attacked by huge fish in the planet core, Liam Neeson simply looks stoned! In the original trilogy luke would be flapping, chewy would be howling and Han would be shouting at Leia for more thrust, but here, all is well, the force will guide us, worry not. Well what is the point then. And don't get me started on Binks! The special effects are rubbish as well. What?! I hear you cry. Yes, they are technically achieved, there is no doubt of that, but poorly implemented, and at that, over implemented. In the final battle there is SO much CG that it looks more reminisent of Toy Story or some other Disney film, with the over fluent movement making the scene look like a cartoon. Yes, George, you may be sending out a very impressive ILM technology demo, but puppets look better. Why? Becuase they ARE real, and no computer can match that. Computer grpahics will always be better when used only when needed, and slipped seamlessly into the real backdrops. Here, the entire backdrop is the seam. Its not all bad though. We all know the light sabre battle is fantastic as is Darth Maul. But for every Amazing duel, there is an annoying kid, for every speeding pod race, an infurating two headed commentator and for every Darth Maul, there's a Jar Jar binks.

Richard Marquand probably has a great deal to do with this, but the experience of cast and crew may be the primary reason.  There was a fluidity in Jedi that the first one lacked, and the second one nearly reached, but not quite.  The cinematography was astounding with a mastery of the effects the first two pioneered.  The campy stuff was still there, but it was more natural and the cast was comfortable with it using it as a tool without stumbling over it.

All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad....  I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre\/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85).

A touch sappy in some spots and simplistic in others, but hey George always tells us that he is trying to reach your average twelve year old more than anyone else and these films do just that! \tLove one, love them all it is tough to chose in some ways, but Jedi has my vote.

But what Sam Raimi delivers is an excellent super-hero movie that will also entertain regular moviegoers! Raimi's love of the main character is undeniable and he approches the Webslinger with the light entertaining touch required, dosing funny moments and action scenes perfectly while not forgeting to devellop the storyline, which the movie does very well, dealing with the origins of Spider-Man in a way that wont bore anyone, even those who came to see loads of nonstop action and can't wait for something to blow up... He also deals with the death of important characters very well. But the two biggest surprises came from Tobey Maguire and the special effects.

It seems some people think that if it is CGI, people can only think it looks good, although some creatures in movies like The Lord of the Rings weren't very convincing.

But apart from the dialogue, Spider-Man is everything it had to be an incredibly entertaining movie that will please people who love comic books and people who just want to see a good summer movie, with great characters (although the Green Goblin ain't the best Spidey villain ever and I will be more than happy to see a Venom\/Carnage or Mysterio movie) and a good introduction to what is sure to become a very popular franchise.84% ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"15 May 2002","score":"","review":"  After what feels like an eternity waiting for the next Star Wars film, I finally got to see &#145;Attack Of The Clones' at the midnight showing at the Odeon along with 3 of my friends.The atmosphere was like no other that I've witnessed at a non Star Wars film.

The anticipation was killing me... the trailers were impeccable.  I consoled my deepest fears by telling myself... `It can't be worse than 'Phantom Menace' can it?'  While scene to scene, `Clones' was much more visibly exciting than Phantom... there was no more substance. Some where between 1977 and 2002, Lucas forgot that in an epic story... THERE NEEDS TO BE A FREAKIN' STORY!!!  I tried really hard to follow the muddy plot, but alas I was not successful. and I'm a David Lynch fan! Yes, this is as expected a visual masterpiece. The costumes and digital effects were spectacular, and so was the acting... spectacularly awful that is.  Now... don't get me wrong... I don't expect Oscar winning performances from this epic sci-fi franchise (although LOTR Fellowship of the Ring was acted astonishingly well), but Lucas's now obviously inferior performance as a director has lowered these actors' Oscar caliber talent to a mere line readings by 7th graders.  By this, I would like to note I'm referring to your average 7th grader, not a Haley Joel or any prodigy of that sort.The love story was trite, nothing even comparable to the sarcastic tension of Hans and Leia.  And, while I muddled through two hours of George Lucas' masterbatory paint by numbers sets salt and peppered with glimpses of a plot... I tried to have faith that it was all worth it.  Alas it wasn't.Okay, don't get me wrong, Lucas did some things right, like limiting Jar Jar Binks screen time and lines to about 10 to 15 minutes total. And by the end of the film, Clones attacking and all, it was getting pretty good.  Sadly though, I'm reminded of last summer's A.I., which, in my opinion, would have been one of the greatest films of all time, minus the last 20 minutes. `Clones' inversely would have been the worst film of all time, minus the last 20 minutes.

I honestly expected him next to blurt out, `Danger, Will Robinson!' Even the awe inspiring climax between the ultimate Jedi and his Paduin was too short to gratify what I had endured to get to that point.Afterwards, I was consoled by another sci-fi `geek'.

The aliens (who have cute little pixie haircuts, jerky body movements and the ability to spout tentacles), take Earth's old TV shows and movies as historical documents, and the Galaxy Quest actors as authentic astronauts. Tim Allen makes an affable swell-head offered the opportunity to explore his own inner hero potential. According to historical documents, Ms. Weaver has ample experience kicking alien butt. She does so here with a healthy sense of humor, while making Tawny more than the predictable punchline of a blonde joke. Rickman is droll indeed as the consummate actor trapped in a role more Gila than Hamlet. The rest of the cast is right on target too, and the script, while never fall-out-of-your-seat funny, will keep a smile on your face throughout. Galaxy Quest also features creatures courtesy of Oscar-winning Stan Winston and the slickest visual effects conceivable from Industrial Light and Magic. ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"}]
