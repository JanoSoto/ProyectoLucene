The key to Psycho is that it came out nearly 50 years ago and while viewing the film one should keep this in mind. Most of the surprises and tricks we take for granted today were at one point something totally new and different. Writers so often steal and copy ideas from others that everything becomes predictable--in fact, that is the major problem with today's horror flick the viewer knows exactly what is going to happen. However, Psycho is sort of a first cause, it's a film that stole nothing yet inspired everything. Of course, to watch the Psycho in this day and age isn't nearly as exciting as it would have been back in 1960. But as I stated, in order to truly appreciate Hitchcock's genius one has to put himself back in a theatre during Psycho's release.The film begins with a young woman, Marion Crane (Leigh). She seems like a respectable girl, but she soon falls to temptation and steals forty thousand dollars from her employer. After this she immediately leaves town and heads towards California. Before she reaches her destination she must first take a night's rest at a roadside motel, the Bates Motel, and here begins our descent into the darkness. At the dilapidated motel, Marion meets the owner, Norman Bates (played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins), and they even have a nice dinner together. Hitchcock has set up the perfect thriller; he dupes us into believing this film is now going to somehow center on Marion and Norman, and in a way it does, but not in the way we anticipate. Hitch starts this film as a classic cat and mouse game girl steal money, cops try to get money back. But all of our expectations are shattered as Marion is brutally stabbed to death while she is taking a shower in her motel room. We even discover that the perpetrator is Norman's crazy mother.Marion may be dead, but her crime is well enough alive. A private investigator (Martin Balsam) (hired by Marion's sister and boyfriend)is on her tail, and traces her to the Bates motel. He too meets and untimely death, and once again we are astounded. Hitchcock not only killed his main character, but now he has killed a cop. We are held in complete suspense; we know that Hitch is not afraid to kill anyone, and that means anything can happen. This is the kind of remarkable and groundbreaking stuff I was talking about. No other director before Hitchcock was as brazen as to knock off the female lead (and certainly not while she was naked in the shower). Could you imagine seeing this for the first time?Soon enough Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and boyfriend (John Gavin) decide to go find her themselves. They want to convince Marion to turn herself in so she may receive a lesser penalty for her crime. Right before the private investigator was murdered by Momma Bates, he told them that he had traced Marion to the Bates Motel, and thus the two of them head off to the hellhole. Shortly after this point the film ends, and what an end it is! Hitchcock has set us up for one of the most suspenseful, disturbing, and surprising conclusions in cinematic history. I can only imagine how incredible this experience would have been back in 1960, but alas, Psycho's ending is hardly a secret anymore and some of its more shocking moments are not nearly as jaw-dropping in this modern age. However, that doesn't change the fact that Psycho spawned the modern horror genre and gave us some of Hitchcock's best cinematography.We have been exposed to almost fifty years of copycats since Psycho and because of this I think we have forgotten just how amazing the original was. It is like living in Arizona one sees the sun so often he forgets how glorious it was when he first moved there. So yes, Pyscho may seem a bit dated, but that isn't the films fault; that is our fault--we have seen to many duplicates. I will also admit that Pyscho doesn't really have much of a message (well, unless one counts the film's brief mention of how people create traps for themselves). However, this movie's goal is not to preach, but to scare and surprise, and I believe it succeeds wonderfully in this area (so long as we can imagine ourselves in a 1960's theatre). Pyscho is not only a part of American culture, but a milestone in American film-making, and probably Hitchcock's greatest achievement.

The werewolf is amazing though not much of a wolf, more a cross between a lion and a piranha. The transformation is still mind-boggling, Rick Baker used every trick in the Dick Smith book as it was then written, and added a bunch of chapters of his own. The acting is good enough--Naughton is a very likable protagonist and works well with Dunne. The music is nice (can listen to Sam Cook any time) but distracting--after awhile you wonder whose version of Blue Moon will pop up next. I dreaded the arrival of Moon River. Then we come to the script. Alas. Nothing in this area makes much sense. After a very suspenseful opening it all falls down, logic was not part of Landis's thought processes. The running gag with Dunne returning from the dead again and again looking more decayed each time is good, but it LACKS A PAYOFF!! He just disappears. What the film needed after the werewolf is killed (badly, see below) is Naughton and Dunne walking spectrally off into the night and a line like Well, this looks like the end of a beautiful friendship. And the doctor's entire trip to the village where it all started is useless, he learns nothing we don't already know and it adds nothing to the story except length. After all the blood and murder and horror (even the contrived stuff like the whole sequence in the Tube) and an interminable and gratuitous series of car crashes (what is it with Landis and cars?), the poor ol' wolf is shot down in an alleyway like a rabid dog--and by regular bullets. Very disappointing. And then we don't even get to see him change back into Our Hero! Thereby removing any connection between Our Hero and the monster, and with it most of the scene's pathos. Hadn't Landis seen any of the other werewolf pix? Fright Night did something like it quite nicely with a very realistic wolf. And where the hell is Our Hero's family?? Frank Oz shows up as a rep of the American Embassy, but that's it. Obviously Landis wasn't interested in even that much reality. One overly pathetic phone call does it for Our Hero's entire previous life. Puh-leeze. The business with him being haunted by the ghosts of his victims is a nice touch, but again where's the logic of having his good buddy there? He was killed by the last werewolf. Oh well.

The camera is simply showing us what the narrator is telling us. We are so accustomed to believing what the camera shows us, that we accept without reserve. We forget that the camera is actually the filmmaker, a human being (in most cases), telling us a story. People lie. We cannot always trust people. We cannot always trust what seems to be objective reality. This film does the same thing that Rashomon and Persona do, although I consider those films deeper and more profound. We the audience are Dave Kujan, Chazz Palminteri's character. We are falling for the lie being fed to us. Though what we are being told is not totally a lie. Many of the things said and told are true. A lie is not a lie unless it contains much truth. Most of what we see actually happened. The fact that not all of it did is what makes the film so interesting. We are left scratching our heads trying to figure out what actually happened. What we thought we knew we no longer know that we know. I think that is one of the marks of a great film. It stays with you, for good or bad. It challenges your idea about film.

One of his regular customers, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), calls on him to verify the authenticity of his rare book The Nine Gates by comparing it to the only other two copies in existence. But Balkan is too insistent and suspiciously generous in his offers, already promising to double the money before Corso even starts. But Corso (apparently not being as smart as us viewers) doesn't really question this. Additionally, Balkan offhandedly entrusts the $1,000,000 book to Corso without hesitation or contract, despite its enormous value.As Corso tracks down the other two books (he gets on an airplane - Balkan has already told him of their European locations) and people around him start to die, he learns that the book (derived from a book by Lucifer) somehow holds the key to opening a portal called the ninth gate.Corso, examining the differences in the nine illustrations between his and Victor Fargas' copy, finds some of the illustrations signed by LCF (for 'Lucifer'), and some by AT. Here the plot takes a major 'wrong turn', as the viewers can clearly see what Corso doesn't that the nine LCF illustrations, distributed among the three copies of the book, must be brought together to solve the riddle and unleash the book's powers.As we wait for Corso to catch on to this mind-numbingly obvious fact, he continues on his quest, which instead of gaining intrigue, becomes plodding and familiar. The same goes for 'The Girl' (Emmanuelle Seigner), who mysteriously appears and disappears, occasionally gliding through the air, but we never learn much more about her (except she has a thick accent, never answers questions, and likes to have sex near burning buildings).Aside from Depp, who finally succumbs to sleep-walking through his part, most of the acting is B-rate. Seigner blurts our her lines at times, much to the dismay of viewers wanting something more substantial. Langella, for the most part, does well until the climax of the film.Effects, even minor ones, could be troublesome. A wire to tip over a podium during a fight scene was glaring. The CG in the opening titles was poorly done, though mostly forgivable. Driving and flying scenes were obviously rear projections, if only they hadn't been so thoroughly abused.Then there are things that defy explanation. Corso, in hot pursuit of Balkan, stops in the middle of a stream (where he supposedly got stuck). A car, trying to hit Corso, manages to miss by swerving in the opposite direction. In an attempt to surreptitiously follow an unsuspecting target, Corso and The Girl choose a loud, high-revving red Dodge Viper. And the film must get at least a mention for having one of the most distracting mustaches (Pedro Ceniza) ever to be projected on a silver screen.The weak score from Wojciech Kilar was often more fitting for a comedy than a thriller. As Corso walks down an alley on his way to a book dealer, we hear a kind of 'adventure' music, similar to what you'd hear in a comedy during the setup of a physical joke (I was half-expecting to see Depp pushing a circus elephant into the back of a convertible). Occasional mismatches between the action and the musical peaks don't help. During the same alley walk scene, the 'adventure' music starts in the previous scene, before we even get to see Corso walking, and it is jarring when the visuals finally catch up.At 133 minutes, this film was nearly an hour too long, plodding its way through details that should have been thought better of. Why do we care if scaffolding suddenly comes tumbling down on Corso? It wasn't scary or mysterious, just out of place.I so much wanted this movie to take me to new and exciting places, and fulfill the promise of the opening minutes. But that was not to be.

But the film doesn't begin in the future, but in the far-away past. Director Stanley Kubrick depicts men at the ape stage, which existed 4 million years ago. That's maybe the most ancient representation of mankind ever presented. The ape make-up is so well done that we all could be confused. Just to say it, make-up artists weren't nominated to the Oscars, because the judges were all certain that these were real monkeys...Parallels between ancient and future times include man's existence and wandering inside an hostile and dangerous world. And his need of evolving. But Kubrick puts his pessimist mood by showing us as unable of evolving by ourselves. We need outside intervention (aliens never shown) in order to accomplish our destiny.Black monoliths are the objects used by the hidden aliens in order to make humans evolving. First time, ape-men become able of using bones as tools and weapons. Second time, world scientists create the space ship Discovery I for outer-space exploration and they hope that they will find the monolith's signification. The third one is a gate throughout space and time and the final one rises astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) to the next level.But 2001 is a fantastic voyage into reflexion and meditation, which means that it's not everyone who's able of enjoying it. Those who expect that space should be used as a playground or as an extreme fight terrain will be strongly deceived when they see that space is only a background to man's research for his own existence and destiny.2001 is to cinema what Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is to music. Both items are the epitome of the 60's counterculture and there is a strong psychedelic mood that translates well on screen or on gramophone. The Star Gate sequence is the best example, with its surrealist sequences of geometrical colored motifs and abstract landscapes. But the themes reflect also the new cultural values which promote introspection and disputes over traditional values.Realism is strongly flagrant. Especially in the sound process. Probably the only movie that really shows space as a fully empty place, Kubrick presents universe as a great black danger, with its desolated landscapes and dead, almost haunted atmospheres.Kubrick wasn't an Oscar favorite, but he strongly deserves the Visual Effects Award that he received for 2001. Futuristic computers, spaceships, furniture and costumes are eye-catching and imaginative. But the best special FX of the movie (and perhaps of all time) are presented in the final twenty-five minutes. These are the spectacular and unbelievable slit-scan star-gate, which is a psychedelically colored gate towards time and space, and also the spatial events, such as the birth of a supernova.The best character of the movie, surprisingly, is not a human being. It's HAL, the ultra-perfected computer that runs the Discovery spaceship. He's so obsessed by his quest for perfection that he wouldn't hesitate to get ridden of anyone who would threaten him. He also leads the viewer to ask himself\/herself many questions is it safe to create computers and machines that are more and more perfected? And do we depend on them? Questions, questions, questions... Answers, there aren't any. At least, they're not revealed. We have to figure them out by ourselves. And do not hope that a monolith will appear and give you an answer. In a time where psychedelic music would be the ultimate escape, 2001 was the symbol of a society that entered into a great phase of questions about itself and it still is today. That's the power and the possibilities of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. The Ultimate Trip still is an adequate nickname and, with its unforgettable sequences, its gripping realism, its visually dazzling shots, its strongly meditative mood and its legacy beyond compare, 2001 is nothing else than the greatest movie ever made.

But the film doesn't begin in the future, but in the far-away past. Director Stanley Kubrick depicts men at the ape stage, which existed 4 million years ago. That's maybe the most ancient representation of mankind ever presented. The ape make-up is so well done that we all could be confused. Just to say it, make-up artists weren't nominated to the Oscars, because the judges were all certain that these were real monkeys...Parallels between ancient and future times include man's existence and wandering inside an hostile and dangerous world. And his need of evolving. But Kubrick puts his pessimist mood by showing us as unable of evolving by ourselves. We need outside intervention (aliens never shown) in order to accomplish our destiny.Black monoliths are the objects used by the hidden aliens in order to make humans evolving. First time, ape-men become able of using bones as tools and weapons. Second time, world scientists create the space ship Discovery I for outer-space exploration and they hope that they will find the monolith's signification. The third one is a gate throughout space and time and the final one rises astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) to the next level.But 2001 is a fantastic voyage into reflexion and meditation, which means that it's not everyone who's able of enjoying it. Those who expect that space should be used as a playground or as an extreme fight terrain will be strongly deceived when they see that space is only a background to man's research for his own existence and destiny.2001 is to cinema what Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is to music. Both items are the epitome of the 60's counterculture and there is a strong psychedelic mood that translates well on screen or on gramophone. The Star Gate sequence is the best example, with its surrealist sequences of geometrical colored motifs and abstract landscapes. But the themes reflect also the new cultural values which promote introspection and disputes over traditional values.Realism is strongly flagrant. Especially in the sound process. Probably the only movie that really shows space as a fully empty place, Kubrick presents universe as a great black danger, with its desolated landscapes and dead, almost haunted atmospheres.Kubrick wasn't an Oscar favorite, but he strongly deserves the Visual Effects Award that he received for 2001. Futuristic computers, spaceships, furniture and costumes are eye-catching and imaginative. But the best special FX of the movie (and perhaps of all time) are presented in the final twenty-five minutes. These are the spectacular and unbelievable slit-scan star-gate, which is a psychedelically colored gate towards time and space, and also the spatial events, such as the birth of a supernova.The best character of the movie, surprisingly, is not a human being. It's HAL, the ultra-perfected computer that runs the Discovery spaceship. He's so obsessed by his quest for perfection that he wouldn't hesitate to get ridden of anyone who would threaten him. He also leads the viewer to ask himself\/herself many questions is it safe to create computers and machines that are more and more perfected? And do we depend on them? Questions, questions, questions... Answers, there aren't any. At least, they're not revealed. We have to figure them out by ourselves. And do not hope that a monolith will appear and give you an answer. In a time where psychedelic music would be the ultimate escape, 2001 was the symbol of a society that entered into a great phase of questions about itself and it still is today. That's the power and the possibilities of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece.

Accompanied by his unpromisingly named daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badhu), the small group in the bunk house provide a rich learning environment for the perceptive, but naive Homer.Homer's adventures are many and as the story twists and turns, he finds love and best of all he finds himself through his experience of the wider community he now inhabits.There is so much more in this film that space permits to even hint at.

This is one roller-coaster ride of a movie.This film is about a man who leads a fairly dull life. I mean, he has a nice wife, but a dead end job as a construction worker in the year 2084 A.D. He has an odd fascination with the planet mars and craves the adventure of one day being able to take a trip there. While riding the bus to his area of work, he notices an ad for a pseudo-trip. I say pseudo because the trip is not real, but an insertion of memory. This place is called recall, and what they do is insert a memory chip, enabling you to believe that you took a vacation to a place that you probably could not afford otherwise. Quaid can see no reason in not going to recall, so he goes- only for the procedure to go terribly wrong, when Quaid realizes that he has already been to mars, and is now a wanted man.Good flick. Seems to live in the same vein as the fifth element. Or the fifth element seems to live in the same vein as total recall, rather. I think that's right. Well anyway, it had some cool graphics, I especially liked the one with the no-air-eyes-pop-out thing. Really cool. My only real complaint is that some of the fight scenes looked like they were filmed by a four year old. Now maybe its because I have seen way too many kung-fu movies, and I believe our generation to be living in a generation of old kung-fu rip-off's (**cough cough** the matrix **cough cough**). The main question on this board seems to be was it a dream? Well that much is up to you. But overall good film. Good enough for an 8\/10 at least.

He has an odd fascination with the planet mars and craves the adventure of one day being able to take a trip there. While riding the bus to his area of work, he notices an ad for a pseudo-trip. I say pseudo because the trip is not real, but an insertion of memory. This place is called recall, and what they do is insert a memory chip, enabling you to believe that you took a vacation to a place that you probably could not afford otherwise. Quaid can see no reason in not going to recall, so he goes- only for the procedure to go terribly wrong, when Quaid realizes that he has already been to mars, and is now a wanted man.Good flick. Seems to live in the same vein as the fifth element. Or the fifth element seems to live in the same vein as total recall, rather. I think that's right. Well anyway, it had some cool graphics, I especially liked the one with the no-air-eyes-pop-out thing. Really cool.
