I came into Moulin Rouge! with a huge bias, due simply to the horrid cover of Lady Marmalade on MTV and the radio, which was my only exposure to the movie.  Were it not for my friend's older sister reassuring me that the song was only in the actual movie for one sequence of a few minutes at most, I never would've seen it at all.  I'm glad I listened to her, because this is a colorful, musical masterpiece, though at times its a little messy.The cornerstone of Moulin Rouge!, being a musical of sorts, is the music. Most of the film's musical numbers are not original, and are composed of resung samples from songs ranging from U2 to Elton John (its fun just trying to see how fast one can recognize the sample).  While a few of these are cute, others are strange and\/or just too much (the whole bit from Smells Like Teen Spirit was so absurd I had to laugh, but the Madonna made me groan).  Probably the best musical sequence is Fatboy Slim's hard hitting Can Can (although ironically enough, this is the aforementioned sequence with the dreaded Lady Marmalade, luckily it is mostly drowned out by the beat) that looks and feels like a modern club.  However, that is what makes most of these sequences so odd; why bother setting the film in 1900 as a period piece if the music and choreography totally remove it from that era?Besides the music, the film's grand atmosphere comes from the stunning visuals.  This is Baz Luhrmann at his best and every editor's worst nightmare; every club\/rehearsal\/play scene packs in enough color, lights, and costumes to put Cirque du Soleil to shame.  Its not just that these scenes feature so many things going on, but that the collage of it all is put together so efficiently; most of the time it feels necessary, as opposed to just filler (there are still moments where the film seems more like a long string of music videos as opposed to a film, though not as many as I would've expected).  On that rare occasion when a sequence turned out sloppy, however, all the overindulgence causes the film to cough up some awful cinematographic vomit (though this only happened once or twice to the point where it really bothered me, mostly from the camera jumping around and switching sequences too much).  Unfortunately, since each sequence is so big (if anything, they get bigger and bigger throughout the film) all this simply adds up to too much to see and digest in just one viewing, so, as brilliant as they are, only the grandest of these grand sequences will leave an impression (but what an impression it is!).Underneath all this style, amazingly enough, is a movie (albeit a weak one).  Though the plot is cliche-ridden (the most disappointing thing about the movie) and obviously depends on its visual\/audio sequences to keep interest (tons of style makes up for an almost total lack of substance), it is held afloat by some excellent supporting performances from Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent, and whomever played Christian's eccentric Bohemian artist colleagues\/neighbors.  Though their acting wasn't lacking, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman should really be commended for their singing performances, which were much better than I could have ever hoped.Moulin Rouge! was a pleasant surprise, but there is just too much to handle.  Although I did enjoy it, its thorough lack of anything interesting in the plot (I had the whole thing telegraphed within the first half hour) and constant one-up-manship over itself will ensure that for repeated viewings its more worth it to just skip through and watch your favorite sequences (the aforementioned Can Can and the ending) again, rather than the whole film.

A very popular book. An adaptation should satisfied the many people who read the book.2. A very control writer. J.K. Rowling knew exactly how she wanted the film to look like and was not going to let anyone destroy her work.3. The book is a set-up. The basic setting and main characters are described in details and will not be described any more. Other were briefly mentioned and will be dealt later.With these 3 obstacles in mind, can anyone be surprise that everyone involved in the project have chosen an faithful adaptation for the book. And while this approach has solved the first 2 obstacles . It only solved half of the 3rd one. Things that were dealt in the book were ignored in the film and would have to be dealt in later films. With a limit time of running for a film I can not see how they are going to do this.(but this is more a problem for the makers and not for me). But even the most faithful adaptation is bound to have changes. Changes are inevitable and here there are no exception. There are changes and I found three of these changes to suggest that the book has not been carefully read or that Rowling's control was not always at best.1. The scene in the zoo - At this stage in his life Harry Potter is not aware that he is a wizard. The way the scene is written and directed seem to suggest the opposite. It makes Harry's reaction late a little illogic.2. The riddles on the way to the stone - There are many riddles, each represent a teacher. Some of them disappeared on the way to the big screen. But there are three which are important. The 1st involve the flying keys. This one represent Harry's strength in being a Seeker in Quidditch. The 2nd involve a live chess game. This one represent Ron Weasley's strength in that game. He is the best player. The 3rd involve potions. This one represent Hermione Granger's strength in logic and show how sharp her mind is. The whole way to the stone also show that our 3 hero's have to work together in order to solve everything. Alone they can not make it. For some reason Hermione's riddle has disappeared from the film and to add insult to injury Professor Dumbledore mention her riddle at the end of the year feast. Confusing to say the least. If you have read the book, you will know what he is talking about. If not you can only guest.3. Harry's confrontation with Voldemort - Harry's reaction to Professor Quirrell come from instincts. The film turns him into a murderer and with no consequences. Not the message I'd like children to see.I was missing 2 other aspects of the book. Harry's life at The Dursleys doesn't look as bad as it was described in the book and I didn't get the sense of a school which in the book is very much part of the book.Chris Columbus is an adequate director. He doesn't have the ability or the vision to give the material an extra bonus. He directed the film according to the book , no extras. In his decision to be faithful to the book he ignored the fact that the book  and the film are 2 different mediums and that there is a place for changes that will reflect that fact. John Williams' music is good and serve the film well. The cast, with no exception is good, but some of them could be use more. I am very glad that all actors were English and that it was filmed in England. It kept the spirit of the book intact. There were 2 scenes that were better than the rest of the film The Quidditch game(too short and not enough) and the live  chess gane towards the end of the film. If only the rest of the film was like that we might have a better film.This is not a bad film nor is it an excellent one. It rank as an OK film. I do think that people who have never read the book will enjoy from it more than people who have read the book. And after the film they will run to read the book, which is good. It is shame though. The book had the potential for a good movie but the result is less than expected.

But there are three which are important. The 1st involve the flying keys. This one represent Harry's strength in being a Seeker in Quidditch. The 2nd involve a live chess game. This one represent Ron Weasley's strength in that game. He is the best player. The 3rd involve potions. This one represent Hermione Granger's strength in logic and show how sharp her mind is. The whole way to the stone also show that our 3 hero's have to work together in order to solve everything. Alone they can not make it. For some reason Hermione's riddle has disappeared from the film and to add insult to injury Professor Dumbledore mention her riddle at the end of the year feast. Confusing to say the least. If you have read the book, you will know what he is talking about. If not you can only guest.3. Harry's confrontation with Voldemort - Harry's reaction to Professor Quirrell come from instincts. The film turns him into a murderer and with no consequences. Not the message I'd like children to see.I was missing 2 other aspects of the book. Harry's life at The Dursleys doesn't look as bad as it was described in the book and I didn't get the sense of a school which in the book is very much part of the book.Chris Columbus is an adequate director. He doesn't have the ability or the vision to give the material an extra bonus. He directed the film according to the book , no extras. In his decision to be faithful to the book he ignored the fact that the book  and the film are 2 different mediums and that there is a place for changes that will reflect that fact. John Williams' music is good and serve the film well. The cast, with no exception is good, but some of them could be use more. I am very glad that all actors were English and that it was filmed in England. It kept the spirit of the book intact. There were 2 scenes that were better than the rest of the film The Quidditch game(too short and not enough) and the live  chess gane towards the end of the film. If only the rest of the film was like that we might have a better film.This is not a bad film nor is it an excellent one. It rank as an OK film. I do think that people who have never read the book will enjoy from it more than people who have read the book. And after the film they will run to read the book, which is good. It is shame though.

A very popular book. An adaptation should satisfied the many people who read the book.2. A very control writer. J.K. Rowling knew exactly how she wanted the film to look like and was not going to let anyone destroy her work.3. The book is a set-up. The basic setting and main characters are described in details and will not be described any more. Other were briefly mentioned and will be dealt later.With these 3 obstacles in mind, can anyone be surprise that everyone involved in the project have chosen an faithful adaptation for the book.

Boromir's scene with the shards of Isildur's sword didn't somehow ring true to the character. The way he left it lying on the floor. No. If nothing else Boromir would show respect for Isildur's sword, with it Isildur achieved a mighty victory and Boromir would honour it for that reason if nothing else.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 January 2002","score":"69 out of 80 people found the following review useful","review":"  Watching this marvellous film again last night, I began to think about how peculiar that a film which has so severely dated in so many respects still manages to say something profound today.  In certain respects, this film just couldn't be done today.  First of all, gender roles have changed a great deal, and many of Alfie's birds simply wouldn't be plausible in a modern film.  Second of all, sex has changed so much.  Back in the 80s, we had plenty of films (usually bad ones) which took a similarly cavalier attitude toward sex, but that's a relic of a simpler, pre-HIV world that's gone forever.   But Alfie still manages to say something, even to a modern audience.  On one hand, it's got a very funny script, and Michael Caine plays Alfie with such an infectious charm that it's impossible not to smile.  But also, there's a deeper layer of meaning to the film.  I never mean to hurt anyone, Alfie says.  I know, says Harry, but you do.  Alfie ignores this lovely and rare moment of real honesty, but the audience shouldn't, because the heart of the film is right here.  Alfie himself is such a fascinating character.  At first, he seems like simply a rogue, a rascal.  But there's a helluva lot going on under the surface.  His deep, deep insecurities, his tragic loneliness (he wouldn't see it that way, naturally), his pathological inability to have a real relationship with anyone.  Especially his own son, whom he obviously loves very much. While it's easy to see Alfie as a tragic story and feel sympathy for the character, it's important to hold onto the hatred.  Alfie is a cruel, merciless, and heartless man.  He is self-absorbed, utterly insensitive, and totally domineering.  He cheerfully holds his birds to standards of loyalty he himself needn't bother with.  He ruthlessly undermines the individuality and autonomy of everyone he is with, even when pretending to be a liberating force.  Notice in his scenes with Gilda how his words sound as though he's endorsing freedom, independence, and self-determination, but the effect of those words is to keep her right under his thumb where she belongs.

In certain respects, this film just couldn't be done today.  First of all, gender roles have changed a great deal, and many of Alfie's birds simply wouldn't be plausible in a modern film.  Second of all, sex has changed so much.  Back in the 80s, we had plenty of films (usually bad ones) which took a similarly cavalier attitude toward sex, but that's a relic of a simpler, pre-HIV world that's gone forever.   But Alfie still manages to say something, even to a modern audience.  On one hand, it's got a very funny script, and Michael Caine plays Alfie with such an infectious charm that it's impossible not to smile.  But also, there's a deeper layer of meaning to the film.  I never mean to hurt anyone, Alfie says.  I know, says Harry, but you do.  Alfie ignores this lovely and rare moment of real honesty, but the audience shouldn't, because the heart of the film is right here.  Alfie himself is such a fascinating character.  At first, he seems like simply a rogue, a rascal.  But there's a helluva lot going on under the surface.  His deep, deep insecurities, his tragic loneliness (he wouldn't see it that way, naturally), his pathological inability to have a real relationship with anyone.  Especially his own son, whom he obviously loves very much. While it's easy to see Alfie as a tragic story and feel sympathy for the character, it's important to hold onto the hatred.  Alfie is a cruel, merciless, and heartless man.  He is self-absorbed, utterly insensitive, and totally domineering.  He cheerfully holds his birds to standards of loyalty he himself needn't bother with.  He ruthlessly undermines the individuality and autonomy of everyone he is with, even when pretending to be a liberating force.  Notice in his scenes with Gilda how his words sound as though he's endorsing freedom, independence, and self-determination, but the effect of those words is to keep her right under his thumb where she belongs.

While this can be a bit much for some, its enough for the rest of us. The only one missing is the Mummy.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa is an extremely talented individual and perhaps the only writer\/director who is able to simultaneously scare and mentally challenge me at the same time (note that very few are capable of doing one or the other). Although the writing is very good (story and dialogue), Kurosawa's real strength is his ability to represent visually the progressive denouement of his story. He rather subtly show you and let your imagination and intellect figure it out for you than to spell out bluntly what the straightforward storyline should be. It does not, however, get to the point of chaotic untidiness or pointlessness, for he is able to guide you slowly along the way (I would then say that he is slightly easier to follow than David Lynch is, but then again who is not). He uses here a strikingly effective technique where he shows you a room from one angle and later lets you discover that room more and more as the movie advances. His camera shots are always well planned and he is thus able to draw you in the movie bit by bit-quite an eerie sensation.The acting is generally good and believable. The camera-work is a stand out.There are many scenes where you will be able to appreciate this superior artistic and technical quality. The music is good and tenseful, but it is sparse and what is used instead is a contrast of minimalist and grossly amplified everyday sounds that vibrate through the movie. When there is no sound, you often find yourself holding your breath. This is not used strictly as a ploy, but rather creates a mood and further pulls you in the general atmosphere of the movie. Most of all, again, the directing is top notch. The pace which is slow enough for you to have the time to both think and be afraid is not slow enough that it gets boring, although you should not expect a North American expeditious run through the film. Everything is there, but it comes to you in slow, meticulously chosen dosage. Only, at the end can you truly see the masterpiece that has been drawn stroke by stroke in front of you.One of the reason this movie actually works is that it is designed to play with your mind and trigger fear and reaction based not only on emotion, but on reason. People are dying, but everything is calm, rational. The tone and story are pretty much realistic and, at the end of the experience, you may feel beyond your volitional control that you are actually convinced of the strange things in the movie.

It contains a glorious cocktail of artistic styles and mediums ranging from pop-art to art nouveau. The two particular scenes that really appear to stand out are when 'Eleanor Rigby' is played and we are shown a grim and almost dystopian view of industrial Liverpool (great pop-art), and of course, the finale; which is literally bursting with colour and psychedelia (best wear your sunglasses!). George Harrison's 'It's all too much' coincides wonderfully with this.The score is well constructed and it's great to see that the film contains some of The Beatles earlier hits; 'Nowhere Man' (which appeared back in 1965 on the album 'Rubber Soul') for example. This is a treat for fans and those who are curious alike.It seems peculiar that The Beatles themselves didn't actually do the voices of their animated characters (their voices aren't overly authentic to the trained ear), but they do make a brief appearance at the end of the film. Yellow Submarine is also great to watch in groups. I had the opportunity to see it at local theatre and it was completely sold-out. It was very encouraging to see young children clapping along to the songs and dancing away along with their parents and other 'random' Beatles fanatics.

That's because director Wes Craven in addition to having a genuine affection for the genre, understands how wildly improbable and easy to lampoon it is. And, with Scream, he skewers it at every corner, using self-referential humor and a flood of in-jokes (some subtle, some obvious).In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves ``deconstruction'' of movie plots. ``Deconstruction'' is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. ``Scream'' is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.But this movie is not just a horror film. The self-referential tone of the movie allows us to step back from the horror. Also, the presence of detectives and inquisitive characters focuses our attention away from fear and toward curiosity. We can stop the killing if we can only unmask the killer.For those who know horror movies, the self-referential tone provides some funny moments when characters point out the rules of a horror movie, mention director Wes Craven, or comment on what would be happening if this were a movie.And, for those looking for a good scare, Scream is an excellent choice. The mask the killer uses (which appears to be derived from Munch's The Scream) is really quite frightening. The killer is more human than in most horror films, and therefore more terrifying. He is not invisible, but he is only seen in a quick flash. His advantage is not supernatural power - victims can lash out against him and have some effect - his advantage is surprise and fear. The killer's humanity and thus his potential vulnerability makes him all the more frightening, and makes us all the more tense for his next victim.MESSAGE - Horror films may breed copycat killings.Conclusion This is a modern type of heart-thrilling horror movies and it really does scare you who are not a real fans of horror movies. I rate this movie as a good movie and it is also a good way to thrill the audience. So it realy does had a very strong effects on the thrilling part. I rate it 3,5\/5. But for the story of the movie I rate it as a fair story. Great score for a movie like this.

The mask the killer uses (which appears to be derived from Munch's The Scream) is really quite frightening. The killer is more human than in most horror films, and therefore more terrifying. He is not invisible, but he is only seen in a quick flash. His advantage is not supernatural power - victims can lash out against him and have some effect - his advantage is surprise and fear. The killer's humanity and thus his potential vulnerability makes him all the more frightening, and makes us all the more tense for his next victim.MESSAGE - Horror films may breed copycat killings.Conclusion This is a modern type of heart-thrilling horror movies and it really does scare you who are not a real fans of horror movies. I rate this movie as a good movie and it is also a good way to thrill the audience. So it realy does had a very strong effects on the thrilling part. I rate it 3,5\/5.

That's because director Wes Craven in addition to having a genuine affection for the genre, understands how wildly improbable and easy to lampoon it is. And, with Scream, he skewers it at every corner, using self-referential humor and a flood of in-jokes (some subtle, some obvious).In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves ``deconstruction'' of movie plots. ``Deconstruction'' is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. ``Scream'' is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.But this movie is not just a horror film. The self-referential tone of the movie allows us to step back from the horror. Also, the presence of detectives and inquisitive characters focuses our attention away from fear and toward curiosity.

The chemistry between Affleck and Adams is noticable from the first time they meet (I almost thought they were dating during the making of this film rather than her and Kevin Smith).  They both also put in excellent performances where you really feel the emotions they are pouring out (a little bit too much at times, admittedly).  Jason Lee is also very good as the third wheel who cant stand to see his childhood buddy moving on.  Jay and Silent Bob make a small cameo near the end that is perfectly suited to their styles - Mewes being his same hilarious nasty self while Smith again puts all of it into perspective for us (much like he did at the end of Clerks with the lasagna line).  This movie works and says more about relationships in the 90s than a thousand episodes of Friends.***********SPOILERS ALERT**********SPOILERS ALERT************My only real beef with this film is near the end.  The whole scene where Holden gets Banky and Alyssa together to suggest a menage a trois as a means of solving their love triangle is more than a bit far-fetched.  I almost thought Smith was going to use this as a way to show them both how he felt about them and how they should all work it out (as a facetious joke perhaps) but Holden is actually serious.  This is where the movie breaks down and loses its authenticity.  The hanging ending which everyone in the audience seems to be kinda irked at (most everyone is rooting for Holden and Alyssa to get it worked out) is actually pretty on-the-money in terms of realism. A lot of times the good guy doesn't get the girl and they all just move on and learn from the lesson.

Not having read the books (or should I say Books?) this was somewhat surprising.  I expected, for some reason, the story to be better.  But no, that's about all there is to it.  There's an epic quest.  Things happen on the way.  In fact, the quest is so epic that apparently it needs three movies for the whole thing to be shown.  What a quest!  And what great things happen on the way! Our heroes get attacked.  Again and again. On the plus side, there are no cute talking animals or computer-generated sidekicks.  There is precious little romance.  The action is well-staged and the special effects actually deserve to be called special.  The film does not hang about, either.  No sooner have our plucky little dudes arrived in one artfully-rendered location than they're off, over the NZ hills, to another one. The power of the ring is shown to great effect, in a couple of eye-opening scenes in which otherwise innocent characters suddenly become evil gits desperate to get their hands on the thing.  Which all adds to the fun, I'm sure you'll agree. The performances from all concerned are excellent, especially when you consider that so many of the scenes involve actors talking\/reacting to stand-ins\/green-screens, or whatever.  Some of the characters are normal sized, you see, while others (although played by normal sized people) are quite a bit smaller.  Such is this film's confidence and subtlety, however, that this is never really stated, it's just there, and the effects are up to the job of showing it without calling attention to it.  Amazing, really, in this day and age. In fact, despite all its up-to-the-minute technology this is a pleasantly old-fashioned film.  It relies on long-forgotten crafts like storytelling, characterisation, plot, suspense and drama for its effects. Peter Jackson knows how to milk suspense without overdoing it, such as in the scene where the Hobbits are hiding in the roots of a tree, from one of the guys in black.  For a second, the shot just shows them, cowering, with the tree above them.  The audience is right there with them (apart from the tw*ts discussing where to go for dinner into their mobiles) until slowly the horseman appears.  It's simple and effective. Moments like that make you realise you're not just watching another Hollywood cgi-fest, but the work of people who genuinely know how to make a Crowd-Pleaser. George Lucas should watch it several times, and then hang his head in shame. And we can only hope that, in twenty years' time, Mister Jackson is still making genuine entertainment like this rather than hopeless, lumpen, stolid, insulting crap like The Ph*nt*m Menace.
