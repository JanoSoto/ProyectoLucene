Batman Returns was criticized for being overly dark and depressing, which upset many parents, in contrast to the first '89 film. Warner Bros. wasn't satisfied with having Batman being in a mature rated atmosphere and wanted a much lighter film. So, they kicked Tim Burton out and had another director to hold the reins for the next film, Joel Schumacher. Schumacher was set to direct Batman Forever, while Burton was demoted as just a producer. So, with the changes, how did the movie hold up? Audiences saw that it was a big step backwards from the dark and complex Batman that Burton captured and reduced to a more kid friendly version. As for me&#x85;eeeyeah, it's corny and cheesy, but&#x85;on the other hand, there's some REALLY good things about it.So, what's the story? Batman, played by Val Kilmer, returns to fight crime in Gotham City once again. The mastermind this time is Two- Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Eventually, a man named Edward Nigma becomes the The Riddler, who teams up Two-Face to bring down the dark knight. Meanwhile, a young man's parents are murdered by Two-Face and seeks help from Batman to hunt down and kill Two-Face for retribution and he eventually becomes Robin. Meanwhile, there's a female criminal psychologist who wants to get in Bruce's head as well as his pants.Yeah, sounds like a lot going on, doesn't it? Well, on the other hand, I do give credit that this film really dives into the psychology of Batman and how much effect it's had on our tortured hero. I like the talk that Bruce gives to Dick about revenge being the wrong path and how messed up he'll be if he kills Two-Face. That's another fascinating thing about this movie. The psychology is more drawn out. The other two films left it to mystery, but this one makes it fully realized. That and it shows more about Bruce's past as if our hero's journey comes full circle of why who he is today. Also, Batman actually comes closer to defeat than the other previous movies! So yeah, I think that was really interesting.Buuut, yeah it does have the problems everyone's talking about. Like, yeah Two-Face being a Joker wannabe is stupid. The Riddler being played by Jim Carrey is exactly what you would expect. Batman having rubber nipples on the suit, yeah that was odd. The fact that there's no connection to the first two movies is REALLY distracting and the fact that Catwoman makes NO appearance, despite that sequel friendly ending from Returns. I also miss the Danny Elfman theme. And I think the biggest change overall is the atmosphere of Gotham City. In the first two movies, the setting was perfect. Gotham City was dark, gloomy and depressing like. Tim Burton was excellent at making settings like that. That's why it was perfect because Gotham is meant to be like that! Here, it's like Las Vegas, having neon lights everywhere and being colorful instead of being all 1940's style getup. Hell, even the gangsters are wearing glow in the dark war paint! &#x85;kay?So yeah, this review is kind of all over the place, but that's what I really thought of it. I guess you could say I have a soft spot for it. Yeah, it's unbelievably stupid at times, but the good stuff is REALLY good. The dark and slow moments kept me interested and I wanted to know more about it. While it's not as good as the previous two, I'd say give it a viewing and judge it for yourself.

The characters played by Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook jr. were all especially guilty of this, and the skill with which Bogart performed just made for an even sharper contrast between him and them.I also had a bit of a problem with the conclusion to the Maltese Falcon's discovery. Once Gutman had scraped the black paint off the statue to reveal it as lead instead of gold, he began to go on the supervilliany type of Now's the time where I reveal to the protagonist every last detail of my intricate plan! rant. This has got to be one of the laziest ways to wrap up an otherwise fairly interesting story in the cinematic world. After learning so much about the falcon and hearing how precious and valuable it was there had been a lot of build up leading to this moment. It's not like the reveal itself ruined the scene, but there aren't many ways to more efficiently deflate a plot than with a quick summary of the details and loose ends. The Maltese Falcon was easy to enjoy. It came across as the type of movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and invites the viewer to sit back and relax while they watch. This however, can certainly hold some aspects of the film back from greatness. Bogart was completely out of everyone's league, and the film showed all the familiar symptoms of a less than seamless novel adaptation, but what we're left with is still a lot of fun.

Almodóvar comedy starred by Spanish star cast plenty of likable humour and disconcerting plots . A film dubber woman called Pepa (Carmen Maura) is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when his lover named Ivan (Fernando Guillen) leaves her, and she tries to contact him to find out why he left her . In the opening scene Pepa (Carmen Maura) and Ivan (Fernando Guillen Cuervo) are dubbing to Spanish Johnny Guitar (1954). Pepa takes on Ivan's wife (Julieta Serrano) who is zealous because of his husband left her for her . Meanwhile , her clueless friend called Candela (María Barranco , though Victoria Abril turned down the role) appears in her flat . Candela who is as unsettling as she is afraid the police are looking for her because of her boyfriend seems to be a dangerous Islamic terrorist . There also meets Carlos (Antonio Banderas) , Ivan'son , and his girlfriend (Rossy De Palma) and amazing happenings take place . Pedro Almodóvar brings us a very mixed bag of outlandish characters , rapid dialogs , and absurd situations on a luxury flat . As a pregnant woman becomes involved into loving triangles , terrorists , revenger wives and faces the greatest danger, which we carry within ourselves . Enjoyable though silly film full of good taste , offbeat characters , embarrassing mood-pieces , fun scenes , sympathetic humor and sense of style but not totally satisfactory , including conventional as well as undiluted pitfalls . The picture deals with troubled people , off-the-wall comedy , absurdities , terrorism , jealousy and many other things . The movie is pretty well and turns out to be a superior comedy to Almodovar's previous and subsequent entries . The result is an amusing but sometimes absurd comedy ,including profanities , colorful frames and a crazy strings of plots . There are many references to Pedro Almodóvar's universe throughout the film . Pedro Almodóvar and Carmen Maura's personal relationship was seriously damaged during the shooting, which Maura even defined as a living hell. It took 18 years for them to work again . On Carmen Maura , Almodóvar told  ¨If you divide the stages of my career and labelled them with the names of the people I've worked with, there's definitely a stage in my filmmaking that would be called The Carmen Maura Years, and those films were all in the 80s - although I did work with her again on Volver (2006). At the time, I felt she was absolutely the best vehicle I could find to tell my stories. She was the actress who had the best intuition, to connect with what I wanted from her. She could be very funny and very dramatic at the same time, so it was the perfect combination for me¨ . Nice interpretations by all star-studded cast as Maria Barranco , Fernando Guillen , Rossy De Palma , Julieta Serrano and full of familiar faces as Chus Lampreave as a caretaker , Witness Jehová , and other delightfully played roles such as Kiti Mánver , Guillermo Montesinos as Cabman , Eduardo Calvo , Loles León , Joaquin Climent , Lambordero , Ana Leza , among others . And a Hollywood\/Spain super star  Antonio Banderas . In fact , this movie marks Antonio Banderas's 3th collaboration with Pedro Almodóvar , after Labyrinth of passions and Matador , subsequently they made  Atame , The skin I live in , I'm so excited , among others hits . As usual in most of Pedro Almodóvar's movies, there is a small role for Agustín Almodóvar, his brother and producer of the film, who plays a building employee . Atmospheric musical score by early deceased Bernardo Bonezzi , Almodovar's ordinary ; including known songs by Chavela Vargas . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine . The motion picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar ; he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines though here he directs a special comedy , including his ordinary touches . Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters and transsexuals and along his career getting some important international prizes . His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release . In 1987, he and his brother Agustín Almodóvar established their own production company  El Deseo, S. A.

A movie that kicked off a series of sequels and spin-offs and remakes of varying quality, and that has become one of the most famous slasher\/horror flicks ever made. When you think about it, Halloween is a very simple film. Michael Myers stalks and murders teenagers on Halloween after escaping from the high security facility that used to hold him. That's all there is too it, as the masked murderer goes on a spree in an otherwise very calm and silent town.What makes this seemingly simple slasher into such an uncomfortable horror movie is, for me anyway, mostly in the way it's been shot, combined with the music and sound effects used. With long, steady shots instead of the jump cut-like shots that seem to be so much more popular in more modern horror films. Sure enough, there are a couple jump scares where Myers will pop up right next to someone or appear behind a door, but the scary scenes are where you see his shadow appear briefly behind one of the future victims. Or when you finally spot him in a steady shot of the street. Most of the scenes are shot in a rather dark setting, often accompanied with an eerie ambient music that really helps set the mood.The acting is overall pretty good. The only actor I felt really did a particularly great job was the late Donald Pleasence in his portrayal of Dr. Sam Loomis, Myers' doctor for many years. This slightly unstable, desperate doctor's hunt for Myers, whom he firmly believes cannot possibly be human, really adds a whole lot to the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis' portrayal of the shy teenage girl Laurie Strode was at times a bit off, though she mostly really managed to pull it off.Absolutely an easy recommendation to anyone remotely interested in horror, with a warning that the sequels are, for the most part, not worth the watch.

Halloween's ending was left completely open, and the formula used was obviously working, and the slasher\/horror genre was definitely a crowd-pleaser, Friday the 13th, released the year before Halloween II, also drawing in large crowds, though with some more mixed reviews than Halloween.A higher body count and more gruesome deaths was expected, and the movie delivered on it. The most surprising (and pleasing, I might add) part for me was that the movie decided to pick up right where the original left off, instead of jumping ahead in time and coming up with some terrible excuse for Myers' return to haunt some completely new teenagers.No, instead this movie decided to take Myers, and build up his back story and character. While the plot in the original was limited to a madman who had been imprisoned for years going on a seemingly meaningless killing spree on teenagers, Halloween II gave out favorite murderer a reason for his killings. Not a very reasonable reason, but a reason nonetheless. It's revealed that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is Michael Myers' (Dick Warlock) biological sister. The seemingly random murders now seem more like Myers planning on finishing his job by killing his second sister.As was the case with Halloween, the sound track and the sound effects used in this one are absolutely amazing, and play a vital part in setting the mood for the viewers. The camera-work is still good, with long shots in dark settings, adding even more chill to the movie, as if it didn't already have enough.Pleasance is as great as ever in the role as Loomis, and though I'm seriously questioning Laurie's decision to hide instead of running from Myers, she repeats her performance from Halloween very well. The saddest thing for me is how 'The Thing' seems so much less intimidating compared to previously. On top of that, he's moved away from his precise, clean and simple killings, to more gruesome and bloody murders, which just seems to not fit the style. Sure enough, it becomes the new style for the future movies, but it certainly does take something away from the creepy aura that seemed to be emanating from Myers in the original flick.Halloween II has its flaws, there's no doubt about it, but it's still a great movie. As long as you don't go into it with your expectations too high (really shouldn't ever set your bar too high when it comes to sequels), you'll enjoy it. And I'll recommend it.

Sure enough, it becomes the new style for the future movies, but it certainly does take something away from the creepy aura that seemed to be emanating from Myers in the original flick.Halloween II has its flaws, there's no doubt about it, but it's still a great movie. As long as you don't go into it with your expectations too high (really shouldn't ever set your bar too high when it comes to sequels), you'll enjoy it. And I'll recommend it.

It shouldn't be considered part of the franchise, but it is. If you go into this not expecting anything other than a horror B-movie, then you might leave somewhat satisfied. I did, at least.Apart from the movie taking place during Halloween, there's nothing in common with the series. A mad Brit is trying to eradicate humanity by using parts of a stone from Stonehenge (that he somehow managed to steal), latex Halloween masks, and a TV commercial. By attaching a tag that carries parts of the stone to the masks, he can somehow trigger a reaction by airing an epilepsy-inducing TV commercial at a time he knows all the kids will be watching, which will... make the masks rot, and the kids turn into bugs and snakes, that in turn will kill the parents.It's the perfect plan. Except, Conal Cochran (that's the mad Brit), didn't take the nosy doctor Challis into account, who hears about this from a seemingly deranged old man that arrives at his hospital while the other doctor is unavailable. This Doctor Challis is divorced, and clearly suffering from it, spending most of his time at the bar, or flirting with younger women. The deranged man is murdered at the hospital, death by having his cranium torn apart by a robot disguised as a human (controlled by Cochran, of course), and I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the reason the doctor is interested in the entire thing is because the deranged man had a really cute daughter. For some reason, without actually discussing it or getting to know each other, the two decide to pose as man and wife to infiltrate the small town where Cochran's company, Silver Shamrock, and its factories are located.Pretty much the first thing they do once they get a room at a motel, is have sex. True, they only have two days to solve this before god knows what happens, but first, sex. Considering how there's no actual nudity, I don't see how there's any point to the two having a sexual relationship whatsoever. But hey, I'm not the movie maker around here.The most infuriating part is that the movie tries to avoid having to explain anything at all by having the lead bad guy say trade secrets.

His mother, Katherine (Lee Remick), had been offed by the (literal) nanny from hell, Mrs. Baylock (a remarkable performance from Billie Whitelaw), while his ambassador father Robert (played with classy gravitas by the great Gregory Peck) had been killed by the cops while in the act of attempting to slay his adopted Satan spawn with one of the Daggers of Megiddo. By the conclusion of the film's sequel, 1978's Damien Omen II, the guardians of 12-year-old Damien also lay dead Uncle Richard (William Holden) had been knifed by wife Ann (Lee Grant), while Ann herself had perished in a conflagration. Viewers would have to wait another three years to see what deviltry young Damien would be up to next, but were well repaid for their patience when part three of the trilogy, The Final Conflict, was released in March 1981. The film performed only 1\/3 as well at the box office as compared to the original Omen installment and does not seem to be highly regarded today, which surprises me. The picture certainly does up the ante of the previous two films, and while necessarily not as original or fresh in conception, more than makes up for that with some truly shocking developments.In the film, the viewer learns that Damien has graduated from both Yale and Oxford, is now in his early 30s and, as portrayed remarkably well by Sam Neill, is not only the supremely wealthy head of the Thorn business empire, but, in consequence of the Satanically induced suicide of the U.S. ambassador to Britain, is next in line for that august position as well. The film basically consists of two running, parallel plots. In the first, Father De Carlo (the great Italian actor Rossano Brazzi, giving the film's most likable performance), head of the San Benedetto monastery in Subiaco, Italy (which featured prominently in the original film), along with six select priests, each armed with one of the seven Daggers of Megiddo, go out into the world to slay the Antichrist. In the second, Damien searches throughout London to find the newly born Christ child, and to slay him before his own powers are greatly diminished. He is abetted by his personal assistant Harvey Dean (some nice work here by Don Gordon), whose own newly born son may or may not be the Christ child himself, while British investigative reporter Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow) interviews the new ambassador and learns a little too much about him. And so, a genuine conflict arises Can Damien kill the newborn Christ before the seven priests kill him?Unlike the previous two films, here, we have a Damien in full knowledge and acceptance of his Satanic lineage. For the first time, the Antichrist doesn't just slay the pesky meddlers surrounding him, but actively goes after Jesus Christ himself! THAT'S what I call upping the ante! As in the previous films, Damien's and his Pops' slayings make for memorable set pieces, and the deaths of the Subiaco priests are brought about most impressively (by fire, knifing, lightning, dog attack and so on). Surprisingly, however, these infernal homicides are not the film's most gripping scenes. Rather--at least, for this viewer--it is the pair of speeches that Damien makes that manages to impress the most. In the first, he addresses a Jesus crucifix with the most shockingly abusive language, calling Christianity a grubby, mundane creed, and declaring ...2,000 years have been enough...Nazarene charlatan, since the hour you vomited forth from a gaping wound of a woman you've done nothing but drown Man's soaring desires in a deluge of sanctimonious morality...I will drive deeper the thorns into your rancid carcass, you profaner of vices.... After which Damien Thorn, a genuine thorn in mankind's backside, does indeed drive the thorn crown on the Christ effigy deeper into Jesus' head, remarkably making the image cry bloody tears! It is a flabbergasting sequence, supremely well performed by Neill. And in his other great speech, Damien exhorts his heterogeneous minions to track down and slay the new Christ child with these words ...Slay the Nazarene, and you will know the violent raptures of my father's kingdom. Fail, and you will be condemned to a numbing eternity in the flaccid bosom of Christ. For the first time, thus, the viewer is witness to a genuinely evil Damien, one who is not only fully aware of his devilish ancestry, but reveling in it. The Final Conflict, besides showcasing some shocking violence and speechifying, is perhaps most startling in its willingness to feature infanticide as a subplot; indeed, by the film's end, no less than a dozen male infants have been exterminated throughout England in Damien's quest to eliminate the Christ child! Screenwriter Andrew Birkin's script certainly does not flinch from taking risks here, and he is ably complemented by some nice work from director Graham Barker and still another fine score from Jerry Goldsmith. Oh...and for all the gals out there who are attracted to so-called bad boys, in this film, they will get to see what a bout of lovemaking with the ultimate bad boy might be like. And for once, we have an Omen film that ends on a happy note--even Damien himself smiles as one of those blessed daggers plunges into his back! Damien may finally be vanquished here, but for those viewers who are interested in seeing what kind of mischief his demon daughter Delia is capable of spreading, there is always the TV sequel Omen IV The Awakening....

And in his other great speech, Damien exhorts his heterogeneous minions to track down and slay the new Christ child with these words ...Slay the Nazarene, and you will know the violent raptures of my father's kingdom. Fail, and you will be condemned to a numbing eternity in the flaccid bosom of Christ. For the first time, thus, the viewer is witness to a genuinely evil Damien, one who is not only fully aware of his devilish ancestry, but reveling in it. The Final Conflict, besides showcasing some shocking violence and speechifying, is perhaps most startling in its willingness to feature infanticide as a subplot; indeed, by the film's end, no less than a dozen male infants have been exterminated throughout England in Damien's quest to eliminate the Christ child! Screenwriter Andrew Birkin's script certainly does not flinch from taking risks here, and he is ably complemented by some nice work from director Graham Barker and still another fine score from Jerry Goldsmith. Oh...and for all the gals out there who are attracted to so-called bad boys, in this film, they will get to see what a bout of lovemaking with the ultimate bad boy might be like. And for once, we have an Omen film that ends on a happy note--even Damien himself smiles as one of those blessed daggers plunges into his back! Damien may finally be vanquished here, but for those viewers who are interested in seeing what kind of mischief his demon daughter Delia is capable of spreading, there is always the TV sequel Omen IV The Awakening.... ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"14 October 2014","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" By the end of the 1976 megahit The Omen--one of the most successful films of that year, returning $60 million in domestic box office receipts on its $3 million budget--the foster parents of 5-year-old Damien Thorn both lay dead...as well as most of the personages who had had anything to do with the kindergarten-age Antichrist. His mother, Katherine (Lee Remick), had been offed by the (literal) nanny from hell, Mrs. Baylock (a remarkable performance from Billie Whitelaw), while his ambassador father Robert (played with classy gravitas by the great Gregory Peck) had been killed by the cops while in the act of attempting to slay his adopted Satan spawn with one of the Daggers of Megiddo. By the conclusion of the film's sequel, 1978's Damien Omen II, the guardians of 12-year-old Damien also lay dead Uncle Richard (William Holden) had been knifed by wife Ann (Lee Grant), while Ann herself had perished in a conflagration. Viewers would have to wait another three years to see what deviltry young Damien would be up to next, but were well repaid for their patience when part three of the trilogy, The Final Conflict, was released in March 1981. The film performed only 1\/3 as well at the box office as compared to the original Omen installment and does not seem to be highly regarded today, which surprises me. The picture certainly does up the ante of the previous two films, and while necessarily not as original or fresh in conception, more than makes up for that with some truly shocking developments.In the film, the viewer learns that Damien has graduated from both Yale and Oxford, is now in his early 30s and, as portrayed remarkably well by Sam Neill, is not only the supremely wealthy head of the Thorn business empire, but, in consequence of the Satanically induced suicide of the U.S. ambassador to Britain, is next in line for that august position as well. The film basically consists of two running, parallel plots. In the first, Father De Carlo (the great Italian actor Rossano Brazzi, giving the film's most likable performance), head of the San Benedetto monastery in Subiaco, Italy (which featured prominently in the original film), along with six select priests, each armed with one of the seven Daggers of Megiddo, go out into the world to slay the Antichrist. In the second, Damien searches throughout London to find the newly born Christ child, and to slay him before his own powers are greatly diminished. He is abetted by his personal assistant Harvey Dean (some nice work here by Don Gordon), whose own newly born son may or may not be the Christ child himself, while British investigative reporter Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow) interviews the new ambassador and learns a little too much about him. And so, a genuine conflict arises Can Damien kill the newborn Christ before the seven priests kill him?Unlike the previous two films, here, we have a Damien in full knowledge and acceptance of his Satanic lineage. For the first time, the Antichrist doesn't just slay the pesky meddlers surrounding him, but actively goes after Jesus Christ himself! THAT'S what I call upping the ante! As in the previous films, Damien's and his Pops' slayings make for memorable set pieces, and the deaths of the Subiaco priests are brought about most impressively (by fire, knifing, lightning, dog attack and so on). Surprisingly, however, these infernal homicides are not the film's most gripping scenes. Rather--at least, for this viewer--it is the pair of speeches that Damien makes that manages to impress the most. In the first, he addresses a Jesus crucifix with the most shockingly abusive language, calling Christianity a grubby, mundane creed, and declaring ...2,000 years have been enough...Nazarene charlatan, since the hour you vomited forth from a gaping wound of a woman you've done nothing but drown Man's soaring desires in a deluge of sanctimonious morality...I will drive deeper the thorns into your rancid carcass, you profaner of vices.... After which Damien Thorn, a genuine thorn in mankind's backside, does indeed drive the thorn crown on the Christ effigy deeper into Jesus' head, remarkably making the image cry bloody tears! It is a flabbergasting sequence, supremely well performed by Neill. And in his other great speech, Damien exhorts his heterogeneous minions to track down and slay the new Christ child with these words ...Slay the Nazarene, and you will know the violent raptures of my father's kingdom.

This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit splattery but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.

Her mom is always moving her two girls from town to town, so both Charlotte and her little sister Kate have trouble making friends. Charlotte is like any other girl her age, but there's one exception... she is obsessed with the Catholic religion and while other girls are thinking of The Beatles, Charlotte dreams of one day being a nun.One day Charlotte meets a boy and her mom meets a man, who happens to work at the local school. As events such as the J.F.K. assassination and kissing her new boyfriend Joe come up, Charlotte's life gradually stops making sense, until a horrible accident makes her family stop and think.This movie is GREAT, I've loved it since grade 5. The acting is amazing with actresses Cher (Silkwood and The Mask), Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands), and Christina Ricci (The Addam's Family Weird is Relative and Casper). The soundtrack is excellent and suits the date in question (takes place in 1963), and the plot is a fictional memoir of one of the most original characters you'll ever see.
