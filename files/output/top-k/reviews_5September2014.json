This leads to a series of events in which Quasimoto learns the true nature of his isolation and of his humanity. He is never a forbidding character as Lon Chaney was. We are invited to like his tender personality. Whatever some Disney films lack they rarely ever fall short at giving us a great menacing villain. Here he is Judge Claude Frollo a stern, cold authority figure more concerned with the letter of the law than with justice. His baritone voice is provided by Tony Jaye with a cold, pitiless detachment. This is one of the few Disney villains that is true to his character. He comes with no catchphrases and no joy of his hatred.We are taken in 'Hunchback' to some of the most breathtaking locations that I have ever seen in an animated film. The Festival of Fools is a kaleidoscope of color and whimsy. The Cathedral has a gloomy forbidding Gothic interior of dark shadows and glowering statues. There are breathtaking moments in this film especially in the opening as the camera crawls upwards into the rafters of the bell tower. This is proof of the freedom of animation. This would have cost a fortune in a live action movie but animation gives them the freedom to move effortlessly through the streets of Paris, up into the bell tower and down into the catacombs of the solemn Court of Miracles.The animation here is so fluid and beautiful.

I'm probably going to be in the minority on this but I personally think this is another under the radar gem. This film believe it or not was one of the first parody films I've seen and it was also the first film with Lesile Nelson I've seen before the Naked Gun films.This to me is one of those parodies done right because it really feels like it's doing it's own thing which is what a good working parody should do. And yeah sure it's not on the same level as the Naked Gun films (first and second to be precise) or any other A level parody film out there but it's not trying to be, it's just trying to be plain fun.This film is an obvious jab to The Exercist and I think it's a very solid hit that leaves a mark. Not much I can really say about this film, I really like some of the physical sight gags which really made me chuckle like one really suttle one was seeing a bible vending machine which I don't think is too far off with the vending machines we have now where some sell random jewelry and romance novels. But of course there was that rocky like montage sequence, where we see Mayii train and gear up for the exorcism which I thought was funny and cool since I'm a fan of the Rocky films and I even like the lunch box that Mayii brings, I'll give you a hint it's another Stalone action film. That's one of the best things about the film it kinda homages Stalone's films a lot, the writer must've been a Stalone fan.Even some of the verbal gags are funny like the jabs on PMS, you got to admit whenever the female populace goes though it, they do act like their possessed. Or my favorite line Freeze puke face! The characters are really solid and a lot of fun. I really like subordinate villain Ernest Weller played by Ned Beatty whom is pretty much just a sleaze con artist that is cheating viewers out of their money with his church program and of course the devil possession situation is just another opportunity for money and ratings. It's obviously a parody on some of the TV church scams that were going on .But of course the main villain the Devil is the spotlight villain, played well by Linda Blair which is ironic since she was in The Exercist. What really makes this version stand out for me is the scheme The Devil has which is to influence and create more followers by using the power of media. That's another thing the film does is it parodies on the issue of media manipulation.And the protagonists are also great. Anthony Stark as Father Luke is funny because he's good natured and always means to help but is always insecure, he's got some good lines.But the highlight of course of the whole film is Lesile Nielsen whom plays Father Mayii. I like his last name which is obviously two words run together. Not much to say for his character, Lesile as usual plays it straight as a good natured priest whom has became retired and reluctant due to the post trauma he's suffered from the last exorcism he's done. Which of course all the more wants you to win, hoping he'll find the courage and strength again. But other than that his character is hilarious he's got some great lines even some sight gags as well. Like seeing him watch a telethon of Weller's crooked Chirch program and he is expressing constant distaste and wearing a bunch of random masks to numb the pain of the program; though Mayii could've just turned to another channel but I guess nothing else was on and he didn't have cable.The exorcism which to me is the real highlight of this film. It was just hilarious just seeing Luke and Mayii just do their jobs while the Devil was just giving them more and more grief. Let alone seeing a cameo by Jesse Ventura and Gene do a wrestling cometary on the exorcism which really added to the humor more because I was a bit of a fan of the WWF at the time (the 80's and early 90's when WWF was actually still good).What all three of them go though in the exorcism is just really random and crazy almost like one big skit show. I won't give away too much two of my favorite moments were seeing the Devil just turn both Mayii into just random things and Luke is going along with it. Or even the Devil with a Blue Dress number which I thought was a lot of fun since I like that song.The only bad things about the film for me are that I do thing the middle of the film is just a bit on the slow side, but of course things pick back up around the third and final half so I can't complain too much. And of course some of the visual jokes as well as a few sight gags are kinda lame but same could be said for a lot of other comedies out there and there are more than enough hits to keep you satisfied.If your a fan of the parody subgenere as well as Lesile Neilson then I recommend giving this film a try, it's devilish fun.Rating 3 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"5 September 2014","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm a fan of the parody subgenre and of course the horror genre, mixing both of them together really can make a beautiful combination.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 September 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Do you want a leg or a breast?Squeezed in the middle of Hitchcock's filmography, To Catch a Thief, is many times forgotten since it came out the year after Rear Window. Hitchcock also had greater success with his later films, Psycho, The Birds, North by Northwest, and Vertigo so this film is easily discarded when we compare it to his other works. It is a shame because To Catch a Thief has many great things going for it which we now take for granted. For instance the love story mixed right in the middle of the mystery is captivating. Perhaps for modern audiences the mystery involving this copycat thief, known as the cat, may be way to easy to solve, but the heart of the story lies in the fantastic chemistry between Cary Grant's John Robie and Grace Kelly's Frances Stevens. The sparks fly between these two characters and their intense chemistry on screen is rarely equaled in modern films. This was my first Cary Grant film and only the second time I'v seen Grace Kelly on screen so perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. I was pleasantly surprised with this film and despite it not being at the same level of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces it is a really enjoyable movie. The cinematography here is gorgeous and perhaps one of the best coming from Hitchcock. Deciding to film this on location in the French Riviera was the best idea Hitchcock had and it really payed off. His cameo at the beginning of the movie just might be my favorite of his as well. There is also a spectacular car chase scene that is the highlight of the film. My only complaint lies in the fact that the resolution wasn't as strong as the opening and mid section of this film, but the pacing was well established and I enjoyed it. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were magnificent on screen together and I look forward to seeing more of their classic work in the future. The gorgeous scenery and the romance went perfect together in this charming film from Hitchcock. Grant and Kelly shared an incredible chemistry together and their witty remarks also added some comedy to the mix. The film might not be as artistic as some of his greater work, but this light weight romantic thriller shouldn't be disregarded when we consider Hitchcock's films because it showed his versatility as a director and his capability of directing less serious films and making them better than the actual material really was. It's an enjoyable film and it accomplishes its purpose of entertaining the audience as it takes us through the gorgeous Riviera of France and introduces us to these beautiful beaches and mansions. Some of Hitchcock's better known films could have benefited from the two strong leads in To Catch a Thief because for a light film they really got the job done. It may be a forgettable film coming from Hitchcock but it is far more entertaining than most of the light movies we are exposed to in the theaters today. Despite not having heard great things about this film, I'm glad I had the pleasure to watch this and see the sparks fly between Grant and Kelly.

The Emperor Worm (an amazing puppet) is fascinating, but it is barely seen in the original short 138 min. version. The special effects look very crude, except for the fighting shield. The expensive sets look really bad. As presented, it's an Allegory for everything from evil, corrupt governments, to drug dependence, to the Coming of the Savior. It's PG-13 rating is due to violence and gore. The Mysticism hard to understand. Maybe more under-dressed maidens would have helped, as much as I hate to admit it. Sure, it has a rousing climax, but, overall, it's too little too late to save the picture. By this time, nobody really cares when it finally rains on Dune! They just want to leave the room!

Likewise, it is equally fair to ask if there would have been bogeymen like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhes without Leatherface. I doubt it. Now, although this specific movie wasn't the first slasher film ever produced it certainly did its share toward setting the foundation for the sub-genre that so many horror fans have come to know and love. Part of the reason for this is that viewers during this particular time-period weren't accustomed to seeing so much raw violence on the movie screen. And that's pretty much all that this movie has to offer as there is little character development, suspense or even gore for that matter. Additionally, the acting and the script were all pretty basic as well. But give the devil his due, the director (Tobe Hooper) used quite a bit of imagination and what few resources he had he used to the maximum extent. And that's quite commendable considering that these days so many directors with a limited budget lack the talent to produce anything other than something so bad it's good.

While the script directly follows the events of the first film (and there are multiple nods to the original throughout), Fright Night Part II has a totally different feel to it; where the first film was rooted in the terror comes to a small town kind of plot structure, Part II is a bit more expansive, and the grandiose historical apartment building lends it a notably Gothic feel.With a well-established backstory provided by the first film, Part II pulls no punches and makes no bones about itself, giving fans exactly what they're expecting, and in a good way. The special effects here are on par with those of the first film, and perhaps even gorier at times. The bulk of the film takes place on a college campus (UCLA, to be exact) and in a huge Gothic apartment building, so the settings here give room for lots of fun to be had.

Atmospherically and tonally, it's remarkably different, with the first film's two central characters anchoring the proceedings.

The casting feels largely quite awkward with Patrick Wayne as a bland lead (I even thought so as a child) and Jane Seymour as a nearly as bland love interest only redeemed somewhat by her beauty and unrelentingly revealing clothing. Margaret Whiting makes for a colorful yet very campy villain and the always reliable Patrick Troughton is undermined largely by having to play a very inconsistent character. Everyone else in the cast is instantly forgettable.One of the single weakest and most awkward key scenes in the film is where Sinbad and his crew try to convince Troughton (as a Greek Philosopher Melanthius) to come with them. Instead of any of them really saying or doing anything to change his mind, he seems to convince himself by tinkering with an old invention that never plays into anything later in the film at all. This really isn't a Sinbad movie; it's a Melanthius movie. Sinbad just plays his chauffeur and bodyguard. Another major script failing is the inconsistent level of knowledge given to Melanthius - he seems at first to guide the group based only on vague legends and intuition, but the further along they go, the more he seems to just know everything about everything.But who comes to Harryhausen movies expecting the best in storytelling and great performances? They come for the stop-motion creatures and fights, which here is done quite well and plentifully. One of the more impressive (though narratively pointless) sequences is a battle with a giant walrus containing some excellent blending of practical and visual effects (how did they get those real snowballs to connect with the stop- motion creature?). A fascinating vaguely antagonistic robotic minotaur rows its way through the movie, but is criminally underused before he gets to do anything cool. The other creatures such as a giant bee, a baboon, and a troglodyte, though well done and realistic, are just not nearly as interesting and feel like a waste of time that could have gone into animating cooler things. Oh yeah, there's also a very satisfying (though poorly set up) battle with a saber-tooth cat near the end.Unfortunately the visual effects department got so carried away and relied so much on budget-friendly models and compositing in lieu of actual sets and locations that it's difficult to really buy into anything. Much of the blue-screening is quite distracting and terrible even by the standards of the time it was made. Just look at the whole scene at Petra and it's quite obvious that most of the actual cast didn't make it there opting instead to just shoot their close-ups in a studio. It fuels the film's quite bizarre tone which helps in some scenes and hurts others. The inconsistency and weirdness isn't helped by the TV-like direction of established actor Sam Wanamaker. His slow and campy style contrasts so sharply with the serious and exciting monster scenes that it starts to feel like there's two different movies here. However there's so much apparent apathy and laziness on display across all departments involved that I can't put all the blame on him. SINBAD EYE OF THE TIGER in many ways though holds up as a fun fantasy movie which children and nostalgic adults will love, but unlike most of its peers from the day just doesn't hold up.

The other creatures such as a giant bee, a baboon, and a troglodyte, though well done and realistic, are just not nearly as interesting and feel like a waste of time that could have gone into animating cooler things.

The casting feels largely quite awkward with Patrick Wayne as a bland lead (I even thought so as a child) and Jane Seymour as a nearly as bland love interest only redeemed somewhat by her beauty and unrelentingly revealing clothing. Margaret Whiting makes for a colorful yet very campy villain and the always reliable Patrick Troughton is undermined largely by having to play a very inconsistent character. Everyone else in the cast is instantly forgettable.One of the single weakest and most awkward key scenes in the film is where Sinbad and his crew try to convince Troughton (as a Greek Philosopher Melanthius) to come with them. Instead of any of them really saying or doing anything to change his mind, he seems to convince himself by tinkering with an old invention that never plays into anything later in the film at all. This really isn't a Sinbad movie; it's a Melanthius movie. Sinbad just plays his chauffeur and bodyguard. Another major script failing is the inconsistent level of knowledge given to Melanthius - he seems at first to guide the group based only on vague legends and intuition, but the further along they go, the more he seems to just know everything about everything.But who comes to Harryhausen movies expecting the best in storytelling and great performances? They come for the stop-motion creatures and fights, which here is done quite well and plentifully.

Well this is one of the strangest and most amazing films I've ever seen. And it's a hell of a lot better than Titanic. I'm confused as to exactly what I just watched, but I really enjoyed it. The cinematography is superb, there are beautiful sequences like Costner teaching the kid how to swim. But then on the other hand you have Costner throwing the kid into the ocean, collapsing a heavy sail on top of a woman, and almost pimping her and the kid out to some guy. When both women challenge his authority he cuts their hair short. I can't tell if this film was taking itself seriously, or being completely tongue-in-cheek; maybe both. Then to make things more confusing, you have Dennis Hopper, as Deacon, leader of the smokers, some kind of cult that's after dry land. His performance is absolutely hilarious. It does look like *beep* he says when someone puts some kind of eyeball in his eye socket after his eye was blown out. Dry land is not our destination, it is our destiny is another great one. There are a million others. Well I'll be damned, the gentleman puppy. He's like at turd that won't flush. I don't know, you have to see it to believe it. The little girl Enola (alone backwards) is some kind of chosen one who draw pictures of things from dry land when dry land wasn't underwater. Still with me? She has map to dry land tattooed on her for some reason and the smokers are after the map so they can find dry land, so Helen, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Costner's Mariner (a half human half fish thing) have to protect her from the smokers after they raid and destroy the sea-town. In one of the film's funniest moment, Enola antagonizes Deacon and he backhands her. That kid takes a lot of abuse in this film. Well what can I say, it's a must-see. As a fantasy film, it definitely holds up; hugely entertaining. The weird ships and contraptions are outlandish enough, and the photography good enough to make the film visually very pleasing.

Luckily for us, it's been reported someday that Leone's children and the movies composer Ennio Morricone, will collect all four and a half hours and have a definitive cut soon underway. Onto the review.In essence, I find the story one I think all of us know somewhere deep in the back of our brain (which gives a weight to the proposed Opium dream theory). Kids growing up as best of friends get themselves involved in organised crime, and now all is left is to wait for the inevitable crash. It would be incredibly rude of me to sum up the movie as just that, because for those people who have watched the film know that the performances and friendship between Robert De Niro and James Woods's character is remarkable. The visual look of the ghetto's are grand, rustic and BIG on scale. The camera is shot so well you'd swear you were looking from the eyes of the children.As well as looking extremely authentic, we are told a very well plotted narrative that spans into each friends 60+ years of living. We begin with an old David Noodles Aaronson (Robert De Niro), smoking in a Chinese opium den as he reflects on his lifetime as a child and a young adult. So far we have seen that he is on the run in the present time, then almost immediately we jump to Noodles's early years making what he can of the depression and meeting a young Max (James Woods). As we meet the gang at a young age (Fantastic performances from these child actors), good times and tragedy are always frequent. Years later, Noodles and Max eventually meet again and my how times have changed.Again, what I've just wrote in the last couple of paragraphs, doesn't even begin to go deep enough to explain what happens in the first act. I really do not wish to tell you what happens, because there is virtually no way to explain the grand scope of this film. It hardly feels like a movie but more of an experience, one of which would feel criminal if I told you anymore about it. But as I will constantly say, the casting and acting is fantastic. The camera work by Leone as always is flawless, and the score for this movie is so big on scale I swear it could rival Nino Rota's score for The Godfather (1972). Final Verdict The greatest gangster movie ever made. When people talk about Leone's work such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966), they always refer to how strong the characters are. Please believe me when I say that these characters are some of the most strongest archetypes I have ever seen, and this film is Sergio Leone's Masterpiece.

So far we have seen that he is on the run in the present time, then almost immediately we jump to Noodles's early years making what he can of the depression and meeting a young Max (James Woods). As we meet the gang at a young age (Fantastic performances from these child actors), good times and tragedy are always frequent. Years later, Noodles and Max eventually meet again and my how times have changed.Again, what I've just wrote in the last couple of paragraphs, doesn't even begin to go deep enough to explain what happens in the first act. I really do not wish to tell you what happens, because there is virtually no way to explain the grand scope of this film. It hardly feels like a movie but more of an experience, one of which would feel criminal if I told you anymore about it. But as I will constantly say, the casting and acting is fantastic. The camera work by Leone as always is flawless, and the score for this movie is so big on scale I swear it could rival Nino Rota's score for The Godfather (1972). Final Verdict The greatest gangster movie ever made. When people talk about Leone's work such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966), they always refer to how strong the characters are. Please believe me when I say that these characters are some of the most strongest archetypes I have ever seen, and this film is Sergio Leone's Masterpiece. In the words of Roger Ebert, An epic poem of violence and greed. Need we say more? 10\/10.

So like good Americans, they didn't just bitch and complain, they made their own movie and told the story their way, the result being RIO BRAVO, and the big winners were us movie buffs and western fanatics.The plot of RIO BRAVO is simplicity itself Sheriff John T. Chance locks up brutal outlaw Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge and awaits the arrival of the Marshall in a few days. Nathan Burdette (John Russell), Joe' wealthy rancher brother, hires a gang of killers with the intention of freeing his brother, at the same time making sure the good citizens of Rio Bravo get the message that if they try to come to Chance's aid, it won't be pretty. Wayne's John T. Chance is a true professional, who does not bemoan his fate or beg for help, he stands for the rule of law and won't be intimidated, going about his job calmly and without without any outward fear. But the script (co-authored by Leigh Brackett) makes it very clear that as good as John T Chance. is, he does need help in this tight spot and gets from a most unlikely group Walter Brennan's crippled old deputy, Stumpy; Ricky Nelson's young gunfighter, Colorado; Angie Dickinson's dance hall girl, Feathers; Pedro Gonzales Gonzales's hotel operator, Carlos; and most significantly, from Chance's alcoholic deputy, Dude, played by Dean Martin in what is surely his finest hour. This typical rag tag band of misfits come together for a common good, and prevail over the villains by being loyal to each other and exhibiting competence in a crisis, thus earning the respect of Chance and the esteem of the others. Courage is defined not as the absence of fear, but as the willingness to confront danger in spite of it. All of these are some of Hawks's favorite themes, thus making RIO BRAVO intensely personal while at the same time, deliberately commercial. There are great touches of humor and lots of great dialog, while each scene appears to be laid out with great care, especially the famous wordless opening in a saloon; the positioning of the actors, the laying out of the sets (mostly the dusty streets, the town's hotel and the jail) appear to have been done with an eye that knew how to tell a story visually. Few reviewers note how well the night time scenes are done.John T. Chance is probably the finest realization of a John Wayne hero in any film, a compliment from Chance is the highest honor a man could receive, and I think Wayne smiles more in this movie than any other, often at the antics of Brennan, in the kind of role he played better than any other. Martin's performance as Dude, a role originally offered to Montgomery Clift (who worked with Wayne, Brennan, and Hawks in RED RIVER), is a revelation; nothing much tops the scene where he pours the whiskey back in the bottle when the band starts to play the cutthroat song, which Santa Anna used in an attempt to frighten the defenders of the Alamo. Angie Dickinson's Feathers (with her stunning legs on display) has to give the sexiest performance of any of Wayne's leading ladies, we even get inside her bedroom, a rarity for westerns at the time. Many think Ricky Nelson was out of his depth in this movie and was cast only for box office appeal, but I think he more than holds his own. RIO BRAVO is the last pairing of old pals and frequent co-stars Wayne and Ward Bond.At two and a half hours, RIO BRAVO moves along very leisurely by modern standards; maybe Hawks should have copied HIGH NOON's tight pacing.In the end, I think HIGH NOON told us much about contemporary America and the degradation and corruption of civilization; while in RIO BRAVO, Wayne and Hawks give us the heroic myth of the Old West at its finest. Both films are equally valid in what they say and are enduring classics in their own right. Want to see how relevant RIO BRAVO is, go see GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.
