This is a great deal of discovery in MISSION TO MARS, but first, you must (try) to overcome a great boredom. The film does, however, have one really good scene, which features the main essence of the entire venture, to show us life on Mars, but first you must get past a lot of special-effects demonstrations and a lot of padding. MISSION TO MARS would have been a better film if it shows us the magic it promises, rather than spend most of the time preparing us for it.The film opens with a small celebration. The first man-manned mission to Mars is about to be launched by NASA, led by Luke Graham (Don Cheadle). Cheadle's friends Jim Connell (Gary Sinise) and Woody Blake (Tim Robbins), who we know will be the heroes of the film later on, give him some friendly insights before he takes on interplanetary voyage. This, then, gives us more time to either moan or fall a sleep. There's no problem with these kind of things in movies, as long as it doesn't chew up the scenery.Afterwards, we follow Graham's beleaguered voyage to Mars, where they are threatened by its harsh landscape. This results in some good effects work, too bad it only runs for a few minutes. then, it goes back to the extremely boring parts, describing a rescue attempt, led by Sinise and Robbins, by NASA to the Red Planet. This, at least, could have resulted to, at least, a little bit of excitement. But they just miss this chance, in favor of one long trek instead.The film is directed by Brian DePalma. I'm talking about THE Brian DePalma. You know? The director of THE UNTOUCHABLES, SCARFACE and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. hard to believe, but you must, for it's the truth. We all know DePalma can do better, we all agree on that. In his other films, he benefits from the acting, story, large-scaled visuals and inspired moments. Here, he only benefits from the effects, which were hardly recognized due to their little amount of screen time.The final moments of the film, the only thing very well-visioned about the entire feature, are pretty good. A sense of discovery is painted all over it. But, like the other good sequence, it only runs for a few minutes, then, credits roll. It's over, done, the viewer steps out of the theater or from their couch, wasted and bares the feeling of being tricked. A voyage in space has always interested us viewers. Ever since space operas like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY and STAR WARS hit the screen, we've been longing to go back to the stars, but fail to get there. Not since the STAR WARS sequels, we never had another adventure in space after wards, or at least a good one. RED PLANET, released just about the same time as MISSION TO MARS, wasn't exactly rocket science. MISSION TO MARS manages to be more cerebral than RED PLANET, but this time, it lacks the action or suspense. It tries to be more like 2001, but that film had awe all over it, MISSION TO MARS just bores you with the visuals.Thankfully, I managed to be awake all through the film. Sci-fi fans who fancy this kind of things, and intents to be loyal to MISSION TO MARS, may want to give it a try. But anyone who likes to enjoy a good summer movie or a film that leaves the earth's atmosphere may not probably live thru the film, not without having their eye blink or even fall asleep.

She livens up every scene she's in and when she's not on the screen you miss her terribly. The role she plays could not fit her any more perfectly and Monroe takes that role and runs with it, making this movie her own. Co-star Tom Ewell plays off her wonderfully, but when Marilyn's not around you get the sense Ewell misses her just as much as the audience does. There are times when Ewell is left to his own devices where the movie does tend to drag. But eventually Monroe will pop up and inject some much-needed life back into the film. All in all, the movie is an enjoyable ride and a worthy showcase for one of the biggest stars Hollywood has ever produced.A sex farce produced in a time when you couldn't really make a sex farce, The Seven Year Itch pushed the boundaries of its time. By today's standards the film may seem quaint, sweet and innocent...a sex farce without the sex. But for 1955 the film was almost revolutionary. The plot's very basic. Ewell plays Richard Sherman, a Manhattanite whose wife and young son have gone away on vacation for the summer. Sherman is left at home for what should be an uneventful few months but then temptation in the form of Monroe moves into the apartment upstairs. We only ever know Monroe's character as The Girl but this is no ordinary girl. Before long poor Richard's libido and very active imagination get the better of him and he spends every waking moment fantasizing about The Girl. We'd seen earlier in the film that, at least in his own mind, Richard is quite the lady-killer, with women constantly throwing themselves at him while he, the happily married man, resists. Now it is he who is on the prowl. Well, at least as much on the prowl as a married man could be in a film made in 1955. His pursuit of The Girl leads to some rather awkward, amusing situations and Ewell and Monroe have great chemistry and wonderful comic timing. It's a shame Ewell is left alone so much in the film because things are not nearly as interesting when he's talking to himself, trying to either talk himself into or out of having this affair. When Ewell and Monroe are together...that's when this movie shines. And there are enough of those moments to make the whole enterprise work. In truth, there's not much of a plot, some of the jokes fall flat and the film does drag at times. But this movie has something truly special which allows it to rise above its flaws.

Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is a real and extremely debilitating illness that causes the sufferers to react to even the smallest exposures to perfumes, pesticides, car fumes and many other chemicals found in modern life. I watched the movie with an intimate knowledge of the condition and direct experience of the isolation, pain and suffering is causes.Overall the movie did present many of the key components of the condition such as the confusion that Carol felt when she first started feeling unwell, the reactions that gradually got worse with repeated exposures, the misunderstanding and intolerance of family, friends and medical community; and the need to find a safe haven. However, I realized that whilst the symptoms and problems associated were quite clear to me, they would have probably been almost completely lost on some viewers (especially in the first thirty minutes of the film which was slow going).That said, Safe is the only movie I know that does address MCS and was obviously well researched as the details in the movie were very close to the mark right down to the fact that people were using reading boxes at the retreat.I found that the emotional side of the characters were brushed over and not really accurately portrayed. The emotions were represented in a cold way and while this might have been the intension of the director, I feel that the movie could have had much more impact than it otherwise did. The isolation, the physical pain and the confusion that MCS causes the sufferer and the family is much more dramatic than what is portrayed.In summary, the movie is quite accurate in the detail and it was easy for me to identify with the many different circumstances presented.

Is it because of the explicit sex (far more fleeting than that shown in any porno tape freely available at most corner video shops), the stylized ultra-violence or the combination of the two ? Unlike some films, this one doesn't in any way glorify violence though, it merely shows the sad inevitability of it as far as its two main characters are concerned.Both Nadine (Karen Lancaume aka Karen Bach) and Manu (Raffaella Anderson) routinely endure violation both in word and deed on an almost daily basis as sex workers, prostitute and part-time porno performer respectively. The gang rape of Manu and her drug-addicted friend shown here is totally different from the clichéd they-may-protest-at-first type of rape scene encountered in some adults only features. While the other girl cries and screams throughout (and is ever more horribly abused because of it), Manu adopts a facade of indifferent resignation, cleverly robbing her rapists of their sadistic thrill. Rest assured that the scene goes on a lot longer than anyone would want it to and that it is very painful to watch, which is the whole point of it. When Manu and Nadine meet and embark on their violent road trip, fully aware that they ultimately can't 'get away with it', sex becomes a source of liberation to them. Like so many guys on the lam in any criminal buddy movie you can think of, they take what they want, when and how they want it, casually discarding (not always violently) their casual partners post-orgasm. One of the most common accusations at porn's address is that the explicit sex scenes dehumanize the people performing them, but here that could not be further from the truth.Former hardcore actresses Lancaume and Anderson are both terrific in their parts and the sex they have (and, yes, it is 'real' sex) enhances their characterizations, rendering them more complete. The 'cinema vérité' rawness of the digital video format in which it was shot, interrupted by sudden flashes of style when violence erupts (an artistic decision to give the viewer a feel for the power and pleasure the women derive from their acts as an escape route from their drab lives), draws the viewer uncomfortably close to the action. Again, that seems to be the point. So don't let the negative publicity fool you. BAISE-MOI is a rare film that utterly achieves what it sets out to do and it bodes well for debut cinéastes Despentes (author of the sulfurous source novel) and ex-porn star Coralie. You may love it (as I obviously did) or you may hate it, but this is an important film that no one is likely to ever forget, no matter how hard they might try.

Unlike some films, this one doesn't in any way glorify violence though, it merely shows the sad inevitability of it as far as its two main characters are concerned.Both Nadine (Karen Lancaume aka Karen Bach) and Manu (Raffaella Anderson) routinely endure violation both in word and deed on an almost daily basis as sex workers, prostitute and part-time porno performer respectively. The gang rape of Manu and her drug-addicted friend shown here is totally different from the clichéd they-may-protest-at-first type of rape scene encountered in some adults only features. While the other girl cries and screams throughout (and is ever more horribly abused because of it), Manu adopts a facade of indifferent resignation, cleverly robbing her rapists of their sadistic thrill. Rest assured that the scene goes on a lot longer than anyone would want it to and that it is very painful to watch, which is the whole point of it. When Manu and Nadine meet and embark on their violent road trip, fully aware that they ultimately can't 'get away with it', sex becomes a source of liberation to them. Like so many guys on the lam in any criminal buddy movie you can think of, they take what they want, when and how they want it, casually discarding (not always violently) their casual partners post-orgasm. One of the most common accusations at porn's address is that the explicit sex scenes dehumanize the people performing them, but here that could not be further from the truth.Former hardcore actresses Lancaume and Anderson are both terrific in their parts and the sex they have (and, yes, it is 'real' sex) enhances their characterizations, rendering them more complete. The 'cinema vérité' rawness of the digital video format in which it was shot, interrupted by sudden flashes of style when violence erupts (an artistic decision to give the viewer a feel for the power and pleasure the women derive from their acts as an escape route from their drab lives), draws the viewer uncomfortably close to the action. Again, that seems to be the point. So don't let the negative publicity fool you. BAISE-MOI is a rare film that utterly achieves what it sets out to do and it bodes well for debut cinéastes Despentes (author of the sulfurous source novel) and ex-porn star Coralie.

Surprised that Mexican TV would actually show this kind of film, and fascinated by the subject matter, I tried to acquire it here - with no success - and indeed only can it be found in the USA on a fairly expensive DVD which I just received and viewed this very day ! My sentiments on the film are mixed - I have never been anywhere near Canada in my life - but the sets do appear to be dreary cold and dismal. Picture quality is not that brilliant and unfortunately the DVD has no subtitles, a bit of a problem when much of the dialogue, especially in part 2 is unintelligible. I am referring notably to the two brothers who have grown up, and Czerny's wife. She didn't even appear to be speaking English and sounded like an East European. The DVD unfortunately does not contain any bonus or extras and I would have appreciated a documentary explaining the basis for making the film, as was the case with the magdalen sisters.On to the actors' performance and may I say that the whole of part one and the last 15 to 20 minutes of part two were brilliant and throat-gripping. The rest of part two I found rather more boring and slow and felt that the interviews with the psychiatrist could have been reduced in length. True, they give us some insight into Lavin's character but I found them too long. Secondly, the episode of one of the boys taking drugs or snow singularly bored me. I'm just not interested in drug-taking nor films about it and don't see the relevance here. I thought that the grown-up Kevin was far more plausible than the grown-up brothers and fully admired the actor's performance in his reticence to testify first of all and then his coming out and taking the bull by the horns, so to speak at the end.As to the good bits of the film, I have nothing but praise. Czerny's performance is absolutely magnificent - mixing the right dose of cruelty, sensitivity, perversion and rectitude. The character is totally plausible from beginning to end and he is not painted as a purely evil character although there is no doubt as to his irresponsability, violence and paedophile tendencies.I was also pleased with the actual quantity of violence, shown sex and implied sex. I had been afraid that none would be shown, and in reality there was just the right mix of implied and actual sex plus of course some terrifying violence. Female viewers of the film will no doubt cringe at these scenes as they have a maternel instinct which fills them with horror at the sight of cruelty or abuse to a child.As a male, I do not have this maternal instinct and therefore do not cringe and I think it is necessary to show these scenes ( correctly dosed, of course ) as they are part of the reality. I find the scenes immoral, powerful, realistic and necessary. I don't believe in showing everything, a part must be left to the spectator's imagination, but enough must be shown to leave an impression of shock with the viewer !! Sorry if that sounds complicated.The final question I had was How Close was this to Reality. In France and the UK, at present, there is a sort of anti-Church or anticlerical racism presently rife to the effect that all priests or brothers are paedophiles.

I never had any friends who spoke to me of this and whilst admittedly there are black sheep everywhere, even in religious communities, I do not subscribe to the theory that they are all paedophiles or homosexuals.What I did find frustrating in the film was that the matter was not dealt with by the police on the spot when it happened and why one had to wait 15 years for the facts to be exposed. Why was the police report doctored ? WHy were the church authorities not more ruthless with the offending brothers. Why was there collusion and cover-up between the police and the church.

Li Mu Bai is a great warrior whose good deeds are known all around East. He decides to give his magical jade sword to an old friend of his, but a mysterious martial arts expert manages to steal the ancient weapon. Li must find out the identity of the thief and find his precious sword. But, the way of a warrior isn't as straightforward - love and honour have their own demands.I'm a big fan of Asian film making and to really watch Asian films you need this certain perspective, especially when it comes to these zen-films. Nevertheless this movie isn't a typical Asian film, as I'd more describe it as a film where Asian film making and Hollywood collide. You could think that it all goes wrong in the Hollywood -part, but for your surprise it doesn't. Ang Lee has created a fine piece of quality style, where you can sense both Asian and Hollywood which blend together like butter for a bread. The story, originally written by Du Lu Wang and turned into a screenplay by three writers, is absolutely beautiful, it includes twists and turns, it's dramatic and romantic, it's even thrilling and it has spectacular fighting sequences. To me the reason why this stands out from an usual eastern movie and where you can really know it's also Hollywood is the somehow different, even better, flow in the story and the amount of fighting sequences. Despite that I think this movie is suitable for both Asian and American audience, not forgetting the rest of the world. Each one gets satisfaction and you don't have to be a fan of Asian films or know anything about the history behind zen-movies, although you really need to be open minded.This leads me to, once again, the one thing I think Asian directors are better than any other directors of different nationalities; The cinematography. If you'd think there isn't anything Asian in this film, you can't deny the fact that the cinematography is. Once again we are shown endless landscapes, mind painted sceneries and this undeniable and precise harmony of professional operation of the camera, which is to me just amazing. It holds this beauty which you can't compare to anything else and that, if something, is the real heart of true dedication of Asian film makers. You can't really do anything else than just thank them about it, but it's enough that you know it yourself. These landscapes are complimented with the utterly tremendous music composed by Tan Dun, who has composed a main theme that'll melt the heart of even the most cynical person. For Asian film making it's very common to fit the music with the cinematography and the story, but I just can't get enough of it, it's always just that good and you just don't get bored of it. The best thing about the music is that you can't hear music like it in any other films, so it's always fresh for your ears if you've only watched movies from Hollywood. Asian instruments are always strong and compelling, being really significant for the overall feeling of the film and what's left after it.Even the role performances are excellent, so you'll get a full quality package. I think Yun-Fat Chow as Li Mu Bai makes his best role performance yet to date and Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien makes some pretty damn fine job as well. Ziyi Zhang is again the beautiful herself, being also a great actress as well, which makes her one of my favourite Asian actresses at the moment. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh have a really good chemistry with each other, which is somehow reflected as the chemistry between Ziyi Zhang and her co-star Chen Chang. Both couples work with each other superbly on screen, so the movie isn't a let down even in that department. When you get along with film you realise that these couples are sort of equal to each other, only that the characters have different names and the stories behind them are different; It's all about love in the end and when we finally get to the end there's an astonishing solution where tears won't be spared. When love and honour have their own demands they will become equal to each other, love will become honour and vice versa. It's really hard to explain and even harder to find out, but in any case the viewer isn't left without answers. You can make up your own mind about the ending though, so it's also really clever.Wo hu cang long is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've ever seen, everything in it matches and clicks, everything just gets along. The film isn't perfect, but to be honest it's really close in being one. It doesn't really have any major flaws and even the minor ones can't be explained. Like mentioned before you really need a certain perspective, or you need to be at least open minded, because let's face it; A film like this isn't for everyone. If you can't stand any films which define the laws of physics or which are somehow surreal I wouldn't really recommend this film to you. If you're just slightly open minded or at least have some remains of an open mind then please do watch it, as I'd say you won't be disappointed. Wo hu cang long even won a total of four Academy Awards, which is really an achievement for a foreign film. Just to name two, it won Oscars from the best cinematography and music, so I'm really not praising them for nothing. Just see this film. You even may be surprised by its magic and its affect on you.

To me the reason why this stands out from an usual eastern movie and where you can really know it's also Hollywood is the somehow different, even better, flow in the story and the amount of fighting sequences. Despite that I think this movie is suitable for both Asian and American audience, not forgetting the rest of the world. Each one gets satisfaction and you don't have to be a fan of Asian films or know anything about the history behind zen-movies, although you really need to be open minded.This leads me to, once again, the one thing I think Asian directors are better than any other directors of different nationalities; The cinematography. If you'd think there isn't anything Asian in this film, you can't deny the fact that the cinematography is. Once again we are shown endless landscapes, mind painted sceneries and this undeniable and precise harmony of professional operation of the camera, which is to me just amazing. It holds this beauty which you can't compare to anything else and that, if something, is the real heart of true dedication of Asian film makers. You can't really do anything else than just thank them about it, but it's enough that you know it yourself. These landscapes are complimented with the utterly tremendous music composed by Tan Dun, who has composed a main theme that'll melt the heart of even the most cynical person. For Asian film making it's very common to fit the music with the cinematography and the story, but I just can't get enough of it, it's always just that good and you just don't get bored of it. The best thing about the music is that you can't hear music like it in any other films, so it's always fresh for your ears if you've only watched movies from Hollywood. Asian instruments are always strong and compelling, being really significant for the overall feeling of the film and what's left after it.Even the role performances are excellent, so you'll get a full quality package. I think Yun-Fat Chow as Li Mu Bai makes his best role performance yet to date and Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien makes some pretty damn fine job as well. Ziyi Zhang is again the beautiful herself, being also a great actress as well, which makes her one of my favourite Asian actresses at the moment. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh have a really good chemistry with each other, which is somehow reflected as the chemistry between Ziyi Zhang and her co-star Chen Chang. Both couples work with each other superbly on screen, so the movie isn't a let down even in that department. When you get along with film you realise that these couples are sort of equal to each other, only that the characters have different names and the stories behind them are different; It's all about love in the end and when we finally get to the end there's an astonishing solution where tears won't be spared. When love and honour have their own demands they will become equal to each other, love will become honour and vice versa. It's really hard to explain and even harder to find out, but in any case the viewer isn't left without answers. You can make up your own mind about the ending though, so it's also really clever.Wo hu cang long is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've ever seen, everything in it matches and clicks, everything just gets along. The film isn't perfect, but to be honest it's really close in being one. It doesn't really have any major flaws and even the minor ones can't be explained. Like mentioned before you really need a certain perspective, or you need to be at least open minded, because let's face it; A film like this isn't for everyone. If you can't stand any films which define the laws of physics or which are somehow surreal I wouldn't really recommend this film to you. If you're just slightly open minded or at least have some remains of an open mind then please do watch it, as I'd say you won't be disappointed. Wo hu cang long even won a total of four Academy Awards, which is really an achievement for a foreign film. Just to name two, it won Oscars from the best cinematography and music, so I'm really not praising them for nothing. Just see this film. You even may be surprised by its magic and its affect on you.

The cast itself is not laden with merely young hot-shot actors inserted into screenplays for box office appeal. Rather, it is almost too politically correct in its casting as all the demographics seem to be represented here young, old, Black, White, male, female, American, European etc. Yet each of the principals and the supporting cast fits into his\/her respective role quite well, with little wasted motion.

To wit, the Jon Voight bridge scene gets a few once-overs, if you will. Also, the European locales are well shot with no gratuitous indulgence, which helps to embellish the story line. Lest I forget, a sweet job by Danny Elfman adapting Lalo Schiffrin's MI theme to the soundtrack, especially during the ending credits where he shifts the theme's normal 5\/4 tempo to a funkier, bluesier 4\/4 time signature!Tom Cruise takes a nice turnabout from some of his earlier more cutesy roles. His role here demands of him technical expertise as well as strength of character in order for him to merely stay alive. J. Voight and V.

Jack Lemmon plays a public relations man who must, along with his wife, battle alcoholism. Lee Remick turns in another superb performance as Lemmon's mercurial, oft inebriated spouse. Blake Edwards shows a surprisingly nice feel for drama and allows most of the scenes between Lemmon and Remick to play out in long, uninterrupted takes which lends the film an air of pathos and grim inevitability. This story does not pull any punches and the b&w color scheme seems to reinforce the binary nature of alcoholism; no middle path exists with the disease, you either get sober or it destroys you. 'Days of Wine and Roses' puts American alcoholism in the foreground of many scenes by prominently displaying flashing neon signs that say things like 'Bar' or 'liquor' in establishing exterior shots. These signs add tension to the plot because the characters are struggling so hard to maintain sobriety. Lemmon's work as a PR man also bears some significance because he deals professionally with images and perceptions, not the underlying realities of life. These underlying truths will eventually surface and haunt him. The movie inheres the same flaws that one would no doubt find in American culture itself in 1962. Remick's character has very little to do and she finds her housewife routine unsatisfying and empty. Lemmon's character seems arbitrarily stronger and more capable of beating alcoholism, perhaps just because of his status as a man. Their daughter gets very little time devoted to her unfortunate situation, both from a writing and a film standpoint. I found myself wondering if her story might not have had the most potential power. That said, both Lemmon and Remmick deliver some of the most powerful dialogue concerning the struggle against alcohol that I have ever seen.

From first to last this thriller makes us asking questions. And that's why I love this movie from my first viewing back in 1999. till yesterday, when I watched it again on TV. All right I admit; I probably catch it once more during that period. But with movies like this you don't get bored. You only notice some new details, or you watch just how one man acts. 9 years ago I was watching Pacino, because of him I lend this movie from video and yesterday I watched this movie as whole, with all its main actors, including Reeves and Theron. I don't want to talk about the whole script and about biblical meaning. This comment is about actors and about actors only.Plot is about young lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who comes to New York from Florida, so he can work in the most powerful law firm in the world. His mother Alice (Judith Ivey) disagree with his decision but all Kevin wants is to make money and try to live happy life with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Law firm is in the hands of powerful and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino). Soon, Kevin is sinking in his new cases and pays less and less attention to his wife, who feels homesick and has all sorts of bizarre thoughts connected with devil.I just love to watch performances from actors in these sort of movies. Al Pacino is one of my favorite male actors (with Depp, Brando and Dean) and his performance is stunning as usual. He plays with his role maybe a little too much, but we can all forgive such genius.

It tells the story of Julie, a 33-year-old woman who has just lost her composer husband and young daughter in a terrible automobile accident. Thrown into the bluest of blue funks (and who wouldn't be?), Julie moves to a flat in Paris and tries to divorce herself from life, telling herself that money, love and friendships are all traps. But what at first seems to be an extremely downbeat film proves rather life affirming, as Julie discovers that maybe there are things left to her worth engaging with after all. Her newfound and unwanted liberty (blue is the color of the French flag that corresponds with liberty, oui?), her sudden independence, may not be as desirable as she initially thought.... Blue is a film loaded with all sorts of symbolism and suggested meanings. It features world-class direction, striking photography (although that impressive image-on-the-cornea shot was used to better effect in Goldfinger some 30 years before) and impeccable acting, especially from Juliette Binoche in the lead. It is certainly not the picture for viewers desiring speed, but nonetheless rewards the patient viewer with its ultimately uplifting message that life does have a way of pulling us back in. Though easily the most somber of the trilogy, it is not at all depressing, and didn't leave me feeling blue at all. Oh...has anyone else noticed that although Julie's daughter is reported to be 5 at her funeral, the dates on her coffin indicate 7? Is this an error on the director's part (hard to believe, with such an impeccable craftsman as Kieslowski) or something else that needs to be thought about by the viewer?

In it we meet Karol Karol, a Polish hairdresser living in Paris who has just been divorced by his wife Dominique (the gorgeous Julie Delpy, who is not unfairly compared to the Brigitte Bardot of Contempt in this picture), due to a spell of impotence. At first blush something of a nebbish, Karol soon shows that he is nevertheless quite the resourceful character. Back in his wintry-white native land, he manages to somehow get back on his feet, rebuild his life despite numerous adversities--as had Juliette Binoche in Blue--and even contrive a get-even scheme involving his ex. As in the previous film, the directing and photography are just outstanding, and Zbigniew Zamachowski is at once sympathetic, funny and charismatic in White's lead role. Sharp-eyed fans of Blue will note Ms. Binoche's Julie character in White's opening courtroom scene, as well as the same old lady at the recycling bin (this latter background character would also, strangely, resurface in Red); just some fun elements to help tie this loosely linked trio of films together, I suppose. Despite being a bit more straightforward than the other two films in the trilogy, White still offers food for thought, as well as some puzzling moments. For example, viewers who will be able to interpret Delpy's hand gestures at the tail end of the picture are certainly better than me. (Then again, I've always been pretty bad at any hand pantomime more involved than a raised middle finger; guess I'd make a lousy deaf person!) Fortunately, Delpy explains these mysterious gestures for us in one of the DVD's copious extras. I'm also somewhat at a loss as to how the color white's corresponding to equality on the French flag pertains here. Are we supposed to think that Karol and Dominique are equals of sorts by the film's end? I suppose so. The white of the title can just as easily be regarded, though, as corresponding to the sweet and pleasing center of an Oreo cookie, in the middle of two decidedly darker segments...
