Basically the mother of brother and sister Carolyn (Annie Corley) and Michael Johnson (Victor Slezak) has died, and in her will she gives instructions of a new death plan, being cremated and her ashes scattered off a bridge in Madison County, like the man she mentions, Robert Kincaid (Eastwood). In her box of possessions, she has written the story of her and Robert, and this is where the film goes to flashback. Italian mother and wife Francesca Johnson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) is alone for four days while her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) are away at the Iowa state fair. She sees a car pulling up to her house, it is Robert asking for directions to a bridge that he needs to photograph, and she decides to take him there. He takes the pictures and takes her back to the house, and she invites him in for a drink, and then a little later when he planned to leave for dinner. You can tell Francesca is really attracted to Robert, but we're not sure about him. Day 2, he comes back and they spend some more time together at the bridge again. It is later in the evening where they become a lot closer, and eventually kiss and end up in bed together. The next day there is a little squabble about the affair situation, and after day four he decides it is right that he should leave, and Richard and the kids (till now) never found out. Years later, Richard is on his death bed, and Francesca every year always visits spots Robert used to go on her birthday. Of course she discovers he has died when his attorney sends her many of his things. Carolyn and Michael of course understand how passionately their mother felt for Robert in those four days, and how the memory of him helped her survive till death, so they honour her wishes. A very touching story that you can feel more than one way about, i.e. is the affair wrong or right, and who should Francesca be with? It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Streep was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Passions.

Rob Zombie recently eased that fear a little bit, but in Sam Raimi's early career, he was making gritty, grimy horror films that reminded us that the old days of horror can still be brought back to life. For every I Know What You Did Last Summer or Hostel or other idiot teen slasher I think back to the days of Raimi's early horror films and just wonder what happened.Here's something interesting, in modern times, there are more and more high budget horror movies coming out, with a noticeable decline in quality as the money gets bigger. I wish someone would notice that one of the best things about The Evil Dead is that it was made on a shoe-string budget. Like Chaplin's favorite part of his career, the early years when he would just go to the park with a bench and a girl and a big oafish guy and just bang out a film, Evil Dead gives the feeling of being just a bunch of friends who went out to the woods and cut themselves off from society for a while to see what they could come up with. And they came out with a classic! The plot, of course, focuses on (you guessed it) a group of friends who go out to the woods to camp. The opening of the movie, the drive through the creepy woods, is one of the best examples of mood-setting that I can think of. You can almost feel the trees closing in around you as the hapless friends drive through the woods, teasing each other about the scary woods.There are several scenes in the movie that will immediately put off a lot of viewers, such as the infamous tree love scene (not my favorite either), but the fact that the movie doesn't try to please anyone is what allows it to cut loose and just be a real horror movie. Trying to please a wide audience is the worst thing that any horror film can do, because that's what gives you those stupid sophomoric teen thrillers.Bruce Campbell, in the first performance of his best role, Ash, is surprisingly geeky in the first Evil Dead movie, at least compared to the hardened badass that he was to become in the two sequels, and considering the fact that he is generally remembered as being the coolest horror hero imaginable. But I think that may be what makes the trilogy work so well. A good story should show character change, and through the course of the trilogy Ash becomes something completely different from what he was when we met him in 1981, and Campbell fits the geek and the hero exceptionally well.Raimi understands the cartoonishly excessive blood and gore will reduce the real scariness of the movie and make it almost into a bloody comedy, so he uses that idea to its maximum potential, causing us to laugh and squirm all throughout the movie, although the real scares are few and far between. The sound effects, camera work, costumes, and vile liquids spraying forth across the screen, however, are horrible enough, and it's clear that Raimi and the cast and crew are having a lot of fun with the material, which is one of the many reasons that it's so easy for the audience to have fun with it, too.It should be noted that, because of the shoestring budget, they had to be truly creative in their effects and filming. Much of the camera work is done using very crude techniques, and the creativity involved creates a feel that the biggest budget could never approach. There are dollies and slides and other devices that are handmade from things like pieces of wood and duct tape in order to get the necessary shots, and the effect is brilliant. Can you imagine? They actually used duct tape to film this movie! Outstanding! Strangely, Raimi took a four year break from directing after the Evil Dead, before finally following the movie up with the astonishingly bad Crimewave, the badness of which just strikes me as a real mystery, given the talent involved in making it. Luckily, he almost immediately followed this disaster up with the first sequel to Evil Dead, which plays like a sequel and a remake at the same time. It serves as a testament to the success of this early effort that it was basically remade Evil Dead II, and now is set to be remade again in 2009. Let's just hope that, now that he's a Hollywood director, Raimi can still capture the same attitude and gritty goriness of his early career!

It really doesn't matter, there's an argument for both sides and so the endless debates will, of course, go nowhere. What is not up for debate is that the movie begins with a recap of what happened in the first film, and then there is another group that heads out to the woods to spend a weekend in the creepy cabin in the woods. They discover a recording of a man studying the Necronomicon, The Book of the Dead (also found in the cabin), which included incantations that bring forth all manner of bad things.Soon the movie becomes strikingly similar to the original, resulting I suppose in the controversy about whether it's a remake or a sequel. Personally, it feels like a rethinking of the first movie, where certain ideas and effects are fleshed out in ways that the financial constraints of the original film wouldn't allow, as well as a beefing up of the significant comic relief. Indeed, for all it's blood and gore and self-mutilations and animated severed limbs, this is one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen.One thing that is shown in part II is a visual presentation of the evil force in the woods, which is sadly a disappointing attempt to add more complex special effects into the movie, but the majority of the film will be remembered as Ash's truly classic battle with the evil force in the cabin, which ultimately starts to take over his own body, but he is able to stop it by cutting off his own possessed hand. Love it or hate it, this stuff has never been done in a horror movie before, and that's not the only genuinely original thing. Even furniture becomes possessed and laughs hysterically at Ash, and we laugh along with them. This is about as fun as gore films can get! I think that one of the best things about the original film was its meager budget, but the best thing about the trilogy as a whole is that it is a horror film that is intended almost exclusively for horror fans. Bring a date to watch this movie and I'm willing to bet that you will find yourself lonely in a hurry. Evil Dead II is packed with horror thoughts and ideas that seem to have come out of nowhere, they are so over the top and unique. Ash is attacked by a severed head, a headless body, and his own severed hand in the movie, along with countless other beasties, and the effect, due in no small part to his hilarious reactions, is horror entertainment of the highest order.Of course, the budget is bigger now, but Raimi was able to take more money and still retain the same feel of the original film, except that he was able to give us more detail and use more effects this time around, but definitely without selling out. Whether he did this later in his career is up for debate, but in the first sequel in the Evil Dead trilogy, it almost seems like he took more money from bankrollers who expected a more accessible horror film and then tricked them, giving us a movie that is still intended for the original fans.Raimi soon moved away from the gritty horror genre with more accessible films, like The Quick and the Dead and the astonishingly brilliant A Simple Plan, before moving into mainstream Hollywood with the Spiderman movies, but it is the simplicity of the Evil Dead films that his fans will always remember with the most fondness. It is telling that the Spiderman juggernaut is known, among fans, and being directed by the guy who made the Evil Dead films, and not the other way around. Peter Jackson, on the other hand, will always be associated with the Lord of the Rings films, while his own early horror films are all but forgotten.

It really doesn't matter, there's an argument for both sides and so the endless debates will, of course, go nowhere. What is not up for debate is that the movie begins with a recap of what happened in the first film, and then there is another group that heads out to the woods to spend a weekend in the creepy cabin in the woods. They discover a recording of a man studying the Necronomicon, The Book of the Dead (also found in the cabin), which included incantations that bring forth all manner of bad things.Soon the movie becomes strikingly similar to the original, resulting I suppose in the controversy about whether it's a remake or a sequel. Personally, it feels like a rethinking of the first movie, where certain ideas and effects are fleshed out in ways that the financial constraints of the original film wouldn't allow, as well as a beefing up of the significant comic relief. Indeed, for all it's blood and gore and self-mutilations and animated severed limbs, this is one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen.One thing that is shown in part II is a visual presentation of the evil force in the woods, which is sadly a disappointing attempt to add more complex special effects into the movie, but the majority of the film will be remembered as Ash's truly classic battle with the evil force in the cabin, which ultimately starts to take over his own body, but he is able to stop it by cutting off his own possessed hand. Love it or hate it, this stuff has never been done in a horror movie before, and that's not the only genuinely original thing. Even furniture becomes possessed and laughs hysterically at Ash, and we laugh along with them. This is about as fun as gore films can get! I think that one of the best things about the original film was its meager budget, but the best thing about the trilogy as a whole is that it is a horror film that is intended almost exclusively for horror fans. Bring a date to watch this movie and I'm willing to bet that you will find yourself lonely in a hurry. Evil Dead II is packed with horror thoughts and ideas that seem to have come out of nowhere, they are so over the top and unique. Ash is attacked by a severed head, a headless body, and his own severed hand in the movie, along with countless other beasties, and the effect, due in no small part to his hilarious reactions, is horror entertainment of the highest order.Of course, the budget is bigger now, but Raimi was able to take more money and still retain the same feel of the original film, except that he was able to give us more detail and use more effects this time around, but definitely without selling out.

He volunteers for a revolutionary new drug\/therapy treatment designed to cure him of his violent tendencies, but what will it really do to his mind and freewill ?This astonishing film, like so many by this amazing director, has no other to compare it to; it is simply unique. There were a spate of dystopian science-fiction movies made in the early seventies - Soylent Green, THX 1138, Rollerball, Logan's Run, etc - all of which vaguely look and feel like each other, but none of them are anything like Kubrick's future shock classic. Instead of spending a fortune on flashy spotless techno-sets, it was shot in incredibly ugly (even by sixties standards) concrete housing estates in Thamesmead and Wandsworth in south London and concentrates on its characters and social setups. Its genius is not to focus on what the future looks like, but what life would be like, and its prophecy of a bland, uncaring society and a government obsessed with popularity, social engineering and restricting personal freedom is absolutely bang-on (if you don't believe me, think about how much our leaders now spend on polls and thinktanks and how much legislation they pass simply because they don't trust us). Morally, it also has a completely original structure - it gives us a loathsome, horrible protagonist, shows him at his very worst, and then asks us to identify and sympathise with him as he is pulped through a cruel political machinery seeking only to exploit him. Through your reaction to this, Kubrick is really defining your own character, an incredible thing for a movie to do. If you think Alex really is an irredeemable thug (as so many self-appointed moral guardians did when the movie was released) then you know very little of human nature and how environment influences us. But if you sympathise with him (as I do), what does that say about you ? Through Alex, the movie examines the odd connection and conflict between morality and intelligence \/ identity \/ creativity, and does so on multiple levels - personal, social, religious, even biological. Kubrick's chief desire in his movies was to get the audience to think and ask questions, and the ultimate question here is when Alex is cured at the end, is that good or bad ? My answer is that it's both good and bad, but it's undeniably sensational and mindbending. The lynchpin of these questions, and the film in general, is the career-best performance by the sublime McDowell as Alex. I think it's simply one of the best in any movie, an exceptional example of the perfect actor for the part at the perfect point in his career, firing on all cylinders. He simply is Alex; he's physically amazing, he grasps the tone (especially the humorous aspects) of the character completely, he understands the movie's purpose and he plays each scene with incredible power, his cunning blue eyes and gleeful smirk burning up the screen. This is not straight drama or method acting, it's an extremely stylised performance to suit the movie, but it's just sensational in every way. The moment in the penultimate shot, when McDowell grimaces and stares insanely upwards, his bestial machismo restored, is the ultimate Kubrick Look, which recurs in many of his films, but never better personified than here. The rest of the cast are a terrific bunch of weirdos, notably Clarke, Morris and Stone, and Sharp gives his oily politician just the right mixture of snobbish disdain and patronising double-talk. This was the first of three films that Kubrick made with cameraman John Alcott and right from the amazing opening pull-back in the milkbar almost every frame is both incredible and original; I think my favourite shot is the circular reverse tracker on Alex as he walks through the music boutique. This is a terrific Steadicam shot - the only problem is it was filmed five years before the Steadicam was invented, so how on earth was it done ! The other crucial element is the fantastic pioneering electronic score by Walter\/Wendy Carlos, which is combined with inspired source music (Rossini's La Gazza Ladra, Elgar's Pomp And Circumstance, Gene Kelly's Singin' In The Rain) to make the delirious visuals even wilder. This movie is so original it even has its own language, the Nadsat (a great jumble of English, Russian, slang, Biblical phrasing and made-up words) which results in such wonderful lines as, Come and get one in the yarbles, if ya have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou !. Sadly and shamefully, here in the UK the film was stigmatised as glorifying violence (Straw Dogs and The Exorcist suffered similar fates) and a hate campaign against Kubrick resulted in his pulling it; outside of bootlegs it was impossible to see here until after his death in 1999. This is both extraordinary - that a director would have the power to pull his own movie out of circulation - and detestable - that philistine idiots who object to artistic freedom would resort to the type of violence they pretend to be protecting everybody else from. The movie remains a work of total genius, and its stunning originality and extraordinary imagery are to be savoured. Based on a great novel by Anthony Burgess.

Paul now has a new woman in his life, KABC news reporter Geri Nichols. One day while he's out with Carol and Geri, Paul is mugged by some punks. Paul fights back, but they get away. The muggers want to get back at Paul for fighting back, so they go to his house. Paul is not there, but Carol is. So they rape and murder Paul's cook, and kidnap Carol and rape her -- the second time in her life that she's been raped, and she didn't even have a chance to recover from the first rape. After the muggers are done, Carol escapes and jumps from a window -- and she dies when she becomes impaled on the railings below. Paul is fed up with his family being attacked all the time, no matter where they live, so Paul rents a ratty hotel room, disguises himself, and sets out to find the muggers who killed Carol. When the LAPD deduces that that they have a vigilante on their hands, they decide to consult with the NYPD, who had their vigilante problem years ago. The NYPD, now knowing that Kersey lives in Los Angeles, fears that Kersey is killing criminals again. Fearing that Kersey, when caught, will reveal that they let him go instead of prosecuting him, the NYPD sends Inspector Frank Ochoa to make sure that doesn't happen. But Ochoa gets killed in a car crash at an LA freeway ramp while Paul is still trying to find the muggers.This movie is poorly-made because they cut out so many scenes.

Paul now has a new woman in his life, KABC news reporter Geri Nichols. One day while he's out with Carol and Geri, Paul is mugged by some punks. Paul fights back, but they get away. The muggers want to get back at Paul for fighting back, so they go to his house. Paul is not there, but Carol is. So they rape and murder Paul's cook, and kidnap Carol and rape her -- the second time in her life that she's been raped, and she didn't even have a chance to recover from the first rape. After the muggers are done, Carol escapes and jumps from a window -- and she dies when she becomes impaled on the railings below. Paul is fed up with his family being attacked all the time, no matter where they live, so Paul rents a ratty hotel room, disguises himself, and sets out to find the muggers who killed Carol. When the LAPD deduces that that they have a vigilante on their hands, they decide to consult with the NYPD, who had their vigilante problem years ago. The NYPD, now knowing that Kersey lives in Los Angeles, fears that Kersey is killing criminals again. Fearing that Kersey, when caught, will reveal that they let him go instead of prosecuting him, the NYPD sends Inspector Frank Ochoa to make sure that doesn't happen. But Ochoa gets killed in a car crash at an LA freeway ramp while Paul is still trying to find the muggers.This movie is poorly-made because they cut out so many scenes.

He also had a night school diploma, but rose to the top of his company through hard work and being completely ruthless. When Sheen brings him information about the airline that his father works maintenance for, Douglas makes a bundle and brings Sheen into his circle.

Miss Honey is her niece and it's possible that Honey's father Magnus' death was no suicide but held responsible by Trunchbull herself. There is not one redeeming quality about the Trunchbull and that's what bothers me the most. Not all monsters look like Trunchbull or act like one. No principal would ever get away with such inhuman behavior.

From what I remember, it certainly wasn't fun when I first watched it, but I didn't see it in what I thought to be a comfortable place. However, it's been six years since then, and I recently rented it to watch on my own free will. I think it was more pleasant watching it alone in my basement, and I certainly can't say I was bored for the most part, but I could still see some serious flaws.Jackie and Luke Harrison are a divorced couple who had two kids while they were together named Anna and Ben. Now that they are divorced, Luke is currently dating a significantly younger woman named Isabel Kelly, who is a professional photographer. When it comes to parenting, Isabel is highly inexperienced, so it's not easy for her to look after the kids when she is left to do so, and her job sometimes gets in the way. In addition to that, the kids don't like their step-mom, and Jackie is sometimes disgusted by Isabel's inability to look after the kids properly, despite how much she may try, so the two women don't tend to get along so well. However, when Jackie is diagnosed with cancer, which could mean she won't live much longer, she must try to work things out with Isabel and family.Playing the song, Under Pressure, by Queen, while Isabel wakes up and has to rush the kids out of bed was a good way to start off the film. After that, I found quite a bit of tension in the film to keep me intrigued, but that didn't stop me from noticing some pretty lame moments. This includes some of the dialogue, and a poor attempt at comedy I can think of when Ben burps and Anna says, Oh, I hate when you do that, I can smell your breakfast! Isabel's advice for Anna on how to get back at her nasty ex-boyfriend is also rather poorly thought out. One of the things she suggests she says to him is, I'm not going to waste my time on some loser who doesn't even know what snowblowing is. Now, it would have been worse if Isabel had actually told Anna what snowblowing is, and since this is not an R-rated film, it's obviously never mentioned what it means, but this part is still pretty stupid. Having a 12 year old character talk about snowblowing may have worked in a really raunchy comedy, but not in a drama! Lastly, there's not much to like about the characters, including Anna with her bitterness and insults, and Jackie, who does something pretty cruel to Isabel with that Pearl Jam concert!Now, like I said, I certainly can't say I was bored for the most part when I last watched this movie. I may have even gotten a lump in my throat towards the end, but due to certain problems with some of the characters and the writing, I feel I may have been cheated by the film. I didn't exactly feel it was all really worth it, even if some parts are done well. 5\/10 just MIGHT be a BIT too low, but not by much. Some parts confused me, and sometimes even put a puzzled look on my face. It may have had a lot of potential that wasn't reached. I'm sure this movie has made many people cry, which I noticed in that high school class, and I don't hold anything against these people. I'm sure it would have made me cry if I were more emotional. However, that still doesn't change my opinion that Stepmom is a lacklustre drama which could move you, but could also possibly leave you wondering what for.

Watching it I found an interesting film that successfully mixes characters with a convincing sense of time and place. It is worth me saying that I'm too young (and from Northern Ireland) so I have no knowledge of this scene or time but the few aging Mods I know assure me that it is not a million miles off the wider experiences. So for me it serves as a snapshot of a time that has since moved on and has become more of a minor fashion statement than a scene but it is the strength of the film that the themes and characters are what keeps the film relevant regardless.Specifically of course this is evident in the troubled and confused (Chr1st I'm middle-aged) youth Jimmy. The film convincingly portrays his neediness to be part of something to define himself, the joy of being there, the acting-out that comes when even within his group he is left out and the emotional collapse that comes when he fails to find anything to find the joy of being part of the mob in Brighton. It is a well observed and surprisingly honest and critical depiction of the character and of the wider struggle of youth. To me this is the core of the film and it is a solid piece of character drama, written with a real understanding of the feelings of those of this age. The period stuff is obviously very important too and the look, feel and soundtrack are all really well done and very enjoyable if you have any affection for any part of this culture (and I do for the music).Daniels leads the cast really well with a performance that makes the film and delivers on the content in the script. He is a tragic and sympathetic figure and I imagine that many viewers will have some experiences that can make them connect with his turn. He is well supported by less well developed characters but still solid performances from a host of British acting talent. Ash is not brilliant but is OK and has not been in anything better since. Davis, Sting, Winstone, Elphick and others all support well but mostly the film belongs to Daniels and his performance is worthy of this responsibility. Writer\/director Roddam pulls it altogether really well (some of it almost feels like news footage), with memorable images and shots, although it is hard to forget that his recent world has not really lived up to the standard he set early (unless you happen to be a big Master Chef fan, in which case he has).Overall then this is an enjoyable but yet also impacting portrayal of the pain of passing from youth to adult. The convincing delivery of period and place only serves to make it better and, while this may date it, the strength of the character and of Daniels' delivery keeps it relevant and engaging almost thirty years later.

I was in high school at the time, and I know it was highly popular with my peers, who are clearly the same target audience that director Ringo Lam was shooting for with Maximum Risk. Van Damme lends his cult star power along with Natasha Henstridge (which the IMDb claims is sometimes credited as The Chick From Species) under the direction of Hong Kong action director Lam and the result is a remarkably bad, by-the-numbers revenge drama.The movie opens with a routine high speed chase that is interesting only because it takes places through tiny alleys in the south of France and ends in a wild jump into oncoming traffic by the man being chased, who is played by Van Damme and who dies before we even see the title of the movie. The last movie that I watched before this one was Universal Soldier, another movie in which Van Damme's character is killing within the first few minutes of the movie, so I was surprised to see it happen again given that this is obviously a very different movie. But if nothing else, the opening chase definitely gets your attention, if only to make you wonder what would make him so desperate to escape from the men chasing him, who turned out to be government agents.But an early death is not the only familiar thing we'll see. Van Damme also plays a double role and spends most of the movie trying to avenge his brother, You see, it seems that there is a French cop who bears an astonishing resemblance to the man killed in the chase, and after some investigation it's revealed that he is a long lost brother. The mother tearfully admits that she had to give up her other son when he was an infant because she couldn't support two children, and never told her other son Alain (the French police officer) that he ever had a brother.That's basically the set-up, and Alain drops everything and sets off on a personal quest to find out who his brother was and who killed him and why. This is what leads him to Alex, his dead brother's girlfriend, played by Natasha Henstridge, who surely would never have taken such a ridiculous role had she not been brand new in the movies. This is her second film, and I am at a loss to explain why she would accept such a ludicrous role other than her inexperience in film.Alex is an ex-stripper who is now a waitress for questionable characters (less money but more respectable), who doesn't blink when Alain shows up at her work, other than to rush him out because he's not exactly welcome there. He tends to be stone silent when he approaches people who think that he is his brother, but in most cases ultimately he comes right out and tells them, and when he tells Alex, she joins him in his mission.Sadly, there is nothing interesting or original about the movie. Every character is a cliché, good guys or bad. All that's left is Alain's quest to learn about his brother's life and bring his killers to justice, which is honorable but all he can do is spout cheesy lines about how he's not going to rest until his brother's killers are brought to justice. I have said before that Van Damme gets a lot of bad press about his movies, and I think that because of that people often forget that his characters are almost always motivated by very honorable ideas and values. He delivers a good message in a way that very few other action stars do, and unfortunately in Maximum Risk the problem is that it's too obvious and there's not really anything else in the movie to entertain us along the way.James Berardinelli, for example, claims in his review that Van Damme's acting ability can charitably be described as 'limited,' so clearly there can be no satisfactory emotional content in the movie. He's right that Van Damme's acting is often wooden and unconvincing, but dead wrong that he can't do it. Sadly, it wasn't until eight years later, in Wake of Death (which Berardinelli didn't see) that Van Damme showed without question that he can definitely convey emotions. WOW.There is the issue that there is no chemistry whatsoever between Van Damme and Henstridge, but a more pressing concern is that she was a man's lover and then, after he was killed, she honored his memory by becoming his twin brother's lover.

He's right that Van Damme's acting is often wooden and unconvincing, but dead wrong that he can't do it. Sadly, it wasn't until eight years later, in Wake of Death (which Berardinelli didn't see) that Van Damme showed without question that he can definitely convey emotions. WOW.There is the issue that there is no chemistry whatsoever between Van Damme and Henstridge, but a more pressing concern is that she was a man's lover and then, after he was killed, she honored his memory by becoming his twin brother's lover. Is it just me or does something about that just not come off right? Sort of throws a wet towel over the already boring and routine obligatory ending.Unfortunately, Lam is not the first Hong Kong action director to enter the American market with a Van Damme disaster. John Woo, an occasionally lucky director, also came to America and brought us Hard Target, another of Van Damme's few thorough disappointments. Van Damme is a major action star with genuine talent and appeal, but sadly this movie was worth the time of effort of anyone involved&#133; ","genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"5 May 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I'd heard good things about this film before seeing it and was not disappointed. The animation and story are excellent as one would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki film. Be warned however that this film isn't as gentle as his other films, we see several people having their heads and limbs removed although this is not shown in graphic close-up.I liked the fact that the conflict between the villagers and the forest creatures wasn't depicted as a clear cut case of good versus bad and like most of Miyazaki's films it has strong female characters that are neither damsels in distress nor trying to marry their Prince Charming like many western animated heroines.The film opens with a possessed giant boar thundering out of the forest and attacking a village. The boar is slain by Prince Ashitake but not before it wounds him. He is told that the found is part of a curse that will ultimately kill him if he doesn't leave his village and seek out the Deer God in forests far to the west.When he gets there he finds the forest creatures in conflict with the inhabitants of a village who are clearing areas of forest to find ore for their iron works. It turns out that Lady Eboshi, the leader of the village, had fired the shot that had caused the boar to be cursed. She is not a typical film villain though as she is very protective of her village and employs former prostitutes and lepers who wouldn't be treated so well elsewhere.Fighting against her is San (Princess Mononoke) a girl that has been raised by the Wolf goddess Moro in the forest and despises humans, and various forest creatures. When she attacks the iron works in a plan to kill Lady Eboshi, Ashitake intervenes to stop them killing each other.

Almost certainly due to the success of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho in 1960, this film once again sees Castle handling a theme based around a psychopathic killer (he did it earlier with Homicidal in 1961 and Straight-Jacket in 1964) and takes direct influence from a certain famous scene from the Alfred Hitchcock film. There's also a touch of Hitchcock's Rear Window thrown in too. Clearly the film was intended to appeal to a young crowd as Castle puts the focus on two girls and a friend staying at home while their parents are out for the evening. They soon decide to make some prank phone calls and after a handful of amusing ones, they end up finding themselves in danger when they pick Steve Marek out of the phone directory. Their opening gambit is I saw what you did and I know who you are...which is unfortunate because Steve has just murdered his wife.Considering the subject material, it does have to be said that the tone of this film is more than just a shade too light-hearted. This is a bit of a problem as it's clear that Castle's main aim with this film was simply to entertain the audience rather than tell a story. The way it plays out is also slightly too simple and it does feel like the film could really benefit from being kicked up a notch on more than one occasion. However, despite the negative elements of the film; there are certainly a lot of good things about it too. The plot may be simple but it's always enjoyable and Castle presents us with a trio of leads that are very easy to get along with. The black and white picture and the atmosphere do benefit the film in spite of the fact that Castle goes slightly overboard with the smoke machine towards the end. Joan Crawford is the big name of the film, although she doesn't have a lot of screen time and it's the pairing of lesser known actresses Andi Garrett and Sara Lane that take the lead roles and both do well with them. It all boils down to a predictable and enjoyable ending and I did enjoy this film despite its flaws. Worth a look!
