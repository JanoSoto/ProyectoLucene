[{"date":"23 August 2005","score":"6 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" The Boondock Saints was a film a couple of times while watching it (not early on, but midway through and around the last twenty minutes) I wanted to turn off, but I didn't as I wanted to see what might happen next. Perhaps that's from the crime\/action film fan I am, but the set-up to the film is a hook the MacManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus) are regular Catholic church-goers who also frequent the local pub. One day, after contemplating that God does not rid the world of the ones who are really the wrongdoers, they go out and do it themselves- quasi-vigilantes with a kind of spiritual morality at their sides. The mobsters that they're wiping out are connected, and it leads to an investigation being started by the eccentric\/gay Detective played by Willem Dafoe, and also an all-out-war escalating with the hiring of a crazy killer (Billy Connolly) on their trails. So, for the first fifteen to twenty minutes of watching the film, the hook had me in, and while I didn't think of it as particularly dynamite film-making, it did attempt at a realistic beginning of the lead's lives and conflicts. This, unfortunately, did not hold. The problem with how The Boondock Saints unfolds is that at many points in the film it doesn't know how to balance the elements of comedy and tragedy, and gets morality mixed up in it all. One reviewer said its like Natural Born Killers with a moral. But un-like NBK, the film doesn't have any particular 'point' to make, up until the end which becomes very muddled. For example, the Willem Dafoe character- he plays this role wildly, sometimes smoothly, and in some scenes he basically held the framework together. But the script doesn't give him much else to go; is he funny, operatic, for real? Writer\/Director Troy Duffy has him chasing his tail every which way. Unlike in a smarter, more experimental film like NBK, Duffy in an ironic sense plays it safe with the story. The script has also been compared to Tarantino, and that is a relevant comparison to make. The film-making style itself is not necessarily a QT knockoff (too many big-style camera moves, and a poor soundtrack sorry to say, there isn't much patience or true daring), but the script does have that sort of realm of it. The F-word is tossed around like candy; the bad-asses in the film are made out to look like 'real' bad-asses (see Connelly, one of his oddest roles); and there is plenty of action to go around (although I'd say, at least in comparison to Pulp Fiction, that had less action, with better results than this film). I wouldn't mean to make comparisons, but it would give people a better idea the near naivety of the filmmaker towards the audience. What's the moral in the end anyway, that justified killing is OK if its connected with Catholic revenge and justice? Whatever points are being made in the film are made early on and then lost in most of the second and third acts. It's not that there isn't some talent in Duffy's writing or direction, or that the actors don't do what they can. Yet there is such a kind of formula to it as well, even in the more unexpected scenes. The Boondock Saints does have its cult audience out there to be sure (some consider it one of the best films ever made), but it is too 'cool' and 'smart' for its own good. It's like the horse that you're friend wanted you to bet in on, and then after its impressive first stretch it folds, and then trips over. I almost wished at times I could like it more while watching it, but I also know that there are better, and less exploitive, original genre films out there.

At the time of its release, everyone loved it and praised it for its slick and original style. Having a main character talk to the camera was a pretty fresh idea for mainstream movies. This doesn't mean it never happened before. This film has been influenced strangely enough, by Jean Luc Godard's Breathless. Who would have thought that John Hughes even paid attention to the French New Wave? Maybe he didn't and it's all just purely coincidental. What else is bizarre about this film is its dated and exaggerated use of technology. Ferris Beuller uses his computer to hack into his high school transcript and alter his attendance record. And this was 1986..? Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a funny movie and it has a very sweet side to it but the upper class atmosphere of this movie is really annoying. Ferris and his friends take a day off from school to live the high life in the city of Chicago by going to expensive restaurants, going to a Cubs game, visiting a museum and as Ferris puts it we saw priceless works of art! and they also sit in a booth by the Chicago stock exchange. What were they doing there? Before going home, Ferris and his friends spend an hour at someone's swimming pool and jacuzzi. All of this just wouldn't be enough without Ferris friend's car, which happens to be a Ferrari. Now there's nothing wrong with being rich and granted, this is a comedy which is not supposed to be totally realistic. But the theme of the film seems to suggest that in order to really have fun, you need to have money and spend it. These kids just cannot see through the superficial and material world they live in. At one point Ferris's sister is heard complaining to herself about Ferris. Maybe it's not so bad. After all, I got a car and he got a computer. Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a light comedy and if there's anything to learn from the story, its that its that getting a little support from your friends goes a long way. In some ways, Ferris Beuller's Day Off was the 80's version of Forrest Gump. They don't exactly have the same story but both films deal with how success can be earned even if you don't play by the rules. Forrest Gump had a learning disability but he became very successful. Ferris Beuller slacked off from school but everyone thought he was sick and was rooting for him. This theme has a strong resonance with today's standard of living. Look whose running the country! And isn't it ironic that Ferris Beuller's Day Off uses George H. W. Bush as a reference when the boring teacher played by the conservative, Ben Stein something o-o economics. Voodoo economics. Well I guess you could say that John Hughes is a true visionary. Every plot and detail has a purpose. That I applaud him for. As for the spoiled kids, I could care less.

The film is about a new kid, Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new town where he knows nobody. He follows Benny to the Sandlot, looking to fit in, of course his hopes of fitting in are quickly shattered after an embarrassing attempt to throw the ball back to the infield.However despite the team's disliking of Scotty, Benny decides to convince Scotty to come back and be apart of the team since they are a player short of having a complete team. The result, Scotty becomes more liked by the team as Benny helps him learn how to play.The rest of the film is entertainment and fun from Squints infamous drowning act to the boys first experience with Chewing Tobacco to the final showdown with The Beast.The side story of the beast is good, a very interesting way of showing why the boys cannot retrieve their baseballs after each is hit into Mr.Mertle's yard. Its something that most kids face, hitting their baseballs into someone else's yard, hearing bad stories about the person that lives in that house and fearing that person. But as Mr.Mertle says in the movie Why didn't you just knock on the door? I'da gotten it for ya. Which shows that not all people won't be mean and release the beast on you, some could be a jolly fun spirited person like Mr.Mertle.Oh, and you gotta have that other team that thinks they are better than your team. A showdown of a real team and the Sandlot kids ensues at one point in the movie, just to prove that the Sandlot kids can kick butt even if they are not a real team.The movie was well done, very enjoyable for people of all ages. There should never have been a sequel however fans of this movie are let down. I'd recommend watching this one only and pretend the sequel does not exist cause the sequel is pretty much a remake of this one.

Joe's Apartment runs out of ideas before the halfway point. The Character Joe rents out an apartment, occupied by acres of cockroaches, who sing and dance and give Joe unwanted company. OK, we get it already.So how does a film revolving around annoying little roaches extend to 90 minutes? By adding in that predictable subplot involving the hard-to-get love interest for Joe of course, who the viewers automatically know will end up together by the end of the movie. Haven't we seen this predictable boy-gets-girl plot in countless other films? Well, not with singing and dancing roaches. I'll give it that.Joe somewhat befriends the roaches, even they are annoying and give him grief. Consider a scene where Joe brings a date to his apartment. The roaches hide, and the date suspects nothing. Soon after, when things look as if they're going well for Joe, the roaches fall out of the chandelier and fall all over Joe's date. Soon after, roaches everywhere, terrifying the girl. Joe tells her it's OK, but what woman is going to listen to that? So what does Joe do? He may start off as mad, but he always forgives them. This angers me. These are vindictive, controlling, and annoying roaches who, if I was occupied with them, would drive me to a point to get my apartment exterminated. These roaches cause Joe nothing but grief, and torture, and they invade his privacy; yet the film is supposed to make us laugh.When the film reaches its inevitable conclusion, I was so annoyed and disgusted by this time that I couldn't feel any of the euphoria the film was trying to feed its viewers. It didn't work.The film was made my MTV studios and it looks like it should have been a made-for-TV film specifically for MTV.

It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare from end to beginning, to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along.

A fresh towel laid out on a car seat lets blood stain it with ferocious osmotic quality as though the towel was covering a fresh wound! But the blood is several hours old.

When you realize what they have done you do not hate the Coens but you begin to admire their ingenuity--their scripts reduce the Greek heroes to mortal escaped prisoners or simple anti-heroes.In Blood Simple, blood that suddenly oozes from a nostril lets the viewer know more than the characters in the film. The comedy of errors that weave the film, invites the viewer to laugh at the dumb actions of each character.

After watching Apocalypse Now! Redux twice, I don't think the film earns any of those titles. But Francis Ford Coppola, the man behind one of our time's greatest movie-masterpieces The Godfather (1972), has made a film about the Vietnam-war that's a pretty unique movie-experience. This is a must for everyone who like artistic cinema.Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is a national hero with a career in the army which is full of merits of bravery and honour. But now he has gone insane, and has escaped from the army and into the jungle of Vietnam, where he is living as a king among an army of his own. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is being given the mission of finding Kurtz and terminate him. Together with some young unexperienced soldiers, he starts the search. In a boat, through a river, the journey goes deep into the jungle. A slow journey into the insanity and madness of the war...a journey to hell on earth.Now, can this film really be called a war-movie? The reason I ask this question, is because I feel that this film has its focus on the people in the war, and their experiences and reflections, rather than the war itself. This is not about people fighting in the war, but a story that takes place in Vietnam DURING the war. But this is probably just one of many questions that Coppola wanted people to ask themselves after a weird, thought-provoking, shocking, tormenting and totally unique film-experience like this.The most notable thing about Apocalypse Now! Redux, and probably the most impelling part is the cinematography...beautiful and perfect. And over all, I think this film has its definite strength in the visual part, but Coppola's directing and contribution to the score should also be mentioned. It all sets a very special mood for the film, and provides a unique movie-experience that it's hard to not be impressed by. I'm also convinced that this is the most artistic war-movie ever made...it even tops Terrence Mavelick's poetic The Thin Red Line (1998) when it comes to artistic expressions, in my opinion. So if you like challenging films with depth, I think you should see this film, no matter what you've read or heard about it.Apocalypse Now! Redux has also a solid cast. Martin Sheen is doing very well in the exacting leading role as Captain Benjamin Willard. Actors such as Dennis Hopper, Frederic Forrest and Marlon Brando is also giving good performances in a film with characters that seems to have a total lack of normal persons. A young Lawrence Fishburne also shows up and gives a approved performance as Tyrone Miller. But the most memorable performance of the film is being delivered by Robert Duvall. His character Lt. Bill Kilgore is among the most famous in film-history, and the way Duvall portrays him is pure brilliance.I haven't seen the original Apocolypse Now! from 1979 with the running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, but I feel that the running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes is the weakness of Apocalypse Now! Redux. I know long-time admirers of Apocalypse Now! (1979) has embraced the added scenes in the Redux-version, but I personally found the film a bit long-winded when it approached 3 hours. I think the scenes where Cpt. Willard and his companions visit a French plantation in the middle of the jungle, is the film's lowest point, and there's also some other scenes that lacks consistency, and that's not strengthening the film.With Apocalypse Now! Redux, Francis Ford Coppola has made a spectacular piece of cinema. Visually, it is perfect and over all this is a film that all film-enthusiasts should experience at least once. But I think the average movie-viewer should go for the original version from 1979. This is a very good film, but not exactly a Top-Rated masterpiece, in my opinion.

Stanley Kubrick was without doubt a great director, but he was almost never emotionally connected with his characters- actually he practically didn't care about them- which resulted in a cold mood throughout his stories. His philosophy was &#132;This happens because it's interesting , but in other films ( &#132;La Strada, &#132;Being There, &#132;The Graduate, &#132;Kareshi Kanojo no Jijyou) the philosophy was &#132;This happens because it's magic.&#132;2001 is an unique experiment. Actually, it's almost something Jean-Luc Godard would have loved to make. It's stripped of any kind of action, suspense, emotion, humor or story, and the only thing it has is style. But what a great style it has. The first half an hour has no dialog and shows prehistoric apes who learned to use bones as tools\/weapons after an encounter with an mysterious monolith. By using tools, their intelligence progressed and eventually evolved them into humans. In 2001 Astronauts started a mission to find that Monolith near Jupiter.-------------The Monolith is a symbol of the highest ideal, inspiration for humans, but it's limits are always beyond reach. It influenced the human mentality, but after the invention of tools it moved, disappeared from Earth. And after the astronaut Bowman made contact with him, the Monolith reacted by putting him in a ( time? ) portal ( showed by an amazing visual style, especially memorable in the &#132;slide show of lights ) and transporting him into a &#132;human zoo, a normal, Earth looking room where he made himself comfortable. When Bowman became old, the Monolith transformed him into an ever higher being, maybe his own, and brought him back to Earth where the next step of evolution could start. Did the Monolith have pity with him? It would have been very interesting to hear some sort of conversation between Bowman and him, but that didn't happen. Also, unfortunately, Bowman had almost no character development. He was the main character and Kubrick took more interest of the HAL computer than him, but that's not important. &#132;2001 is a fantastic film, but it's not flawless. It takes a great deal of concentration to watch it, and sometimes its just simply- dare I say it?-pretentious and boring. Such a big story about human progress could have been more entertaining, but it's still a big story.

I have never read the book so my review is solely based upon the film. And unfortunately I must report that the film is terrible. Perhaps lovers of the book will tell me that transferring it to the screen was a staggeringly difficult task, and that director David Lynch should be applauded for at least attempting it. But in truth, if you come to this film with little or no knowledge of the source material, you will be left confused and frustrated by what is on offer. Sorry, but any film-maker intent on bringing a long and complex cult book to the screen should at least try to make the film accessible to all viewers. Peter Jackson did it a couple of decades later with his Lord Of The Rings films; here, Lynch simply alienates members of the audience who are NOT disciples of the book. His screenplay is muddled and very confusingly structured, and as a director he fails to coax decent performances from most of his astonishing cast.Dune is a nickname given to the planet Arrakis, a sand-covered wilderness which is the only planet in the universe where a priceless spice can be found. The spice, when harvested, enables people to travel through space and time. The planet is guarded by gigantic worm-like monsters which burrow through the sand and devour everything in their path. At the start of the story, the year is 10,191 and the universe is under the control of Emperor Shaddam IV (Jose Ferrer). Another royal family, the Atreides clan (father Leto, mother Jessica and son Paul - played respectively by Jurgen Prochnow, Francesca Annis and Kyle MacLachlan), travel to Arrakis where they learn they have been lured into a trap by their enemies. Paul and Jessica escape into the desert where they discover a huge tribe of native warriors living in the caves. The warriors believe in a long-foretold prophecy that one day a messiah will come and lead them to power.... and young Paul turns out to be that very man.The plot in synopsis-form sounds imaginative and pretty serviceable, but Lynch gets bogged down in the impossible task of setting into motion various story threads that will brings the parts together. An abundance of characters are thrust into the mix - many of them played by very fine actors - but few are introduced meaningfully. The dialogue is riddled with baffling references (presumably, if you've read the book you'll get the references) which rapidly lose the viewer. Furthermore, there is evidence that Lynch realised somewhere along the line how incoherent his story was, as many of the characters provide whispered voice-overs to convey their thoughts. While these voice-overs help - slightly! - with the audience's comprehension of what the hell is going on, it seems a clumsy and unwieldy device, probably added belatedly when the film's makers finally acknowledged what a muddled film they'd made. Some of the special effects are quite innovative, and (in isolation) certain sequences are spectacular and highly imaginative, but when viewed as a whole Dune is an utter mess of a movie.... and truly deserves its label as one of cinema's most heavily-criticised debacles.

Thorton decides to return to his birthplace in Ireland, where he hopes to live in anonymity in the house where he was born.Within minutes of arriving, he meets Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) and her brother, William Dahaher (Victor McLaglen). Mary Kate is the local spitfire, the kind of woman who drives both men and women away from her with her sharp tongue. Will Danaher is also interested in Thorton's birth home, as well as in the widow who currently owns it. However, Thorton wins out in the bid for the home, and Danaher takes his revenge on Thorton by forbidding him from courting Mary Kate (he later changes his mind when the local matchmaker assures him that the widow will accept Will's marriage proposal as soon as Will moves Mary Kate out of his house). After establishing the tragic circumstances under which Thorton returns to Ireland, and allowing the audience to share in Mary Kate's frustration at being denied a husband by her brother, the movie seems to be trying to evolve into a comedy. After a very brief courting period, during which Thorton and Mary Kate show their shared rebellious streaks by escaping their chaperon, our hero and heroine are married. However, Will, having now realized the trick played by the matchmaker, refuses to give the couple Mary Kate's dowry. Thorton, who is determined not to confront anyone and provoke a fight, takes the position that the dowry is not important, but Mary Kate wants what rightfully belongs to her. When Thorton refuses to fight for her, she decides to leave him. Rather than see his wife's point of view, Thorton decides to assert himself by throwing Mary Kate around like a sack of potatoes, first around their bedroom, then around the Irish countryside.

The film contains some genuinely funny moments, but suffers from the need to have Drew Barrymore play a woman who ages twenty years over the course of the story; she seems, inevitably, too womanly as a girl and too young as a late-thirty-something. More fundamentally, the film appears to have two slightly contradictory purposes. On one hand, it looks at how a parent might find themselves sacrificing their own happiness for their children's, or feeling justly guilty if they do not. However much you love your children, such stresses are a natural (and arguably neglected) aspect of parenthood, and if you're a single parent, then they're likely to be greater than if you have a better support network. This certainly makes for a more interesting theme than the vacuous I love you, kids attitude that permeates Hollywood movies whenever they want to show us that their hero\/heroine has a heart of gold. The other idea is also not bad more comic, it's based on the awfulness of growing up with a self-obsessed drama queen for a mother. But combining both ideas is difficult, as to play up the second de-legitimises the first, and this movie lacks the subtlety to make the combination work. The film is also weakened by the way it presents the child in question in a wholly favourable light; it even displays a more forgiving attitude to the utterly useless father than it does to Drew's character, as if his hopelessness properly transfers full responsibility onto the mother. Perhaps it was a mistake to wrap the story of the mother through the narration of the perfect son, a move that tells the audience what to think a little more clearly than necessary, and the heartwarming ending adds nothing to the story.

The film contains some genuinely funny moments, but suffers from the need to have Drew Barrymore play a woman who ages twenty years over the course of the story; she seems, inevitably, too womanly as a girl and too young as a late-thirty-something. More fundamentally, the film appears to have two slightly contradictory purposes. On one hand, it looks at how a parent might find themselves sacrificing their own happiness for their children's, or feeling justly guilty if they do not. However much you love your children, such stresses are a natural (and arguably neglected) aspect of parenthood, and if you're a single parent, then they're likely to be greater than if you have a better support network. This certainly makes for a more interesting theme than the vacuous I love you, kids attitude that permeates Hollywood movies whenever they want to show us that their hero\/heroine has a heart of gold. The other idea is also not bad more comic, it's based on the awfulness of growing up with a self-obsessed drama queen for a mother. But combining both ideas is difficult, as to play up the second de-legitimises the first, and this movie lacks the subtlety to make the combination work. The film is also weakened by the way it presents the child in question in a wholly favourable light; it even displays a more forgiving attitude to the utterly useless father than it does to Drew's character, as if his hopelessness properly transfers full responsibility onto the mother. Perhaps it was a mistake to wrap the story of the mother through the narration of the perfect son, a move that tells the audience what to think a little more clearly than necessary, and the heartwarming ending adds nothing to the story.

But it is also a complex fantasy that works very strongly as an adventure. It is a dream Dorothy Gale has; she is a twelve-year-old girl in Kansas, being raised by her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, poor chicken farmers. There are three kindly workmen also, but her dog Toto is being sought by mean Miss Alma Gulch, who has been bitten by the little terrier. Unable to get anyone to help, Dorothy runs away just as a tornado is coming. She meets kindly Professor Marvel who gazes into a crystal ball and advises her to go home. She does so but as she arrives, the family is in the cyclone cellar; hit by a shutter, Dorothy is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she is dreaming, and the house has been carried off by the tornado. Objects whirl by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle from whose basket Toto escaped earlier; only she turns into a witch on a broomstick. But the house lands safely; and a strange land greets her eyes; female voices sing, garish-hued flowers sprout, and amid ponds there is a yellow brick road and a central plaza. A rainbow-colored bubble approaches; from it steps Glinda, Good Witch of the North. Dorothy finds out her house has killed the Wicked Witch of the Munchkins' land. She has to admit she is no sort of witch; but she becomes the little people's heroine for her deed anyhow. Then out of smoke the Wicked Witch of the West, the other witch's sister, appears and threatens Dorothy. Glinda transfers the dead witch's ruby slippers to Dorothy, warning her to keep them on always. Wanting to get home, Dorothy is advised to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the Wizard can perhaps help. Along her way, as she goes on with Toto, she picks up three companions--a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and a Cowardly Lion. They all need help too--one lacks a brain, the second a heart, the third courage; so they accompany her, hoping to get help also. The Wicked Witch writes, Surrender Dorothy on the sky after trying to steal the slippers when poppy fumes fell the quartet; Glinda wakes them by causing a snowstorm whose chill revives the quartet. In the Emerald City, they gain admittance to the palace. The Wizard, a great talking head, knows why they've come and demands they fulfill a mission first--fetch the Wicked Witch's broomstick from her mountaintop castle. With no choice, the quartet heads for Winkieland and their battle. Flying monkeys kidnap Dorothy and Toto; the others follow to rescue her. The Witch demands the slippers for Toto's life. She tries to remove them from Dorothy's feet and is nearly electrocuted. As an hourglass measures Dorothy's life expectancy in red, Toto escapes. He finds the others, who penetrate the castle and rescue Dorothy. They are recaptured. The Witch starts to execute them, setting fire to the Scarecrow. Dorothy throws a bucket of water on him, splashing the Witch, and she melts to nothing. The people there rejoice that they are free of her. Back at the Palace, Dorothy requests their reward. The Wizard balks. Then Toto pulls aside a drape about a booth, revealing a little man frantically working dials and levers--the Wizard. he admits, I'm a very nice person, but a very bad wizard. He is able to point out to the three companions that they've already got what they were after; their rescue of Dorothy has proved that. He gives them symbolic gifts. Dorothy wants to go home. He offers to take her there in a balloon--that's how he got to Oz. Leaving the Scarecrow and the others in charge, he takes his balloon up. Toto jumps from the gondola, and Dorothy, running after him, is also left behind. But Glinda arrives and tells her the ruby slippers can help--all she ever had to do was want to go home more than anything. Dorothy follows her instructions and finds herself back at home, lying in bed with her Aunt and Uncle tending her and the farmhands looking on anxiously. She tells them about her dream and says, There's no place like home!; the film fades out on her radiant face. The Kansas portions of the film, were in sepia tone; Oz was always vivid technicolor.This film as fine special effects and vivid production values. Cinematography by Harold Rosson and the production design by Malcolm Brown contributed to its strength. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf along with author L.

Judy Garland had to play a twelve-year-old girl; camouflage was required. Jack Haley was not the first choice for the Woodman, nor several other principals for their roles.

I don't know what took me so long.This is the story of Father Greg Pilkington, an idealistic young priest appalled by the liberal-thinking, older priest he shares a congregation with. Clashes and airs of superiority from Father Greg set up, almost calculatedly, his crushing and inevitable fall from grace. Try as he might, Father Greg, pious and as intolerant as ever, cannot suppress his sexuality and takes to the gay bar scene. A casual pick up turns into an affair which in turn becomes a personal and professional disaster as an equally intolerant society pushes him towards wrongful arrest and a verdict of guilty. Father Greg becomes the object of derision and hatred by the bigoted, close minded community, itself a reflection of all the young priest exhibited in but a show of intolerance and sanctimoniousness.The real heart of this picture occurs in the confessional when a desperate young girl tells of ongoing sexual abuse at the hands of her father. Eventually, this information becomes a test of faith for Father Greg as he questions his spirituality, the laws of the church and God himself.During all of this the older priest, Father Matthew, preaches of the trappings of power that the Church has saddled itself with - and how the trappings have gotten in the way of the message of God, of love, of tolerance, of patience and compassion. As might be expected, the Church's higher ups have little patience for this sort of talk - and the congregation itself shuns Father Greg turning mass into an explosive show of blind eyed fanaticism.As Father Greg, Linus Roche gives a searing, searching performance as the young tormented priest. His fall and redemption, the center of the story, comes across with an earnestness that steers clear of sensationalism, despite the loaded message of the movie. Tom Wilkinson, as ever, gives a performance that is as natural and believable - and likable - as anything he's done before or since. (Side note having waited so long to watch this it's interesting to see these two actors with important roles in this year's new and glorious Batman Begins.) A truly remarkable and emotional film.
