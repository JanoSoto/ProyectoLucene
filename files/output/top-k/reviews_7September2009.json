The five sisters become four after the youngest ones suicide, which is the start of the end of the family. This film has a lot going for it and Coppola, in her debut, does an impressive job juggling the various themes running throughout the movie. We have teenage suicide, obsession, sexual awakening and all of it is look at with a very skeptical eye and in the end the film comes off rather haunting if not a complete work of art. What Coppola does well is the entire mystery built around the suicides in the film. A lot of information is given out yet no answers are even attempted. Even when the boys are trying to come to terms with what happened, nothing. We get no answers and not many ideas as to what was going on with these girls that would push them so far over the edge. Their parents, perfectly played by James Woods and Kathleen Turner, are faceless monsters but not in a bad way but in a way that any kid would see their parents as villains. We have Kirsten Dunst giving one of her finest performances as the sexually advanced 14-year-old who ruins a fun night out for her sisters when she runs off with the town hunk (Josh Hartnett) instead of returning home on time. Even the parents are surrounded in mystery as is the Hartnett character who walks away from the girl he loved the most after having sex with her for the first time. While the film asks a lot of questions, at the same time I think it bites off more than it could chew because at times the film itself doesn't really know what it's trying to say. Perhaps that's a point and another reason for not answering any of the questions in that suicide itself is just a mysterious item that one can't get answers from the victim. It happens and no one really knows why except for the person it happens to and they aren't talking. The fine performances, great cinematography and overall great tone makes this a must see, although I'm not sure if one viewing will capture everything that's here.

This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay, I'll cede Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave America to go to Romania.

Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. And in mine, I can't help but feel this movie is a bit overrated.Let me start by saying I like movies in this sub-genre. As an ex-drug abuser myself, I find solace in watching fictional characters struggle with an affliction that was once part of my own life, and there's a sort of therapy involved there that seems to make one feel as if someone, even a fictional someone, at least understands the pain an addict goes through. I also just plain like raw, dark, and gritty movies. I'm not a Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music kind of guy, and any movie that sheds light on the seedy underbelly of society is okay in my book. Sure, the message is often bleak and depressing, but at least it's not contributing to the lie that mainstream movies try to sell, where everything is cute, life is wonderful, the bad guys always get punished, and any conflict is wrapped up with a nice little bow in the end.With that being said, I went into Trainspotting fully prepared to feast on the dark nature of the film and find myself immersed in a cast of characters that I could relate to. But I was sadly disappointed. Things started off well enough I loved Ewan McGregor's opening monologue, describing the pointless, cliché choices we as civilized humans tend to make in regards to our lives...as if we're all just drones, doing whatever society tells us we should do. I know that I can personally relate to feeling like this at many points in my life. But sadly, it was all downhill from there.If I had to point out any one, main problem with the movie, it was my lack of attachment to any of the central characters. I felt unable to sympathize, or ever really care what happened to any of them. And in a movie like this, such a thing is critical. The cast was all fine and dandy, so it was nothing to do with that, but I just felt...detached. I think it might have had something to do with the fact that from the moment we are introduced to these characters, they're all already drug addicts. Part of the impact of these sort of films, for me anyway, is being able to witness the fall from grace...to see a good life gutted and destroyed by drug abuse. But as it stands, we never get a glimpse of what life was like -before- these characters were all on drugs, and to me that leaves a bit of a void.And for however dark one may think the film is, I personally didn't find it all that bleak. Requiem for a Dream (my personal favorite movie about drug addiction of all time) makes this look somewhat childish in comparison. That's not to say that there aren't dark moments in the film, because there are, and when they do it hit, they leave an impact. But overall, I felt more emphasis was placed on the weirdness of the characters, and some of them were a little too much for me to handle.The film is surprisingly void of any intense drama, which I sort of expected considering the subject matter. I realize this was probably intentional and done to avoid being cliche, but I could have done with a little more intensity and drama.This bland feeling overpowered me through most of the movie, and I found myself checking the running time to see how much time had elapsed, which is usually always a bad sign while watching any movie. I have to say the film did redeem itself in the end, and probably made me add another star to it than I normally would have. I really liked the outcome of the story, which makes it a shame that both the beginning and end caps of the film were filled with what was in between.I realize I'm going against the grain here with this review, but I see no point in hailing this as some sort of modern masterpiece when personally I don't see it myself. Maybe I just have bad taste, but I feel it pays to be honest in these matters, and I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and call this a fantastic movie when I don't really believe it is. Something about it felt empty to me, and it wasn't nearly as impacting as I had hoped it would be. It's no Requiem for a Dream, that's for sure.

I think it might have had something to do with the fact that from the moment we are introduced to these characters, they're all already drug addicts. Part of the impact of these sort of films, for me anyway, is being able to witness the fall from grace...to see a good life gutted and destroyed by drug abuse. But as it stands, we never get a glimpse of what life was like -before- these characters were all on drugs, and to me that leaves a bit of a void.And for however dark one may think the film is, I personally didn't find it all that bleak. Requiem for a Dream (my personal favorite movie about drug addiction of all time) makes this look somewhat childish in comparison. That's not to say that there aren't dark moments in the film, because there are, and when they do it hit, they leave an impact. But overall, I felt more emphasis was placed on the weirdness of the characters, and some of them were a little too much for me to handle.The film is surprisingly void of any intense drama, which I sort of expected considering the subject matter. I realize this was probably intentional and done to avoid being cliche, but I could have done with a little more intensity and drama.This bland feeling overpowered me through most of the movie, and I found myself checking the running time to see how much time had elapsed, which is usually always a bad sign while watching any movie. I have to say the film did redeem itself in the end, and probably made me add another star to it than I normally would have. I really liked the outcome of the story, which makes it a shame that both the beginning and end caps of the film were filled with what was in between.I realize I'm going against the grain here with this review, but I see no point in hailing this as some sort of modern masterpiece when personally I don't see it myself. Maybe I just have bad taste, but I feel it pays to be honest in these matters, and I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and call this a fantastic movie when I don't really believe it is. Something about it felt empty to me, and it wasn't nearly as impacting as I had hoped it would be. It's no Requiem for a Dream, that's for sure. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"7 September 2009","score":"19 out of 27 people found the following review useful","review":" Judging by the high rating the other users of this site have bestowed on this film, I guess some people might say I'm off my rocker to rate it a mere 6, but hey...what can I say? Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. And in mine, I can't help but feel this movie is a bit overrated.Let me start by saying I like movies in this sub-genre. As an ex-drug abuser myself, I find solace in watching fictional characters struggle with an affliction that was once part of my own life, and there's a sort of therapy involved there that seems to make one feel as if someone, even a fictional someone, at least understands the pain an addict goes through. I also just plain like raw, dark, and gritty movies. I'm not a Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music kind of guy, and any movie that sheds light on the seedy underbelly of society is okay in my book. Sure, the message is often bleak and depressing, but at least it's not contributing to the lie that mainstream movies try to sell, where everything is cute, life is wonderful, the bad guys always get punished, and any conflict is wrapped up with a nice little bow in the end.With that being said, I went into Trainspotting fully prepared to feast on the dark nature of the film and find myself immersed in a cast of characters that I could relate to. But I was sadly disappointed. Things started off well enough I loved Ewan McGregor's opening monologue, describing the pointless, cliché choices we as civilized humans tend to make in regards to our lives...as if we're all just drones, doing whatever society tells us we should do. I know that I can personally relate to feeling like this at many points in my life. But sadly, it was all downhill from there.If I had to point out any one, main problem with the movie, it was my lack of attachment to any of the central characters. I felt unable to sympathize, or ever really care what happened to any of them. And in a movie like this, such a thing is critical. The cast was all fine and dandy, so it was nothing to do with that, but I just felt...detached. I think it might have had something to do with the fact that from the moment we are introduced to these characters, they're all already drug addicts.

TETSUO is a film I have wanted to see for quiet some time & heard nothing but many good things about it, when I was finally able to secure a copy to watch, in the end I didn't know quite how I felt about it, but perhaps out of all my mixed emotions over the film I was left feeling somewhat disappointed, after all the hype I was expecting something so much better than what I got, the plot sounded really weird & interesting which is one of the many reasons I sought both it & it's sequel out. First I'll start off about what I liked best about the film, the film has many terrifying moments which like I & many others on this site have stated this is like watching a nightmare unfold before your very eyes, it was almost like someone grabbed a camera & was actually able to get into someones nightmare to film it while they were having the dream, in particular the scenes that stands out as pretty creepy, weird & terrifying is the Japanese girl who chases the lead down the hall as she morphs into half metal being that he can't kill or escape, nor can he hide from, the black & white photography also added to the films weird energy & creepiness & the actors were good, the film also has some good stop motion effects on hand here, in fact this movie could be best described as one of the best horror movies you ever seen crossed with, oh let's say THE TERMINATOR as written by someone who was high up on the strongest street drug available, it's crazy! probably the craziest movie I have ever seen & I do mean that, this movies plot & execution is really off the charts! Now for the reasons I was disappointed with it. First off while I love the stop motion it was used way to much in the film & the film has no story for you to get hooked into, just a guy watching himself morph into a robot creature & many scenes set in fast motion & after viewing so much of the films wild imagery it gets boring after a while & the direction was terrible! while I understand the films cult reputation, the director must understand that a story is important to a film if it's ever going to be entirely successful & not just scene after scenes of weird nightmarish imagery. The film ends with an apocalyptic twist. All in all an interesting concept that is not fully achieved, it's unforgettable yes, but not entirely successful. Full marks for the stop motion, story concept & the nightmarish scene with the half human\/robot girl chasing the lead down a hall, plus the make-up & creature effects that were all done on such an obvious low budget, but rather less for the movie as a whole.

There is not much commentary on the justification of the Vietnam War, only an examination of what war does to the mind. There is a scene where an officer asks Private Joker why he wrote Born to Kill on his helmet if he wears a peace sign on his shirt. Joker replies I don't know. It has something to do with the duality of man, or something to that effect. The whole movie is about the duality of man; everybody wants there to be peace, but when an authority figure tells us to kill, it becomes natural. For this, Full Metal Jacket is a thought provoking experience.The first forty minutes of Full Metal Jacket follows a group of Marine trainees on Paris Island who want to serve in Vietnam. We meet our main character, Private Joker, but the first act is dominated by two performers, R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and Private Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed Gomer Pyle, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Hartman is the toughest Drill Instructor imaginable; he is on his soldier's butts about something all the time. Pyle, however, is a natural screw-up, it is hard to imagine how he even made it to Paris Island, and Hartman is always the harshest with him, because he has been trained to believe that the louder you bark at a soldier the sooner they will shape up. Instead, it has the opposite effect on Pyle; he becomes mentally disturbed during his training, probably because he was never mentally fit to be a soldier in the first place. This segment typically receives the most praise; it is certainly easier to enjoy, because it progresses toward a natural conclusion, graduation day. Ermey also gives the best performance in the film, mainly because it was not a performance, as Ermey was a real Gunnery Sergeant. Almost all of his lines were ad-libbed. Sgt. Hartman is one of the most memorable characters in all of Kubrick's films.The rest of the movie does not really flow toward a natural ending; it just follows Private Joker on his daily exploits in Vietnam, and ends rather abruptly, making it harder to enjoy. The film's themes are exemplified in every scene, however. As a journalist, Private Joker has not been disturbed by actual combat, but he meets many others who have, particularly a soldier named Animal Mother. He cannot understand how soldiers can kill with such ease, but but he comes to understand in the final combat experience of the movie.Like all Kubrick movies, there is some good camera work here. I swear when people got shot in this movie I thought I had been shot too, especially during the sniper sequence. The only problem I have with FMJ, besides the disjointed quality of the second half, is that it never really feels like you are in Vietnam. The movie was filmed in England, and even though the sets were great, they still feel like sets. For these reasons, FMJ is the weakest of Kubrick's war movies (excluding Spartacus). It is still an intellectually stimulating experience that should not be missed if you like war films.

The South Africans depicted may have been over the top, but the political upheaval was executed immaculately. In spite of that cultural reference, there's a setback to it as well. I don't understand why did the South Africans killed Riggs' wife and now have targeted his girlfriend. What's up with that? The whole logic was completely null and void and has no logic to it at all. Some editing should have been taken to consideration. It's still an enjoyable film, but the first one stands above them all.

The dialogue is probably realistic at least where the gangster types in the film are concerned, and maybe for that reason alone it is worth a look. I know that the lead cop character comes off like a shake and bake job ready for a rubber room about half a dozen times in the movie, which is a far cry from the same type of character in the film Serpico. Tough is lacking in this portrayal of a cop on the way to juggling candy canes. Long also, at almost two and one half hours. Maybe inspired by the film The Godfather, nowhere near as well done as that film. Maybe I am being too harsh, but I wasn't all that impressed with this movie.

I have heard about it, good things, but just never made it to the rental counter with it. Finally, my wife checked it out of the public library on DVD.What can I say? Most movies I see, I forget them totally, as far as any impact on me, as soon as I leave the theater. This one, days later, (and I keep watching it over and over), haunts me. Everyone raves about Sean Penn, and rightfully so. His performance is seamless. You forget that an actor is portraying Sam, and start to believe differently. The world disappears (your world), and you immerse yourself in Sam's.Michelle Pfeifer blows me away as Rita. I have never had the urge to write an actor\/actress and applaud their work, but I do now. She draws you in. You care about her, her marriage, her relationship (lack of) with her son. She lays on his bed and kisses his head while he is asleep, and you believe it is because Sam has encouraged her to try again. She is a winner in the courtroom, but a loser with people. Her secretary, her husband, her son. She would have lost with Sam, but he is a man on a mission.Sam knows how to be a friend, in his simple way, and he unconsciously teaches Rita the things she didn't learn in Law School.Sam is still a child, but he has a grasp of what it means to love unconditionally. He impacts everyone he meets because of it. That's a fine choice he tells patrons he meets on his job. He hugs a witness during the court session. He affirms Rita. You're my attorney that never loses. Her line that sums it up? I worry that I've gotten more from this relationship than you. To be honest, they become friends, and help each other as best they know how. And it's a win\/win.

The movie is based on a novel that had to be more complex than this movie. The movie ramshots over information about the setting of the picture just to get to the action of Schwarzenegger's character competing in the popular futuristic game show of the day called The Running Man. This gameshow allows convicts the chance to try and escape from what they call stalkers and will give them they freedom if they do so. Schwarzenegger's character is wrongly accused so, of course, we're routing for him. Richard Dawson, plays the host of the show, and actually does a good job in the off-color role but the rest of the movie is just plan bad. This piece of bad entertainment was directed by a former TV star from the Starsky & Hutch show and he shows here that he doesn't have this talent even though other TV stars have successfully changed into this role(aka.

I loved the art direction, and Jonathan Lynn really had faith on this film to achieve what it was. The ending (or endings, did not disappoint).
