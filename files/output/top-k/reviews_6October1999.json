I had no expectations, just hope of seeing a scary film.The opening of the film was not that positive. The dialogues were bad and not remotely interesting, plus the acting of the housekeeper was simply laughable. The other characters were not that convincing either. Thankfully the creepy atmosphere of the house takes over, and both dialogue and acting gradually improves (the actors never truly impress, though). The peak of the film is definitely half way through, and especially the psychological thrills I found very scary. You also get a couple of shocks, but, in my opinion, a thousand shocks cannot replace a well made psychological thrill. Unfortunately the psychological thrills are much too few in this film. Towards the last part of the film, the visual effects completely take over, which is very nice to look at, but not scary at all. So once again, as it happens in several horror\/thriller movies, the ending lacks tension and thrills.Hill House is without a doubt one of the most atmospheric settings I have seen in a long time. Only Bates' motel and house in Psycho and the Overlook Hotel in The Shining come to mind when thinking of more frightening settings. The fact that the house is truly magnificent as the setting just makes it all the more disappointing that it all ends up in a special effects orgy. Impressive as they may be, the effects did not scare me.All in all an entertaining film that could have been even scarier, if they had put some more weight on the psychological thrills. Don't get me wrong, there are several scary scenes in the film, but also several soft spots. So, what is my conclusion? Well, an above average horror flick with the usual cliches, a decent plot, average acting, a couple of good scares and thrills, and, unfortunately, a sh*tload of visual effects. Definitely worth watching, though.I rate it 7\/10.

Every time I knuckle down and actually see this movie again, however, I am struck by how honest and *truly* sweet it is--there is nothing sickening or overly sentimental about it (aside from the dreadful Sixteen Going On Seventeen, which I always fast-forward through on the tape).The acting is wonderful.  Julie Andrews actually seems to allow the audience to read her mind several times during the film, such as in the delightful Edelweiss scene.  Christopher Plummer is also very good as a man who is extremely confident in his old love (for his country) while at the same time being insecure in his growing new one (for Maria).  The children are genuine and endearing without being cutesy, and the serious plot turn, involving the escape from the Nazis, is handled very well. Yes, I know this is not how it happened in real life, but it does play well on screen.  Most (if not all) true story movies take dramatic liberties, and as long as the viewer realizes this fact, everything is fine.In conclusion, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen this movie in a while is to see it again (on video, not TV--the network cuts too much out) and realize how genuine and non-syrupy it actually is.  It is well-filmed, well-acted, and it contains some of the best music Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote (although I will admit I'm not too fond of Rodgers's addition, Something Good).

The town judge, Judge Walter Burns (Burt Reynolds) who is more concerned about the town's dignity than anything else.  And the man who left town to become successful, Charles Danner (Hank Azaria). It's like any other typical American town, sort of like.....Mumford!     Instead of having the town's popular psychtrist being a phony, the claim to fame of Mystery is hockey, and Mystery does take it's hockey very seriously.  Every Saturday morning the entire town gather at a frozen pond to watch the local hockey athletes play.  This is a very big deal to Mystery.  Being on the hockey team is like being a part of the in-crowd. Just ask the local school teacher, Skank Marden (Ron Eldard), who not only plays hockey, but pretty much has intercourse with most of the women in Mystery.  Skank claims that hockey and sex is the only fun things in cold weather.  Mystery is very proud of it's players, they generate so much popularity over the years that successful former Mystery resident Charles Danner, writes a feature article of the Mystery hockey players in Sports Illustrated.      The feature article caught the eye of the National Hockey League, and they suggest to have a game with the Mystery hockey team play the.....New York Rangers!!!!!  This is very big news for Mystery.  The town mayor, Scott Pitcher (Colm Meaney) sees this as a major publicity event that will generate popularity with for the town.  But the Mystery's lawyer, Bailey Pruitt (Maury Chaykin) feels that it's the perfect opprotunity for the hockey team to finally get recognized.  And the town... well, they couldn't be more excited.      MYSTERY, ALASKA is a entertaining little film.  It's the film about the nobody's from nowhere who go up against the giants from metropolis.  And it does have it's moments.  The story is pretty basic, where the local team players have many different stories.  Skank can't seem to stop sleeping with various women, including the mayor's wife (Lolita Davidovich). Birdie Burns (Scott Grimes) is struggling to please his overbearring father, Judge Burns.  And Sheriff John Biebe, has to face almost retirement from age, and has to compete with the very young and very fast, Stevie Weeks (Ryan Northcott). While Stevie has to face what he's going to do with his relationship with, the Judge's daughter Marla Burns (Rachel Wilson).     If MYSTERY, ALASKA came out when it was originally suppose to be released (March 30th), it would have been a bigger hit, and a better film.  I think Hollywood Pictures was scared of THE MATRIX, therefore they decided to delay it.  Well, if it's not one Warner Bros. movie that's going to kill MYSTERY, ALASKA, then it's going to be another, and that movie is THREE KINGS.       Which is a shame, because MYSTERY deserves more business than it's getting.  Granted it is very similar to a typical small town film (i.e. NASHVILLE and MUMFORD), but it does grab one's intrest and it does have some very well done moments. Also, the hockey scenes are very exciting, but personally, I thought that there were too little.      What I thought stood out in the film were the actors and actresses.  Russell Crowe proves that he can carry a film very well, and be a very likable person.  Burt Reynolds is also very good as the strict town judge who also becomes the team's coach.  He shows that he his all hard on the outside, but also does have a soft spot inside of him.  And Maury Chaykin is also great as the town's lawyer, who doesn't protray the typical vicious and money-grubbing lawyer, but pretty much the most sensitive man in town.      There is also good support from Ron Eldard, Colm Meany, Hank Azaria, and Mary McCormack, the latter playing the wife of the sheriff.  But sadly, David E. Kelly can't really write a script for a film.  I'm sure that he's good for television character development, but with a film, it seems like that he's leaving some characteristics of the people out.  I will say this though, this is A LOT better than Kelly's previous screenplay, LAKE PLACID.     And Jay Roach does a decent job of mixing in the seriousness and comedy of the story.  And for those Jay Roach fans, there is a nice cameo surprise in this film.  But it's good for the director of the silly satires of AUSTIN POWERS take a somewhat serious turn.      MYSTERY, ALASKA is a good movie, but with other small town movies out there, it will be a mystery to where it went.

Needless to say, it does not live up to the hype. It is not scary at all unless you're afraid of tree branches and leaves. The characters are annoying as hell. (I couldn't stand Heather's insidious screaming!) By the end of the film I was routing for the Blair Witch to kill her already and give my ear drums a rest. People think this film is so original, but it's not. A film called The Last Broadcast, which finished filming in 1997, is about four filmmakers who trek into the New Jersey Pinelands in search of the Jersey Devil, another local legend.

First came U.S. Marshals, in 1998, which, like The Fugitive, detailed an innocently convicted man tracking down his enemies and starred Tommy Lee Jones. Now there's Double Jeopardy, which contains a plot so close to the other two, its a shame the filmmakers had to go and break tradition with generating this film an R-rating. Neither of the other two films were this coarse, and that's the only thing keeping Double Jeopardy, on its own level of comparison.The movie opens by introducing the happily married couple Nick and Libby Parsons, who seemingly has it all; a wealthy living style, a well-behaved nine year old son named Bobby, a strong matrimony, and even a great big sail boat that Nick recently borrowed for Libby and is ready to purchase for her. In the heat of the decision, the two of them arrange a baby-sitter, long time friend Angie, to watch Bobby for the night while they have the time of their life exploring the waters nearby.Everything looks wonderful from the sailboat. The waters calm and the sky clear. Libby and Nick go under deck when night falls. The two of them relax, make love, and then go to bed. When Libby wakes up hours afterwards, the entire sailboat is covered with blood, showing signs of a struggle. The boat is deserted, with her being the one on board. Where's Nick? What happened?Libby will have plenty time to think about these things when she is accused of murdering her husband with a knife. She is wrongly convicted and sentenced to prison, where she learns that her husband is off living another life with Angie and Bobby, and the two million dollars in insurance money. She then learns of the concept of double jeopardy, from a jail mate. It is the fifteenth amendment on the constitution. The prisoner explains to Libby that the state already said that she killed her husband, so if she gets out of prison, and actually kills him, regardless of how many witnesses or the evidence, she can't be charged twice with the same crime. This is exactly what Libby intends to do.Double Jeopardy has a perfect setup in the structure and story. The first act is pretty solid and confident. The scenes relate to each other and are well constructed.  The external problem is the seemingly murderous act against her husband. The internal problem has to do with her missing son. Proper complications follow the conflict, such as Libby's prison sentence, the discovery of her husbands secret plans, her parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones) and his strict rules which are broken, her escape, all that build up to a rather predictable, but admirable, conclusion.The film runs into trouble in the second act. The story turns from skillful setup to scene after scene of Libby and her parole officer, Lehman, chasing each other. The Fugitive got away with that, and I am not necessarily saying that Double Jeopardy is a total failure in its chase sequences. The scenes are well made and somewhat exciting. But it is a shame to see such a wonderful first act lead to such a conventional story line.The are many good qualities and bad qualities about Bruce Beresford's suspense thriller. The take off in the second act is full of excitement and high energy. The sailboat scene, where Libby awakens to a bloody mess in the middle of the night with her husband missing, is really suspenseful--but there is no momentum build up. The trials in which Libby is charged with are one sided, making perfectly clear that the film is going somewhere unexpected. The scene where Libby learns of her husband's secret life on the phone in prison is a golden moment, as is the slammer atmosphere altogether. There is a nice production design involved with the film as well. But what about the $10,000 Libby spends on clothes as she confronts Nick for the first time in years? That is the question I kept asking myself throughout the third act.The performing talents existing in Double Jeopardy only prove what a shame it is that the characters aren't better understood or developed. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't get to do much here except chase Libby. Not to mention the fact that his character is developed through situations, rumors, dialogue and personality clashes, never being introduced to us appropriately. This is not a major catastrophe, and to some extent, under the circumstances, kind of effective--but his performance is never anything he is capable of producing with a better developed script.Ashley Judd's performance and character is a different story. Her character is entirely realized and empathized with. From her motives to the increasingly dramatic situations she is faced with, all offer profoundness and realism. One big problem, however, is the intelligence  of her character, which seems to vary from scene to scene. For example, in one incident she might be so cleaver and tricky that her keen senses can associate troubles nearby. While in others, she is prone to walk right into an obvious trap. The key in developing profound characters is keeping them profound throughout the entire production,  and the way to do that is consistency.Even if Double Jeopardy wasn't a virtual clone of The Fugitive, however, it would probably have failed still. You see, the movie's individual scenes seem fragmented and scattered.  Like Stigmata, the production has a hard time fitting together in order to make a good overall piece of work. So, no, even if you haven't seen or heard about The Fugitive or U.S. Marshals, this film still isn't worth seeing.

Neither of the other two films were this coarse, and that's the only thing keeping Double Jeopardy, on its own level of comparison.The movie opens by introducing the happily married couple Nick and Libby Parsons, who seemingly has it all; a wealthy living style, a well-behaved nine year old son named Bobby, a strong matrimony, and even a great big sail boat that Nick recently borrowed for Libby and is ready to purchase for her. In the heat of the decision, the two of them arrange a baby-sitter, long time friend Angie, to watch Bobby for the night while they have the time of their life exploring the waters nearby.Everything looks wonderful from the sailboat. The waters calm and the sky clear. Libby and Nick go under deck when night falls. The two of them relax, make love, and then go to bed. When Libby wakes up hours afterwards, the entire sailboat is covered with blood, showing signs of a struggle. The boat is deserted, with her being the one on board. Where's Nick? What happened?Libby will have plenty time to think about these things when she is accused of murdering her husband with a knife. She is wrongly convicted and sentenced to prison, where she learns that her husband is off living another life with Angie and Bobby, and the two million dollars in insurance money. She then learns of the concept of double jeopardy, from a jail mate. It is the fifteenth amendment on the constitution. The prisoner explains to Libby that the state already said that she killed her husband, so if she gets out of prison, and actually kills him, regardless of how many witnesses or the evidence, she can't be charged twice with the same crime. This is exactly what Libby intends to do.Double Jeopardy has a perfect setup in the structure and story. The first act is pretty solid and confident. The scenes relate to each other and are well constructed.  The external problem is the seemingly murderous act against her husband. The internal problem has to do with her missing son. Proper complications follow the conflict, such as Libby's prison sentence, the discovery of her husbands secret plans, her parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones) and his strict rules which are broken, her escape, all that build up to a rather predictable, but admirable, conclusion.The film runs into trouble in the second act. The story turns from skillful setup to scene after scene of Libby and her parole officer, Lehman, chasing each other. The Fugitive got away with that, and I am not necessarily saying that Double Jeopardy is a total failure in its chase sequences. The scenes are well made and somewhat exciting. But it is a shame to see such a wonderful first act lead to such a conventional story line.The are many good qualities and bad qualities about Bruce Beresford's suspense thriller. The take off in the second act is full of excitement and high energy. The sailboat scene, where Libby awakens to a bloody mess in the middle of the night with her husband missing, is really suspenseful--but there is no momentum build up. The trials in which Libby is charged with are one sided, making perfectly clear that the film is going somewhere unexpected. The scene where Libby learns of her husband's secret life on the phone in prison is a golden moment, as is the slammer atmosphere altogether. There is a nice production design involved with the film as well. But what about the $10,000 Libby spends on clothes as she confronts Nick for the first time in years? That is the question I kept asking myself throughout the third act.The performing talents existing in Double Jeopardy only prove what a shame it is that the characters aren't better understood or developed. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't get to do much here except chase Libby. Not to mention the fact that his character is developed through situations, rumors, dialogue and personality clashes, never being introduced to us appropriately. This is not a major catastrophe, and to some extent, under the circumstances, kind of effective--but his performance is never anything he is capable of producing with a better developed script.Ashley Judd's performance and character is a different story. Her character is entirely realized and empathized with. From her motives to the increasingly dramatic situations she is faced with, all offer profoundness and realism. One big problem, however, is the intelligence  of her character, which seems to vary from scene to scene. For example, in one incident she might be so cleaver and tricky that her keen senses can associate troubles nearby. While in others, she is prone to walk right into an obvious trap. The key in developing profound characters is keeping them profound throughout the entire production,  and the way to do that is consistency.Even if Double Jeopardy wasn't a virtual clone of The Fugitive, however, it would probably have failed still. You see, the movie's individual scenes seem fragmented and scattered.  Like Stigmata, the production has a hard time fitting together in order to make a good overall piece of work. So, no, even if you haven't seen or heard about The Fugitive or U.S. Marshals, this film still isn't worth seeing. Sorry--a close call in my case, but no recommendation here.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.

First cut is a reverse angle in the phone booth.   The same thing is repeated for her second interview. There are many long cuts throughout the film where entire scenes are played in one cut.  They're all interesting to watch but this one is really something.· Watch how seamlessly the transition goes from one scene to another as Ray Collins (Gettys) and Ruth Warwick (Emily) come out of Susan's apartment. Kane is shouting, I'll send you to Sing Sing and as the door closes his voice is covered by the sound of a car honking, street noise, a few words are exchanged, they leave, pan up to the number above the door and then there is an almost invisible dissolve to a picture of the same door in a picture in the paper and a news boy shouting Read all about it, shot of Leland as he turns and walks back through a door into a bar, to get drunk.· The opera house opening night.  The story is told from two different points of view.  First Leland's, we see the confusion backstage and a front shot as the shadow of the curtain opens.  Later the same story is told by Susan, same scene from the reverse angle.  In the first one, the camera pans up through the fly system of an enormous theatre until we reach the stage hands holding their noses disapprovingly.  This is actually series of paintings all flawlessly put together in the lab, using several traveling matte shots.· When they go on a picnic in the Everglades.  There is a scene in the tent where Kane's makeup is many years older than the preceding and following scene.· When Susan Alexander leaves him, she walks across a terrace.  The scene is a triple matte shot.  In the background is an ocean\/beach view.  In the middle ground is the terrace. In the foreground for an instant is a screeching parrot.  You can see through the eye of the parrot.· In the scene where Kane destroyed Susan's room after she leaves, Welles cut his left hand pretty badly during the take and had to be taken to the doctor.  When he comes up to the glass ball in close up at the end of the scene, he appears to hide his left hand (because he knows it was bleeding, perhaps.)· The film ends with a long shot on Xanadu.  Black smoke is pouring out the chimney.  This image is in a lot of Welles's films.  See Mr. Arkadin or The Trial.

I think we all have and this common wondering is brilliantly played out in this clever new movie from Australia. I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival and it is my pick as best of the festival this year. Director Philippa 'Pip' Karmel has done a wonderful job with this film. My understanding is that this is her directorial debut though she has been involved in the technical side of film for some time (editor of 'Shine'). She has taken the aforementioned question I wonder what would have happened if... and run with it. Fast-lane journalist Pamela Drury (wonderfully played by Rachel Griffiths) is taken back in her life and is given the 'what if' test to the max. She experiences the life she would have had, had she made a different choice in her past. She experiences the spouse, family, house, children, pets, job, and everything that goes with these, if she had've made that other choice. The experiences she has in this 'new' life are simply slices of real life but they are slapped in our faces with such clarity that we identify deeply with her. It shows how often we pay little attention to those little events in our life, like, say, potty training. Trust me, you need to see it. Also, the director included a popular film technical 'trick' that I've never really liked in the movies; I've always thought it so unreal that it distracted me from the story. But in this film it is done so smoothly, and brilliantly, that it was just wonderful. The audience I was with laughed frequently and heartily during this film. This is a genuine 'feel-good' movie, and I LIKE feeling good after seeing movie. I'll be seeing it again when it hits the theatres. Thank you Pip.
