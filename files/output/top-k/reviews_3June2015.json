Not today.The story to The Seven Year Itch is about a New Yorker Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) ships his wife, Helen (Evelyn Keyes), and their son off to Maine for vacation. Left alone to work back in Manhattan, Richard encounters a gorgeous blonde model (Marilyn Monroe) who has moved into the apartment upstairs, and becomes immediately infatuated. While pondering infidelity, Richard dreams of his beautiful new neighbor - - but will his fantasies about her become a reality?I couple of days ago it just came to me that I haven't seen any movies starring the icon herself Marilyn Monroe. I mean wow how can I go through life without seeing the most ionic actress of all time on the screen showing her brilliance in front of my eyes, but I rather waste my time watching garbage Hollywood movies release today and I know I can skip them and already skipped some movies that I had zone interest in, but for the bad movies from this year will be in my worst movies of 2015 list which is coming out at the end of December, because if your going to make the best list of the year you got to have the worse as well. But anywhere I'm only seeing these classic one by one, because it's all about perfect timing to watch them if I'm in the kind of mood to watching them, but after noticing that I haven't seen any Marilyn Monroe films so I quickly went to watch one of her films and I picked this movie and it was a good pick.Tom Ewell who plays the love himself thinking he can get any women he likes kind of guy and he was a funny character. Tom really played he's character really well as he made his character likability and understandable. He had great line delivers and in a way he's a bit like some men out there that can't get a date and think that every women wants them, and I think a lot of people can relate to that by the character and Tom Ewell great performance.Now let's talk about the great beauty herself, Marilyn Monroe and by the first sentence of Hi, I already liked her. This is my first movie that I've seen starring Monroe and this is a performance worth waiting for because she was so adorable and just unforgettable and as I said before her first ever sentence won me over just like that. Marilyn Monroe gave a brilliant performance that I'm going to check out her other movies pretty soon. Nicely done Marilyn.The chemistry between Monroe and Ewell was spot on perfect. Both of them had great scenes together that made them look like the perfect couple that some people wish for. I think it's something to do with the writing and the actors themselves as they the ones one pulled it off and made it worked, so I give the actors credit for that. The comedy was good, the directing was great and extremely well done, the character's & actors made the chemistry funny and watchable.Now for problems This movie was release in the 50's and yeah I know the 50's can have it's goofy judging by the movie that was release at that time and I'm mostly given for that, but this movie takes it up the walls, I mean these a scene where Tom Ewell character has day dreams of women falling for him and that scene alone took me out a little bit as it was like the movie was trying to push the message into me face saying Look he loves himself and he's kind of lonely, isn't that just sad, or just look at that. I already got the message that this guy is lonely as he talks to himself maybe to the fact that he's been alone for a while, but beside that nick pick I still enjoyed the movie.Overall The Seven Year Itch in my opinion is a good comedy as the acting and character's made the movie want it is.

That crazy monologue (courtesy of the Nightrider) may be the best way of summarizing the action sequences in Mad Max. So, set in a post-apocalyptic version of the lands down unda, Mad Max tells the tragic but extravagant story of a man trying to give the world a last chance by serving a collapsing law system that is overshadowed by the insanity and violence that now rules over the land.As you may have guessed, the word dystopia is a synonym for Australia in this movie and the filmmakers do an amazing job of portraying this with an extremely low budget. They use an excellent idea of only having very few city sets. The hall of justice, the hospital and some apartments and garages are seen throughout the movie but they are very scarce and empty looking. This gives the audience a true feeling of emptiness and insight on the situation that most of society has gone missing. The rest of the film is smartly shot on location. The desolated and flat landscapes of Australia serve as the perfect places to let out all the road rage in ever lasting car chases that could go on and on for days, as the roads seem to always lead to more nothingness. This wasteland is characterized very well with numerous bike gangs roaming it constantly and you can also feel the desperation of the cops who find it extremely difficult to deal with a certain gang lead by someone named Toecutter. Hissssssss. But there is one man that stands strong like a rock against a current. A man who has taken the law into his own hands. Mad Mel. Sorry, Mad Max. That name carries the title of badass like no other. He gets along with his mates, he has a smoking hot wife and a cute kid, he believes in the law and he sports a roaring V8 that can catch on to almost any baddie. He is basically a symbol for the stable world, but we'll talk about all of those crazy theories later.For now let's talk about innovation. The ground base this movie establishes is vast. The post-apunkalypse that we have witnessed in many movies and parodies through the last 4 decades has its source in Mad Max. The costume design and the whole tone of the original make it somewhat of a pioneer.But aside from the style he helped to establish, George Miller surprised his audience (which at the time was fairly small) with a heavy dose of maniacal stunts that had people wandering how in the actual hell had the director convinced the stunt-men to pull off those cringing vehicular tricks! The action in this flick is astounding and the lack of a big budget solidifies the fact that you are a visionary director with a remarkable ability to plan and direct action sequences (just watch Mad Max Fury Road and you'll know what I am talking about). Risk clearly lies behind every shot but that is the only way that passion transcends into the big screen. The editing makes the action even more extravagant by mashing these scenes with perfect pace and adding subtle touches like those weird eyes popping out moments. Those subtle moments of insanity are what make this movie so unique. The antagonist hissing at Max is a weird wut did I just watch instance but that sort of weirdness is what keeps us from shutting our eyes in these sort of films. Aside from all the praise lie a couple of negatives that are understandable because this was George Miller's first feature lenght film. One of them being that Max becomes Mad as the movie is reaching its end. And I don't mean the third act; the real Mad Max gets maximally 15 minutes of screen time. Even the normal Max gets only half of the movie worth of screen time, as the first half mainly tells the story of Goose, Max's friend. Mel Gibson only gets to shine as an actor in a very limited amount of screen time. The rest of the movie he is just staring at nothing like a badass and that is to little for our main man Mel! The pacing is all over the place switching, very confusingly, between some vehicle crashing into a million peaces and a scene of Max's wife getting a long walk along the beach and an even longer tan. As distracting as they might seem, the negatives don't outweigh the positives. George Miller creates a world where sanity and insanity have come to a final confrontation. A world where you can only survive if you adapt to the circumstances and become as crazy as its inhabitants.Mad Max is the product of this world. The product of Toecutter. Stripped from all hope and love, a new Max emerges and adapts to the world as it is. That's why Toecutter is such an iconic character and worthy of an introduction as awesome as the one he gets, he represents madness and the birth of Mad Max. But we will not thank Toecutter for molding such an iconic film persona, as he now lies in the category of roadkill. We will, however, thank George Miller for starting out on such a successful franchise with very low resources but immense passion. This film is a must see for someone looking for the work of a mastermind behind action sequences and scene building mixed in with some maniacal ideas of characters and even some laughs that will come out of its 80's movie cheesiness. And it even made Mel Gibson reveal himself to the world! But before I lose myself talking about Mel Gibson's career, I will finish this review by giving Mad Max an 8 out of 10.

As distracting as they might seem, the negatives don't outweigh the positives. George Miller creates a world where sanity and insanity have come to a final confrontation. A world where you can only survive if you adapt to the circumstances and become as crazy as its inhabitants.Mad Max is the product of this world. The product of Toecutter. Stripped from all hope and love, a new Max emerges and adapts to the world as it is. That's why Toecutter is such an iconic character and worthy of an introduction as awesome as the one he gets, he represents madness and the birth of Mad Max. But we will not thank Toecutter for molding such an iconic film persona, as he now lies in the category of roadkill. We will, however, thank George Miller for starting out on such a successful franchise with very low resources but immense passion. This film is a must see for someone looking for the work of a mastermind behind action sequences and scene building mixed in with some maniacal ideas of characters and even some laughs that will come out of its 80's movie cheesiness. And it even made Mel Gibson reveal himself to the world! But before I lose myself talking about Mel Gibson's career, I will finish this review by giving Mad Max an 8 out of 10.

Look, to conservatives like me, superman being hijacked by the 80s version of hippie, tree hugging, Bambi kissing fruits did not endear the film to us. Yes, the effects were the worst I have ever seen. Beyond bad, but what the hell did the cast think? Had they ever seen a Golan Globus movie?

Some of the Lois and Clark scenes, with the awful actress \/ model named after a great author who must be spinning in his grave, are worth watching. Unlike 3, this could be fixed. First, hire a real effects studio, rewrite the script DE tree huggerize it, fire half the cast including Radium boy, and you could salvage this crap. Superman 3 is beyond repair; all copies of the film should be collected from around the world and launched into space. They should then burn all the negatives. Any surviving cast members, writers and crew should be exiled. Their are a few scenes worth watching and Gene Hackman is always worth the price; I even watched THE QUICK AND THE NO TALENTED BIMBO.

Danny escapes his troubles in the adrenaline-pumping fantasies of the cinema, especially the JACK SLATER film series.The JACK SLATER movies spoof the action franchises popular at the time, like DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON. Jack Slater is the ultimate badass, working for the LAPD but doing things his own way. Chomping on cigars, kicking down doors. Going where other cops wouldn't dare.In the film, the star of the JACK SLATER series is real-world action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is LAST ACTION HERO's biggest meta concept as Schwarzenegger stars as a parody of himself (playing both Arnold and Arnold-as-Jack).With the help of an enchanted ticket given to Nick by the famed escape artist Harry Houdini, Danny is able to enter the world of the newest JACK SLATER movie and help Jack beat the bad guys. It should be a dream come true, but instead of just going along with it, Danny tries to shatter Jack's worldview by proving that he lives in a fictional movie universe, full of improbable explosions, predictable one-liners, and physics-defying stunts. Danny calls out Jack for using well-known Arnold catchphrases like I'll be back and tries to explain the absurdity of Jack's LAPD colleague being an animated anthropomorphic cat (voiced by Danny DeVito). Jack thinks Danny's crazy (obviously), but Danny's uncanny knowledge of secret information (gleaned from watching prior installments of the JACK SLATER series, as well as the opening scenes from this one) gets him assigned as Jack's partner, in true buddy movie fashion.Danny is always completely self-aware about being the comic sidekick in an action movie. He knows Jack Slater's world is governed by plot contrivances and movie clichés. He even calls out the villain for monologuing. Austin O'Brien doesn't do a bad job in the film, but he does start to get on my nerves a little.The fun really starts once the villain (Charles Dance) gets ahold of the magic ticket and enters the real world, a place where heroes can bleed and bad guys can actually win. Jack and Danny track him to the star-studded premiere of JACK SLATER IV, where fictional hero Jack Slater comes face-to-face with Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger (among other fun celebrity cameos).The satire of LAST ACTION HERO is on-point. Besides getting Arnold Schwarzenegger to spoof himself, the movie is directed by John McTiernan, who directed DIE HARD (1988), and the screenplay was co-written by Shane Black, who wrote LETHAL WEAPON (1987). The top-notch pedigree surely helps sell the film's high concept.The script has a lot of potential for the right actor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger seems like he's having a lot of fun with the material. It wouldn't be the same without a real A-list action star playing Jack Slater. Arnold has a good sense of humor about himself and seems to enjoy playing with his image.One of the best in-jokes for serious movie buffs comes early in the film when Danny's English teacher, played by Joan Plowright, introduces a clip from Laurence Olivier's HAMLET (1948), suggesting that the students might know the British acting legend from his late-career role of Zeus in CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) or an older TV commercial for Polaroid. Plowright is, of course, Olivier's widow.In addition to HAMLET, the movie includes nods to Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957), Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA_(1992), and WITNESS (1985) with Harrison Ford. In the movie world Danny warns Jack not to trust his FBI buddy John Practice because he is played by F. Murray Abraham, the guy who killed Mozart (an allusion to AMADEUS (1984)). A Humphrey Bogart-type detective in a trench coat appears in one of the JACK SLATER police station scenes. And since Arnold Schwarzenegger can't exist in the fictional world of Jack Slater, his famous role in the TERMINATOR films is played instead by Sylvester Stallone.The JACK SLATER action is hilariously over-the-top and stylized, satirizing Hollywood action blockbusters and further contrasting the fantasy world of the silver screen with the real world Danny knows. The original story, developed by Zak Penn and Adam Leff, is quite clever and the film, unconventional as it is, succeeds because of its uniqueness.

All of those elements make Some Kind Of Wonderful a great film that is John Hughes at his best.Some Kind Of Wonderful tells the story of Keith(Eric Stolz),a High School teenager who is a gas station employee and painter and has romantic feelings for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson),a popular girl who goes out with her rich boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). With courage by his side Keith asks Amanda out on a date which doesn't sit well with Keith's tomboy best friend Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson)who starts to have feelings for Keith. Now,Keith has to deal with his friendship with Watts and his attraction to Amanda.Released in 1987,Some Kind Of Wonderful is a terrific and memorable Teen movie that was writer John Hughes' final film in the Teen\/High School\/Coming Of Age genre and maybe his most overlooked of the Teen movies he did from 1984 to 87 and is a movie that came out towards the end of the teen movie boom of the 1980s because by 1987 the Teen genre by 1987 and John Hughes' association with the genre had hit it's creative peak. Often seen as a gender reversed remake of earlier Teen classic Pretty In Pink(1986)and some will admit there is similarities between the two films(the same director and writer,love triangle,soundtracks and even the movie posters). At the same time there are minor differences between the two movies. And while Pretty In Pink is a great movie and a more iconic and well-known film I always preferred Some Kind Of Wonderful a movie that may not be very original but is one of the best Teen films of the 80s. Some Kind Of Wonderful is in my opinion not only a John Hughes classic but a Teen classic as well but unfortunately is often underrated and overlooked in comparison to The Breakfast Club,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink and Weird Science which is a shame because SKOW has all of the trademarks of those other filmsmemorable characters,great soundtrack and good dialog where everything just works. While none of the John Hughes regulars such as Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall appear in SKOW the Hughes style is still in effect with this movie. In SKOW we get some romance,drama and a little humor in the way Hughes did so well and the movie keeps your attention. The whole movie is basically a build-up to the last half hour of the film when Keith and Amanda go out on their date and what happens before that examining the relationships of the three main characters Keith,Watts and Amanda who in true John Hughes fashion are three dimensional characters and have depth. With Keith,Watts and Amanda we as a viewer have a connection with all of them as the three of them have to deal with love,relationships and dealing with their peers and classmates. As Hughes did with The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink SKOW deals with timeless themes and issues such as identity,different social groups as well as class struggle with rich vs poor among teenagers. The screenplay by John Hughes is terrific with memorable dialog that is strong,amazing and just makes the characters real and unforgettable. The ending of Some Kind Of Wonderful is amazing and classic John Hughes and is a truly effective and romantic and will viewers cheering at the screen. A fantastic ending.The cast is great. Eric Stolz is excellent as Keith,with Stolz bringing an emotional weight and depth to the role. Mary Stuart Masterson is brilliant,beautiful and gives the film's best performance as Watts,with Masterson being powerful and stealing every scene she's in. Lea Thompson is terrific and beautiful as Amanda,with Thompson being dramatic in the right places. Craig Sheffer is great as Hardy Jenns,Amanda's rich jerk boyfriend. John Ashton is wonderful as Cliff Nelson,Keith's Father. Elias Koteas is fantastic and funny as Duncan,a teenage punk. Maddie Corman(Laura Nelson),Molly Hagan(Shayne),Scott Coffey(Ray)and Lee Garlington(Gym Instructor)give good performances as well.The direction by Howard Deutch is simple,but great and effective,with Deutch sometimes moving the camera and bringing a nice pace and style to the film.

All of those elements make Some Kind Of Wonderful a great film that is John Hughes at his best.Some Kind Of Wonderful tells the story of Keith(Eric Stolz),a High School teenager who is a gas station employee and painter and has romantic feelings for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson),a popular girl who goes out with her rich boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). With courage by his side Keith asks Amanda out on a date which doesn't sit well with Keith's tomboy best friend Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson)who starts to have feelings for Keith. Now,Keith has to deal with his friendship with Watts and his attraction to Amanda.Released in 1987,Some Kind Of Wonderful is a terrific and memorable Teen movie that was writer John Hughes' final film in the Teen\/High School\/Coming Of Age genre and maybe his most overlooked of the Teen movies he did from 1984 to 87 and is a movie that came out towards the end of the teen movie boom of the 1980s because by 1987 the Teen genre by 1987 and John Hughes' association with the genre had hit it's creative peak. Often seen as a gender reversed remake of earlier Teen classic Pretty In Pink(1986)and some will admit there is similarities between the two films(the same director and writer,love triangle,soundtracks and even the movie posters). At the same time there are minor differences between the two movies. And while Pretty In Pink is a great movie and a more iconic and well-known film I always preferred Some Kind Of Wonderful a movie that may not be very original but is one of the best Teen films of the 80s. Some Kind Of Wonderful is in my opinion not only a John Hughes classic but a Teen classic as well but unfortunately is often underrated and overlooked in comparison to The Breakfast Club,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink and Weird Science which is a shame because SKOW has all of the trademarks of those other filmsmemorable characters,great soundtrack and good dialog where everything just works. While none of the John Hughes regulars such as Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall appear in SKOW the Hughes style is still in effect with this movie. In SKOW we get some romance,drama and a little humor in the way Hughes did so well and the movie keeps your attention. The whole movie is basically a build-up to the last half hour of the film when Keith and Amanda go out on their date and what happens before that examining the relationships of the three main characters Keith,Watts and Amanda who in true John Hughes fashion are three dimensional characters and have depth.

Now at least we know his name, Jedediah. And he has a son, Jedediah Jr.! This must be the son he had with the girl from Pappagallo's clan\/tribe in Mad Max 2. She was played by the pretty actress Arkie Whiteley. It's shame she didn't return and all three of them would have been working as a team. I know a lot of fans say this is a whole new character of Bruce Spence, but I want to believe it isn't. All it would have taken would have been one word Partner That would have made the connection so clear and definite to Mad Max 2. On a funny note, Bruce looks like drummer Stuart Copeland from the musical group The Police in this film to me.And one final note, and I'm surprised no one saw this....was that one character from the 1st film, came back in a surprising fashion! I'm talking about the character of Benno Aunt May's mentally challenged protector from Mad Max 1! (in the 1st film he was played by actor Max Fairchild) I at least realized it right away when Max beats Blaster and knocks off his helmet, we see the face of a mentally challenged man-child. When Max looks at him and realizes this Benno from the 1st film, he can't bring himself to kill him. Even Benno\/Blaster recognizes Max now and even smiles at him like he did in the 1st film and the music cue from the 1st film comes on for a brief seconds. That was like a bittersweet moment for me. It was a shame that Auntie's goon Ironbar kills Benno\/Blaster and it ended the the brief reunion Max and memories he may have had at the moment.Everyone else the cast was good. Little Adam Cockburn as Jedediah Jr. was hilarious. Reminded me a lot of a similar little guy with a loud and dirty mouth. The one I'm talking about is from the original Bad News Bears with Walter Matthau. Tina Turner did a good turn as evil Auntie. Her sidekicks Frank Thring as The Collector and Angry Anderson as Ironbar and George Spartels as Blackfinger were memorable. Robert Grubb as Pig Killer was amusing. Especially the scene where Max opens the door with arrow stuck in Grubb's leg! Priceless. Edwin Hodgeman as Dr. Dealgood was right on as he portrayed him as a evil, slimy and devilish game-host way. And last but certainly not least was Helen Buday as Savannah Nix the leader of the Lost Children's Clan. And her 2nd in command Tom Jennings as Slack. Tom reminded me of Blue Lagoon's Christopher Atkins character, Richard. Almost looked the same in appearance.So all in all if you watched the 1st two films , then might as well watched this 3rd one.

It is a redoing of Kafka's THE STRANGER. Ed is not there existentially; he has gone way beyond Luke or Harry the antiheroes of the counterculture in their respective films. Ed's vacancy is so profound; like the stranger things happen to him, even life and death struggles and he experiences nothing. The profundity of the emptiness gives the film such an eerie quality. Yet, when we enter his life can we blame him for running away? How would you like to stand all day listening to Frank drone on his inanities for the entire day? When he comes home, Doris continues the droning. He is consumed with escape; he has left but his body remains. Thornton was always a great actor. Like Russell, in SOLDIER, imagine trying to act with this limited dialogue using only non verbal communication? Thornton pulls it off. I see some people thought that Ed would never have fallen for such a ridiculous scheme that Creighton sells him on.The answer is he is consumed with escape; he has retreated as far as he can, the prospect of great wealth and the final ability to leave his Stygian life. The delusion consumes him. He sets in motion the deadly concatenation of events that will ultimately kill Doris, Big Dave and himself. Thornton conveys his doubts about Creighton; I never got the feeling that he really believed him. He was so sick cutting peoples' hair and listening to Frank drone on eternally. When Doris starts an affair with Big Dave it really is the trigger. Doris is such a cold, cruel angry person that it is impossible to feel the least bit of empathy for her. Attacking the salesman, she never misses the opportunity to be mean to people. Her cruelty to Ed, flirting with Dave and subtly ridiculing Ed right in front of Dave, is why the film did not do well. It also is quite esoteric and odd even for a Coen film. When you add a heroine who is a cruel, heartless, immoral sleaze it is hard for people to care about her.It was all needed philosophically to convey the horrible life Ed has; this is why he has taken such existential flight that even when Big Dave is about to kill him, Ed still is not there. His defensive reaction is depicted as reflexive; the body saves itself automatically without any effort on Ed's part. This is quintessential Kafka. The stranger suffers these events as if he were a spectator in the stands. This is zero affective content to any action that happens to him. Even with Big Dave bleeding out and choking, Ed has no panic nor emotional content. It is the same as any other action. He simply resumes his routine. We see some of the emotional reasons Doris is cruel, cold and shut off. Yet, it is an existential flight so much further than COOL HAND Luke or DIRTY HARRY. These two antiheroes are still in the world interacting with it experiencing it. Ed is a walking corpse. He welcomes death, though, again it is surreal and someone else's experience to him. I must tell you even if all this bores the crap out of you watch the movie for Tony Shalhoub's Freddie Riedenschneider; he steals every scene he is in. His love for himself and his very flexible ethics are drop dead hilarious. Babbling anything, like the Hawthorne Effect, that he thinks will win the case for him. The entire universe has been boiled down to this WHAT WILL WIN THE CASE? He is as empty as Ed is but for this one axion the universe must be manipulated so I can win my case. It is a hidden gem in the Coen library far superior to the ugly, overrated FARGO. It will interest you; you will never see another film like it.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"3 June 2015","score":"","review":" Spoilers AheadWhat is the essence of this movie existential vacancy. It is a redoing of Kafka's THE STRANGER. Ed is not there existentially; he has gone way beyond Luke or Harry the antiheroes of the counterculture in their respective films. Ed's vacancy is so profound; like the stranger things happen to him, even life and death struggles and he experiences nothing. The profundity of the emptiness gives the film such an eerie quality. Yet, when we enter his life can we blame him for running away? How would you like to stand all day listening to Frank drone on his inanities for the entire day? When he comes home, Doris continues the droning. He is consumed with escape; he has left but his body remains. Thornton was always a great actor. Like Russell, in SOLDIER, imagine trying to act with this limited dialogue using only non verbal communication? Thornton pulls it off. I see some people thought that Ed would never have fallen for such a ridiculous scheme that Creighton sells him on.The answer is he is consumed with escape; he has retreated as far as he can, the prospect of great wealth and the final ability to leave his Stygian life. The delusion consumes him. He sets in motion the deadly concatenation of events that will ultimately kill Doris, Big Dave and himself. Thornton conveys his doubts about Creighton; I never got the feeling that he really believed him. He was so sick cutting peoples' hair and listening to Frank drone on eternally. When Doris starts an affair with Big Dave it really is the trigger. Doris is such a cold, cruel angry person that it is impossible to feel the least bit of empathy for her. Attacking the salesman, she never misses the opportunity to be mean to people. Her cruelty to Ed, flirting with Dave and subtly ridiculing Ed right in front of Dave, is why the film did not do well. It also is quite esoteric and odd even for a Coen film. When you add a heroine who is a cruel, heartless, immoral sleaze it is hard for people to care about her.It was all needed philosophically to convey the horrible life Ed has; this is why he has taken such existential flight that even when Big Dave is about to kill him, Ed still is not there. His defensive reaction is depicted as reflexive; the body saves itself automatically without any effort on Ed's part. This is quintessential Kafka. The stranger suffers these events as if he were a spectator in the stands. This is zero affective content to any action that happens to him. Even with Big Dave bleeding out and choking, Ed has no panic nor emotional content. It is the same as any other action. He simply resumes his routine. We see some of the emotional reasons Doris is cruel, cold and shut off. Yet, it is an existential flight so much further than COOL HAND Luke or DIRTY HARRY. These two antiheroes are still in the world interacting with it experiencing it. Ed is a walking corpse. He welcomes death, though, again it is surreal and someone else's experience to him. I must tell you even if all this bores the crap out of you watch the movie for Tony Shalhoub's Freddie Riedenschneider; he steals every scene he is in. His love for himself and his very flexible ethics are drop dead hilarious. Babbling anything, like the Hawthorne Effect, that he thinks will win the case for him. The entire universe has been boiled down to this WHAT WILL WIN THE CASE? He is as empty as Ed is but for this one axion the universe must be manipulated so I can win my case. It is a hidden gem in the Coen library far superior to the ugly, overrated FARGO. It will interest you; you will never see another film like it.

And to see it is thrilling.Of course there's a little more to it than a hasty decision to turn it around. Several factors converge in this extraordinarily tight drama Lester discovers his daughter's friend Angela, a 90s Lolita. He also finds his bland job to be on wobbly ground, and lastly he gets new neighbours, a military family with a strange boy, Ricky. These together create a change in the meek Lester and create a magnificent film.The real question I had after seeing this film was What's wrong with American Beauty? and then I couldn't answer my question. I'll start with the most well- known aspect of the film, its acting. The entire cast is sharp as their respective characters. Led by Kevin Spacey as Lester, original Yes Man (I rule!), you will find something relateable in at least one of the characters, good or bad. Their personalities and actions are entertaining, their motives are all there, and if a character is intended to be likable, you will like them. It's just as a good film should be honest and unforced, but with just an edge to help you in the right direction.I've briefly mentioned how tight American Beauty is. The plot is wonderfully self contained but also organic, it feels very plausible. There's a reason things happened as they did when they did. I can't find any plot holes. Much credit has to be given to the script and writers, and bonus points for being an original idea when so many excellent dramas have Based on in their credits.But more than characters, plot and script, American Beauty is also visually wonderful. While much of it is observed as life is, Lester's fantasies have a brilliantly symbolic and colourful side making them stand out as more than dreams. This leads to the deeper aspects of the film, such as recurring symbols, numerous metaphors (the bag...) and of course the moral.For a film concentrating on failure, I found a very positive message out of the film, and that was to enjoy life and all the beautiful things in it, and to never trap yourself. Like the tag, look closer, find yourself looking past the black and white (into the red?) and see beauty. It all sounds cheesy, but unlike Spacey's later work Pay It Forward, it doesn't come off the screen that way. From a cynic to seizing the day, American Beauty is a dark film with a big smiley face over it that blends until its climax. An engrossing fiction that for many isn't too far from real life, I think this film can speak to people differently as you age, and that power to draw different meanings from different viewings is a sign of a true film. A full film and a fantastic way to close out a millennium. 9.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Few people will be able to completely uproot their lives and begin it again, but that Lester Burnham's journey in American Beauty he wipes his hands clean of his pitifully ordinary life and lives life how he wants with his own goals. And to see it is thrilling.Of course there's a little more to it than a hasty decision to turn it around. Several factors converge in this extraordinarily tight drama Lester discovers his daughter's friend Angela, a 90s Lolita. He also finds his bland job to be on wobbly ground, and lastly he gets new neighbours, a military family with a strange boy, Ricky. These together create a change in the meek Lester and create a magnificent film.The real question I had after seeing this film was What's wrong with American Beauty? and then I couldn't answer my question. I'll start with the most well- known aspect of the film, its acting. The entire cast is sharp as their respective characters. Led by Kevin Spacey as Lester, original Yes Man (I rule!), you will find something relateable in at least one of the characters, good or bad. Their personalities and actions are entertaining, their motives are all there, and if a character is intended to be likable, you will like them. It's just as a good film should be honest and unforced, but with just an edge to help you in the right direction.I've briefly mentioned how tight American Beauty is. The plot is wonderfully self contained but also organic, it feels very plausible. There's a reason things happened as they did when they did. I can't find any plot holes. Much credit has to be given to the script and writers, and bonus points for being an original idea when so many excellent dramas have Based on in their credits.But more than characters, plot and script, American Beauty is also visually wonderful. While much of it is observed as life is, Lester's fantasies have a brilliantly symbolic and colourful side making them stand out as more than dreams. This leads to the deeper aspects of the film, such as recurring symbols, numerous metaphors (the bag...) and of course the moral.For a film concentrating on failure, I found a very positive message out of the film, and that was to enjoy life and all the beautiful things in it, and to never trap yourself. Like the tag, look closer, find yourself looking past the black and white (into the red?) and see beauty. It all sounds cheesy, but unlike Spacey's later work Pay It Forward, it doesn't come off the screen that way.
