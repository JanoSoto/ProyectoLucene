Given the situation regarding this film's production, the film comes across upon reading the pre-production stage as a bit of an accident. Whilst scouting for locations for Reservoir Dogs, director Roger Avary would discover a place where a 'perfect' heist film could take place. Since the whole gimmick (in the nicest possible way) for Reservoir Dogs is that it's a heist film without the heist, the bank couldn't really be used but it suited Avary's other script he had going and that was Killing Zoe.An interesting back-story to a film that is never anything but interesting, apart from perhaps being entertaining at certain points. For Reservoir Dogs to take a mere two years before it itself would become a victim of a pastiche is testament to Reservoir Dog's influential power as well as Avary's own passion and drive behind this production. Notice how the script supposedly took a week to write, also.The film revolves predominantly around a heist going on in a French bank in which master safecracker Zed (Stoltz) is working with an old French buddy who also just happens to be a heroin addict and a psychopathic criminal, amongst other things. He is Eric (Anglade) and is played with ruthless efficiency by the respective French actor. But Killing Zoe is not another routine heist film. Killing Zoe spells out all the tiny, painstaking details that go with robbing a bank and it utilises the conventional 'race against time' drive. Amongst other things, the guys will have to go through each hostage one by one in order to get codes, they will have to pass the time in the main office while other robbers work downstairs on the vault and they will have to deal with any security guards they might miss once entering new bank owned territory.But that's the joy of Killing Zoe. Once it all gets up and running, there is no going back. It is a roller-coaster of violence, disturbance and dark, dark humour that isn't over until it's over. The film is all about stealing and mugging. Zed is the perfect 'fish out of water' an American in Paris; an American in France; an American in Europe. One of the first scenes of the film has a porter stand there and accept a tip that is probably too much; Zed is being 'robbed'. Then there is Zoe (Delpy) herself who charges a thousand Francs for sex but maintains she is no prostitute. In that case, can I have my money back? wise-cracks Zed but if you go by her convincing analysis of what she is, she is right and thus has got herself some money not through stealing but in a slimy working way. Similar to the porter who gets extra cash bringing up bags and Zoe acting as a prostitute for money, Zed and his group of cronies are breaking into banks; breaking into vaults and trying to steal the cash that they probably all think they earn by doing this. With this reading, the film is about greed.Then there are the influences of other work made by Tarantino and Avary round about the time. The sex scene between Zed and Zoe is inter-cut with images from the Nosferatu film echoing the technique used in Natural Born Killers; a film Tarantino wrote but disowned. There is also the establishment of a genuine love affair between a male lead and a prostitute echoing True Romance of the previous year, another Tarantino penned film. So if Zed is established as this lost soul as an American in France, it is because he is mugged out of a thousand Francs from a girl who isn't selling herself; he is never given the time in plain English and is informed by Eric about how wrong foreign people are when it comes to French iconography and tourism. But when push comes to shove and he is placed in his 'zone', Zed performs. This is first followed through when he looks at a map of the bank and comes up with an alternate plan that will save them time as well as possible trouble &#150; he has solved the robbers a problem.Killing Zoe is a film that although is American, does not conform to European stereotypes just archetypes the genre demands. The French are not buffoons, the Englishman played by Gary Kemp is not a total idiot and if anything they are all a match for one another with the Zed, the American, himself sticking out for ridicule thanks to the evidence mentioned in the previous paragraph. Eric is a psychotic criminal into hard drugs and homicide, he would also rather blow someone up than shoot them in the vault. The film is one that does not start off with typical French iconography of whatever you like but stays a ground level, literally. The fast moving cars and sense of travelling kicks the film off perfectly and with a good guy to root for, a love story cleverly thrown in and an awesome bad guy, it is no surprise the film maintains that air of near perfection throughout.

No CGI desert backgrounds here, just the glorious enjoyment of huge Nazi excavation sites to unearth the enchanting but mysterious power that is The Ark Of The Covenant.

Paul Freeman is terrific as Belloq, i think that he plays him with a sinister charm and has some wonderful dialogue 'Your going to give mercenaries a bad name!'

Its success helped New Line Cinema through a particularly lean time in its history, and transformed Freddy Krueger into the most popular horror pin-up since Michael Myers.Wes Craven's original film was an absolute classic of the genre. The Elm Street sequels are a whole different kettle of fish. They reduced Krueger to little more than a wise-cracking pop up effect. None of the sequels came with the eerie atmosphere or disturbing distortions of reality Craven infused the original with. By the time of Elm Street 6, Freddy had been killed off and brought back so many times, the character had lost all credibility.When I learned of another new Elm Street film, it didn't exactly raise my hopes. Not even the return of Wes Craven could turn my head. It just seemed a shallow attempt on New Line's part to milk even more money from the audience, hungry for Freddy!But I should have had more faith. Because Wes Craven's New Nightmare is not just another cut and slash job (Freddy and filmmakers included!), but a startling reinvention of the Elm Street series. Its the only one in the entire franchise that matches up to the original. Thanks in no small part to having Wes Craven back in the directors chair.What shocks from the offset is New Nightmare isn't like any of the others that came before it. In spite of the trailers efforts to mislead us, this is a quite different film from your standard Elm Street saga. New Nightmare, quite ingeniously, takes place in the real world. Where the actors play themselves. And the setting isn't teenage bedrooms and shadowy boilers but film sets and studio lots.A theme that runs through much of Wes Craven's work is the blurring line between reality and illusion. A Nightmare on Elm Street was the perfect aesthetic for that conceit. But New Nightmare takes it to even more incredible heights. It was undoubtedly the film that convinced Kevin Williamson that Wes Craven was the right director to bring the like-minded Scream to the screen.New Line Cinema are making a new Freddy Krueger film. Wes Craven is still doctoring the script. And they want Heather Langenkamp to star in it. For those stalwart Krueger fans, Langenkamp played Nancy in the very first film. She's not so sure she wants to, especially since her fictional life has begun to intrude on her personal one. Heather has a stalker, who calls her up in a Freddy voice. Leaving odd one letter notes in the mail. And she's having nightmares.All real world problems. But when her son Dylan becomes obsessed with the Elm Street series, and her husband dies in an horrific accident, Heather becomes convinced Freddy is alive.

While this first entry to Hammer's ingenious Frankenstein series is not one of my personal favorite Hammer Productions, it were this film and the following Horror Of Dracula which basically redefined British Horror, and represent everything the Hammer Studios stand for. Mad Science and the Resurrection of the dead have always been among my favorite Horror topics, and Hammer's Frankenstein films starring the great Peter Cushing are among the most memorable films in the field. My personal favorite film in Hammer's Frankenstein franchise is still the brilliantly insane Frankenstein Created Woman of 1967, but this first film is also brilliant, and furthermore gets the benefit of originality. Sometimes in cinema, actors are predestined to play a certain role - and this is definitely the case with Peter Cushing here. Nobody else could have played the role of the obsessed Baron Victor Frankenstein as Cushing did. When it was Hammer's Dracula that made Christopher Lee the Horror icon he is, it was The Curse Of Frankenstein and its sequel that rose Peter Cushing to immortal fame.Hammer's Baron Frankenstein is more (insanely) dedicated than the character is in the novel or any previous film, and Cushing is brilliant in the role, which he played six times altogether. While he is not necessarily a villain as such (he does what he does with the strong conviction of doing what's necessary for the benefit of mankind), Victor Frankenstein gets more and more dedicated to his obsession of creating artificial life and resurrecting the dead in this first Frankenstein film from Hammer, and, at a certain point, he is willing to do anything in order to achieve his goals. At first he is still supported by his assistant and former teacher Paul Kempe (Robert Urquhart) who gets more and more frightened by his former student's obsessive behavior...I do not want to give too much of the plot away, but I guess everybody knows what the story of Frankenstein is about. As the story of Dracula, the Frankenstein story got its haunting Hammer-style makeover. From today's point of view the graphic depiction of violence and gore in the film may seem tame, but back in the day the early Hammer Classics Curse Of Frankenstein and Horror Of Dracula were some of the first films to actually show red blood, some gore and explicit violence. Both classics were directed by Terence Fisher, easily the most important Hammer director, and, as usual for hammer, the film is greatly photographed in eerie Gothic locations. Gothic castles, foggy grounds and a constantly gloomy mood - this is what makes a lot of the greatness of the world of Hammer. Peter Cushing truly is one of the greatest Horror icons ever, and Hammer's Frankenstein series probably earned him this deserved reputation more than anything else. The monster, by the way, is played by a fellow Horror icon, with whom Cushing formed the most awesome Horror-duo in a whole lot of films, none other than the great Christopher Lee. Hazel Court is a beauty in the female lead, the only tiny negative aspect is the fact that Robert Urquhart's character of Paul sometimes annoys with his moralistic nagging (also, while he is supposed to be Frankenstein's teacher, Urquhart clearly is years younger than Cushing). That does in no way lessen the greatness of this Hammer Classic, however. All said, The Curse Of Frankenstein is a true British Horror Classic, which every Horror fan must see, and no film buff in general should miss!

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"23 May 2008","score":"10 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" The Curse Of Frankenstein of 1957 truly is essential for every Horror lover to see. While this first entry to Hammer's ingenious Frankenstein series is not one of my personal favorite Hammer Productions, it were this film and the following Horror Of Dracula which basically redefined British Horror, and represent everything the Hammer Studios stand for. Mad Science and the Resurrection of the dead have always been among my favorite Horror topics, and Hammer's Frankenstein films starring the great Peter Cushing are among the most memorable films in the field. My personal favorite film in Hammer's Frankenstein franchise is still the brilliantly insane Frankenstein Created Woman of 1967, but this first film is also brilliant, and furthermore gets the benefit of originality. Sometimes in cinema, actors are predestined to play a certain role - and this is definitely the case with Peter Cushing here. Nobody else could have played the role of the obsessed Baron Victor Frankenstein as Cushing did. When it was Hammer's Dracula that made Christopher Lee the Horror icon he is, it was The Curse Of Frankenstein and its sequel that rose Peter Cushing to immortal fame.Hammer's Baron Frankenstein is more (insanely) dedicated than the character is in the novel or any previous film, and Cushing is brilliant in the role, which he played six times altogether. While he is not necessarily a villain as such (he does what he does with the strong conviction of doing what's necessary for the benefit of mankind), Victor Frankenstein gets more and more dedicated to his obsession of creating artificial life and resurrecting the dead in this first Frankenstein film from Hammer, and, at a certain point, he is willing to do anything in order to achieve his goals. At first he is still supported by his assistant and former teacher Paul Kempe (Robert Urquhart) who gets more and more frightened by his former student's obsessive behavior...I do not want to give too much of the plot away, but I guess everybody knows what the story of Frankenstein is about. As the story of Dracula, the Frankenstein story got its haunting Hammer-style makeover. From today's point of view the graphic depiction of violence and gore in the film may seem tame, but back in the day the early Hammer Classics Curse Of Frankenstein and Horror Of Dracula were some of the first films to actually show red blood, some gore and explicit violence. Both classics were directed by Terence Fisher, easily the most important Hammer director, and, as usual for hammer, the film is greatly photographed in eerie Gothic locations. Gothic castles, foggy grounds and a constantly gloomy mood - this is what makes a lot of the greatness of the world of Hammer. Peter Cushing truly is one of the greatest Horror icons ever, and Hammer's Frankenstein series probably earned him this deserved reputation more than anything else.

The morality founded on our most unjust social institutions, like religion, patriotism, the family, culture briefly, what are called 'the pillars of society'.I mention this, not to alienate people who might find such a statement offensive, but to suggest insight into his point of view. A viewpoint vigorously defended in this anti-bourgeois, rural tale that has a kick like a mule. Buñuel's truths are just as applicable today but, by putting them in 1930s France, he sweetens the bitter pill with a coating of sex, storytelling and the reassuring fiction that 'things have maybe moved on since then.'Célestine impresses us. Intelligent, attractive and sophisticated - but she nevertheless needs to earn her living in service. She takes the train from Paris to work as a chambermaid at a country estate. In this lap of wealth, she deals with a panoply of dodgy people. A brutish handyman. A frigidly overbearing Madame Monteil. Madame's lecherous husband and her kinky father. Remarkably, none of these are portrayed as stereotypes. Characters are well fleshed out as Buñuel pits one against another. Madame Monteil earns our sympathy as she confides sexual shortcomings to the priest, who is in turn well-meaning if hopelessly out of touch. Doddering old Monsieur Rabour, although at first shockingly abhorrent with his fixation on women's feet, probably has nothing more harmful than a shoe fetish. Would you mind if I touch your calf? he asks (but goes no further up her leg). Is Célestine playing a dangerous game? Is she a libertine? Or just one step ahead of her audience?The first half of Diary of a Chambermaid is delightful saucy comedy. Buñuel's famed surrealism, that make films like Un Chien Andalou or L'Âge d'Or so formidable, is nowhere to be seen. Nor do we have to grapple with the distanciation of Exterminating Angel, his Brechtian masterpiece of just two years earlier. But be warned, gentle reader. The second half is not only grislier, but by the end Buñuel will have pulled the rug from under your feet. It can be a bleak experience.Quite apart from a clever story, Diary of a Chambermaid offers many delights, both to casual viewers and serious film analysts. Depending on your viewpoint, Moreau's many-sided performance is either a triumph for feminism or stands feminism on its head. It strips bare the bourgeoisie and capitalist, presenting the rising tide of French fascism as xenophobic intolerance - one we can recognise as replicated in many countries or patriotic cults even today. The hypocrisy of the upper classes is one of 'fur coat and no knickers'; whereas the pious protestations of the lower ranks are shown as the facade from which they lust after the coat itself.Class-struggle is mirrored by sex-as-power. To men, sex becomes a celebration of might, whether physical, social or financial. To women, it is the potential to entrap with allure. She is always present and always unattainable. Through this implied promise of sexual gratification she bends men to her will. And still projects an aura of 'purity'. Our handyman tortures a goose before killing it &#150; rather horrible, but in a way does it add to his raw animal charm? And is Buñuel really just telling a story? Or is he manipulating his audience to drive the point home?This is also Buñuel's only film made in anamorphic widescreen format. Although not showy, the cinematography is powerful. Credits open to the sound of a rushing steam train. We watch, through Célestine's eyes, the countryside flash by. A wide angle lens increases the sense of movement, as if we are propelled by an unstoppable force.When Joseph tries to kiss Célestine at night by the bonfire, his posture is that of a vampire. A snail crawling across the a dead and violated body in the woods is as vivid and shocking as anything from Buñuel's earlier catalogue of slit eyeballs and dead donkeys. But it is Buñuel's acerbic vision of all that is wrong, in all layers of society, that is so chilling.At one point, Monsieur Rabour is reading the French author JK Huysmans. Huysman's view of the world was as pessimistic as Buñuel, but it is Buñuel that makes it so all-encompassing. The festering fascist mob who cheer for Chiappe in our film, are honouring the same chief of police who prohibited Buñuel's L'Âge d'Or (after fascists destroyed the cinema where it was being shown). There were few governments that liked Buñuel, and we can see that the feeling was mutual.The film is more political than it is entertaining, which may alienate some viewers who start off liking it. Even the title seems cynical &#150; I don't recall any suggestion of her keeping a journal. Diary of a Chambermaid is a great vehicle for Moreau, who gets to play so many characters in one. A criticism often levelled at mainstream cinema is that women tend to be decoration in male-driven plots. Célestine (or 'Marie' as she is called in another dig at Catholic - or class - depersonalisation) doesn't so much take over the driving seat as suggest a new perspective from which she is in control.

The morality founded on our most unjust social institutions, like religion, patriotism, the family, culture briefly, what are called 'the pillars of society'.I mention this, not to alienate people who might find such a statement offensive, but to suggest insight into his point of view. A viewpoint vigorously defended in this anti-bourgeois, rural tale that has a kick like a mule. Buñuel's truths are just as applicable today but, by putting them in 1930s France, he sweetens the bitter pill with a coating of sex, storytelling and the reassuring fiction that 'things have maybe moved on since then.'Célestine impresses us. Intelligent, attractive and sophisticated - but she nevertheless needs to earn her living in service. She takes the train from Paris to work as a chambermaid at a country estate. In this lap of wealth, she deals with a panoply of dodgy people. A brutish handyman. A frigidly overbearing Madame Monteil. Madame's lecherous husband and her kinky father. Remarkably, none of these are portrayed as stereotypes. Characters are well fleshed out as Buñuel pits one against another. Madame Monteil earns our sympathy as she confides sexual shortcomings to the priest, who is in turn well-meaning if hopelessly out of touch. Doddering old Monsieur Rabour, although at first shockingly abhorrent with his fixation on women's feet, probably has nothing more harmful than a shoe fetish. Would you mind if I touch your calf? he asks (but goes no further up her leg). Is Célestine playing a dangerous game? Is she a libertine? Or just one step ahead of her audience?The first half of Diary of a Chambermaid is delightful saucy comedy. Buñuel's famed surrealism, that make films like Un Chien Andalou or L'Âge d'Or so formidable, is nowhere to be seen. Nor do we have to grapple with the distanciation of Exterminating Angel, his Brechtian masterpiece of just two years earlier. But be warned, gentle reader. The second half is not only grislier, but by the end Buñuel will have pulled the rug from under your feet. It can be a bleak experience.Quite apart from a clever story, Diary of a Chambermaid offers many delights, both to casual viewers and serious film analysts. Depending on your viewpoint, Moreau's many-sided performance is either a triumph for feminism or stands feminism on its head. It strips bare the bourgeoisie and capitalist, presenting the rising tide of French fascism as xenophobic intolerance - one we can recognise as replicated in many countries or patriotic cults even today. The hypocrisy of the upper classes is one of 'fur coat and no knickers'; whereas the pious protestations of the lower ranks are shown as the facade from which they lust after the coat itself.Class-struggle is mirrored by sex-as-power. To men, sex becomes a celebration of might, whether physical, social or financial. To women, it is the potential to entrap with allure. She is always present and always unattainable. Through this implied promise of sexual gratification she bends men to her will. And still projects an aura of 'purity'. Our handyman tortures a goose before killing it &#150; rather horrible, but in a way does it add to his raw animal charm? And is Buñuel really just telling a story? Or is he manipulating his audience to drive the point home?This is also Buñuel's only film made in anamorphic widescreen format. Although not showy, the cinematography is powerful. Credits open to the sound of a rushing steam train. We watch, through Célestine's eyes, the countryside flash by. A wide angle lens increases the sense of movement, as if we are propelled by an unstoppable force.When Joseph tries to kiss Célestine at night by the bonfire, his posture is that of a vampire. A snail crawling across the a dead and violated body in the woods is as vivid and shocking as anything from Buñuel's earlier catalogue of slit eyeballs and dead donkeys. But it is Buñuel's acerbic vision of all that is wrong, in all layers of society, that is so chilling.At one point, Monsieur Rabour is reading the French author JK Huysmans. Huysman's view of the world was as pessimistic as Buñuel, but it is Buñuel that makes it so all-encompassing. The festering fascist mob who cheer for Chiappe in our film, are honouring the same chief of police who prohibited Buñuel's L'Âge d'Or (after fascists destroyed the cinema where it was being shown). There were few governments that liked Buñuel, and we can see that the feeling was mutual.The film is more political than it is entertaining, which may alienate some viewers who start off liking it. Even the title seems cynical &#150; I don't recall any suggestion of her keeping a journal. Diary of a Chambermaid is a great vehicle for Moreau, who gets to play so many characters in one. A criticism often levelled at mainstream cinema is that women tend to be decoration in male-driven plots.

That was a big mistake. Talman, with a hideous and slightly deformed face and a voice like Jason Robards, is one of those psychopaths who goes on a murder spree for no particular reason. He pulls a gun and Lovejoy and O'Brien become his captives.Talman plans to take them through the sparsely populated desert of Baja California to the town of Santa Rosalia, then bump the two of them off as he hops the ferry to Guaymas, on the Mexican mainland, where he figures he will elude any police who might be in pursuit.That is, if he figures anything at all. Talman's plans are so ill reasoned that you have to wonder if the guy has any frontal lobes left. As it happens, the policia finally catch up with them and capture Talman, much to the relief of the other two who, by this time, are thoroughly browned off at having been humiliated and abused.Talman is enough to creep anyone out. One eye never closes. So, for the several nights they spend camping together, the others never know whether he's awake or not.It's not a very good movie though. The characters are all one dimensional. The sneering Talman is pure evil. Not engagingly evil either, like Hitchcock's villains. Just nasty and a little sadistic. Lovejoy and O'Brien, two competent actors, are stuck in their roles. We learn practically nothing about them except that O'Brien is impulsive and Lovejoy more thoughtful. Both are unrelentingly morose. With a pistol pointed at your noggin, that's understandable, but even in the first few scenes, before they get into trouble, neither of them seems especially enthusiastic about their vacation, and Lovejoy is positively cranky. The most animated performances come from the Mexican characters they meet, and there aren't many of them.The plot has so many holes in it that it seems cobbled together out of patches and things. Talman tells them that he needs them because he doesn't want to be connected with their car, but that when they get to Santa Rosalia he's going to bump them off. Why does he need them alive to drive to Santa Rosalia? Why not bump them off in the desert and just take the car? It doesn't make sense. It makes even less sense after the car is fatally damaged and they must walk the remaining miles to Santa Rosalia.I understand this is based on historical events and, to the extent that that's true, I'd have to guess that the kidnapper let the real guys live because psychopaths have trouble with impulse control. Circumstances waft their intentions this way and that. The kidnapper might have let them live because he enjoyed their chats or because he felt like having company or because he was too lazy to pull the trigger or because he liked having two plain-vanilla folks to boss around. Like most men who take hostages, Talman has created his own social world consisting of one king and two slaves. And as a poet once said, 'It's good to be da king. Ida Lupino's direction is sufficient -- no more than that, and sometimes less. Example. Lovejoy and O'Brien spend two nights in their sleeping bags while Talman watches over them. The scenes are clumsily staged. Lovejoy and O'Brien are wrapped up to their neck in their dark sleeping bags, as if in swaddling clothes, and they lie rigidly on their backs with their faces up. Who sleeps like that? It's worth seeing once but not worth coming back to. Everything about it seems indifferent. The photographer, Nicholas Musuraca, has worked on some fine noirs but this isn't one of them. Or maybe his work is better than it seems. I watched it on a 5-disk DVD set of Noirs.

Why does he need them alive to drive to Santa Rosalia? Why not bump them off in the desert and just take the car? It doesn't make sense. It makes even less sense after the car is fatally damaged and they must walk the remaining miles to Santa Rosalia.I understand this is based on historical events and, to the extent that that's true, I'd have to guess that the kidnapper let the real guys live because psychopaths have trouble with impulse control.

The kidnapper might have let them live because he enjoyed their chats or because he felt like having company or because he was too lazy to pull the trigger or because he liked having two plain-vanilla folks to boss around.

The scenes are clumsily staged. Lovejoy and O'Brien are wrapped up to their neck in their dark sleeping bags, as if in swaddling clothes, and they lie rigidly on their backs with their faces up. Who sleeps like that? It's worth seeing once but not worth coming back to. Everything about it seems indifferent.

That was a big mistake. Talman, with a hideous and slightly deformed face and a voice like Jason Robards, is one of those psychopaths who goes on a murder spree for no particular reason. He pulls a gun and Lovejoy and O'Brien become his captives.Talman plans to take them through the sparsely populated desert of Baja California to the town of Santa Rosalia, then bump the two of them off as he hops the ferry to Guaymas, on the Mexican mainland, where he figures he will elude any police who might be in pursuit.That is, if he figures anything at all. Talman's plans are so ill reasoned that you have to wonder if the guy has any frontal lobes left. As it happens, the policia finally catch up with them and capture Talman, much to the relief of the other two who, by this time, are thoroughly browned off at having been humiliated and abused.Talman is enough to creep anyone out. One eye never closes. So, for the several nights they spend camping together, the others never know whether he's awake or not.It's not a very good movie though. The characters are all one dimensional. The sneering Talman is pure evil. Not engagingly evil either, like Hitchcock's villains. Just nasty and a little sadistic. Lovejoy and O'Brien, two competent actors, are stuck in their roles. We learn practically nothing about them except that O'Brien is impulsive and Lovejoy more thoughtful. Both are unrelentingly morose. With a pistol pointed at your noggin, that's understandable, but even in the first few scenes, before they get into trouble, neither of them seems especially enthusiastic about their vacation, and Lovejoy is positively cranky. The most animated performances come from the Mexican characters they meet, and there aren't many of them.The plot has so many holes in it that it seems cobbled together out of patches and things.

I specifically remember watching at my cousin's house when I was about 4, but I did not get one thing that happened.As the years went by, I saw Jurassic Park sporadically, but never got the storyline completely. Each time I watched, I would get a little more of it, but never the full thing. It was only recently I bought the movie for DVD finally and watched it, and fully got every detail.Jurassic Park is a great Sci-Fi thriller with great special effects and a great cast. Sam Neill stars as Dr. Alan Grant, the not-technologically savvy, old fashioned archaeologist who does not take long to show that he is the protagonist. Laura Dern plays Dr. Ellie Sattler, the archaeologist who has an obvious crush on Grant. Jeff Goldblum portrays Dr. Ian Malcolm, the smart, witty, sly, laid back Chaotician. Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond, the imaginative, happy, determined owner of Jurassic Park. Bob Peck plays Robert Muldoon, the cautious, trained, quick-thinking hunter\/raptor-cage operator. Martin Ferrero plays Donald Gennaro, the wimpy, hesitant, greedy lawyer who seeks to close down Jurassic Park if not to make a fortune off it. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lex Murphy, John Hammond's grandchildren who's thirst for adventure gets them into this whole mess. Samuel L. Jackson makes an early appearance as Ray Arnold, the commanding computer tech who is caught in the middle of Jurassic Park's security problems and problems caused by Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who seeks to steal embryos from Jurassic Park's lab to sell to a rival corporation.Aside from a great cast, they special effects were first rate. Especially for 1993. They were better than a lot of movies we see nowadays. And they were not overused or anything.The mix of an adventurous, eerie, inspiring sound mix along with scene lighting and weather make Jurassic Park an unforgettable film. Definitely worthy of the Top 250, although it does not seem to get that recognition.This is a movie you just HAVE to see at least once. Like Jaws.10\/10.If you have not seen this movie...you must be a zombie considering no one can go without seeing this once in their life.

It seems that now everybody's trying to do a hostage situation in certain movies after the first Die Hard made an impact on audience lives from Cliffhanger (Die Hard on Rocky Mountains), Speed (Die Hard on a bus) and now the 1996 movie The Rock directed by Michael Bay, who more or less is known for making high octane action movies with a plot for people not to think about. Here Michael makes an attempt to make to mix action, cool characters and an edge-of-your-seat adventure with an all-star cast.The film's premise has General Hummel (Ed Harris) robbing nuclear weapons and using Alcatraz as a base filled with members of a tour where with the weapons he could melt half a city after a big impact and asking the government a heavy ransom before releasing a missile. The F.B.I. brings in chemical specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a neurotic agent who doesn't say bad words and knows everything about every chemical ever made. Goodspeed gets a partner, a convict by the name of John Mason (Sean Connery), an ex-agent for the British Intelligence who doesn't know that his deal of being released is being cut by an old rival of the F.B.I. while serving as the only hope to save the people in the old prison.With this being a Michael Bay movie, expect high action from every direction from a spectacular chase sequence in the San Francisco to the bad guys shooting the good guys with high power machine guns and unexpected surprises with emotion. One of the main reasons the film works besides the action is the relationship between Connery and Cage where despite their character differences in the film, somehow they depend on one another to save each other in certain situations and seeing how there's trust.Overall, a very good action movie.
