[{"date":"8 June 2000","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Sure the movie had its typical sequel problems, but they were minimal flaws in comparison to ANY other franchise in this genre.  It was a good look at how each of the surviving characters in the story had changed, and where the problems in the original Scream started.  It kept the pieces together, and the story intact.  It still manages to pull MANY inside jokes, while at the same time giving you chills as the killer continues his vengence.  Scream 3 is in no way better than the original, but FAR superior to Scream 2, and any other horror sequel for that matter.  Alot of movie-goer's complained that Scream 2 and Scream 3 were stupid or not scary.  But trust me, those people are not true fans of the series, direction, writing, or cast.  They're just there to watch a movie.  So, please pay no attention.  Scream gave horror a much needed boost in the late 90's and spawned 2 years worth of copy-cat films.  I think what a lot of people just don't get, is that Scream had two sequels from the beginning.  These were planned sequels, not merely attempts to fool us into buying more movie tickets and popcorn, but rather a very long horror movie\/story that the producers found could be told in three parts allowing more detail and emphasis per movie\/story.  Hollywood has just about finished its horror\/teen flick run.  Scream 3 is definitely the end of a good thing.

Brosnan reprises his 'cool' image once again and Linda Hamilton delivers a quality performance as the mayor of Dante's Peak. However both actors were slightly wasted as their real talents were not well-unearthed and the ending (I'm not into romantic finales but nevertheless) wasn't well developed and seemed all too quick. And that's another story - the end. If more time was spent developing it then the film would have done a lot better, I'm sure, although the fantastic effects compensate for any lapses. Anyway, I'd give this a 7, 8 on a good day.

William Petersen is excellent as Will Graham. My favorite device is how Will starts out his profile addressing the killer in the third person (The house must have felt cool to him), then moves to the second (You stood here and watched them), but it's only when he lets himself move to the first person (I enter the house) that the solution becomes clear. It's a journey that he doesn't want to make, but he knows it's the only way to find this guy before he kills again. Brian Cox is excellent as Lecter (you have to love the phone trick); it's too bad he wasn't brought on for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Might have sent his career into overdrive. The best sequence is the analysis of the Tooth Fairy's letter to Lecter at the lab. See if you can spot all the present-day TV stars! I count 3 the dad from LIFE GOES ON and Bletcher from the late lamented MILLENNIUM; Bulldog from FRASIER; and Chris Elliott, who now voices Dogbert on the DILBERT animated series!

Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger give the best performances of their careers as Aurora Greenway (the mother) and Emma Horton (the daughter), respectibly. Jack Nicholson comes in for a great comedic supporting role as MacLaine's next door neighbor who's an over-the-hill former astronaut.

Terms of Endearment won 5 Academy Awards Best Picture, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay (James L.
