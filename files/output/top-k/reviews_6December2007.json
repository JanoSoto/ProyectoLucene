I watched About Last Night first, I have to say that this movie despite it's dated look and music, is still vital to today's world of love and sex. It's amazing how we still haven't changed that much, huh? But anyways, onto the movie, over all acting and the way that About Last Night was shot, I'd say this was a decent movie. It's still somewhat of a classic to this day, it starred a couple of the famous members of the brat pack, Demi Moore and Rob Lowe who had absolutely amazing chemistry on screen and really brought the relationship to life. While I admit, that this is very dated, it's all good, most of our movies will one day be dated, it's kinda fun to see what life was like then. I was only 1 years old when this movie came out, so those shoulder pads would've weighed me down, lol. Despite the dated look, the story is as true as it ever was today.Debbie and Danny, first off, how corny are these names put together? OK, back onto the story, they meet at their favorite bar and hook up, it seems like the most common one night stand. But they can't help but think of each other, so they continue on with their sexual relationship. But they are getting more and more serious with seeing each other, so they move in together, as just room mates as first. But eventually they decide to try a relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend. But things get very difficult with their two best friends who are just rooting for their relationship to crumble to pieces. Then they must confront the difficult part, is there anything they have past than just the physical attraction? You'll have to see for yourself.About Last Night is a good movie, the acting and over all film is average, it's watchable. It has a little comedy to it as well, so it's not all drama. It's got some steamy moments between Demi and Rob, I have to say that it was beautifully shot in the scene where they first say I love you to each other. But this movie really did get to me because I could totally relate to Demi's character on every level, I think that's another plus is that it is written very realistically and doesn't just have them be all happy again after all their problems, it's very realistic to what trials a relationship goes through. I would recommend About Last Night, it's a good film and a fun time capsule.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 December 2007","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I just bought a DVD with About Last Night and St. Elmo's Fire, I figured since it was 5 dollars to give it a look.

I lost control of my bike and suffered a head injury, hanging onto my bike for dear life over a ditch. I was then rescued by the school bus driver and brought to the general store where I was laid out on the front counter and told to squeeze fingers if I could understand the people around me. I suffered scars, a concussion, and amnesia... all incredibly painful things... But nothing was more painful to me than during my recovery,I asked my dad and brother to pick up a Donald duck video for me to cheer me up. They came home with HOWARD THE DUCK. God knows why they thought this movie would be appropriate for a seven year old, brain injured girl who just wanted to be entertained by DONALD DUCK. If they had read the back of the video box... would the plot summary have convinced them? Maybe it's the cigar smoking duck on the front cover? I don't know, but I do know that we all watched it together as a family. Or at least we attempted to. Between attempting to figure out what the heck was going on, the lousy and distracting music, the weird and uncomfortable sexual chemistry between Howard and Lea Thompson, the bad acting and lack of any plot that makes sense, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Even now, 17 years later, the memory of my entire family shaking our cocked heads in disbelief at what we were seeing and dropping our jaws at the incredibly bad acting, bad special effects and horrible dialog, persists in my head. It's rather comical if you use this movie to play a joke on your friends. Tell them your going to see a really good movie. Wait about five minutes for them to say something negative. Then tell them it gets really good a little more in. See how long they can stand this movie before they give up on it and either burst out laughing or run from the room screaming, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. As a platform for your own entertainment... I guess it depends on how much you like movies that are so bad... their just bad. I personally think, aside from playing that fun trick on friends or family, Howard the Duck, the original copies, duplicates, videos and DVDs?

We are often so overwhelmed by complex story lines and fast-paced action that we forget to simply sit back and admire the sheer beauty of celluloid. Engineered with intricate precision by passionate, experienced hands, a film can transcend the boundaries of simply being a film. It can become a work of art. '2001 A Space Odyssey' is not a film to be watched by one in any hurry. To the unprepared viewer, the leisurely pace of the narrative may first come across as slow or tedious. However, to those lucky enough to be able to appreciate its brilliance, the film is a relaxing, meditative journey that you can't expect to forget any time soon. The film relies, not on dialogue, but on stunning visual imagery and an eerily appropriate classical score, to explore its themes and advance the limited plot. In fact, the first spoken word appears almost thirty minutes into the film, and, in total, less than forty minutes of dialogue constitutes the total running time.Following the enormous success of his classic apocalyptic black comedy, 'Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964),' director Stanley Kubrick became enthralled by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and so collaborated with noted English sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke to create the proverbial good science fiction movie. The two decided to adapt and expand Clarke's early short story, The Sentinel, written in 1948 and first published in 1951. In a nutshell, and at its most literal level, '2001 A Space Odyssey' tells the story of Mankind's evolution, either prompted or surveilled by ominous black Monoliths, the tools of an unseen advanced extraterrestrial civilisation. Through the coldly-sinister HAL9000 computer (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), Kubrick also explores the expanding role that technology will play in the future, and whether or not our complete dependence upon it will inevitably result in our own destruction also an important theme in 'Dr. Strangelove'.Many of the film's detractors often complain that the story poses complex questions about Mankind's origin and place in the Universe, but without offering any answers of any kind. I can see how the film's open-endedness might be infuriating to those who are eager for a neatly-packaged explanation, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Though one might miss it on first viewing, Kubrick has plenty to say about the way he views humanity. For example, the opening Dawn of Man sequence depicts the crumbling society of the early hominids, as they attempt futilely to scrounge out an existence in the arid landscape. The inexplicable arrival of the Monolith (accompanied by György Ligeti's endlessly-creepy Requiem) precipitates a profound change in the mental capabilities of the Apemen &#150; they are now able to exploit tools to stay alive. That famed match-cut from the soaring bone to the orbiting spacecraft four million years later is so simple, and yet it conveys so much about the human race. Worth noting is that Kubrick originally intended those spacecraft to be orbiting nuclear weapons the Cold War being at its peak around the time of the film's production. The cut is a way of enforcing that, given his intelligence, Man will always use it to develop ways to destroy himself (remembering that the bone was used to kill the leader of an enemy tribe).Another sequence that remains hotly-debated almost four decades after the film's release is the controversial ending, a psychedelic wormhole of colour produced by effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull using slit-scan photography. Following his journey through the Stargate &#150; a breathtaking trip across the bizarre expanses of the Universe &#150; Dave Bowman is deposited in a sort of fourth-dimensional observational chamber, its classical decorations both familiar and alien, where the greater beings who engineered the Monoliths can keep an invisible eye on him. In this room, having finally defeated his tools, Man must face one final challenge his own death. Throughout history, human evolution depended so much upon its technology\/tools that it almost replaced us. In the end, it tried to destroy us (i.e. HAL). Now, just moments from the death of Mankind, separated from his tools, what do we have left? The final act of a dying Dave is to reach out his withered hand towards the Monolith that stands before him. This image of 'reaching out' with an extended finger was directly borrowed by Kubrick from the famous painting found in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel artwork -- of Man extending his finger to touch God's hand. Note how, following Dave's epic transformation\/rebirth into a Starchild, Kubrick juxtaposes the Earth's razor-thin atmosphere with the frail fetus in its womb, stressing the fragility, preciousness and vulnerability of the planet on which we dwell.There's really no adequate way to explain why '2001' is such a magnificent and special film to me. It is, above all else, a motion picture that appeals to our emotions, and the feelings of awe, wonderment and terror that overcome me are simply indescribable. In judging films, I prefer to reserve the term masterpiece for the films capable of completely drawing me into their world, of making me forget that I'm watching a movie. I want to feel as though I am there. Shortly put, '2001' achieves this more effectively than any other film I have ever experienced. If you need any further explanation of why I value this film so greatly, then consider my experiences with one particular sequence Dave Bowman, in order to re-access the Discovery and disconnect HAL, must enter the spaceship through the emergency airlock, exposing himself to a total vacuum for an extended period of time. As the breathable air finally began to fill Dave's surroundings, I found myself taking a breath for the first time in almost half a minute. I was there.
