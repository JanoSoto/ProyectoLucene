But little did I know that when I first hit 'play' on that DVD menu, i had taken my first step into a larger world.In the first half, I thought that the CGI and effects looked great. Now let me just say something for a second Most people dislike the Prequels for overuse of CGI and not enough real things. But to me, the wonder and mystery of Episodes IV-VI works in a different way. Seeing all of the CGI in the Podrace, the Droids, and a few of the characters, I was stunned. I had never seen CG quality to such an extent before, and much of it really did look real. I had wondered how much work it must've taken to put it all together with the lighting and textures and stuff.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we can move on. Personally, I didn't really find that much to complain about. I was able to follow the story just fine, and i thought the characters were really interesting. Anakin as a child didn't bother me at all, and i thought he was pretty likable. He had an interesting character, and I kind of actually felt sorry for him since he lived on such a dusty old planet such as Tatooine. When Jar Jar Binks first appeared, I feared the worst based on some of the reviews I saw. But in the first minute or so, Jar Jar actually didn't bother me at all. In fact, I thought he was quite entertaining and funny. For example, when he got his head stuck in the pod race electrical line, I was laughing out of control.Now let me explain something else for a moment Some people may argue that that comedy doesn't belong in a Star wars movie. But to debunk that, I'm only going to say this In the Empire Strikes Back, remember when Yoda first appeared?...Near the middle of the film came the saga's first chronological lightsaber dual, between Qui Gon Jinn and Darth maul, the movie's secondary antagonist. his motive is to wipe out the Jedi and overthrow the Galactic Republic as a a way of getting revenge. (Anyone who paid attention during the Jedi Council parts would know that the Jedi wiped out the Sith a long time ago, and Darth Maul is the apprentice of one of the last Sith Lords who want the Sith to come back.Now that that's out of the way, let's move on. In the second half of the film, the effects only got better. The Naboo Starfighters near the end looked seriously real, the trade Federation battleship looked pretty wicked, and the battle between the gungans and the battle droids looked spectacular, but soon after this happened, came the highlight of the film. While the Theed palace soldiers are trying to take back the palace, they ran into Darth Maul, who had been sent by his master to kill the two Jedi and everyone who stood in their way to victory. After that came the second best lightsaber fight in the entire saga. For one thing, Darth Maul has a double bladed (duel bladed) lightsaber. And I thought it was nice to see an update on the lightsaber formula. Anyway, when the fight starts, three key factors make it a great fight. 1 is the music, called Duel of Fates. no words can describe how well this piece of John Williams Gold fits into the fight, and the film in general. The second factor is the movements, or choreography. For the first time, we were introduced to lightsaber duels with back flips, jumps, several hits a second, and some seriously fast paced action, which the Original films seriously lacked from the reviews. And the third thing that makes the fight so great is the location its in. The Theed Palace reactor is such a bad ass place to have a lightsaber fight, its almost as if Darth Maul purposely waited nearby it so they could fight there. Overall, just watch the fight on Youtube and you'll see what I mean.Overall, The Phantom Menace was a great entry in the Star Wars franchise. It's got great effects, lovable characters, a great storyline, and doesn't deserve all of the hate that it has. I highly recommend watching this any day.I'd give this a 15 if I could.

It's a movie I have probably seen 10 times or more, but I hadn't seen it in about a decade.It didn't take long for me to remember all the reasons I love(d) this movie.The first thing that stood out immediately were the opening credits and the opening scene. Robbie Robertson's music is hypnotizing. It fits the dreary bar and poolhall's like musty smoke and old hardwood. It's not just his music either - ALL the music in this movie is fantastic and strategically placed.Fast Eddie Felson(Newman) notices Vince right away, that kids got a sledge-hammer break.Paul Newman is FANTASTIC in this movie. The writing, the music, the acting - all superb.Those who never saw the Hustler can appreciate this film on it's own, but some of the subtleties and references to Fast Eddie Felson carry a little more weight(as does the ending) if you have. We don't need an explanation of what happened to Fast Eddie Felson from 1961 to 1985(we get the idea), but I think the entire meaning of this film is lost if the viewer doesn't understand the arc of Paul Newman's character from the ending of the Hustler to the ending of the Color of Money. I think the single biggest reason that this film is scored where it is - is that the ending of this film is rather abrupt and anti-climactic. For that matter, so was the ending from The Hustler, but the Hustler doesn't appear to suffer from it on IMDb. Another reason may be because of Tom Cruise. Cruise is amazing here, but Cruise has become the Dallas Cowboy of acting. The actor we love to hate. A lot of people snarl or misjudge a film solely because it stars Tom Cruise. The character of Vince is just as easy to dislike.Just the fact that MI4Ghost Protocol is scored higher on this website makes me cringe.I don't think there was a better person for the role. One of my favorite lines of the film is when Eddie says, Don't change the shirt - it's a nice touch.... or earlier when he says, you've got the flake, you've got that down pat, but can you flake on and flake off, I don't know. The dialog here is superbly written and each actor is perfectly cast.Eddie sees Vince as an opportunity. An opportunity to make money? Yes, but more like an opportunity to pick up where he(Eddie) left off so many years ago, when he was 'put out of the business' so-to-speak.I just want this movie to keep going.Each character is well-developed. John Turturro is great, and there are other strong supporting roles from a few lesser-known but no less talented actors like Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs.The shots in and around the poolhalls reek of realism, and all the betting and play is choreographed expertly.While the ending is abrupt - it contains a nice little twist that is extremely effective and really dials into the meaning of this film.Is this better than The Hustler? No. Is it better than the 6.8 ranking here? Heck yea it is! I think that some people forget that this really is a sequel. How many films do this? Create a sequel 25 years later? An effective one at that? Anyone that has seen the Hustler and the Color of Money leaves this film with a really good idea of what happened to Fast Eddie over the last 25 years, and the next 25 to come.Bill Cobbs(Orvis) says, Do you know who you have stake-horsing here for you - this here's Fast Eddie Felson.

I've never been into war movies but there's always been something about the Vietnam War that grabbed my interest. It didn't play out like a normal war. It was deep in the jungle and the soldiers that experienced it encountered more than your average wartime strain. The jungle is a beast all it's own and to find yourself battling in it's nightmare terrain where the enemy can and will come from all sides at any moment is terrifying. I love a good Vietnam War film, where the focus is on the experiences of the soldiers as opposed to achieving victory. APOCALYPSE NOW is one of my all-time favorite films period, and FULL METAL JACKET is an intense view of a soldier's life from boot camp through the horrors of the war. So when I sat down to watch PLATOON, my questions was how well did Oliver Stone's vision of the war stand up to Coppola and Kubrick? PLATOON follows the experiences of one soldier, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), as he arrives in Vietnam. An idealistic college student, Chris believed it was everyone's duty, not just the poor, to do their part in the war. Once he arrives, he discovers that nobility doesn't even enter the picture. It's all about survival and the law of the jungle, and he's caught in the conflict between the gung-ho Sergeant Barnes and the liberal Sergeant Elias.I suppose my initial disappointment with the movie was all a result of personal biases. At first glance, the movie wasn't as visually impressive as Kubrick's 'Nam, and especially not Coppola's. Coppola had an incredible artistic vision when he created APOCALYPSE NOW. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue in that movie is powerful (in my personal opinion, anyway). And Kubrick's film was brutal in how it depicted the dehumanization of soldier's in the war. Oliver Stone's movie didn't feel as artistically influenced. It had an almost generic feel to the movie from the very beginning with the jungle-green opening credits over the shot of a passenger\/cargo plane dropping a batch of fresh recruits in Vietnam. As I watched the film again, I found myself drawn into it's vision more and more. I still find Stone's vision less visually impressive than the others, but I am pulled in by the characters of the film (more than Kubrick's at times). PLATOON is an intense character piece where we experience the war through the eyes of someone going into a nightmare situation without knowing what to expect (just like the viewer). You sympathize with Chris and his comrades and feel the tension between the Elias and Barnes sides of the camp. You watch as Chris's idealism is slowly chipped away until there is nothing left but an almost feral nature and a code of honor when he seeks justice for one of his fallen friends.My second problem with the film on its first viewing was the main character. I hadn't seen this movie until very recently, after the whole public meltdown of Charlie Sheen in the media. So my image of Charlie Sheen is that of a bizarre tale of how celebrity life and eat your sanity. Watching him as a bright-eyed, optimistic private was a hard pill to swallow. I just couldn't buy into it. I eventually overcame my views on Sheen and actually believe he did a better job than I originally gave him credit for. He's still a little hard to buy in such a powerful dramatic role (I mean, he did do HOT SHOTS) but he puts in a good performance. No where near as good as his father in APOCALYPSE NOW, but a good job regardless. There are actually a lot of great performances here&#x85;Keith David, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, etc. I admit Dillon did feel a little over the top as Bunny, but he remained in the realm of plausibility. You believe him as a someone who was probably a small-town jock back home but gets to stretch his legs a bit and goes a little far with the freedom to act in Vietnam. Speaking of over-the-top though, no one fits the bill better than John C. McGinley as O'Neill. It's OK though, because I've come to expect him to ham it up. The real powerhouses in the film are Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as Sergeants Elias and Barnes. These man are the real center of conflict in the picture. These two men have very different views on running the war in Vietnam and it's their head-butting and eventual confrontation that drives Private Taylor's final descent into total loss of innocence. It's truly a great story. Sure, I still don't believe it rises to the ranks of Coppola and Kubrick, but I definitely count this as one of the most iconic visions of Vietnam to come out of Hollywood.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"18 April 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" PLATOON is a movie that didn't really impress me much when I first watched it, but I found that it grew on me after a few more viewings. I've never been into war movies but there's always been something about the Vietnam War that grabbed my interest. It didn't play out like a normal war. It was deep in the jungle and the soldiers that experienced it encountered more than your average wartime strain. The jungle is a beast all it's own and to find yourself battling in it's nightmare terrain where the enemy can and will come from all sides at any moment is terrifying. I love a good Vietnam War film, where the focus is on the experiences of the soldiers as opposed to achieving victory. APOCALYPSE NOW is one of my all-time favorite films period, and FULL METAL JACKET is an intense view of a soldier's life from boot camp through the horrors of the war. So when I sat down to watch PLATOON, my questions was how well did Oliver Stone's vision of the war stand up to Coppola and Kubrick? PLATOON follows the experiences of one soldier, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), as he arrives in Vietnam. An idealistic college student, Chris believed it was everyone's duty, not just the poor, to do their part in the war. Once he arrives, he discovers that nobility doesn't even enter the picture. It's all about survival and the law of the jungle, and he's caught in the conflict between the gung-ho Sergeant Barnes and the liberal Sergeant Elias.I suppose my initial disappointment with the movie was all a result of personal biases. At first glance, the movie wasn't as visually impressive as Kubrick's 'Nam, and especially not Coppola's. Coppola had an incredible artistic vision when he created APOCALYPSE NOW. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue in that movie is powerful (in my personal opinion, anyway). And Kubrick's film was brutal in how it depicted the dehumanization of soldier's in the war. Oliver Stone's movie didn't feel as artistically influenced. It had an almost generic feel to the movie from the very beginning with the jungle-green opening credits over the shot of a passenger\/cargo plane dropping a batch of fresh recruits in Vietnam. As I watched the film again, I found myself drawn into it's vision more and more. I still find Stone's vision less visually impressive than the others, but I am pulled in by the characters of the film (more than Kubrick's at times). PLATOON is an intense character piece where we experience the war through the eyes of someone going into a nightmare situation without knowing what to expect (just like the viewer). You sympathize with Chris and his comrades and feel the tension between the Elias and Barnes sides of the camp. You watch as Chris's idealism is slowly chipped away until there is nothing left but an almost feral nature and a code of honor when he seeks justice for one of his fallen friends.My second problem with the film on its first viewing was the main character. I hadn't seen this movie until very recently, after the whole public meltdown of Charlie Sheen in the media. So my image of Charlie Sheen is that of a bizarre tale of how celebrity life and eat your sanity. Watching him as a bright-eyed, optimistic private was a hard pill to swallow. I just couldn't buy into it. I eventually overcame my views on Sheen and actually believe he did a better job than I originally gave him credit for. He's still a little hard to buy in such a powerful dramatic role (I mean, he did do HOT SHOTS) but he puts in a good performance. No where near as good as his father in APOCALYPSE NOW, but a good job regardless. There are actually a lot of great performances here&#x85;Keith David, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, etc. I admit Dillon did feel a little over the top as Bunny, but he remained in the realm of plausibility. You believe him as a someone who was probably a small-town jock back home but gets to stretch his legs a bit and goes a little far with the freedom to act in Vietnam. Speaking of over-the-top though, no one fits the bill better than John C. McGinley as O'Neill. It's OK though, because I've come to expect him to ham it up.

From me, that response to a work of art is the highest and most elusive measure of artistic success. (This is one of the mere 5 films in existence that I give 10\/10.) But it did more than that; I experienced something I had never felt in my life, regarding fiction or reality.I take the extent to which Life Is Beautiful offends critics obtusely obsessed with realistic treatment of the holocaust as a partial measure of its success. Benigni aptly leaves most of the victims' suffering to my imagination. As an intelligent viewer who doesn't need to be spoon-fed history (a fact that Benigni utilizes), I recognize cruel irony and jubilant defiance in Guido's whimsical humor.

When Guido explains the game to Joshua, I feel internally destroyed precisely because said allusions make me feel like I secretly know what happens behind the scenes.Eschewing of suffering and graphic portrayal of it each have their place, and I highly respect the artist who can move me to suffer along with a fictional victim by depicting torture of the victim. Since they each have their own uses and appropriate settings, neither is necessary right or wrong; they just accomplish different emotions. In this case, Guido's defiance of his situation is a bold choice that achieves the best possible emotional result, which is my definition of artistic success.The cartoonish humor of the first part is entertaining and endearing. Having grown up on Saturday morning cartoons, I feel sentimentally nostalgic and childishly bubbly about its comedy. Above all, I care about the characters not because I feel intellectually obligated to empathize with them for being humans, but because I genuinely like them.A contrast exists between two elements of the film the clear delineation between the unrelated plots of part 1 and of part 2, and the unbroken continuity of the film's joyful spirit and of Guido's character. It tells me that the human experience is a unified whole. Joy and suffering do not exist independently of each other; it is the same person throughout all the emotions. Guido's choice to respond the way he does makes him who he is. The juxtaposition of the contrast between situations with the comparison between respective stages in character development tell me who he is.Fundamentally, Life Is Beautiful gives me a sense of joy that I feel as my own, rather than happiness that feels fabricated. It connects with my own experience and uses brilliant irony to evoke in me the sting of regret and fear -- and then make me feel like I personally triumphed over tragedy.

The snakes were an added touch, and the story was excellent. I have seen them all and I would have to say this is probably the best one of them all. The story is about Professor Henry Indiana Jones, an Acchelogist who has just come back from South America on an expedition. He is asked to go on a special assignment in search for The Lost Ark of The Covenant. Once in Cairo he meets Belloq a competitor who all seems to get there first or ends of getting what Indy finds. They are both after the same thing and it's a rat race to see what is in store for Indy and CO.. Near the ending it is spectacular, and to some views might be a little tense, but it's not that bad. I loved the last of the movie the warehouse scene, it seemed like the perfect ending to an excellent movie.

Not only wonderful comedians, but wonderful actors, ably assisted by John Hughes' direction and his script.Reminiscent of The Out of Towners, this is another calamity-filled travel film, except that instead of it focusing on the problems in a city, it focuses on the problems of two guys, Del Griffith (Candy) and Neal Page (Martin). Neal's problem is Griffith. Griffith's problem is he's a Jonah.Neal, a businessman currently in New York, is trying to get back to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving and is going to be late for a plane if he doesn't get to the airport immediately. He loses one cab when he falls in the street while racing another guy (a cameo by Kevin Bacon) for it, and he loses a second when it is inadvertently taken by Del. To Neal's horror, he runs into Del, a shower curtain ring salesman, at the airport, and Del sticks to him like Crazy Glue. This is the beginning of a disastrous trip that involves a plane, the Bates motel, a train, a bus, a car, a couple of trucks, a Cujo type dog, you name it.There are some hilarious scenes in this film as well as some poignant ones. The scene in the hotel when Neal goes off totally on Del, who just stands there and takes it, is a riot. Another great scene is Del trying to raise money, and another one occurs when they're getting a ride from the son of a friend of Del. The guy shows up and orders his wife to put Del's trunk in the back of the truck. A must-see, I won't give it away.Laila Robins is lovely as Neal's wife. Martin and Candy are very funny together. Martin of course can write, act in drama, and do comedy. Candy had a gift that matched his size, not only for comedy but for dramatic acting. This is a nice example of his talent as well as that of the late John Hughes. We lost both of them too soon.

Its use of light, shadow, and water can all be classified as stylistic, and its cinematography could also get it elected into a genre so admirable. The film follows Michael Sullivan Sr. (Hanks), a hit man working for an Irish Mob boss (Newman) in 1930's Illinois. Sullivan has a loving wife (Leigh) and two plucky kids Peter (Aiken) and Michael Jr. (Hoechlin), yet tries to keep his sons oblivious to his involvement in the mobster lifestyle.One day, Michael Jr. sneaks out to see his father and a mentally unstable mob member Connor (Craig) murder a man in a warehouse. Despite assuring Jr. won't tell anyone, Connor goes to Sullivan's house late one night and kills his wife and his youngest son Peter, mistaking him for Jr. While Sullivan and Jr. flee to Chicago, it isn't long before Sullivan's former mob boss sends an assassin (Law) to track him down and kill him. The film becomes a relentless journey of trying to leave behind an old lifestyle and start a brand new one through a child.What must be lauded is the use of dark and grim cinematography; the last work of Conrad L. Hall who died shortly after the film was completed. When the film is dark, it is still beautifully lit by source lighting and little intricate elements such as headlights and streetlights. From what I've seen of the graphic novel, written by Max Allan Collins, it was, like the film, ominous, dark, and very, very serene.Road to Perdition also has a great amount of symbolism, which I favor over ambiguity any day. One of its biggest motifs is in the use of water and rain. The event is woven in when death comes up in the film, sort of commenting on the randomness of humanity and the fact that death, like rain, is instantaneous and sometimes virtually unpredictable. Rather than being blatant, it's woven in the film so naturally and subtly you may miss it.Hanks gives an electrifying performance as a stressed father, focused on achieving redemption through his son. He believes that the sins he committed are unforgivable and irredeemable. All his life he has been involved with complex underground operations, contentious relationships, and secrecy from his loved-ones. He feels he hasn't been a proper father, and believes his son can do way better. On a little side-note, the acting from both Tyler Hoechlin and Jude Law is excellent as well, and audiences should pay attention to little side performances that will likely go unnoticed because of a lot of enigma on screen.This is a cold, bittersweet film for much of its runtime. It's hard to watch and difficult to recommend. It doesn't strive to be so much a gritty, honest mobster tale as it does try to be a parable of father and son relationships and a tragic take on innocence lost. I think many will agree that Road to Perdition is a pretty shameless Hollywood film. From voiceovers, to big name stars, to cinematography, to storytelling, to the hefty budget, to morals, writing, and tone, it's all the components of a straight-forward Hollywood tale. That's not a bad thing. I, for one, would rather see a big budget Hollywood epic than a poorly done, incompetent indie work. It isn't until that indie work has proved itself to be more than meets the eye will I choose it over a Hollywood epic.Starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Liam Aiken, and Tyler Hoechlin.

The entire group of characters are just boring stereotypes who do just about everything you'd expect them to do. The white trash come to L.A. to get on the show and then the mom and daughter start trying to sleep with a black man from Detroit who is on the show because he cheated on his girlfriend. His other girlfriend and lover then get mad at the white girls and so goes even more fighting. I will admit that a couple of the one-liners are good but as a whole this is just a really poor movie. The performances by Pressly and Hagan are actually good and they do bring some life to the characters but there's simply nothing there. RINGMASTER is a perfect example of a major screw-up.

It's a simple story about a maverick cop's pursuit of a serial killer and for that reason has a timeless quality that makes it just as enjoyable for today's audiences as it was for those who saw it in the 1970s.After a young woman in a rooftop swimming pool is shot dead, SFPD Homicide Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) investigates and finds a note left by the lone gunman. The killer who calls himself Scorpio (Andy Robinson) demands a payment of $100,000 and threatens that if the ransom isn't paid promptly, he'll continue to kill another person everyday until his demand is met.A little while later, Scorpio carries out his threat and kills a young boy. From information contained in his ransom note, the police know that his next target is likely to be a Catholic priest and so Callahan and his rookie partner Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) stakeout a nearby Catholic church. Their action is successful in preventing Scorpio from killing a priest but in the ensuing shootout, a police officer is killed.Scorpio goes on to kidnap and bury a young girl and then threatens to let her suffocate unless he's paid a ransom of $200,000. The Mayor of San Francisco (John Vernon) feels that he has no choice in the matter and authorises the payment to be made. Callahan is assigned to the job of delivering the money and is also instructed to do nothing that might provoke the gunman into killing his hostage. In the action that follows, however, Callahan is brutally beaten up, Gonzalez is wounded and Callahan stabs Scorpio in the leg.Callahan's efforts to bring Scorpio to justice are frustrated when he's advised by the District Attorney that no charges can be made against the killer because his rights had been violated when Callahan had searched his home without a warrant and also because he failed to observe the correct procedure when seizing Scorpio's rifle. Callahan then continues his pursuit of Scorpio operating purely under his own rules rather than those laid down by the SFPD.At the time of its release, Dirty Harry was seen to be very much in touch with the mood of the general public who had seen an obvious increase in violent crime accompanied by an apparent inability on the part of the law enforcement agencies to deal with the problem effectively. This left many people feeling vulnerable and let down by the system that was supposed to be there to protect them. The analysis of the problem as expounded by Harry Callahan was that the justice system had become too soft on criminals, criminals' rights had been given greater importance than those of the victims and the lawyers who represented suspected criminals were simply hell bent on obstructing the police in their work.Callahan's cynicism and contempt for everyone in authority led to him carrying out his duties in the style of a violent vigilante who was determined to get the desired results by whatever means necessary, even if that meant he had to use unethical methods. His readiness to abuse police powers and operate outside of the rules predictably brought him into conflict with his superiors but he knew he'd feel vindicated if his methods played a significant part in reducing the level of crime on the streets of San Francisco.Callahan is a real anti-hero who shares many of the traits displayed by Scorpio. Both men are violent, sadistic and have no respect for authority or society's rules. They're also both voyeurs and totally untroubled about the number of people that they routinely kill. Furthermore, Callahan is a bigot who even dislikes college graduates!This movie was career high for Clint Eastwood whose portrayal of his character is perfect as it captures so brilliantly the intensity and depth of the disgust and hatred that Callahan feels for so many people. The fact that his character is naturally reticent and softly spoken makes this achievement even greater.Dirty Harry was well received by both the public and a majority of the critics which is understandable because it's a piece of entertainment that an be viewed either as a simplistic story that can be enjoyed purely on a visceral level or one that can be used to consider the deeper issues that it raises.
