A couple of anthropomorphic elements can be seen in the robot, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief since these elements are subtle and not the primary driver of character development.  The robot character is somewhat enigmatic\/alien, which only serves to make the story more intriguing rather than confusing.The other characters are enjoyable, even though they are somewhat flat (to varying degrees).  The humor is not as sophisticated as, say, The Simpsons, but it's never annoying, overly juvenile, nor over-the-top as it can be in most Disney movies.By the conclusion, I found myself unexpectedly moved, thanks to the well-crafted sympathy-inviting character development.

Then, last night, I mistakenly put Halloween III into the VCR.I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the most absurd failure ever put into film, made worse by the fact that it shares the title of one of the very best horror films of the last few decades.  I don't particularly like labeling things as 'best' or 'worst', but I've seen average-intelligence kindergarteners write better plotlines than this one.  I've seen 'Don't Go In the Basement', and I still think that H III rates lowest.First of all, why was it a sequel?  The reason that so many people expected something of Michael Myers and Laurie is because the title clearly implied it.  The assumption that some of the film's dignity (if it had had any to begin with) would have been salvaged had it not been made as a sequel to a movie far, far its superior may be correct-- if I hadn't assumed that it was connected with Halloween, I never would have seen it.Secondly, I honestly can't imagine a worse story.  One of the most irritating things in a horror novel, story, or film is when the plot is not realised at long last, or when 'loose ends' are tied up hastily and cheaply. However, H III does even go far enough as to tie them up, it leaves them dangling like idiotic windsocks.  Why was this Cochran fellow making children's heads fill with...suspisciously harmless critters (ring-neck snakes rarely bite, are completely non-poisonous, and crickets-- please.)? The only motive that seemed to surface was that he was cuh-raaaazy.  Used car salesmen are 'cuh-raaazy'.  That's a very poor motive for such an elaborately stupid scheme.  Perhaps viewers are meant to assume that it's somehow 'witchcraft' that is driving this man, which is equally stupid and biased.  Yes, Mike was deranged, but he followed the concepts of his own affliction, and things made sense.  The second movie was hokey and not up to the work of the first, but it worked.  It had a functional plot.The special effects were almost non-existant.  The man who was apparently murdered died of some sort of brain trauma-- yet he didn't spasm, twitch, or shudder, which would have provided reality AND chills.  But no-- he laid as still as if he were a poor actor in cheesy make-up.  Odd.  Also, cyborgs, I hope, are not made of floppy foam rubber, Jell-O butterscotch pudding, and twists of multicoloured wires.  The destruction of the woman's face was totally unrealistic and unbelievable; there was no reason for her to have insects in her mouth.  The child's head exploding with bugs and small, garden-variety snakes was so incredibly wrong that it was impossible not to laugh.  They may've well have had him start sneezing out cheese-whiz and purple ketchup and chanting something remotely Lovecraftian.  I can't mock this scene extensively, as it does the job itself.What was the point between the doctor and the young girl-robot sleeping together?  Do we care about these characters?  Of course not.  There's no reason for us to feel anything for them, least of all affection.  And frankly, I was more concerned for the creepy girl than the doctor-- the man's moustache changed shape, colour, and size in almost every scene.  I was afraid that the film might take one more step in its tenacious mediocrity and have the false hair attack her.  I hope for the man's sake that it was spirit-gummed and not a natural growth of his face-- it was as eerie as Snidely Whiplash's.It would be impossible to accurately detail everything that's wrong about this film.  It's not frightening; it's poorly put together; it has more corny gore than actual thrills.  Hitchcock's masterpiece, Psycho, had only ONE vaguely gory scene, yet the movie is still frightening; Lovecraft rarely touched on actual blood and guts.  This is because FEAR comes from the mind, not from poor effects.In addition, there is...no point whatsoever.  It vaguely plagurizes various old stories and films here and there, and there are virtually no likeable (or even believable) characters.  The doctor is a bad actor; his ex-wife is obnoxious; his children are irritating and rude; and most of the smaller parts are similarly disappointing, yet less notable.  The single interesting character was the town drunk, who had his head torn off in a horribly plastic scene.In conclusion, this piece of excremental matter has so many plotholes that all of the gooey beige pudding concept simply runs right out of it.  I'm thankful that Jamie Lee Curtis wasn't in this, as an afterthought, because I rather enjoy my current state of respecting her as an actor.  What's worse about this cinematic plunge into the scatological is that it depends on its overblown gross-out scenes to support it, as opposed to trying to be intellectually stimulating.  There are good gore flicks out there that aren't intellectually stimulating in the least, but they at least present good gore.  And they label themselves as such.I can't really understand how this film survived in video form.  It's a disgrace in all ways.  It's actually disgustingly poor.  Had I known then what I know now, I would have stared at the bug zapper instead of actually watching this garbage.  I can't even give it stars.  It doesn't deserve rotten fruit matter.

Actually it doesn't tell their story, but it displays their relationships. The film begins on a Sunday morning at 2 o'clock, right after a party, and ends just after the sun rises. In these few hours we get to know these four people better then we might possibly want. George and Martha are the older couple. He is a history professor, she is the daughter of the head of the university. Their relationship seems to be from hell, full of mutual disgust and humiliation. Their guests are Nick and Honey. He is the new, ambitious biology professor, she is his naive young wive. As all these four characters are more or less drunk throughout the entire film, alcohol works as a catalyst, and we quickly see the different kind of character traits they have George is a cynic, Martha loves to torment her husband, Nick is an opportunist and Honey is very much a stupid blonde. The two relationships deserve closer examination We wonder why Martha and George married in the first place. They keep swearing at each other. Martha can't stop humiliating George, when they are alone as well as when Nick and Honey are there. Maybe there is still a rest of love in them, but there mutual respect has vanished completely. And then there is the strange story of their son, who is supposed to visit on his birthday. They way George and Martha talk about him make us feel that there is something peculiar about him. At the end we get to know more about him, and we can only guess how important the son is for their relationship. Nick and Honey, on the other hand, seem to be quite the opposite. But, being used as weapons by the older couple, we see that their relationship isn't as perfect as it seems to be, either. Nick didn't marry Honey because he loved her, but because he thought she was pregnant and because of her money. And when Martha tries to seduce him to tease George, he plays the game with her, always in mind that this woman's father is the head of the university. Honey, on the other hand, is much more emotional than her husband, but she also is the most passive character, and the one most affected by the alcohol. Mike Nichols assembled an outstanding cast for his film. Casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George is a stroke of genius - not only are they terrific actors, but it also heats the imagination of the viewer how much their real-life-marriage resembled the relationship they had in this film. Elizabeth Taylor outshines her co-stars a little. Never was she any better than in this one; although her character is the meanest in the film, she manages that we still feel compassion for her at the end. But Richard Burton, George Segal and especially Sandy Dennis deliver memorable performances, too. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' succeeds at something rather difficult It makes us care for characters we wouldn't want to have anything to do with in real life. And although it actually consist of nothing but four people talking for two hours, it never bored us for a second.

Although I will voice criticisms in this review, I must start by stating that any serious movie fan should see the film for Norton's performance.  It is a benchmark by which all young modern actors can be judged.Although other films do a better job of portraying the intricacies of courtroom drama, and the police procedures are shoddily written, those elements are not the heart of this movie; struggles for power - Gere's Vail struggling for notoriety, Linney's Janet struggling for independence, Norton's Stampler struggling for control of his own destiny - are central, and play against one another to form the momentum of the plot.  That they play out in court seems merely to be a function of several of the protagonists' chosen profession as lawyers.Aaron Stampler is arrested, covered in blood, after he flees the scene of an archbishop's murder.  True to 1996 California (I know, I was there), the chase and capture was carried live on several local news stations.  Stampler's guilt is a foregone conclusion in the public eye, despite his lack of a criminal history or any apparent motive.  His presumed guilt is unimportant to the publicity-seeking Vail; indeed, it's established in the opening scene that Vail would rather not know his clients' status of guilt or innocence.  He finds himself compelled by the stuttering, soft-spoken Stampler, though, and we sense that this conviction of a client's innocence might be a wholely new experience for him.This part of Gere's performance is subtle, nuanced and ultimately believable.  Where he misses the mark is in his interactions with his former partner (Linney), to whom he merely condescends and bats his eyelashes when he's not trying out his stable of lawyerly tricks on her.  For her part, Linney plays Janet as a woman in over her head; how she got to her position seems unclear given her shaky portrayal of a supposedly confident prosecutor.  What should be tension between her and Gere instead plays as wooden discomfort.  It's hard to understand from what we see on the screen why Gere still pursues her.John Mahoney plays the DA Shaughnessy, a man with too many private pursuits to be a public servant.  He is a believably rancorous old boy, and it's a pleasure to see him sharp and unflinching.  Younger viewers who know him from Frasier will be shocked by this layered portrayal.Alfre Woodard also provides great support as the presiding judge, and earns our respect by keeping Vail in check when he's flamboyant, but ultimately being fair.If you're prone to nitpicking the details of a police procedural, Primal Fear is likely to give you fits, but despite the 7 I rated it, I still believe it's a referential and influential film, not to be missed.

While it may have have been an internationally best-selling novel (one I have not read) it makes for a cliche, dull, completely run-of-the-mill spy thriller (slightly, but not much better then the Ben Affleck similarly timed thriller The Sum of All Fears). The plot opens with our hero having amnesia and revolves around his search for who he is - and why he has cat-like reflexes and the instincts of an assassin. We all know how tired a plot device amnesia is, but since it's just a catalyst to set up the movie and since '24' used it I shouldn't complain. It goes without saying that he is an important figure and that there are government agents who want him dead. I'm glossing over all of this because the movie is just so utterly lifeless in almost everything it does, but that's not to say that this premise couldn't have made for a great movie. In the hands of this script it amounts to little more then hollow chase scenes, shootouts and a few martial arts fights here and there. The best scene in the movie is late in the finale when Bourne improvises an interesting and expedient route to getting down a flight of stairs using a dead body. I will say I was attracted to it by the involvement of Doug Liman. His 'Go' (9.1 out of 10), a modest multi-character story about the misadventures of partying ravers, was one of the best movies of 1999. Here Liman is apparently sitting in the director-for-hire chair of a big studio movie. It's not his forte. He is confined to a standard linear story with no surprises and Liman just can't generate any excitement out of the proceedings. It's a little disappointing, but it's not surprising. The visuals are decent but in almost every technical aspect the movie fail to even match the unique and creative looks of his independent films. The cast is solid, not bad for a movie like this. Damon is credible and likable as the personality-challenged Jason Bourne. Chris Cooper is quite good against type as the baddie. Franka Potente is around to be the standard girl that Bourne meets so they can first distrust each other, then come to terms as he pulls her from one life-threatening situation after another and then eventually kiss. She's squashed. Potente's appearance and the foreign local only served to remind me of the kinetic 'Run Lola Run' (a good example of novelty light-show cinema) and what Tom Tykwer might have done with this movie.

There are lots of bad sequels in the history of film making, so that in itself is not unusual.  Yet it wasn't enough for David Fincher to make a mound of garbage such as this, in the process he felt it necessary to completely obliterate the Alien movies by totally disregarding everything that had come before his film.  I'm not saying he had to make the same kind of movie as the previous two films, but to kill two main characters in the first five minutes of a sequel, two characters that we had invested so much time in in Aliens, and to do it without blinking an eye is not only inexcusable, but makes Alien 3 so downbeat from the start, it's hard to care one iota about what comes afterward.  The closest thing I can compare it to would be if George Lucas had killed Princess Leia And Han Solo in the opening scroll of The Empire Strikes Back.  As if all this wasn't bad enough, there is not one character in this movie that we care about or gives us any reason to care about them.  They are just there to supply food fodder for the Aliens when they decide to pop out and move the plot along.  Then again, we see so little of any of the characters as Fincher decided not only to make a dark film but to film it in the dark as well.  I guess this is what one calls atmosphere.  I call it covering up your big boo boo.Poor Sigourney Weaver.  She does try.  Yet we know so far in advance what is going to happen to Ripley, that we are not shocked or saddened by it.  We only know that after the hell she went through in the first two films, she sure deserved a lot better than this mess.When you singlehandedly destroy a great series, you get a one rating, and you get that one because I can't give you a zero.

Compared to many later Bond films, Dr No is lacking in big action set pieces, and there is no hi-tech gadgetry in sight. However, this brings the film much closer to the spirit of Fleming than many of its successors, and allows Bond to actually do some espionage work, bringing a welcome flavour of realism to the proceedings. Bond in this film is not a quipping, invincible superhero, but a human being prepared to become a ruthless killer when required, and capable of being scared, as is plainly demonstrated when he finds a nasty-looking spider on his bed. This is a Bond who can also get beaten up, and look the worse for wear afterwards, not a common feature of most Bond films.Having said that, many of the soon-to-be familiar elements of the Bond franchise do make their debut in Dr No, such as Bernard Lee's irascible M, Lois Maxwell's Miss Moneypenny, and Bond's CIA ally, Felix Leiter, well played here by Jack Lord. Q also puts in an appearance, but in this film he is played by Peter Burton rather than Desmond Llewellyn, and all he gives Bond is a Walther PPK. Dr No himself is the first in a long line of supervillains with some kind of physical abnormality and an impressive HQ, but he is well played by Joseph Wiseman and his scheme for knocking over NASA rockets is not as OTT as some of the fiendish plots of later films. The other big element present from the start is, of course, the Bond girl. There are some very good ones in this film, especially the lovely Ursula Andress, who remains one of the most iconic of Bond girls, even if she doesn't do very much after coming out of the sea.It is not the greatest Bond film, but Dr No remains an impressive start to the series, setting much of the tone for the franchise while treating Bond more seriously than would often be the case in later films. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It may be over forty years old, but the first Bond film still holds up well today, thanks to great Caribbean locations, tight direction and scripting and an assured debut performance as Bond from Sean Connery, who looks at home in the part from the beginning.

How he did not win the Oscar for it, i will never know but i can assure you he gave the best performance an actor could give. Michael Jeter also came over my predictability as Del. i had only seen him in JP3 in a smaller part but he was excellent and made his character touching and had a heart even though he had comitted a murder.

However out of them all the 2 actors that touched me the most were Jeter and Duncan. I heard never seen Michael Clarke Duncan in another movie before until i saw this and he produced the best performance i have ever seen an actor give! How he did not win the Oscar for it, i will never know but i can assure you he gave the best performance an actor could give. Michael Jeter also came over my predictability as Del. i had only seen him in JP3 in a smaller part but he was excellent and made his character touching and had a heart even though he had comitted a murder. I believe his character was designed for a much smaller part but Jeter made him so much better and gave him the heart he had.I am very sad to hear about his death very recently i will greatly miss him as he had a terrific talent and although he was not very well known his performance in this movie will never be forgotten ( at least by me anyway!). Tom Hanks and David Morse are also excellent as the security guards and are brilliant throughout the movie.Overall this movie showed me that all these smaller actors like David Morse, Michael Jeter and especially Michael Clarke Duncan can act brilliantly even though they are not as famous or well known as Hanks and others. However he heart of this movie comes from believing miracles can happen. I didn't really but after seeing this movie i was always believe in miracles.Frank Darabont has produced a wonderful classic that should never be forgotten and should be watched by every person with a heart and who has some beliefs. Or someone who doesn't it doesn't matter! After watching this movie i can assure you that you will have second thoughts.Not to be missed.     10\/10  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"9 July 2003","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Right now I can't think of a single movie character that I found more annoying than Joanne Woodward's portrayal of Beatrice.

It deals mainly with the violently and sexually persuaded writer the Marquis de Sade and his dealings inside a Napoleonic mental asylum. There are other stories going on inside the film but the majority of the action centres around the Marquis and the controversy raised by his works and actions.The film itself is extremely well done. It's chilling and yet funny and paints a creepy portrayal of a mind filled with anguish. In the central performance, Geoffrey Rush is amazing. This is without a doubt one of his best performances and he brings real empathy to a role for which he is perfectly cast. Joaquin Phoenix is at his usual staggering best as the naive abbé who befriends and takes care of the Marquis. Also an excellent performances is put in by Kate Winslet and Michael Caine is villainous as Dr. Royer-Collard.While director Philip Kaufman extracts excellent performances across the board, there are many aspects to this film which are not entirely up to scratch. The film is adapted by Doug Wright from his play of the same name and as such it has in some ways a wonderful theatrical feel to it but in other ways it seems like it is nothing more than a play plastered onto the screen. Not that there is fundamentally anything wrong with that but in this case it gives the whole mood an artificial feel to it.Similarly, the ending is artificial-seeming and is slightly too obvious in what it is attempting to do. There are several points at which the film could end, and yet doesn't. But unlike other films in which this occurs, I do not believe it justified, since the story diverts onto different tangents not ten minutes before the end, and where it might have left the audience with a chilled and wonderfully hollow feeling, it instead makes us feel unfulfilled, as if the wrong story has been told. Quills finishes with the central and pivotal character having been completely reduced and other, less interesting characters being given too much of the limelight.However, the performances, direction and script themselves are all remarkable and make it a film well above average. Quills is a definite example of when the whole is less than the sum of its parts. 4 and a 1\/2 stars out of 5.

Not only the visual aspect (not that it could hold a light to LOTR), but the acting was very intensive. The boy who played Jake Yorkin (the son) was...believable, which might sound sarcastic, but in reality he did well compared to all the untalented little stars and starlets out there. I haven't seen much of Michael Vartan, but I had no qualms about his performance here. He conveyed sleazy cheating husband who pretends to care about his wife and family very well in this movie. We get to Connie Nielson at first I didn't know it was her! Perhaps it was the odd and modern hair styles that I'm not used to seeing her with. She pulled them off nonetheless. She has always been okay whenever I've seen her work, nothing overly impressive (not that I could do much better), but always interesting. Same applies here. Now we get to the GEM! Now, Robin Williams has always in my opinion, been an exquisite actor. We saw early on that we was funny...than hilarious. After time he became one of the funniest men in existence, being able to pour out comedy as a fountain does water. Moreover, it's often improvised. We saw in a few movies that he was also able to play a dramatic part, not only the goof ball funnies. Here he takes the cake...then eats it...after photographing it and placing stills on his wall to remind him of the cake he enjoyed. I've seen first hand when an actor becomes a part. Robin has convinced me that he has talent beyond many of today's stars...and beyond comedy. He became Sy with such commitment, that it was frightening. There was no doubt that Robin was a good actor, but with this porteyal, we see that his is one of a kind. Not everyone could pull off the subtleties that he does, from the stillness and quietness, to the enraged and semi-focused. Whoever said it wasn't kidding an excellent character study! Congrats!
