[{"date":"29 September 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Compulsive gamblers have, to me, always been rather synonymous with pathetic loosers.  Somehow I just can't muster much empathy for these folk--any more than I can for mountain climbers, speed racers or stunt daredevils.If that's their choice, fine; but leave me out when it comes to feeling sorry for their plight when things go amiss. In the case of Rounders, I just couldn't feel much for these assorted poker whizes, be they reformed-, hustler-, or addict-types. It was then to the cast's credit that this presentation proved as provocative as it was.  The excellent Matt Damon and the superb Edward Norton offer convincing characterizations, along with fine supports, including John Turturro.  The above trio represents the best of the more younger crop actors working in film today.  Each brings a youthful talent and integrity to their respective assignments, which shines through even in average productions.  In the case of Rounders, their ensemble acting is on a consistently high level, with the total production offering some well-observed statements on the tensions created between gambling denizens and their loan shark counterparts.   ###   ","genre":null},{"date":"29 September 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Compulsive gamblers have, to me, always been rather synonymous with pathetic loosers.
