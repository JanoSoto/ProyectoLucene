This includes the Buddhist priest because he mentioned that everyone is good in nature. Even though he is aware of stories of rape and murder, he chooses to live in self-denial; to have faith in the goodness of humanity. Therefore, if you are still debating on who is absolutely right or wrong, then you are probably missing Kurosawa's intention. We need to analyze who is more wrong than the rest. Similarly, philosophy students will go off-topic if they choose to debate on whether Euthyphro was absolutely right or wrong to prosecute his father for accidentally murdering a murderer.The deceased samurai claims that someone removed the dagger from his chest and the woodcutter admits to the theft in the ending. So, let us start from here. Two claims from two accounts support that the murder weapon was a dagger. This eliminates the possibility that the murder weapon was a sword. Therefore, the bandit lied about killing the samurai with a sword. It is plausible that his ego as a famous bandit made him conjure this lie. In fact, it is possible that he ran off like a typical bandit after the rape without engaging a meaningless fight with the angry samurai.Did the deceased samurai lie? Yes. Remember what I said earlier, everyone lied in this film. The discussion should be centered on who lied the most. It is plausible that he did not commit suicide even though the murder weapon has been verified to be a dagger in the above paragraph. It is possible that the deceased samurai lied about his suicide to protect any remaining samurai dignity because the bandit raped his wife. So who killed him then? It is possible that his wife actually tripped and killed him accidentally with the dagger. To reveal the truth that he was killed in a freak accident is probably one of the last things in a respectable samurai's mind.Finally, the woodcutter, probably the biggest liar of all the characters' lies combined. He lied from the beginning, filed a false police report, made false statements in front of the judge, stole the valuable dagger and angrily accused the deceased samurai of lying about the murder weapon, which was later exposed by the commoner. He even reprimanded the commoner for stealing the clothes from an abandoned baby, which shows how hypocritical he is. All these accumulated lies make his claim of having a family of six children extremely unreliable. In the ending, the woodcutter was wearing a mild smile while walking towards the camera with the baby in his arms. The unusual eerie music played in the ending was also very suggestive. In my opinion, he is probably going to sell the baby to the black market for more money, considering the fact that he stole the murder weapon out of greed.Rashômon's ending was left open-ended by Kurosawa and I urge the audience not to watch on a superficial level. The ending is not as simple as it seems. This is Kurosawa we are talking about, not any random 'grade C' director. It is definitely not a hundred percent happy conclusion.

No action commences until they have finished and yet, even before the first real image of the film comes on the screen, we are filled with a sense of dread. We know the movie we are about to see is going to frighten the hell out of us. This is in thanks to the fantastically eerie score written by John Carpenter himself, coupled with the camera's inching forward towards a flickering jack-o-lantern. He sits there with that disquieting grin during the film's title sequence, as though taunting us, daring us to watch this movie. From there, we are treated (although I suspect that's really not the right word) to a prologue done entirely in a continuous point-of-view shot of the killer. We are given no choice but to go with him, and from his vantage, witness what is easily the most heinous act in the film.

From the very first scene your already thinking What the hell is this? Now this question doesn't necessarily dictate that the viewer is enjoying themselves, but once that thought occurs it is undeniable that they have just stepped into a completely unique world.The only way for me to describe what this movie is like is to say it is as if the director Cory McAbee - hell bent on making a stew that had never been tasted before - went into his kitchen - went through his cupboard pulled out a cup of musical honey for an unexpected sweetness, some robust western beef, a very carefully measured amount of comedic spices, a thick film noiry broth and put them all together in a pot. Not everyone will like this stew - while your eating it you may find that one moment you absolutely love it and nothing before or after has or will taste as good, then you take another spoon full and you wish you'd never started eating in the first place, but when you take yet another you can't imagine what it was you disliked.I for one loved the movie - It was the dancing cowboy in the beginning that got me. That image really hammered down what this movie was going to be - and that is exactly what you don't expect it to be.As for direction - I absolutely loved the way it was shot. It's very minimal as far as lighting goes, you can almost actually see where the lights have been set up. I remember in the bathroom scene when the two cronies are dancing you can blatantly tell how the light kit has been arranged because of the obvious shadows. We accept this very obvious lighting, because, though it seems very rushed and in your face, you know it's actually very carefully planned and stylistically consistent.Over all the editing didn't bother me and flowed quite nicely. There was one particular cut when they flash to the workers that bothered me. It was very quick and such a specific moment that I almost feel silly mentioning it, but it didn't seem to have any flow with the other cuts and seemed unnecessarily disjointed. It reminded me almost of one of my first editing projects I did on I Movie - just one of those moments that makes you go - Ooh ouch. But other then that moment, the editing didn't faze me.The music is so unusual - I have to comment on it. Sometimes it just doesn't match the action at all. There may be vague hints like in The Girl with the Glass Vagina you think Okay I'll accept that he's singing about Vaginas- it's Venus the planet of women - there's lots of those there. but by that point your brain is pretty much mashed potatoes anyway, having sat through nearly the entire thing. I love that the songs take you out of the absurdity for a moment only to bring you to a level even more surreal then before.Over all I really enjoyed the American Astronaut.

Is a cult film a film that lacks many of the components of a mainstream film, but somehow or other is able to garner many fans through its artistic merits, bizarreness, racy humor, etc.? If so some films like Kevin's Smith's Clerks and Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise might rank highly in some circles because of their use of black and white film and their ability to find humor in the mundane life. However, what about the films of Kitano Takeshi and Miike Takashi? Their films are vastly different, but they are both labeled cult film directors in the West. Maybe it is because they are Japanese. As one can tell when one goes to the local video story, if one wants to rent a foreign film it is automatically in the art film section even if they were quite mainstream in their home countries. What am I trying to get at here? I am just trying to say that the label cult film is just too easy to use. I mean, come one, do you really believe Kill Bill is a cult film when it garners millions of dollars at the box office. Who knows? It is up to the film viewer to decide. The reason I am bringing this up and why I went into the blurb above is because I've just watched one of the films that I have known as a cult classic for around ten years, but I have just gotten around to watching myself and that film is David Lynch's Eraserhead.Upon the films opening and it scenes of an urban wasteland of concrete, steel, and dirty water, the first thing I thought was that I can definitely see where Tsukamoto Shinya received his influence for Tetsuo the Ironman. Eraserhead tells the story of Henry Spencer a young man who works for a printing company, he is now on vacation, and who sports some very impressive hair. After returning to his apartment one day, the woman across the hall informs him that a woman called for him and invited him to dinner with her family. This is Mary X, and Henry goes there reluctantly because he has not heard from her for a long time. Within Mary's home we meet her parents. Mom is quite overbearing, Dad likes to cuss a lot and talk about his old injuries, grandma doesn't talk much she jut helps tossing salads and smoking, the dog seems to have just had puppies. Within these environs and after a dinner which consisted of Henry piercing a small cooked chicken that started twitching and bleeding, Henry learns that he is a father. However, he is the father of a monster not a baby. Henry and Mary decide to get marry and raise the monster, but Mary can not handle the monster's incessant crying and leaves it with Henry. Henry could not care less about it, but it seems it is also the least of his worries because some other bizarre things are happening. His radiator seems to be possessed by a woman with horribly puffed out cheeks and his head seems to fall off sometimes&#133; David Lynch's Eraserhead is definitely a trip into the bizarre, and I do believe that it is one of the strangest films that I have ever seen. Does the film actually have a plot or a deeper meaning behind it? Hard to say, but some believe that it shows the difficulties of taking on adult responsibilities such as raising children.

Typical Capra movie where one person, dedicated to doing what is right, can make a difference for society.James Stewart is Jefferson Smith, an honest son of a deceased newspaper man and who also publishes a small paper, but loves nature and the heritage of the USA. When a senator dies unexpectedly, and the governor needs to pick a replacement to serve out his term, the crooked newspaper man Jim Taylor wants to be sure they send a 'yes' man, someone who won't ask too many questions. At stake is a big project to build a dam which will make millions for Taylor who has bought up adjoining property under false names.Jeff Smith is picked because he is green, and they think surely he will just go along.

Film was not an exception, and so movies with ghosts or a haunting as plot device have been done since the invention of cinematography. The Changeling continues this tradition of stories, following the Gothic approach of the haunting and the mystery that goes with the journey. Apparently it wasn't well received when it came out (although it won the Genie award), but fortunately, it's finally getting the recognition it truly deserves as one of the best ghost stories ever put on film.The Changeling is the story of John Russell (George C. Scott), a successful musician and composer who one day during a vacation lost his wife and daughter in a tragic car accident. Still recovering from the shock, he moves to a huge abandoned mansion in Chessman Park that belongs to the Historical Society in an attempt to rebuilt his life, however, he begins to experience a series of supernatural events that seems to be related to the house's past and the mysterious events that took place there. While reluctant at first, soon Russell will discover that the dark presence that inhabits the Mansion has a very specific purpose for him.Based on a story by Russell Hunter, the movie was written by William Gray and Diana Maddox, who cleverly built a captivating mystery that slowly unfolds as Russell's investigation takes place. Putting the genre's conventions to good use, the writers follow closely the Gothic pattern for ghost stories without moving away from the mystery. This focus on the secrets and Russell's research really make the story very interesting, and the fact that the characters are likable and very well developed just adds to the effectiveness of the movie. Like a hybrid between detective novel and horror film, The Changeling not only offers a creepy and scary story, it also allows the audience to identify with Russell and feel the excitement of the investigation.Director Peter Medak creates an enormously atmospheric movie that really takes good advantage of the story's Gothic style, making it one of the scariest films of the 80s. With and elegant and classy cinematography (by John Coquillon), Medak uses the location to make the Mansion itself an important character in the movie, and like Robert Wise did decades before in The Haunting, succeeds in making a horror movie where the terror comes from subtle and simple objects instead of complicated special effects. This focus on the suspense and the Gothic elements of the movie perfectly fits the mystery of the plot, resulting in an overwhelming atmosphere of dread that doesn't end until the secret is revealed.Better known for his amazing performance in Patton, George C. Scott once again shows his enormous talent as the tortured John Russell. Scott's acting is natural and realistic, and easily makes the character come to life with a charm that makes hard not to feel identified with him. Scott's real life wife Trish Van Devere plays his character's counterpart, Claire Norman, in a character that easily could had become a cliché. Like Scott, Van Devere's natural performance enhances the film's mix of realism with dark fantasy, and while her screen time is considerably smaller, her performance is effective. The film has also great performances by Melvyn Douglas, Jean Marsh and John Colicos in the supporting roles.The Changeling has slowly build up a reputation as one of the forgotten great films of the 80s, and for the most part the film lives up to the hype. It's certainly creepy and director Medak really conveys great doses of suspense in the story, although fans expecting something more graphic will be sorely disappointed. In a way, the film can be seen as the opposite of Spielberg's Poltergeist (another great ghost story, in my opinion), as both films tell the story of a haunting, but with completely different styles. The Changeling's restrained Gothic style will definitely not be appealing to all, but those familiar with The Haunting will find a good heir to that awesome movie here.Lately this film has quickly finding it's well deserved recognition, as this modest Canadian film can truly stand proudly among the classics. It's often said that one should not believe the hype surrounding films, but in this case, the hype is right and The Changeling is great.

Scott's real life wife Trish Van Devere plays his character's counterpart, Claire Norman, in a character that easily could had become a cliché. Like Scott, Van Devere's natural performance enhances the film's mix of realism with dark fantasy, and while her screen time is considerably smaller, her performance is effective. The film has also great performances by Melvyn Douglas, Jean Marsh and John Colicos in the supporting roles.The Changeling has slowly build up a reputation as one of the forgotten great films of the 80s, and for the most part the film lives up to the hype. It's certainly creepy and director Medak really conveys great doses of suspense in the story, although fans expecting something more graphic will be sorely disappointed. In a way, the film can be seen as the opposite of Spielberg's Poltergeist (another great ghost story, in my opinion), as both films tell the story of a haunting, but with completely different styles. The Changeling's restrained Gothic style will definitely not be appealing to all, but those familiar with The Haunting will find a good heir to that awesome movie here.Lately this film has quickly finding it's well deserved recognition, as this modest Canadian film can truly stand proudly among the classics. It's often said that one should not believe the hype surrounding films, but in this case, the hype is right and The Changeling is great. Fans of Gothic films, this is a must. 9\/10 ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"6 December 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For any man who has ever felt lonely, excluded or unwanted this is the film for you. I have viewed this film repeatedly and would recommend it to anyone with half a brain in their head. I won't bore you with a mindless summary of the film's plot, but rather include some personal observations that I as a white male living in contemporary times feels. I can relate to Travis' racism; his outsider feelings that basically suffocate him from the outside world. So often in films do directors and writers wish to portray blacks as some sort of innocent little lambs that require our pity or as victims of a horrible set of circumstance. Not in this film, instead we see blacks pimping, stealing, ravaging, ranting and basically screwing up in every conceivable way. In one scene specifically Travis is pointing his pistol at a television screen of a black male dancing with a white female on American Bandstand and repeatedly thumbing back the hammer to fire. This coincides with a similar scene in which a passenger (Martin Scorsese himself) glows with anticipation of shooting his wife and her black lover with a 44. caliber magnum, and revels in the very fact of his own hatred, desperation, and jealously. I myself have felt a sort of alienation from women of my own race and sometimes wonder if their is a vast, deep-seeded feminine conspiracy as Travis himself states She is just like all the others, cold and distant. There isn't any conspiracy, but all the same I get shivers any time I see this film or even think about some of its implications and it's incredibly memorable dialogue. I wish all films were as powerful and as gripping as this film truly is. It remains unseated even in these times of great independent film-making. So rarely does a film captivate it's audience with subtle implications and haunting imagery without spelling out it's message and it's thesis to a spoon-fed Hollywood audience, hell-bent on tagging and labeling every film that comes their way. This is a rare treat, and I dare anyone to watch it and intelligently discuss it from a standpoint of the 1970's and of 2006.

What I'll never forget - and this is true, so help me - is that moments after I left the theater, a couple birds swooped over my head. I thought I'd have a heart attack at the age of 18!! I never forgot that. It still creeps me out.Since then, I've seen the film at least a half dozen times, both on TV, on VHS and on DVD and always found it fascinating....even 40-some years later. Sure, it doesn't pack the wallop it did when it came out, but it's still scary enough with unique, memorable scenes.THE GOOD - Those scenes with the birds becoming larger and larger in numbers while sitting on the jungle gym bars, or the telephone wires are some of the most memorable in movie history. Who can forget them, especially if one first saw this film at a young and impressionable age? The suspense and the terror that director Alfred Hitchcock mounted with these scenes are almost unparalleled in film history, so kudos to him for that. Also, even though the special-effects are dated, they were still good enough to be effective today. The birds attacking the kids can still look plenty real. The ending also was very suspenseful and a very good one. This movie is certainly one of the most unique ever made.Acting-wise, I'm sorry Tippi Hedren never made it in the business with that classically-beautiful face and pleasant demeanor. Her acting seemed okay to me, so I don't know what the deal was with her career....or lack of one. Rod Taylor, meanwhile, was fine and Suzanne Pleshette was good in a low-key role. Viewing this in '90s, it was interesting to see such a young Veronica Cartwright, someone, of course, I was unfamiliar with back in the 1960s. THE BAD - A lot of these pertain to my personal beliefs, not to the film-making. For instance, I can't stand shrill, hysterical women so Jessica Tandy's role in here as the crabby old protective mother of star Rod Taylor is extremely irritating to me and takes away from the enjoyment of the movie. I have no problem with the rest of the major players, as I mentioned above.I did not appreciate the usual cheap shot at Christians, which was becoming more and more frequent in the 1960s. The only religious person in the movie was some wild-eyed doomsday predictor - and drunk - at a restaurant. I'm not surprised Hitchcock, a biased pagan himself, included that in the film. It wasn't untypical of him, and it wasn't there by accident. Some of the scenes were too talky and melodramatic, mostly those with Hedren and either Taylor or Tandy but then, too much action would have spoiled the suspense, so I just put up with some of those annoying-dialog scenes and wait for the birds to re-appear!ONE LAST NOTE When are they going to produce a good DVD of this film? The disc I owned was almost identical to the VHS, a very poor transfer. I got rid of it, but would be happy to reacquire this film with a sharp DVD transfer. It certainly deserves one.

It wasn't untypical of him, and it wasn't there by accident. Some of the scenes were too talky and melodramatic, mostly those with Hedren and either Taylor or Tandy but then, too much action would have spoiled the suspense, so I just put up with some of those annoying-dialog scenes and wait for the birds to re-appear!ONE LAST NOTE When are they going to produce a good DVD of this film? The disc I owned was almost identical to the VHS, a very poor transfer. I got rid of it, but would be happy to reacquire this film with a sharp DVD transfer. It certainly deserves one.

What I'll never forget - and this is true, so help me - is that moments after I left the theater, a couple birds swooped over my head. I thought I'd have a heart attack at the age of 18!! I never forgot that. It still creeps me out.Since then, I've seen the film at least a half dozen times, both on TV, on VHS and on DVD and always found it fascinating....even 40-some years later. Sure, it doesn't pack the wallop it did when it came out, but it's still scary enough with unique, memorable scenes.THE GOOD - Those scenes with the birds becoming larger and larger in numbers while sitting on the jungle gym bars, or the telephone wires are some of the most memorable in movie history. Who can forget them, especially if one first saw this film at a young and impressionable age? The suspense and the terror that director Alfred Hitchcock mounted with these scenes are almost unparalleled in film history, so kudos to him for that. Also, even though the special-effects are dated, they were still good enough to be effective today. The birds attacking the kids can still look plenty real. The ending also was very suspenseful and a very good one. This movie is certainly one of the most unique ever made.Acting-wise, I'm sorry Tippi Hedren never made it in the business with that classically-beautiful face and pleasant demeanor. Her acting seemed okay to me, so I don't know what the deal was with her career....or lack of one. Rod Taylor, meanwhile, was fine and Suzanne Pleshette was good in a low-key role. Viewing this in '90s, it was interesting to see such a young Veronica Cartwright, someone, of course, I was unfamiliar with back in the 1960s. THE BAD - A lot of these pertain to my personal beliefs, not to the film-making. For instance, I can't stand shrill, hysterical women so Jessica Tandy's role in here as the crabby old protective mother of star Rod Taylor is extremely irritating to me and takes away from the enjoyment of the movie.

And, while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures, it isn't bad and is a decent time-passer--but not much more.Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and detached Ms. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart--and apparently in the witch's rule book, this is a definite NO, NO!! The film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches. They are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety. Most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless (such as Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps). And, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz. Considering what I think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world!Anyway, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic, but not something I would rush out to watch. The acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact, I almost scored the film a 6--it was really close.
