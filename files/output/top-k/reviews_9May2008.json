The INDIANA JONES series may just be one of the best franchises in the history of cinema, and it seems pretty hard even to make a sequel that won't fall short of the predecessor. The INDIANA JONES series has everything that I like about the movies. Action, adventure, thrills, romance, and simply fun. And the first film, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, is the best place to start. The great thing about RAIDERS is that it isn't content with one great scene. It's ready and willing to throw in as much beginnings and endings as far as it can. The film moves from one locale after another, giving the characters much more to do. To a lesser film that tries hard, it's overstaying ones welcome. To a great film with a great screenplay (written by Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan), its terrific entertainment.The film opens with our dashing hero, the ever-daring Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford at best), going on a trek through the rugged and muddy South American rain forest, off to find a priceless idol hidden inside temple ruins, surrounded by a bevy of booby traps. After surviving the ordeal and getting his loot, Indy's little artifact falls in the hands of his fortune-hungry foe Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman), ending with Indy escaping a chase with Belloq's native allies through a plane, where Indy comes across his worst enemy the pilot's pet python. I hat snakes! bellows Indy, and who knew such an action hero would admit his fear. Makes me want to admit my complete despise of cockroaches.But this is just the first act, what follows include Indy's confrontation with Sherpas in the Alps, a trek that turns to a chase though Egyptian desert, but not without getting Indy trapped in a pit of snakes. The finale is always the time where the baddies get their just desserts, but that's just part of the charms of these kind of movies. It brings back the pure cheer for the heroes entertainment. And since this movie is filled with very interesting and memorable characters, the experience is more relevant. The fun of Saturday-matinées are wonderfully relieved thanks to such expert handling by director Steven Spielberg and the breathtaking special effects work by George Lucas' ILM which still holds up pretty well.There's no further a do I can give about how great this film is. For all I know, you've seen it more times than I have (and I've seen it numerous times) and liked it as much as I did, if not more. Its worth buying the DVD set which includes the two films in the series, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, both still stand out as pure classic cinema. Comparisons (especially with the 2nd one) are overrated. One film in the series is just as good as the other. RAIDERS is the most original of the three, but the other sequels are less sequels, and sprout out much original ideas on their own.There's nothing really more I can say about this great films. My endless praises would just be the same thing that the last guy said about this movie. We know it's such a classic as other classics considered as the Great Movie-going Experience. Like Lucas' other work on pure fun at the movies fantasy STAR WARS, RAIDERS has earned its place in classic cinema.Rating ***** out of 5.

I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher When's 'Star Wars' coming round here? to which he replied It'll be some time I expect.. His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. I have seen 'Star Wars', I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster.

I have not had the pleasure of encountering Jarmush's work before (there goes my intellectual weight), but only based on this, I do not shy away from comparisons to poetic greats such as Terrence Malick or Wim Wenders.All this praise aside, I must remark that it's in no way easy accessible cinema, but a very rewarding hypnotic trip, 'Dead Man' is worth more than one look.

Mainly on the Criterion DVD, which I highly recommend. Like many who love it, I'm old & it reflects my sense of the era, but not my personal experiences. Linklater, with a one indie film track record, got studio money and had to fight very hard to get his vision and words on the screen. He and his casting director had an eye for talent, as many have pointed out. For me, the key to appreciating this is in the making of feature on the DVD. More than most, it tells a great story of why it is worth it to fight for your vision, and what you have to be willing to lose in the process. Several reviewers here say this movie lacks a plot. IMHO, this movie is far closer to reality than any of the reality shows on TV that play out like game shows. This movie is closer to being a time machine without being a documentary. For that same reason, I don't think it's a comedy. I never laugh at it. The dialog is simply real and we are sitting in the time machine watching what happened at this place and time. So, kudos to the writer\/director, and the cast who is able to bring his words seamlessly to life. In 2008, when studios make the most money from turning comic books into movies, it seems unlikely that we will ever see the like of this film again. But we are so lucky that, for 90 minutes, we can forget about what a mess our generation has made of things -- geez, I hope it's not because our leaders spent their youth getting stoned instead of actually learning things in school!!

In true fashion, not a typical horror you would expect but metaphorically, a veneer of horror is laced throughout this movie. The movie begins with Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster) training for the FBI and is called upon by superior Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) to see what possible information he may be able to lend in catching the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, before he kills his most recent captive.An exciting and captivating thriller and superbly acted; Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins bring to life two of the most complex and intense characters on celluloid Clarice Starling, a metaphor of fortitude in the face of danger, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a metaphor of calculated evil behind a sophisticated veneer. The core of the movie's aspect deals with the character interplay between them even though Hopkin's screen time is around 20 minutes or so. His presence is ominous and electrifying. Hence, the stage is set for an impressive psychological masterpiece centering on the dependence between Clarice and Lector as she continues to track Buffalo Bill. The serial killer is mainly a serviceable character, a restrained and reclusive transvestite. The art of investigation is a spotlight and interesting given the tension built as Clarice tracks the serial killer down through the vague advice that Lector gives her. The stark pale cinematography beautifully captures the mood of the film. The dialogue is dense, layered with subtlety and the camera-work is skilfully handled with some stunning display of detail. A fascinating display of direction is in a scene that shows an intense and grisly escape that Lector plotted by making a deal which was a transfer to another cell in exchange to provide Clarence more insight into a serial killer's profile.Jonathan Demme has done an amazing job at skilfully presenting here some edgy psychological material with depth that amplifies tension and maturity. The Silence of the Lambs is clearly a favourite as it ingeniously combines various facets of film-making to please mainstream and most art-house film lovers. The greatness of this movie is validated by bagging the five top Oscars.

Most of the population are workers who slave underground to keep the massive machine that is the city going while the privileged stay above ground and live hedonistic lives. It is impossible not to see this in Marxian terms, the prols exploited by the capitalist class. At the time of the film's production in Germany, there was indeed a specter haunting Europe and it was indeed the specter of communism. Curiously Lang ends the film with a blatant political statement. He has labor and capital reluctantly shake hands. I find this curious because there is little doubt that for the previous two and a half hours the film depicts the capitalist class in the person of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) as seeing the workers as mere automations to be exploited. I think Lang wanted to dodge the political implications of his film. I think he was less interested in ideology than in showing striking visuals of man in the world of machines, of humans as machines themselves, and other humans more like brains without bodies, wet wear blind to anything but production and keeping the hive buzzing.Metropolis is like a hive or an ant colony except that the workers never get to go out and forage. Their world is dark and steamy; they are for the most part without hope as they come and go with their heads bowed in submission.In another sense (and this metaphor is directly from the film) the workers are the hands of the body and the capitalists the mind. Maria says, Between the mind that plans and the hands that build there must be a Mediator, and this must be the heart. Maria is a prophet who predicts the coming of this Mediator, who one might, in all innocence, believe to be a nice stand-in for, say, Jesus Christ. Politically speaking, then, perhaps what Lang is saying is that the war between communism and capitalism will eventually be mediated by the Second Coming. Expressing this commonplace idea with striking visuals rather than speaking it in so many words, exemplified the power of the relatively new medium of the picture show. This is the first silent film I've seen in many years. It's a bit over the top in terms of acting, which of course was deliberate since facial expressions and body language were used to replace words that would have to be read. Modern audiences may find this convention comical or just weird. I found the scenes showing the characters running at something like one and a half times real human speed a bit amusing. I don't know enough about silent films to know whether that was deliberate or something Lang thought effective. Gustav Frohlich, who has the male lead, in particular is a frenzy of action and contorted facial expressions. Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and her deadly clone (and the robot and the dancing woman as well) is even more over the top in her physical gyrations, but her performance stands out because there is nothing quite like it in filmdom, at least nothing that I have ever seen. It is both the heavy makeup and her wild, demonic (and seductive) expressions that allow us to clearly see when she is the evil clone and not the demur, heroic Maria. For me she was the most memorable part of the film.There is quite a bit of trivia and film history associated with this landmark film. The film seen today is a 2001 reconstruction of the original, part of which has been lost. The missing action is explained in text before going on to the next scene. Metropolis was said to be Hitler's favorite film, which doesn't surprise me, and it was the most expensive film made up until that time, and employed a huge cast.But see this for Fritz Lang's stunning and haunting visuals, which remain even to this day as striking works of art.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

While I love the eye-popping special effects as much as the next person, it's also important to have a great story...something Dick Tracy has in spades.For the uninitiated, Dick Tracy is a comic book that pre-dates even Batman and Superman, having made his debut in 1931. The cops and robbers storyline is based off of creator Chester Gould's experiences living in Chicago during the Roaring 20's. In fact, the heroic gang buster Tracy is partially based on the legendary Eliot Ness and Tracy's chief adversary, Al Big Boy Caprice, was based on the infamous Al Capone. What set the comic apart (and Warren Beatty faithfully recreates)was it's pulp crime thriller story lines with some basis in reality. Unlike Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man, Tracy rarely faced the same foe twice. As in reality, most of Tracy's villains either A. Were arrested and went to prison for life. B. Were killed in a gunfight with Tracy. OR C. Died some twisted and\/or ironic death befitting their character. It's gripping tales, strange villains, and exciting pace has made it a mainstay of the Sunday morning comics.In the film, Warren Beatty stars, produces, and directs this exciting adaption of the comic. In the title role, Beatty's terrific. Channeling his inner-Humphrey Bogart, Beatty gives a dead-on portrayal of the tough and morally indestructible hero, tempering the character with the right balance of human faults to make you root for him.Since there's no clear-cut epic story in the Tracy mythos, the story plays like a recreation of 1930's gangland wars with a heightened sense of reality. Al Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is a brutal and ambitious crime boss looking to form an organized crime syndicate with other villains from the legendary Rogues' Gallery including the trigger-happy Flattop (type-cast villain, William Forsythe), the scratch-happy Itchy (Ed O'Ross from Six Feet Under), the appropriately named Mumbles (Beatty's Ishtar co-star Dustin Hoffman), the intimidating Influence (veteran character actor Henry Silva), and the sour Pruneface (veteran R.G. Armstrong), along with others. But there's only one thing standing in his way in Big Boy's quest to control the city Dick Tracy.But Tracy has problems of his own. Despite his toughness, Tracy can't even muster the courage to propose to his sweetheart Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly). He has to look after a street urchin called The Kid (Charlie Korimso). And fend off the sexual advances of Big Boy's night club siren, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna, spoofing her Material Girl persona). Add to that a mysterious, not to mention FACELESS, foe who's helping Tracy fight the bad guys one minute and setting him up the next moment.The movie, despite the depth of plot, moves fairly quickly with an energy that never wanes one bit. From a visual standpoint, the vivid color schemes are used to give the film it's comic book feel, which a touch of film noir undertones. Danny Elfman's score (as good as anything John Williams has done) really drives the piece. And the All-star cast which also includes Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Charles Durning, Dick Van Dyke, and Bonnie & Clyde alums Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons, elevate the film's integrity, making it a must see for any true comic book fan wondering what comics were like BEFORE the tidal wave of super heroes flooded the scene.

He only takes a momentary break from his REM sleep when the heroine is in trouble for one minute, otherwise she can handle herself. Ice Cube plays the cool black guy which seems to be a necessary ingredient in such movies. Of course he doesn't die because he's too cool. Thankfully Owen Wilson does not get decapitated like what happened in 'The Haunting'. Instead, he ends up getting gobbled up. Kari Wuhrer is the potential lonely hot chick who allows the camera to focus on her endowments (which, to one's disappointment, she doesn't fully show) and of course she's killed off. Then there's John Voight as typical greedy villain, the unexpected visitor. While all the actors give almost Oscar worthy performance, it is Suzie (I hope I got the name correct) the digital snake that steals the show. This actress (assuming that it's a female since she so lustfully gobbled up Owen Wilson and throws up John Voight because he's comparatively old and unattractive) gives one of the most nuanced performances. She downplays her part so well that one really has to look hard to find a registered expression on her face and the talented Suzie just gets it all right by hissing, slithering, showing off her tongue, throwing up and lustfully swallowing just on time. Lopez could have learned a thing or two about method acting and staying in character from her mega-talented co-star. It's sad that Suzie dies in the movie because I actually wanted her to win (sorry JLo). It's also a pity that Oscars don't award digital actresses because Suzie truly gave one of the finest performances. Shame on the Oscars for not noticing this gem! People should have spoken up for her. Anyway, to sum it up, 'Anaconda' is a cheeesy (unintentional comedic) horror\/thriller wannabe. Yeah, it's a crappy movie.

He told me that one night on the ship they showed The Thing from Another World, and at the scene where a door is opened to reveal the monster standing on the threshold, an entire roomful of hardbitten American sailors screamed like teenaged girls. I'm not sure that would happen today, although the scene still provides a good shock if you're not expecting it, but Howard Hawks' film of The Thing is still one of the first and easily one of the best of the 1950s monster movies. Smart dialogue and good acting lift it above all the others (except perhaps Them!).Hawks (and the consensus is that the film was principally directed by Hawks himself, not by Christian Nyby, an editor who needed a director's credit on his resume) maintains suspense in the most simple and effective way instead of constantly cutting away to show us what the monster is up to or where it is, Hawks keeps us with the band of soldiers and scientists trying to find it and destroy it, so that we don't know any more than they do. John Carpenter in his remake over a quarter-century later provides more special effects, but he doesn't hold the suspense as well.The characters are well-fleshed-out stereotypes, and the film is as fine a display of good ensemble acting as you'll see in any film, let alone a monster film. For me, that's what makes the movie watchable many time over. And it's what makes The Thing from Another World a good film rather than a guilty pleasure.
