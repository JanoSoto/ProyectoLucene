The script by Kevin Williamson obviously rips off Invasion of the Body Snatchers by Jack Finney & Robert A.

Williamson's interpretation on the premise is to take the themes & ideas & insert them into a modern horror teenage high school setting that was proving so popular at the time with the likes of Scream (1996) which Williamson also wrote. I really liked all of the characters in The Faculty which is a rarity with an almost all teen cast full of clichés & stereotypes, Williamson gives everyone just enough personality to shine. The Sci-Fi horror elements aren't ignored or forgotten about either as The Faculty moves along at a great pace, it never became dull & I was never bored. There is a nice mystery element as well with who is the Mother alien that started it all plus the ongoing question of trust & who has been taken over by the aliens? My only real complaint is that the film ends too conveniently when by killing the Mother alien all the other smaller parasitic aliens die & everyone simply returns to normal. Director Rodriguez uses the mistrust & paranoia well to create some good tension. Rodriguez gives the film a nice polished look throughout & at $15,000,000 it seemed bigger budget, there are also some nice touches here & there like the alien being in human form as it walks down a darkly lit locker-room but giving off the shadow of a multi tentacled monster that engulfs the whole floor. The monster alien at the end looked good & the special effects which switch between animatronic & CGI work well together for a change. There is also a fun effect scene that pays homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). There isn't much blood or gore in The Faculty, just some chopped off fingers, a stabbing with scissors & a bullet in someones head. But there is some drug use & a fair amount of bad language though. The acting is very good by a young & attractive cast, from a pre Lord of the Rings (2001 - 2003) Elijah Wood to a very sexy Famke Janssen. Mega star rapper Usher Raymond makes an appearance as well, better known these days simply as Usher. I love The Faculty, I love the characters, I love it's sense of humour & fun, I love it's story, I love it's modernness, & I love it's ability to entertain me & make me feel better that all great films should be able to do to some extent.

The crew set off in a smaller craft to the planet where the transmission is being sent from, once there Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Kane (John Hurt) & Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) don their spacesuits & go to track the source of the transmission down.

Eventually the creature seems to come off by itself & Kane regains consciousness & appears fine. However while eating dinner Kane has a fit as an alien creature bursts out of his chest. The crew decide they must arm themselves & the two engineers Parker (Yaphet Kotto) & Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) manage to come up with some basic weapons, they all quickly discover this alien has grown to an enormous size & is very hostile...Directed by Ridley Scott Alien really is just about the best of it's type, period. The script by Dan O'Bannon is a little slow to get going by todays standards but I felt this build up is essential as Scott piles on the tension, isolation & mistrust among the crew before they are systematically hunted down by a seemingly invincible killing machine that is the alien. You feel for the characters of which there are only seven during the whole film which makes what happens even more effective. While the pace may be measured Alien is never boring & it provides terrific scary entertainment, even after all this time I think it still manages to be creepy, frightening & very effective at what it sets out to do. Technically Alien is top-notch, a lot of the special effects hold up very well even today next to all the flashy soulless CGI that fill films up. Obviously a few are a little unconvincing but I can easily forgive this, I mean it was made over 25 years ago wasn't it? The production design is great as well, Alien doesn't depict it's spacecraft as sterile white & perfectly clean but as something far more realistic, all the dirt, grime & grated floors that look like a mining ship would. Having said that some of the computer equipment looks a little dated even now which along with the slightly slow pace is my only real complaint. The alien itself was designed by H.R. Giger & looks very impressive, very organic & menacing even though it isn't seen that much it's definitely one of the most memorable of all on screen aliens. Director Scott also manages to use sound & music to good effect, I found Alien quite a quiet film which works well. There isn't much in the way of blood or gore, just that alien bursting out of Hurt's chest. The acting is great from all involved & director Scott manages to retain an air of mystery about who will survive as he gives no obvious indication of a hero type character. Alien is a true classic, the chest-burster scene will live on forever & it's a film everyone should see at least once. Watch it as soon as you can.

This may be apocryphal, although I don't know because I wasn't there. The fact that it's a Roger Corman quickie that is actually good makes it all the more legendary. Corman is renown for making fast cheap exploitation pictures, but in recent years he has become a veritable icon in the world of independent film. He made movies his way, outside of the constraints the Hollywood system (although he would often copy successful formulas from industry projects). He has also launched the careers of countless well known actors and directors (Joe Dante, Ron Howard, Jonathan Demme and Francis Ford Coppola have all given him small parts in their films). If you average it out Corman has been involved, in some capacity, with about seven film projects per year, for the last fifty-one years. Being prolific does not necessarily equal greatness however and very few of his films have gained critical or financial success. In his respective field he moves what is known as quantity, but every once in a while things come together and something great emerges. This is the case with 1960's THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.The story opens on a skid row flower shop that is barely making the rent. The store is run by Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles) who is at wit's end with his incompetent employee, Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze), who can't seem to even cut flowers right. Audrey (Jackie Joseph) is the only other person who works at the shop and Seymour spends most of his time silently pining for her. One day Burson Fouch (Dick Miller) walks in, orders flowers, and begins to eat them in the middle of the store (he adds salt, of course). Now this is a guy who has probably been tossed out of every other flower shop for thirty miles around, but Mushnik tolerates him (mainly because he's buying) and it is Fouch that offers up some sage advice. What they need is a gimmick, something to draw in the high-paying customers. Seymour sheepishly states that he has been growing an exotic plant at home. Mushnik demands a success or Seymour will lose his job. The plant, which he names Audrey Jr., becomes the talk of the town and the cash comes rolling in. There's only one problem the botanical beast must be fed human blood in order to survive......THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS was meant to be a pseudo-sequel to the Roger Corman picture A BUCKET OF BLOOD (which also starred Dick Miller), but that idea was abandoned (or I fail to see the connection). What Corman, along with his screenwriter Charles B. Griffith, has created, is a strange and fast paced black comedy. They get a lot of help from the actors who have great comedic timing, especially during scenes in the flower shop where everyone is talking over the other person. The writing for these scenes is sharp, but the cast really pulls it off (considering that most of the sequences were done in one take). The characters are another asset there is the flower eater, a perpetually grief stricken old woman, and two coppers who exchange tragic dialogue in Dragnet-esque monotone (Cop#1 My son just died.\/Cop#2 Those are the breaks. Let's role.\/Cop#1 Ok.). There is also Seymour's factitious disordered mother (played by Myrtle Vail) whose eyes light up when her son brings her a nerve tonic that is ninety-eight percent alcohol. When Seymour brings Audrey over to the house, his mother prepares not health food but food prepared with health care products (epsom salts, caster oil, etc.). There is also Dr. Farb (John Shaner), a dentist who extracts revenge on deadbeat customers. And, of course, Jack Nicholson in an early (and oft mentioned) role as a masochistic dental patient. The fact that Corman and Griffith throw just about everything into the mix (the plant having hypnotic powers for example), and that they still manage to pull the whole thing off walks a thin line between skill and luck.Although the fact that there was a Broadway musical based on Corman's project is well known, I'll quickly retread it here. When the stage production became a hit, the story was recreated for the screen by Frank Oz in 1986. These large scale productions lose some of the oddball humor of the original though, and some of the best things are missing (the mother, the cops, the cheesy production values). The reinterpretations do fail to fully capture the manic seat-of-your-pants energy of Corman's film, but they are fun in they're own right. THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is a film about a talking plant who eats people, but somehow the cast and crew elevate the material above camp, above cult, above inspired, to masterpiece....Alright, maybe not that far but it's still pretty good. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2005","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is notorious in the biz for being shot in two days.

This may be apocryphal, although I don't know because I wasn't there. The fact that it's a Roger Corman quickie that is actually good makes it all the more legendary. Corman is renown for making fast cheap exploitation pictures, but in recent years he has become a veritable icon in the world of independent film. He made movies his way, outside of the constraints the Hollywood system (although he would often copy successful formulas from industry projects). He has also launched the careers of countless well known actors and directors (Joe Dante, Ron Howard, Jonathan Demme and Francis Ford Coppola have all given him small parts in their films). If you average it out Corman has been involved, in some capacity, with about seven film projects per year, for the last fifty-one years. Being prolific does not necessarily equal greatness however and very few of his films have gained critical or financial success. In his respective field he moves what is known as quantity, but every once in a while things come together and something great emerges. This is the case with 1960's THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.The story opens on a skid row flower shop that is barely making the rent. The store is run by Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles) who is at wit's end with his incompetent employee, Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze), who can't seem to even cut flowers right. Audrey (Jackie Joseph) is the only other person who works at the shop and Seymour spends most of his time silently pining for her. One day Burson Fouch (Dick Miller) walks in, orders flowers, and begins to eat them in the middle of the store (he adds salt, of course). Now this is a guy who has probably been tossed out of every other flower shop for thirty miles around, but Mushnik tolerates him (mainly because he's buying) and it is Fouch that offers up some sage advice. What they need is a gimmick, something to draw in the high-paying customers. Seymour sheepishly states that he has been growing an exotic plant at home.

It's a rather jarring combination, but no matter how bad some scenes are (and there are some REALLY bad ones...witness the bereft father's unintentionally funny hysterics and the Reverand's hilariously filmed nightmare) the scenes that work REALLY work! There are OBVIOUSLY many non actors in the cast...extras recruited from in and around Burgaw\/Wilmington NC where it was filmed. I come from NC and readily recognize the accent of the people, and the look of the place down to road signs that probably shouldn't have made it on camera since this is supposed to be New England. The only notable members of the supporting cast are Terry O'Quinn as the harassed and unfortunate sheriff, and a baseball bat-toting Lawrence Tierney, who is excellent in what little he has to do.

The special effects are decent. Some, such as the hair growing longer and shorter on The Reverand's arm are very well accomplished, however the full werewolf makeup with the head by effects wizard Carlo Rambaldi(E.T., Close Encounters, etc.) is less than convincing owing to the head, which is beautifully mechanized, being so large and out of proportion to the body in size. McGill is the one under the makeup, though stunt men would've obviously been required for some scenes, and he does a very nice job, but even so the head seems top-heavy and is distractingly too big. However, when it works it does so to an amazing degree. The general atmosphere of fear and paranoia are palpable. The scenes in the greenhouse, the ruined covered bridge, and Marty's first sighting of the werewolf are beautifully done, as are the opening scene of the railroad worker meeting his demise at the claws of the werewolf and the sheriff meeting his at the BASEBALL BAT of said werewolf.

Sometimes it seems that there isn't an actor at all, it's just a person being filmed, not a person acting. This is the case with Sean Penn in I Am Sam.I Am Sam follows a mentally handicapped man named Sam Dawson (Penn) who tries to keep custody of his child Lucy Diamond(Dakota Fanning), named after one of Sam's favorite Beatles' songs. Sam has been a good single father to Lucy since she was born. They do everything together like reading one of Sam's favorite books Green Eggs and Ham. With the help of those around him like Annie Cassell (Diane Wiest), Sam raises Lucy in a very loving environment. When Lucy turns seven and starts to realize what is wrong with her daddy, she becomes a little concerned that she will get too smart for him. Sam doesn't know what is going on due to his handicap until it is too late. At her birthday party, she is taken away from social services and the two are split apart.Sam needs the help of a good lawyer and finds one in the yellow pages thanks to one of his buddies. He goes to see Rita Harrison (Michelle Phiffer), a lawyer who never loses who ends up taking the case pro bono so the office doesn't think she does this all for money. The two of them seem to be on two separate pages when it comes to life. Sam feels like everyone is against him, including Rita. All Rita wants is to win the case and win her family back. They both learn a lot about each other and about life in general as the case goes on.Penn is outstanding in this role, which got him an Oscar nomination. This movie really hits home giving the viewer a lot to enjoy. Penn is a character that you like and feel bad for all at the same time (much like Forrest Gump).

But, it's not really a surprise, because the film utilized all the legendary aspects of the comic book character as presented since 1962. It's also amazing that I'm old enough to have started reading his adventures in the late sixties, when he was a relatively new super-hero. He was already famous by then, however, as the mythical qualities of the hero who sacrifices all his personal comforts for the good of humanity had propelled him to the forefront of modern super-heroics.This quality is very evident in the film's story thrust. It seems as if the entire world is against Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Even when he first dons a mask to enter a wrestling match and no one in the vast audience there knows who he is, they're all shouting for his downfall. Even his uncle (Robertson), one of the only 2 people in the world on his side, seems to turn against him just before he's killed, though that's more a function of Parker's immaturity. Someone in Parker's place could (and should) very easily turn into a major villain with a major chip on his shoulder. One could argue it's easy to become a hero if you have a billion dollars (Batman) or be invulnerable to harm (Superman). Parker has nothing and he bleeds profusely in this film. None of this deters him - he is so focused on his mission, a life mission which has him looking forward to a lonely and painful journey for year after year.It's also painful to see the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). MJ in this version is a combination of both the Mary Jane & Gwen Stacy characters of the books. Rightly so, as the flip MJ of the sixties wouldn't have been a good love interest. The bottom line is do we care when the villain drops her to her possible death near the end (an eerie recreation of the most tragic instance in the books). Sure we do; she's the hero's girl, she deserves happiness (she does have a miserable existence, to some extent). All the other characters are well-drawn, as well. Harry (Franco) craves his father's respect; Aunt May (Forsythe) struggles with various pains associated with one's twilight years; even Osborne (Dafoe), who is merely driven insane by an experiment - he twitches in megalomania and is truly creepy. Then there's Jameson (Simmons), transposed faithfully from the 4-color pages - he's a caricature, sure, but that's what happens to someone who wraps himself in his work. They become the work; selling papers - printing ink is in his blood.Would this film have been as successful if not faithful to the character? I'm not sure, but it's hard to imagine a 2nd weekend of $70 million in that scenario. The filmmakers, director Raimi in particular, stuck to the core of Spider-Man. The one big deviation, his organic webbing, was just another intelligent decision (a high school kid developing a product beyond all the high tech companies? uh-uh). It even served as a metaphor for Parker's teen-age development. A funny thing about Maguire, too. A few months before the picture opened, I saw his likeness on the poster of another film and I thought immediately - that is Peter Parker!

The martian threat is addressed from military, religious, and scientific points-of-view. The individual courses of action that these three facets choose rings true even to this day.

Everyone else tries desperately to survive.The art direction by Al Nozaki is one of the things that make this film so memorable. As the main designer for the fearsome war machines, Nozaki incorporates the popular streamlined art deco styles of the time to create unique weapons that are frankly more impressive by gliding than stumbling around on three spindly legs.The visual effects are also impressive enough. Even though suspension wires can be seen in a few shots of the machines, and there's one shot in particular when the reflective hull of a machine shows some spill from the blue screen, the composites combining live action with models work. Some of the imagination involving the technology of the machines, such as the skeleton beam and protective blisters, are effectively brought to life on screen.

The best scenes are the ones that describes the relationships between the characters, be they between PP and MJ, or between PP and Harry Osborn. It is rare to have a movie that mixes these elements and somehow makes the both work. Superman was quite boring when you didn't see him battle the forces of evil. And speaking of Superman, Peter Parker chooses a similar vocation as Clark Kent, although it is as a photographer, not reporter. That is also somehow connected to Peter Parker's character because before he develops his sense he is more of an observer than a man who interacts with anybody.As for the villain, (there must be an interesting one to make a superhero movie) Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice.

But let us not forget that Spiderman's alter ego, Peter Parker is somewhat of a nerd and that is something that Maguire really does resemble (not to insult him).The film itself is a high concept FX extravaganza in the highest form but the story that goes along with it is very compelling. The best scenes are the ones that describes the relationships between the characters, be they between PP and MJ, or between PP and Harry Osborn. It is rare to have a movie that mixes these elements and somehow makes the both work. Superman was quite boring when you didn't see him battle the forces of evil. And speaking of Superman, Peter Parker chooses a similar vocation as Clark Kent, although it is as a photographer, not reporter. That is also somehow connected to Peter Parker's character because before he develops his sense he is more of an observer than a man who interacts with anybody.As for the villain, (there must be an interesting one to make a superhero movie) Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice. The scenes where he shows his affection for both his son and Peter Parker are in sharp contrast to what he will become and it shows that he can play both sides equally well.

Not surprisingly, the driver's compass ends up not working, and they find themselves way off course, coming to a stop at a deserted ghost-town that had been a barracks during the fighting in WWII.

Well, sure, even if it sounds a lot like *The Flight of the Phoenix* or any number of films in the deserted island genre. Which is why it's surprising that *The King Is Alive* is Number 4 (if anyone is still counting) in the ongoing Dogma 95 series, which, if I remember that ridiculous Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity correctly, proclaimed that genre films are strictly verboten.

The last time I felt it at the movies was when I saw Star Wars. That was before I saw Taxi Driver. I rented Taxi Driver with some friends seventeen years after its theatrical release.I was blown away. My friends and I didn't say a word until ten minutes after it was over. How was it that a movie like this could have such an impact?The film stars Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle who takes on a taxi career after serving in the Marines in Vietnam and suffering from some horrible discharge. From the beginning we already feel something unpleasant about Travis. We can see that he's lonely, reserved and a bit socially awkward. We sense something more intense underneath but we don't really know what it is. Wandering into porn movie theaters makes him seem even more lonely and perverted. This is his quality time after long days of witnessing a violent atmosphere of pimps, prostitutes and homeless drug addicts.Taxi life sure isn't the solution to his miserable and solitary life. Bur one day, Travis spots a girl played by Cybil Shepard who works at a campaign headquarter for a presidential candidate. We watch Travis trying to flirt and ask her out and although it seems charming to an average bimbo, it comes across as totally awkward. There are long pauses of silence and observations that sound creepily insulting. I can see the way you carry yourself that you're not a happy person he says. When he takes her out to lunch, we see Travis's loneliness amplified with a a mild sense of paranoia. This scene is utterly ironic in how we see a typical first date as sounding nervous and alienating. Who is this guy? Cybil seems intrigued by him and is reminded of a Kris Kristoferssen song he's a poet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction. It's a great description of Travis but he immediately gets insulted. Rather then analyze the song, he just gets defensive. I'm not a pusher and I never have pushed. He proves himself wrong. After a bad date of trying to take her to a porno movie, he can't take no for an answer. We start to see more of Travis's creepy personality unfold as he obsesses over her by sending flowers and finally bursting in the office to yell and scream at her. Why does'nt he get it? After all the drunks, weirdos and psychos he picks up, could'nt he learn something ? No, instead, he is driven to a plan of madness. We don' know exactly what but its definitely building inside him. We see this in an amazing scene with Peter Boyle outside a cafeteria. Their interaction reinforces the loneliness and alienation between these characters. Its a quiet scene but its so true in its portrayal that it seem scary. The film looks like a documentary at times because we see street action in the background that weaves in and out of the foreground giving you a sense of real life drama. Some of the shots are particularly shocking and so matter of fact. When an encounter with a pimp turns bloody, we see it from a distance as if we were pedestrians witnessing a crime. The violence in this film is anything but glorified. It puts the film in a gritty and dirty atmosphere that we don't want to participate in. But its not just the violence that hooks us in, its the bizarre and psychological mysteries that carry the story. How did Travis get infatuated with Cybil Shepard? Was it coincidence that she worked for the presidential nominee? How events happen and get traced in this film is utterly disturbing. I still can't explain how a film could have an impact to the magnitude that it did. One thing I do know is the director (Martin Scorsese), the screenwriter (Paul Schrader) and the main actor (Robert DeNiro) were all going through similar experiences during the making of this film. That is rare in a field that involves a lot collaboration. When it does happen it as it did, it becomes truly magical. This is without a doubt, Scorsese's best film to date.

The last time I felt it at the movies was when I saw Star Wars. That was before I saw Taxi Driver. I rented Taxi Driver with some friends seventeen years after its theatrical release.I was blown away. My friends and I didn't say a word until ten minutes after it was over. How was it that a movie like this could have such an impact?The film stars Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle who takes on a taxi career after serving in the Marines in Vietnam and suffering from some horrible discharge. From the beginning we already feel something unpleasant about Travis. We can see that he's lonely, reserved and a bit socially awkward. We sense something more intense underneath but we don't really know what it is. Wandering into porn movie theaters makes him seem even more lonely and perverted. This is his quality time after long days of witnessing a violent atmosphere of pimps, prostitutes and homeless drug addicts.Taxi life sure isn't the solution to his miserable and solitary life. Bur one day, Travis spots a girl played by Cybil Shepard who works at a campaign headquarter for a presidential candidate. We watch Travis trying to flirt and ask her out and although it seems charming to an average bimbo, it comes across as totally awkward. There are long pauses of silence and observations that sound creepily insulting. I can see the way you carry yourself that you're not a happy person he says. When he takes her out to lunch, we see Travis's loneliness amplified with a a mild sense of paranoia. This scene is utterly ironic in how we see a typical first date as sounding nervous and alienating. Who is this guy? Cybil seems intrigued by him and is reminded of a Kris Kristoferssen song he's a poet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction. It's a great description of Travis but he immediately gets insulted. Rather then analyze the song, he just gets defensive. I'm not a pusher and I never have pushed. He proves himself wrong. After a bad date of trying to take her to a porno movie, he can't take no for an answer.

This movie is about sacrifice, selflessness, love, devotion, joy, passion, all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks, resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl, Rose, barely a teenager, who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal, a nasty, brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fiancé. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose, by nature a gentle spirit, is angry and desperate to escape, so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man, Jack, who, despite his shabby appearance, is a well-traveled, sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him, and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love, the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose, instead of cashing it in like she could have, she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed, the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive, unhappy, moody adolescent into a composed, mature, independent and beautiful woman, even changing her name, now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is, she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack, he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly, knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live. That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with Christian teachings.Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I will I was waiting for the ship to sink because I was hoping that when the ship sank the movie would end ... but it didn't, and for that I was disappointed. To me, the story of the the Titanic is what happened to the ship, not some contrived, fictional, and highly improbable love story between a Little Miss Rich Girl and a Mr. Nice Guy Ne'er Do Well. The movie is weak for two reasons First, the movie is asking me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome, powerful, influential and above-all wealthy fiancé who has her mother's approval in favor of a no-account nobody who didn't even belong on the ship. Second, since we already know what's going to happen to the ship, much of the excitement is lost. Nevertheless, the portrayal of how the ship actually sank, and the resulting pandemonium, was effectively done. So if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the passengers and crew coped with the impending sinking of the ship, that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story. But Hollywood being Hollywood, if the story doesn't include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality, no matter how contrived, then that story won't be the one that makes it onto the screen, and this movie is proof of that statement. As further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which Little Miss Rich Girl, who's now something like 100 years old and a great-grandmother, tosses a multimillion-dollar diamond overboard in the name of love. Even for a movie that's unbelievable. It would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had posed nude for her boyfriend, Mr. Nobody, who, by sheer coincidence, also happened to be an accomplished artist. (Duh!) Now THAT would have made for a good story. The movie could have been entitled The Titanic - The Story of a Woman and the Divan that Made Her Famous. Now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million dollars to make this movie, then we'll be in business.

Following a confrontation with some goons working for the Russian mob, the brothers have what appears to be a religious moment, an apparent message from God that they should dole out vigilante justice on whatever criminals they see fit to do away with. The brothers set out on a killing spree, suddenly blessed with skills in handling firearms fit for military sharpshooters. They are aided by their friend Rocco, who conveniently enough happens to be a low level employee of the Italian mob. Rocco is the most likable character in the movie, overshadowing the brothers in all the scenes they're in with his charisma, which is surprising because he isn't a professional actor and got the role because he's friends with Troy Duffy. The brothers and Rocco are pursued FBI Agent Paul Smecker, a hard edged homosexual, portrayed in a gleeful, over the top fashion by Willem Dafoe, whose performance is the highlight of the whole movie.Troy Duffy's script is full of so many holes, his lack of experience of a writer is obvious. Unexplained and illogical elements of the story are introduced on a whim simply because they're convenient for advancing the plot, and then these elements are immediately forgotten and never mentioned again. One example is the brothers ability to speak fluently five languages; this is introduced right before Conor has to speak in Russian on the phone while posing as a mobster to find out the location of a meeting between the Russian crime bosses.

Kevin Costner plays New Orleans DA Jim Garrison, who sought to expose the conspiracy the generals were angry at Kennedy for trying to get out of Vietnam, the Cuban exiles blamed JFK for being soft on Castro (which he really wasn't), and after the assassination, everyone who should have investigated was sent out of the country.There's another interesting part here. Recently, Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles was arrested for illegally entering the United States. A cop during Batista's reign, he fled to the US and was trained at Ft. Benning, Georgia. In 1976, he blew up the airplane carrying Cuba's LaCrosse team, killing everyone on board. He never repented. In 1997, he set off several bombs in Havana hotels, killing an Italian tourist, and then in 2000 was arrested after he tried to assassinate Castro while the Cuban leader was making a speech in Panama. Acquitted by Panama's outgoing president in 2004, he made his way to the US. Now that he's been arrested, reports have been coming out about him. One was titled Who has what to hide about Luis Posada Carriles? It says that he may have been in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, and that George H.W. Bush may have also been there.I don't know for certain that Posada was there, but it begs the question if more information about the Kennedy assassination comes out, what are we going to learn about whom? Now that most Americans believe that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, what else is out there? Even the official story about Oswald is sketchy. He supposedly defected to the Soviet Union, but he'd never had any pro-Communist sympathies during his youth. Apparently, around the time when he defected, U2 spy planes began flying missions over the USSR. One was shot down on May Day, 1960, forcing a cancellation of a summit between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. According to what I've read, it sounds like the CIA deliberately sent the plane over there in order to cripple possibilities that Cold War tensions would ease. But just how does this relate to Oswald and the assassination? Who all was involved? As it is, it sounds like some Nazis were also involved.I feel that I should also discuss John Kennedy himself. He has been known as progressive, but if one looks at his record, one becomes cynical. He made a conscious effort to overthrow Castro, even approving Operation Mongoose to destabilize Cuba. He increased the number of US troops in South Vietnam. Known as involved in the Civil Rights Movement, in reality he tried to stop the March on Washington, and even sent LBJ to Norway that day, believing him to be too pro-civil rights (which Johnson wasn't). Probably most perfidious of all, when a pro-democracy movement arose in Guatemala against the terrorist regime installed by the CIA, Kennedy made sure to crush the movement. So why did certain elements want to eliminate him? Because he wasn't an extremist. He didn't want to use US troops to invade Cuba (and so the CIA embarrassed him into taking the blame for the Bay of Pigs debacle), and he was planning to remove US troops from Vietnam by 1965. This is why they decided to get rid of him.

Recently, Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles was arrested for illegally entering the United States. A cop during Batista's reign, he fled to the US and was trained at Ft. Benning, Georgia. In 1976, he blew up the airplane carrying Cuba's LaCrosse team, killing everyone on board. He never repented. In 1997, he set off several bombs in Havana hotels, killing an Italian tourist, and then in 2000 was arrested after he tried to assassinate Castro while the Cuban leader was making a speech in Panama. Acquitted by Panama's outgoing president in 2004, he made his way to the US. Now that he's been arrested, reports have been coming out about him. One was titled Who has what to hide about Luis Posada Carriles? It says that he may have been in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, and that George H.W. Bush may have also been there.I don't know for certain that Posada was there, but it begs the question if more information about the Kennedy assassination comes out, what are we going to learn about whom? Now that most Americans believe that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, what else is out there? Even the official story about Oswald is sketchy. He supposedly defected to the Soviet Union, but he'd never had any pro-Communist sympathies during his youth. Apparently, around the time when he defected, U2 spy planes began flying missions over the USSR. One was shot down on May Day, 1960, forcing a cancellation of a summit between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. According to what I've read, it sounds like the CIA deliberately sent the plane over there in order to cripple possibilities that Cold War tensions would ease. But just how does this relate to Oswald and the assassination? Who all was involved? As it is, it sounds like some Nazis were also involved.I feel that I should also discuss John Kennedy himself. He has been known as progressive, but if one looks at his record, one becomes cynical. He made a conscious effort to overthrow Castro, even approving Operation Mongoose to destabilize Cuba. He increased the number of US troops in South Vietnam. Known as involved in the Civil Rights Movement, in reality he tried to stop the March on Washington, and even sent LBJ to Norway that day, believing him to be too pro-civil rights (which Johnson wasn't). Probably most perfidious of all, when a pro-democracy movement arose in Guatemala against the terrorist regime installed by the CIA, Kennedy made sure to crush the movement. So why did certain elements want to eliminate him? Because he wasn't an extremist. He didn't want to use US troops to invade Cuba (and so the CIA embarrassed him into taking the blame for the Bay of Pigs debacle), and he was planning to remove US troops from Vietnam by 1965. This is why they decided to get rid of him.

The chase sequences, of course, standard fare, nothing spectacular or nail-biting. The Russians (or any dark, sinister force\/country\/covert agency) who want access to a secret code which has the ability to control underwater missiles, check. An impenetrable fortress atop a gigantic mountain\/boulder\/what-have-you, you betcha. A possible second love interest for Bond, another check. The only thing that is sorely lacking is a memorable villain, and in trying to humanize the bad guys, the creators have come up with people who aren't very interesting, or even ingenious. Julian Glover seems quite grey whenever he's on screen it almost makes me wish the writers hadn't disposed of Ernst Stavros Blofeld, or brought someone similar.And at over 120 minutes, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY runs a tad too long and doesn't maintain a level of mounting suspense necessary for this kind of movie, so when the end comes, it's a little more than a relief, not because this was a bad feature -- again, it wasn't -- but the fact that this ordeal was so perfunctory. And partly to this are the performances, which are wooden to say the least -- Carol Bouquet, while playing a tough girl, emotes little; Roger Moore repeats playing suave and his age is showing here; Lynn Holly-Johnson is irritating to no avail and her part could have been excised, but in a small role as a secondary Bond girl, Cassandra Harris brings an elegant presence in her brief moment of screen time. She should have had the larger part, since she does smolder, but oh well -- I'm complaining and the movie is a quarter of a century old and a classic. Just not a memorable one.
