[{"date":"10 December 2014","score":"","review":" Ravenous is set during the American-Mexican War and follows the story of American officer Capt. John Boyd, who is transferred to a remote Fort after receiving a promotion. Not long after arriving at the Fort, a man by the name of Colqhuon arrives and tells them of the troubles that he and his group encountered, especially when his Colonel started to resort to desperate measures to stay alive.This obviously won't be a movie for everyone (then again, what movie is?) but if you enjoy watching dark, psychological thrillers then you really won't go far wrong with Ravenous.The gore in the movie - and the subject matter - is rather tame by today's standards (although may still make some people a bit squeamish), but that's not what this movie is about after all. It's basically a movie of survival and asks the question of how far would a person go to stay alive.Guy Pearce as Capt. John Boyd and Robert Carlyle as Colqhoun are undoubtedly the stars of the movie with Carlyle bringing a real menace and calculating nature to his character.The only real downside to the movie is the occasionally annoying music, which at times sounds like a cat being neutered without anesthetic. Thankfully it's not all the way through the movie so it's not enough to put you off viewing.Overall, this low-budget movie from 1999 is a pretty decent watch.
