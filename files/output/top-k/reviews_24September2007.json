Then, found a VHS of The Specialist and subjected myself to another two hours of junk, with The Italian Stallion. Double UGH ! I think I was so shocked from four hours of this kind of action movies, I was paralyzed, unable to get-up and switch from video to satellite-TV. Didn't really have to get-up - I could have clicked it all away. Problem is, out of all those satellite-channels, there was nothing good or nothing I hadn't already seen........I blame myself....I was enlightened with how many users knew so much trivia about The Specialist. I had never heard of the film; I got a good education on it. $15-mil for Stallone (Ray Quick) ??? If his career is on the skids, why does he command such a high fee? (Not surprised to learn he has done porn in the past; that's not my being dumb, just haven't been that interested in him since Rambo.) $45-mil to make the movie? WOW ! Just think how many good things all that money could have done. I didn't see Anaconda, and am now glad - so, I wasn't aware that Luis Llosa directed both films. I'm not one to worship at directors' doors. One good movie doesn't mean they ALL are going to be good. One-at-a-time, please....For a long time, I've been wondering why actors\/actresses think whispering their lines is sexy, or demonstrating they know how to emote. Stallone should have pitched his voice at a higher tone, and stopped trying to get all those weird mouth-movements onto film.On the other hand, James Woods (Ned Trent) needed a muzzle for his hollering - or someone in the sound-booth to turn-down the volume.

The only positive comment I can give for these two actors is, I'm glad age has filled-in their faces....both were always gaunt-looking.

Her entire career has been one of every actor she's appeared with, with their hands all over (and inside) of her body. Instinct was a first-time shocker - enough, already ! I must also comment that micro-mini skirts were not in style for the 90s a huge, veiled hat and a dress that hardly covered her panties, in a church?Like many, I didn't recognize Rod Steiger (Joe Leon).

I don't even consider the few opinions who thought it was the best film ever made - in just the period of the 90s ?? Wow! again...I found no redeeming nor entertaining qualities for The Specialist, except for how hard the special-effects artists were hitting it, and the pretty colors the explosions made. If this is the best Llosa can do with all that money and directing-scripting, no wonder he isn't getting any work.

The great location photography enhances the mood of the film perfectly and helps make this a really classy piece of escapist fun; like Tourneur's Out of the Past, Welles' Lady from Shanghai and his own Notorious, a lot of the film's appeal is from seeing beautiful and exotic people in a beautiful and exotic setting, trying to figure out how to stay alive in a situation where no-one and nothing seems familiar or trustworthy. Just as in most exotic noir films, the main character John Robie the cat burglar (Grant) has a mysterious criminal past which makes the female protagonist uncertain about whether to trust him. However this film stays away from the dark side of the caper genre by clueing the audience in very early as to the protagonist's innocence, thus making the female protagonist the more interesting character as far as motives and judgments.For me, the main reason to watch this film is always Grant, so suave and self-deprecating as the once-notorious cat burglar. Since as I said we know he's innocent, what's interesting about his character is the way he reacts to the fact that so many other people think he's guilty. Robie seems to actually enjoy being implicated, except insofar as he values his freedom and his lifestyle very highly. This film is built on irony, and the greatest irony of all is that in the end Robie finds a woman (Kelly) to whom he will willingly accept the loss of both (he will now welcome a mother-in-law to his paradise villa). Now in a lot of Grant's 50s\/60s movies we see the female protagonist actually seducing Grant, but it was never handled as well as in this film. That's because the element of seduction coincides in so many convincingly ironic ways with his other motivations. 2 scenes in particular stand out in this regard to me. The first is the scene with Kelly driving reluctant passenger Grant at very high speeds on the edges of cliffs as cops chase them. This time it is not his own ingenuity that will save him, and it's interesting how Kelly slowly plays her cards until she throws out her joker and completely trumps him &#150; she knows his true identity. This scene is reminiscent of the one in Notorious where Grant is driven by a drunken Ingrid Bergman (or, for that matter, the one in NxNW where he's driven by a drunken&#133;.. Cary Grant!). Hitch seems to revel in placing the ultimate leading man in dangerous and humiliating circumstances &#150; it's essential to the development of the character that he be humbled just a bit by Kelly just as she will later be humbled to discover that he was not the thief she thought he was.It's the juicy irony of that situation that really makes the developing romantic relationship work &#150; Kelly's character thinks that she understands Grant and she is chasing him just like he's chasing the real thief. In the first place she aggressively kisses him before he really speaks to her (an element lifted for Donen's derivative Charade) so she's already chasing him in a sense just because she's so fascinated by his seemingly unique ability to ignore her. Then in the second really important love scene, the fireworks scene, Kelly thinks she has him all figured out &#150; you've been staring at them all night she says, referring to her jewels even though Robie was probably staring at her more, shall we say, uniquely feminine features in that particular region. As Hitchcock keeps us guessing about what each lover truly desires in the other, he gives this romance great depth and verity by engaging our own desire to be close to these fascinating intelligent characters and by enticing us with the irony of their conflicting motives.OK, another thing &#150; this is Grace Kelly at her best. Compared to most of her other performances, this is truly astounding, confident work. I can't forget the look in her eyes as she tours the villa with Grant &#150; totally convincing and yet somehow haunting, a young woman in love but not sure exactly what she's getting into. Every time I see a bad Kelly movie I pick this one up again to remind myself of just how much a director can do to bring out the most in an actor. Even Grant is better than usual here, perfectly mixing his comedic and dramatic personae for really the first time as far as I'm aware. In Suspicion he and Hitch toyed with and deconstructed his normal screen persona &#150; but this film is tome even more impressive and enjoyable because it took that persona and instead of contradicting it (Suspicion) or simply undermining it (i.e. Hawks' Male War Bride) they exaggerated it and played more subtly with the sexual element of the catch and the question of who exactly catches who &#150; and more importantly and amusingly, why.I'll leave it to others to discuss all the other solid performances, the director's techniques, etc. All of it is true, but this film is really all about Grant and Kelly's characters, in danger and in love (the film asks is there a difference?) and having the time of their lives. It's an intelligent, suspenseful, romantic movie with two exciting lead actors, beautiful locations well photographed, gorgeous costumes that enhance character and plot (e.g. Grant's slave boy costume in the grand ball), all captured by one of the world's best directors at the peak of his abilities. And I do mean&#133;&#133; captured. This is a rare beast and should be appreciated as such, and not for what people might wish it was trying to be.

That's because the element of seduction coincides in so many convincingly ironic ways with his other motivations. 2 scenes in particular stand out in this regard to me. The first is the scene with Kelly driving reluctant passenger Grant at very high speeds on the edges of cliffs as cops chase them. This time it is not his own ingenuity that will save him, and it's interesting how Kelly slowly plays her cards until she throws out her joker and completely trumps him &#150; she knows his true identity. This scene is reminiscent of the one in Notorious where Grant is driven by a drunken Ingrid Bergman (or, for that matter, the one in NxNW where he's driven by a drunken&#133;.. Cary Grant!). Hitch seems to revel in placing the ultimate leading man in dangerous and humiliating circumstances &#150; it's essential to the development of the character that he be humbled just a bit by Kelly just as she will later be humbled to discover that he was not the thief she thought he was.It's the juicy irony of that situation that really makes the developing romantic relationship work &#150; Kelly's character thinks that she understands Grant and she is chasing him just like he's chasing the real thief. In the first place she aggressively kisses him before he really speaks to her (an element lifted for Donen's derivative Charade) so she's already chasing him in a sense just because she's so fascinated by his seemingly unique ability to ignore her. Then in the second really important love scene, the fireworks scene, Kelly thinks she has him all figured out &#150; you've been staring at them all night she says, referring to her jewels even though Robie was probably staring at her more, shall we say, uniquely feminine features in that particular region. As Hitchcock keeps us guessing about what each lover truly desires in the other, he gives this romance great depth and verity by engaging our own desire to be close to these fascinating intelligent characters and by enticing us with the irony of their conflicting motives.OK, another thing &#150; this is Grace Kelly at her best. Compared to most of her other performances, this is truly astounding, confident work. I can't forget the look in her eyes as she tours the villa with Grant &#150; totally convincing and yet somehow haunting, a young woman in love but not sure exactly what she's getting into. Every time I see a bad Kelly movie I pick this one up again to remind myself of just how much a director can do to bring out the most in an actor. Even Grant is better than usual here, perfectly mixing his comedic and dramatic personae for really the first time as far as I'm aware. In Suspicion he and Hitch toyed with and deconstructed his normal screen persona &#150; but this film is tome even more impressive and enjoyable because it took that persona and instead of contradicting it (Suspicion) or simply undermining it (i.e. Hawks' Male War Bride) they exaggerated it and played more subtly with the sexual element of the catch and the question of who exactly catches who &#150; and more importantly and amusingly, why.I'll leave it to others to discuss all the other solid performances, the director's techniques, etc. All of it is true, but this film is really all about Grant and Kelly's characters, in danger and in love (the film asks is there a difference?) and having the time of their lives. It's an intelligent, suspenseful, romantic movie with two exciting lead actors, beautiful locations well photographed, gorgeous costumes that enhance character and plot (e.g. Grant's slave boy costume in the grand ball), all captured by one of the world's best directors at the peak of his abilities. And I do mean&#133;&#133; captured. This is a rare beast and should be appreciated as such, and not for what people might wish it was trying to be.
