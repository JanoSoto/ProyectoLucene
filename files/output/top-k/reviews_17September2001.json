However, in Memeneto the essence, the distinctiveness, the brilliance, the virtue is in the story itself.  This is the first film in quite some time that I can honestly say I enjoyed purely for the sake of the story- the film itself.  The film has a real starkness to it making the noir comparison obvious, inevitable and quickly a cliche.  The device used in this film is not as straightforward as most people have initially described and it is certainly not a gimmick.  When I think of gimmicks I think of filmic devices, techniques, or methods that are employed only to befuddle the audience and to show off the filmmaker's ability.  Therefore this film's device is not gimmicky, the story would be just as interesting without the device.  Of course as some people have already observed this film is not only an implausible one, but an imperfect one, but surely we have made bigger concessions for films in the past.  At the heart of the story is the main character Lenny and his inability to as he puts it to make any new memories.  This problem though often comical proves to be simultaneously Lenny's tragedy (making Lenny a very ironic character).  Along with the chaos of a daily life in which he can not remember anything longer than several minutes Lenny is determined to exact his revenge by bringing his wife's killer\/rapist because as he puts his inability to remember the act is irrelevant because his wife deserves justice.  Caught up in Lenny's world or perhaps Lenny in theirs are several different characters.  The motel worker that feels sympathy for Lenny, but not enough to keep him from charging him for an extra room because as he puts it business is slow and Lenny won't remember anyway.  The bartender (Natalie) who is caught up in a drug racket and is as quick to use Lenny and mock him as she is to help him.  Their is a particularly frustrating scene which illustrates this, in which Lenny is trying to find a pen so he can remember what she has said.  And of course Teddy who more than anyone pops in and out of Lenny's life.  Unfortunately Teddy is as close to a friend as Lenny gets to have in this story.  A truly interesting aspect of the story is the even more fragmented phone conversations Lenny has in which he reveals Sammy Jankus, a character who Lenny investigated who suffered from almost exactly the same condition Lenny does the only difference is he could not condition his instincts (according to himself Lenny can).  As the story of Sammy unfolds we see a subplot that is as intriguing as anyone I can remember in recent film and as integral to understanding Lenny as Freud thinks our dreams are to understanding ourselves.  Unlocking the mystery of Sammy and why it is so important for Lenny to remember him sheds light on the whole situation.  In what is without a doubt the most important scene in understanding Sammy in the film and subsequently understanding Lenny we see that Sammy of course without being aware of it kills his wife as she reminds him at least three times over that she needs her insulin shot and as a result of the failed test she goes into a coma and dies.  So in understanding this scene we fully realize Sammy's problem.  Sammy who ends up in a mental institution and doesn't even realize that his wife is dead, loved his wife very much, but is incapable of saving her because of his mental infirmity.  Lenny's problem is the same, but reversed.  Lenny loved his wife very much, but was incapable of saving her and as a result he develops almost the exact same infirmity as Sammy.  Whether Lenny's brain damage is a result of physical trauma (the blow to the head) or the psychological trauma of not being able to deal with the tragedy is arbitrary the condition remains the same.  Still at this point we have yet to fully realize the significance of the connection between Sammy and Lenny.  The connection is fully illuminated for us at the end if we are only paying close enough attention.  When Lenny goes to meet John G. or rather Jimmy Grantz (who Teddy has set up for a fall) Lenny asks, You Jimmy Grantz?  Jimmy dryly replies, You expectin any other Jimmies out here memory man? (An obvious reference to Lenny's condition, but the only one in their conversation.)  After Lenny has done away with Jimmy he begins to feel guilty and thinks that perhaps he has killed the wrong man.  And here is the kicker he makes a statement that essentially says that he (Jimmy) knew about Sammy, how did he know about Sammy?  He even brings it up to Teddy when he arrives on the scene, but the fact is Jimmy never said anything to Lenny about Sammy or Sammy's condition, the only reference he made was to Lenny's condition.  Sammy regardless of whether he is real or not is Lenny's alter ego, a personality that he has constructed and conditioned himself to remember so that he can deal with the situation.  The dream about Sammy's inability to save his wife when she puts him to the test is really a dream about Lenny's own guilt.  As Teddy points out later it is quite irrelevant whether Lenny's wife was a diabetic or not although she may have been.  The important points are (Most of which Teddy makes to Lenny) he doesn't know who he is only who he was, that Sammy in his condition will never be able to reconcile the guilt he feels over his wife's death, and that Lenny's memory while failing him in the short term has permanently failed him, in the long term it has shielded him- for what is there for Lenny to do once he has exacted revenge and brought this animal who killed his wife to justice?  Tragically and perversely what Lenny has conditioned himself to is revenge.  Revenge is what gives his life meaning, hope, purpose.  The revenge is never as sweet as he imagines and Lenny goes on conditioning and even manipulating his own mind so that he may remember those things he wishes to and forget those which he does not want to remember.  Never is this more obvious or conscious than at the end when Lenny's latent desire fully manifests itself.  In this final scene not only has he become aware of what he has been doing, not only has he accepted it, but he in fact rather enjoys it.  Why else would he choose to completely ignore it?  A man that truly wants to solve his wife's murder- to bring her killer to justice doesn't choose to completely rule out the possibility that he may have already done so, and at least makes a note of it so he can seriously investigate.  Lenny if he really wanted to bring the killer to justice and resolve the situation would have raised those questions in a way that made sense and sought to answer them.  Lenny wants to be the searcher, the mourner, the vengeful husband he likes playing that role and telling those stories, it is only this that could fulfill him.  Teddy says towards the end (at which point in filmic time he is still alive although in our memories if they have served us correctly tell us he is a dead man.) says, Lenny you're not a killer that's why you're so good at it.  Don't be fooled.  Remember he wanted to forget.  Does Lenny truly feel guilty later?  Sure, but rather conveniently he can't remember why.

However, in Memeneto the essence, the distinctiveness, the brilliance, the virtue is in the story itself.  This is the first film in quite some time that I can honestly say I enjoyed purely for the sake of the story- the film itself.  The film has a real starkness to it making the noir comparison obvious, inevitable and quickly a cliche.  The device used in this film is not as straightforward as most people have initially described and it is certainly not a gimmick.  When I think of gimmicks I think of filmic devices, techniques, or methods that are employed only to befuddle the audience and to show off the filmmaker's ability.  Therefore this film's device is not gimmicky, the story would be just as interesting without the device.  Of course as some people have already observed this film is not only an implausible one, but an imperfect one, but surely we have made bigger concessions for films in the past.  At the heart of the story is the main character Lenny and his inability to as he puts it to make any new memories.  This problem though often comical proves to be simultaneously Lenny's tragedy (making Lenny a very ironic character).  Along with the chaos of a daily life in which he can not remember anything longer than several minutes Lenny is determined to exact his revenge by bringing his wife's killer\/rapist because as he puts his inability to remember the act is irrelevant because his wife deserves justice.  Caught up in Lenny's world or perhaps Lenny in theirs are several different characters.  The motel worker that feels sympathy for Lenny, but not enough to keep him from charging him for an extra room because as he puts it business is slow and Lenny won't remember anyway.  The bartender (Natalie) who is caught up in a drug racket and is as quick to use Lenny and mock him as she is to help him.  Their is a particularly frustrating scene which illustrates this, in which Lenny is trying to find a pen so he can remember what she has said.  And of course Teddy who more than anyone pops in and out of Lenny's life.  Unfortunately Teddy is as close to a friend as Lenny gets to have in this story.  A truly interesting aspect of the story is the even more fragmented phone conversations Lenny has in which he reveals Sammy Jankus, a character who Lenny investigated who suffered from almost exactly the same condition Lenny does the only difference is he could not condition his instincts (according to himself Lenny can).  As the story of Sammy unfolds we see a subplot that is as intriguing as anyone I can remember in recent film and as integral to understanding Lenny as Freud thinks our dreams are to understanding ourselves.  Unlocking the mystery of Sammy and why it is so important for Lenny to remember him sheds light on the whole situation.  In what is without a doubt the most important scene in understanding Sammy in the film and subsequently understanding Lenny we see that Sammy of course without being aware of it kills his wife as she reminds him at least three times over that she needs her insulin shot and as a result of the failed test she goes into a coma and dies.  So in understanding this scene we fully realize Sammy's problem.  Sammy who ends up in a mental institution and doesn't even realize that his wife is dead, loved his wife very much, but is incapable of saving her because of his mental infirmity.  Lenny's problem is the same, but reversed.  Lenny loved his wife very much, but was incapable of saving her and as a result he develops almost the exact same infirmity as Sammy.  Whether Lenny's brain damage is a result of physical trauma (the blow to the head) or the psychological trauma of not being able to deal with the tragedy is arbitrary the condition remains the same.  Still at this point we have yet to fully realize the significance of the connection between Sammy and Lenny.

Although the entire cast is strong, it is James Stewart's finest hour. I remember an interview with him some years ago, in which he said that, to him, a good movie was all about 'moments'. He recalled the scene, in Martini's bar, where he says a prayer. This is my favourite scene in the movie, and is just one of the many such 'moments'. If ever I'm not sure whether I really liked a film or not, I can usually work out the answer by this 'moments' theory. Unfortunately, few movies can deliver the goods, and none match Frank Capra's masterpiece. 10 out of 10 does not tell the whole story. My advice to anyone who has not seen this film, is make sure you do see it before you die - it may even prolong your life!

At no point does it ever threaten to become exciting, but neither does it ever try putting you to sleep. So it's definitely another movie from Rob Cohen.The main problem is that this is a virtual retread (ahem) of the far superior 'Point Break'. The plot? An undercover cop gets involved with a group of fast-living criminals and finds himself with divided loyalties thanks to a beautiful woman. If you've seen 'Point Break' you'll be constantly comparing the two and finding the older movie to be far superior.'Point Break' was well structured, there was a constant pull on the central character, dragging him into the criminal gang until he found himself deeply and inextricably caught up in their activities. Whereas 'The Fast and the Furious''s Officer O'Connor is even more gung-ho than the bad guys. Who can care what happens to the good guy if he wants to be the baddie?It's also lazily directed. 'Point Break' left your heart pounding with its chase scenes or the incomparable parachute drop. Here, there is little that hasn't been seen before and done better. The first car race does work well, but the climactic car chase is far too long, not at all well edited, and falls flat. Likewise it fails to utilise the locations. If you travel through nighttime LA, you see something between a dream and an industrial nightmare - here it is a few neon lit streets that could have been anywhere. What a waste of a great location.Finally the movie has a lazy ending which appears to have been lifted directly from 'Point Break', the cop who is friends with the master criminal in one final confrontation.

He is definitely bound for greater things, perhaps even a role where he can exercise his acting?If Summer 2001 had been a normal movie year, 'The Fast and the Furious' would have done respectable box-office and then sunk without trace.

Jimmy Stewart's coming to grips with his fear of heights at the end of VERTIGO is merely an icing of suspense on an otherwise well baked murder mystery.  In MARNIE, on the other hand, Hitchcock deals with the deeper, darker side of Marnie's psycho-sexual illness.  Mark Rutland's (Sean Connery)constant probing into Marnie's (Tippi Hedren) persona takes on the role of psychotherapy complete with word association games and sound cues that shake Marnie's subconscious.  In one scene Rutland is even seen reading Psycho-sexual Behavior in the Criminal Mind.  Strange night-time reading material for a handsome, newly married businessman of a certain wealth.  In the end, there is a complete pyscho-catharsis as Marnie remembers the traumatic night when as a child she killed the sailor (Bruce Dern), thus unleashing a lifetime of criminal psychosis.Hitchcock's direction is masterful in its depth of portrayal of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams.  The scene in which Marnie experiences a nightmare at the Rutland manse is a perfect example.  As the dream begins, the set is that of her mother's house during a stormy night when her mother's clients came rapping on the door. Marnie awakens, however, in the plush bedroom of the Rutland residence.  Hitchcock's camera takes us into the criminal unconscious and then exits into an opulent, satin covered reality gone psychotic.  This insight helps us to see the troubled Marnie in a sympathetic light.  Hedren's awesome acting talent underscores this as at times she emotes a little lost child persona.  This is very true to character since emotionally, Marnie's development stopped that night when as a child attempted to save her mother.From the beginning of the film, Hedren's portrayal of Marnie is pregnant with a little girl's search for maternal love and approval.  At the end of the film, Rutland's explanation of Marnie's life of theft as the compensatory behavior of an unloved child is simplistic and amateurish from a psychiatric viewpoint.  However, it works for the audience Hitchcock is trying to touch, and it is reminiscent of the doctor's pedantic and sophomoric review of Norman's psychosis in PSYCHO, a horror film rife with simplistic freudian interpretation.

Elliot is like Kaufman in alot of ways.  Some people never really understood Kaufman's peculiar brand of performance, and from the looks of the reviews below, there are plenty of people who don't get Elliot.  It was not always the *content* of Kaufman's performance that made you laugh, it was the fact that he was doing it in the first place.  For those that saw Man on the Moon, think about the Gatsby reading.  It wasn't funny for an audience member at that Kaufman appearance to hear all of Gatsby being read, even LONG after the joke of doing it wore out.  But paradoxically, if he hadn't done so it wouldn't have been as funny.  What's funny is that he had the gumption to go ahead and finish the entire work, regardless of what the effect on his audience was.Likewise, not everything that Elliot does is gut-busting hilarious.  For those of us who like his work, it's the absurdity of what he did that counts.  If you've seen Elliots short-lived TV series Get a Life, than the perversely surrealistic scenery of Cabin Boy makes more sense.  It's supposed to make the viewer feel like there is no normalcy to be found.  I'm not claiming this was some great artistic acheivement, it's simply a good way to facilitate Elliot's brand of comedy.  There was no comfortable, sane baseline in Get a Life to which characters could return, not even a basic continuity of plot between episodes (such as what characters are still alive.)  Likewise, Cabin Boy is simply a string of absurd situations that when taken separately are not really hilarious in that sense.  But taken as a totality, a fan of Elliot's humor appreciates the quirky nature of the film as a whole.I say this not to convince those who don't like Elliot, only to justify the opinions of those of us who do in the face of people who simply write this film off as horrible.  In terms of quality, the TV series was Elliot's best work, but this film definitely has some appeal to some people.  There really is a cult sort of following for this film, becuase some of us are sick of the cookie-cutter comedies that get churned out these days.

There are of course other people to blame, for instance the screen writer and the director.  But Prinze and his co-stars have to take a lot of the blame as well.First of all, what to say about Prinze.  This is another fantastic performance in the fine tradition of his other great works, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Wing Commander, the absolutely horrid Boys and Girls, and about anything else he is in.(The House of Yes, and She's All That, are exceptions)  First of all he can't act.  He is supposed to have an accent, or he isn't, I'm not that positive because it comes in and out.  In certain scenes it is very evident, and in others it is non-existent.  And in any scene that requires real emotion, well, I challenge you to not burst out in laughter.  It is hard.  His main co-star, Jessica Biel does little here to further her career.  She cries a lot, and spurts out cliched dialogue that should drive anybody up the wall.  The rest of the actors, Lilliard, Blucas and Valderrama are sorely underused.  What dialogue they get isn't important to anything that goes on in the movie.  And I'm not sure about Brian Dennehy.  I saw him talking, but I'm not sure if he was acting or mourning the death of his career.  Either way, I'm sure he was only in the movie because he needed the money.  Poor poor Brian Dennehy.The story is executed in an absolutely horrible manner.  The movie has scene after scene, which just ends up feeling more like unrelated event after unrelated event.

All of the characters are underdeveloped, and there are just way to many characters as it is.  The ending is horribly predictable, but by that point you won't really care anyway.The direction was some of the worst I have seen of late.  The acting was bad, and the director should have done something to clear that up.  There were way to many slow motion shots, and way way way too many 360 degree camera shots.  The actors always seem a bit distant and everything feels a bit forced.  There is no tact, it all just happens because, I figure, it says in the script that something is supposed to happen. On the upside, some of the acting and dialogue are so bad that you are bound to get a few good laughs out of the movie.
