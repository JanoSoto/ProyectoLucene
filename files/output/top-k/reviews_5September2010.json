I won't give you the story line and the characters since that's mostly available in all the reviews. What I want to talk about is what it left me with.Message in a bottle (MIAB)is a movie to experience the honesty of real life's twists and turns as we go along. Each characters is honest and sincere (to the extent of being unsure at times) in expressing their challenges. Garret (Kevin Costner) who is still holding on to the yesterday because that gives him comforts and completes his life, in a way. His father, Dodge (Paul Newman), displays his persistence in nudging his son to move along in life and find the courage to face the life (and its unpredictability) yet again. And we have Theresa (Robin Wright Penn), who has lost her love only to find it again. I couldn't help feeling a sense of peace in me after watching the movie. Not because it has some breath taking coastal frames (i would have love to click those shots on my camera; the framing is near perfect), but it allowed me to let go of the notion of holding on to someone to feel the love. Both the lead characters show how to love without boundaries--of time, distances, contrasting lifestyles,and possessing each other. Theresa falls in love with Garret for his love for his wife. For me, it was so pure and honest. She wants him in her life but at the same time respects his love for his wife (who is no more). Garret struggles between his present and past. He doesn't want to let go of either. Isn't it how you or I would have done. The vulnerability, frailty of human nature is very well depicted. Garret can continue to feel the love of his dead wife every moment of his life. Theresa can experience love every moment in her life by setting Garret free to choose between yesterday and tomorrow. As they say, 'If you love something, set it free. If it is yours, it will come back.

The film starts on a very strong footing with a musical photo-montage that deftly conveys the effects if the industrial revolution, overcrowding, and pollution. There is another montage near the end of the movie, as well. These portions of the film are incredibly striking and powerful. It's some of the most evocative film-making I've seen. They are the high points of the film, and are so bold, that they would be reason, enough to see this film.The rest of the film is uneven, but is still watchable and compelling. There is a great deal of provocative material here, and it will have you pondering it for days. The film is set in the future, but most of the sets look very much like the 1970s when it was filmed. One exception is an apartment where the very rich dwell. It has an interesting white- hued futuristic look. The apartment comes complete with what, at the time, was a great futuristic advance-one of the first arcade style video games, created by Nolan Bushnell who went on to found Atari. It probably looked pretty cool at the time, but now it looks like a primitive version of Asteroids. It doesn't help that the actress playing with it does not seem to have a clue how to operate it. Her ships keep dying every second or two, yet she is oblivious to this and acts like she's having a grand time. Couldn't someone on the set have spent a few minutes teaching her how to play it? Despite all that, I thought it was a neat scene, and I was pleased to see that vintage game. I think i remember playing it!You have to make allowances. We are a bit spoiled now.

In the film he plays the son to the Sheik of the first film. The son gets into a bit of trouble when he falls in love with a poor dancer (Vilma Banky) only to have her father kidnap and torture him. The father tells the Sheik's son that the daughter was in on the kidnapping but it turns out this wasn't true so the son must make mends with his own father (also played by Valentino) and go get the woman he loves. For a 68-minute film there's quite a bit of plot going on but in the end it's certainly a better film than the original thanks in large part to a lighter tone that allows some humor as well as a lot more action. It's said that Valentino was embarrassed by his image in the first film so perhaps that's why this sequel is so different in terms of tone. In the original film you could accuse the Sheik of being a truly horrid monster but those traits weren't passed down to the son who we see as an all around good guy. The camera certainly soaks up the sexuality with various shots just fixated on the star and I'm sure his female fans appreciated this. The film also benefits from some nice humor from a couple idiots working for the dancer's father. The action scenes this time out are a lot more impressive as we get more fist fights, more sword battles and of course we have Valentino riding to the rescue of his woman and having to save her from the evil father. Valentino turns in a much better performance here than in the previous movie. He's very charming as the son and manages to be funny in his own right but the more impressive performance comes from the older father. There's quite a bit of make up on Valentino when playing the Sheik from the first film but I thought he did a very good job with the anger the character has as well as a small bit of humor when his wife (Agnes Ayres; returning from the first film) reminds him that he was the same way when he was younger. George Fawcett is good as the bad guy and Banky is also very good in her role. Banky and Valentino have a lot of chemistry together and this is extremely apparent early on when the two sneak away to meet under the moonlight. Who knows where Valentino's career would have gone had he not died and we can't even say he would have survived into the sound era. This final film of his has the actor in good form, which is more than a lot of legends can say for their swan songs.

I've not seen them all, but of all that I have seen, they all rate high in my book. This version of A Star Is Born is very special...it was made just a decade after pictures converted to sound. If we put the action 'right in the moment', one wonders how Norman Maine could have been washed up in less than a decade...especially if he passed all the rigorous criteria to make it into the talkie era. But we must suspend common sense for a time, in order to get into the movie. His star is fading even as we are introduced to him. Wine, women, song, and the theatre of the bombastic have all taken their toll on Norman. Everybody is back-biting him as being washed up in the business...and all seem to know it ...except Norman, that is. Meeting aspiring starlet from the Midwest, Esther Blodgett, is a bit of serendipity for both of them...though with different outcomes. He arranges a screen test, even twists the producer's arm to star her in a vehicle, which is a success. As her star rises, his continues to fade and fade until he is practically dead in the business. If he had problems when he was still a star, you can imagine what horrors he must have endured as his career is eclipsed by that of his wife, now known as Vicki Lester, who has begun to appear in her own highly acclaimed movies...even winning a coveted Academy Award (which Gaynor did in fact win some years earlier...the first actress to be awarded in her category). Humiliation is piled upon humiliation for Norman. Vicki loves him so much that she decides to put the brakes on her own career to take care of him. Norman now sees that he has lost all that he had, but cannot endure this selfless sacrifice his wife is making. If you have not already seen the movie ( are there aliens living amongst us?) or one of its several derivatives, I will stop there, and let you see the movie for yourself. The performances are sensitive, and this was probably one of Hollywood's first efforts to look at itself with some measure of honesty. The viewer connects with Esther Blodgett and her aspirations, and they want her to win. Fredric March draws out the true tragedian that Norman Maine represents, and his performance shows how pitiful one can become when one's life is shattered and dreams and ambitions disappear like snowdrifts in the springtime. Kudos go to Adolphe Menjou as producer Oliver Niles, Lionel Stander as the no-nonsense PR man ( what a contradiction in terms), who has no sympathy for Norman and contributes to Maine's ultimate decline...and to May Robson. May we all have a Granny like her to come to the rescue in our darkest hour. This version of a Star Is Born is best because it is the most dramatic and most honest of the numerous versions. It is raw and gritty, yet it never loses its focus or sensitivity. See the other versions of the movie if you feel you must, but do make an effort to see this one first.

I will nail my colours to the mast right away - in my opinion none of these works surpass the classic play Dr Faustus by the early English dramatist Thomas Marlowe, either in well rounded dramatic appeal or theological relevance . For me, this play although not totally original towers above later and often better known versions of the Faust legends such as Goethe's dramatic poem or Gounod's opera. All of these however transcend Angel Heart. This popular film still carries a (for me) incredible IMDb users rating of 7.3; if compared with them it can be seen as the absolute trash that it was. Assuming the supernatural was what its makers wanted to feature they would have done far better to base their film on Marlowe's great out-of-copyright drama rather than to purchase rights to a twentieth century imitation set in New York, and then stiffen the content by stirring in a gratuitous mix of voodoo rites that had nothing to do with the book they were filming. But they appear not to have known or even cared, whether their aim was simply to create a horror film designed to appeal to impressionable young people or whether it was to provide some sort of morality linked message - ultimately they achieved neither. True the film has a certain superficial gloss which is initially attractive, but ultimately most of it is simply ludicrous and where its search for horror runs unchecked it becomes crude and disgusting.If its makers aimed simply to create a horror film they needed to recognise that horror comes from showing ordinary normal people going about their normal days activities, and then to gradually make the viewer aware that these people are unknowingly only a hairbreadth away from some contingency that will change their lives for ever. Think not of imaginary monsters or supernatural events, but of such ordinary situations as 2,000 people following everyday activities on the Titanic when they were told that most of them were five hours away from spending their last five minutes battling the cold waters of the North Atlantic. Or think of the office workers in the twin towers carrying out their normal daily activities five minutes before the terrorist's 'plane struck and doomed almost all of them. Among films, few create such a sense of horror better than 'Naked Fear' where a young girl quietly trying to earn her living in a strange town suddenly discovers she is on the hit list of a maniacal serial killer. But Parker's films are always flamboyant and he is not the right director to produce such a film. Instead we have a film steeped in necromancy which can raise little more than a chuckle with its juvenile efforts to make our skin creep. Murnau did far better with his silent classic 'Faust', filmed in 1926 but still supporting an IMDb rating of 8. Did the makers of 'Angel Heart' ever watch this? I have not read their original novel but I understand its scenario was entirely set in New York. Parker has attempted to rake up the horror by shifting the scene to New Orleans and bringing in some lurid voodoo rites. Voodoo beliefs provide much of interest but I felt they were better featured in such simple low cost B movies as 'French Quarter' or 'Barravento' and I do not know what place they were supposed to have here unless it was to provide justification for some of the extremely crude and gross, but totally pointless images - often verging on the obscene - gracing this film.

Among films, few create such a sense of horror better than 'Naked Fear' where a young girl quietly trying to earn her living in a strange town suddenly discovers she is on the hit list of a maniacal serial killer. But Parker's films are always flamboyant and he is not the right director to produce such a film. Instead we have a film steeped in necromancy which can raise little more than a chuckle with its juvenile efforts to make our skin creep. Murnau did far better with his silent classic 'Faust', filmed in 1926 but still supporting an IMDb rating of 8. Did the makers of 'Angel Heart' ever watch this? I have not read their original novel but I understand its scenario was entirely set in New York. Parker has attempted to rake up the horror by shifting the scene to New Orleans and bringing in some lurid voodoo rites. Voodoo beliefs provide much of interest but I felt they were better featured in such simple low cost B movies as 'French Quarter' or 'Barravento' and I do not know what place they were supposed to have here unless it was to provide justification for some of the extremely crude and gross, but totally pointless images - often verging on the obscene - gracing this film. Ultimately for me the only real emotion these raised was extreme distaste. I can only hope that those responsible for the planned re-make are determined to avoid repeating Parker's fiasco.

It is just AMAZIIIIIING !!!! I watched this movie with pretty low expectations as the previous film which I watched of Mike Judge was Extract and to be frank I did not find it entertaining at all !!(Infact it was so-so !!) So just for time pass I searched for positive reviews of his other films. I saw that Office Space had got a good rating and decided to watch it, and lo and behold !!! I was simply blown over. I mean this is seriously CLASS A stuff man !!! When I saw that this movie had released in 1999, I was just simple taken aback !!! How come such a wonderful director like Mike Judge made a movie like Extract ! (I mean c'mon Extract was nothing compared to this !) The direction was spot on. The acting was spellbinding. The script was well written and cohesive and I would like to mention something special regarding the acting.Ron Livingston, David Herman and Ajay Naidu were Awesome but the person who really steals the show and takes the cake(pun intended !) here is hands down Stephen Roots aka Milton Waddams.He just sinks his teeth in the role which fits him to the T and which according to me is nothing short at all of an award worthy performance(Meaning just look at him, he is so cute; has an amazing screen presence and the way in which he underplays his role, it speaks volumes about the actor). Jennifer Aniston was okay in a role that did not require her to display ample histrionics.What to say, if you are a fan of Mike Judge and even have a passing interest in movies related to office life, just give it a go (Trust me, you are not going to regret it!) I cannot remember myself laughing out loud so much at a movie recently and watch out for the rap at the end of the movie !P.S. Last words which I would like to say to Mike Judge Sir are- Sir please just continue to make movies like Office Space and kindly don't disappoint us with movies like Extract. Thank you !!!!

The Sixth Sense was a great movie, sure, but the ending wasn't twisted. A shocker, yes, but not twisted. Even the killer from Se7en, Fincher's masterpiece, wasn't a twist ending. A twist, yes, a surprise, hell yes, but a twist ending? No.With Michael Douglas and Sean Penn headlining a cast that also includes James Rebhorn and Armin Muehler Stahl, you wouldn't expect a twist at all. No, with these actors you'd probably expect maybe a nice little thriller or maybe even a comedy of sorts, and that's why The Game is such a masterful film. These actors are so completely taken out of their element it's scary.Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich man who's unhappiness in life has been noticed by his brother, the care-free, James Dean-ish Conrad Van Orton. Conrad gives an unthanking Nicolas a card for CRS, a company that will make Nicolas' life better. And so begins a long, perilous, and unimaginably entertaining psycholgical mind game where Nicolas' life doesn't just turn upside down, it turns inside out.I loved Se7en, so I had high hopes for The Game and this film didn't at all disappoint. In fact it raised the bar so much that I've made a point to see every Fincher film since. (Fight Club and Zodiac are also fantastic films) The camera-work is awesome, with each scene having and holding a growing sense of claustrophobia.The acting is just superb. I don't think Michael Douglas is able to turn in a bad role. He's just as good in this as he was in Wall Street, and will be when Wall Street 2 comes out this month. Penn is also very good, showing his stripes as the free-wheeling brother. Deborah Unger is beautiful and underrated as an actress, I wish she'd be in more movies like this. Stahl and Rebhorn show why they are also some of Hollywood's most underrated blood.To sum it up, FANTASTIC MOVIE. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the film as a whole, awesome. The ending absolutely blew me away. Don't just rent this one, buy it, because you'll want to watch it again and again.

The Sixth Sense was a great movie, sure, but the ending wasn't twisted. A shocker, yes, but not twisted. Even the killer from Se7en, Fincher's masterpiece, wasn't a twist ending. A twist, yes, a surprise, hell yes, but a twist ending? No.With Michael Douglas and Sean Penn headlining a cast that also includes James Rebhorn and Armin Muehler Stahl, you wouldn't expect a twist at all. No, with these actors you'd probably expect maybe a nice little thriller or maybe even a comedy of sorts, and that's why The Game is such a masterful film. These actors are so completely taken out of their element it's scary.Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich man who's unhappiness in life has been noticed by his brother, the care-free, James Dean-ish Conrad Van Orton. Conrad gives an unthanking Nicolas a card for CRS, a company that will make Nicolas' life better. And so begins a long, perilous, and unimaginably entertaining psycholgical mind game where Nicolas' life doesn't just turn upside down, it turns inside out.I loved Se7en, so I had high hopes for The Game and this film didn't at all disappoint. In fact it raised the bar so much that I've made a point to see every Fincher film since. (Fight Club and Zodiac are also fantastic films) The camera-work is awesome, with each scene having and holding a growing sense of claustrophobia.The acting is just superb.
