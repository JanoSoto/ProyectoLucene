On the other hand to write it off as terrible with a blanket statement is a pretentious way of trying to establish oneself as an artsy person who really gets it.To judge this movie accurately you must first realize that it is philosophically deep as a mud puddle.  It is not about art.  It is about creating a world and putting you in it.  From the standards of the time it did this very well with special effects. Now many of these effects look very fake (the cardboard box and PVC gun turret on the death star)  Also many of the scene changes look dated.  Datedness is inevitable for any movie, so to criticize a film based on this is to criticize practically the whole media.Instead the way to address the film is to find the distinguishing feature which has totally altered the movie industry.  Off the top of their head a cynic would say that budgets have been forced up because other movies have to meet the special effects standards set by Star Wars.  This in turn has made independent low budget film go way underground.  This is true to some extent, but by this reasoning any movie with advanced special effects would have done the same, and it was bound to happen anyway.  In terms of plot to explosions ratio Star Wars isn't that bad.  A devout Star Wars fan would say, 'Well, duh Star Wars'My response to both is that what was new about Star Wars and still makes it good viewing today is not shiny new visual effects, but having a futuristic world with advanced technology and still having disgraceful examples of that technology. I will call this concept jalopies in space.  The idea of craft like the Millennium Falcon with technology to go light speed being held together with duct tape and rubber bands is why Star Wars is still relevant today.  The feel of the beat up helmets, which the wing men wear, or Han Solo's 'just hit it with a hammer' attitude were a new way of presenting the future.

Prior to this, although a technologically advanced society might be morally degenerate in a 1984 novel sort of way, the technology would have no chance of malfunctioning unless it wanted to kill people.  Also the jalopie feel of the movie is not an attempt at comic relief.  It is an attempt at realism that works well.  The dirty feel of the film also applies to other genres to a lesser degree.  In the 90's computer generated effects have been knitted into all genres.  You know the look of these graphics too clean, too smooth.  Having a too perfect look is good if that is what one is aiming at otherwise it's not so good.  A realistically rough look can be applied to any visual media.This realism makes perfect sense.  It is the sort of thing that cannot be replaced with shiny new computer graphics.  I do wonder how much of the jalopies in space feel of the movie was intentional. In the special edition rerelease Tatooine is computer generated and looks really clean.  A one horse planet shouldnÕt be clean.  On the other hand the damaged rebel clothing and helmets had to be intentional, because it would be easier to get a matched set of new looking helmets or clothing than a beaten up look.  In terms of Episode I being clean this makes sense because it represents a period of time when the universe is economically stable and deals with affluent classes.My final recommendation is to see this movie regardless of who you are, because it is referenced ALOT.

Unfortunately, the movie suffers the most from being just plain boring....everything good is buried under bad filler.

Instead, let's skip the ad and go straight to Secrets Of How To Be An Oscar Winner Without Working For A Living. First thing is, don't write a script which involves real people. Why? Because that's real hard. Second thing is, don't write a script which involves real situations. Why? Er, well, because that's real hard, too.Third thing is, remember the other two. Begin, then, by circumventing all the labours necessary to delineate shades of human behaviour and instead. . . write about aliens. Aliens are great because no-one's ever met one (I think) and therefore, aliens can behave in ways no-one can argue with. They can be flip, they can be funny, they can be miserable, they can be, when you think about it, even a little. . . perverse. So let's do a movie about a bunch of aliens, in the guise that this is, er, about Alienation (no, no, no not Alien Nation). Because alienation is really an incredibly in thing in Western culture, we're on to a winner right away. Then let's chuck in a big storm (no, no, no not Perfect Storm) and wait for the acclaim to ring forth and, possibly, awards to roll in. Hello, The Ice Storm. No, wait a minute, wrong fillum. This is American Beauty. Well of course it is. A look through the microscope at American Life. At real people like, sort of, Kevin Spacey, too young, too personable, too attractive ever to emulate James Mason chasing Lolita but no matter, he's off another planet anyway (although don't say so, not in your script). Then there's his wife. She's from Mars as well. (But again, don't admit that she's really, really normal). And his daughter. Young. Sassy. Articulate. Troubled. Alien-ated. Came from Pluto, but don't mention that either, she's normal, honestly, really really normal. Like the neighbours who film everyone (like they do on Pluto, which is why young sassy Alien Daughter never thinks to report them to the cops). One of them's a general or colonel or something, he used to lead the Neptune Third Division (Armored). But hey, keep that quiet, too he's normal, too. And, oh, almost forgot, the Virgin from Venus who has a way with the transmogrification of flower petals. She's a friend of the Daughter from Pluto. Well, they would be. Now then. There's the cast of characters. Not a brushstroke of reality amongst the lot of 'em. BUT this really doesn't matter. Because what you tell the world, what the publicists tell the world, what the director tells the world, what the cast tell the world, is. . . They're actually all of this world. So everyone believes it. Honestly. It's true. Just tell people, all these beings are Americans and, hey, Americans will believe it! Yeah! Right on! Tell the world, too, that this is serious, in-depth, Highly Significant cinema and, well, they'll believe that, too. So there you go. Loadsa money. Lots of awards. And everyone out there really believing that America is like this -- hell, even your neighbours are like this -- because when something as loaded with honours as this comes to town, it just has to be true life.  If you've got a script like this in mind, please email me. I've an idea we could do something on a Martian with a fetish for washing up liquid (quite normal, dear, quite normal) who showers pine cones on unsuspecting sub-James Masons until the day comes when an Ice Storm causes his spaceship to explode whilst being filmed from a General and his son from Neptune. This will be entirely realistic and a slice of life from Oakland (for example) that no film-maker has yet had the bravery or intellectual rigour to even attempt. That it will also be pretentious (space) junk is, truth to tell, quite besides the point.

And, oh, almost forgot, the Virgin from Venus who has a way with the transmogrification of flower petals. She's a friend of the Daughter from Pluto. Well, they would be. Now then. There's the cast of characters. Not a brushstroke of reality amongst the lot of 'em. BUT this really doesn't matter. Because what you tell the world, what the publicists tell the world, what the director tells the world, what the cast tell the world, is. . . They're actually all of this world. So everyone believes it. Honestly. It's true. Just tell people, all these beings are Americans and, hey, Americans will believe it! Yeah! Right on! Tell the world, too, that this is serious, in-depth, Highly Significant cinema and, well, they'll believe that, too. So there you go. Loadsa money. Lots of awards.

This will be entirely realistic and a slice of life from Oakland (for example) that no film-maker has yet had the bravery or intellectual rigour to even attempt.

With the infamous stories of spite, jealousy and rivalry that emerged from the set during the past year, along with the three stars vying to wear the best scantily clad attire possible, this has in part fueled an increased awareness among the teenagers. Everyone else probably went along to compare the faithfulness of another TV\/film adaptation, or to sigh at the possible ruin of yet another classic TV series. The movie seems to be built around stereotypes of the stars type cast persona, and surprisingly the screenplay seems to be doing all it can to back this up. If this film doesn't get Lucy Liu beyond her `Ally McBeal' credibility, or at least in terms of box office figures, it is hard to say what will. Her performance is definitely enjoyable, but once again, she seems to struggle past the dominatrix bitch that has probably influenced her film work since day one as Ling Woo. Yet she is the only Angel that can convince one of her suitability to the role. Cameron Diaz's transition to an action style flick hasn't allowed her to leave at home the familiar tricks of goofiness employed in `My Best Friends Wedding' with equally cringe-worthy scenes in both films and Drew Barrymore's heartfelt sincere moments seems to retread everything from `Ever After' to `Never Been Kissed.'Despite the comic implementation of Bill Murray, he seems to have few funny things to do, let alone lines to proclaim. While I enjoy Matt LeBlanc's performance on `Friends' for many weeks throughout each year, is it not possible to allow Joey Tribianni resting time during the film release season? If LeBlanc continues to reprise the dim actor in film appearances, it is likely that his movie career will become washed up after the comedy series comes to an end. It is probably Tom Green, Drew Barrymore's real life boyfriend delivers the goods in his hilarious and very welcome performance. The remainder of the film's characters seem to be hurriedly stolen ideas and spoofs of the quintessential film villain, which the screenplay makes no attempt to develop except in a abrupt change of pace that doesn't really work when culminated with false dramatics.Music video director McG has a somewhat coveted film debut with the popularity of the film at the box office. However, the surprisingly well executed action of the first thirty minutes of ANGELS begins to sag after this point, and never quite redeems itself even at climax. The opening credits of the film are in itself slotted together like a music video. Unfortunately, the light-hearted elements of the film are often a major let down, and are unfortunately few and far between, while I questioned whether or not I was obliged to laugh dutifully. This is merely the fault of the screenplay and its seventeen writers, in which its flaws are covered up with the obviously big-budgeted and purposefully, planted action sequences. It is quite difficult to believe that such a large pool of writing ability was unable to come up with a stronger story. The film's sound track is a mixture of 70s, 80s and 90s music, along with a few new additions. There's nothing too special here, but the music is often used at unnecessary moments in many sprinkled handfuls throughout. Obviously the biggest treat of the film was the Matrix-like action style effects. Sadly enough, I don't think they know what they're doing in there either.CHARLIE'S ANGELS the TV series was big, loud and cheesy. Merely it was all about the look of the show, and at the end of the day, what people thought of it. The film probably does credit to this factor.

Part of the problem is the inevitable comparison to Night's stunning 1999 breakthrough The Sixth Sense. I've read a number of comments that urge viewers not to make such comparisons, but that's neither sensible nor realistic. It's the same director, the same star, the same genre (supernatural mystery) and both are built around an unexpected ending. To suggest that one shouldn't compare the two is like a car manufacturer asking the public not to compare its '99 models to its '00's. The second difficulty in honestly evaluating it has to do with how so many film-goers, including myself, really admire Night's sensitive, understated, almost religious approach to his craft. The man is really trying to enrich the medium, to elevate the art form (okay, I'm sounding pretentious) in a Hollywood climate of stale formula, empty commercialism and happy brainlessness. I like to think of him as the little guy valiantly standing up to all the Jerry Bruckheimers of the world.So I went into the theatre in a state of great anticipation, tempered perhaps a smidgen by the somewhat uncertain buzz that hovered around the film in the days leading up to its release. And it had me in its grip all the way through its taut, hyper-observant opening on the train, where Night is meticulously extracting the drama and suspense from the everyday (sad, hapless Willis flirting with an attractive young sports agent who has had the misfortune to take the seat next to him) and on through the early passages where Willis is coming to terms with the shocking reality of having survived a train wreck which should have killed him. There is in these scenes the wonderful sense that so many great movies share of seemingly ordinary events slowly building towards something EXTRAordinary.But then the film runs into some problems that are very difficult to discuss without giving things away. The first mis-step (or series of mis-steps) is the repetitiveness of the scenes involving Sam Jackson's memorably obsessive Elijah character explaining to Willis his incredible theories on what he might be and represent. There must be four or five of them and they all pretty much cover the same territory, ending similarly with Willis thinking it over then unconvincingly brushing him off with something to the effect of YOU have issues. Now stay away from me. Another flaw, that has been pointed out in many other comments, is the superfluous presence of Willis' wife played by Robin Wright Penn. There is nothing wrong with her performance at all, and she does figure in a major way in Willis' history and the direction his life took. But as far as the present is concerned, she needs to be pulling the story in some direction, creating some kind of tension or conflict and she never does. I understand that Night conceived this as a trilogy and I'm sure she will play a much bigger role in the sequels (should there be any) but in the self-contained universe of this picture, she is a classic example of under-development.There are other scenes that just don't ring true or are just too much. The gun-wielding scene with Willis' son was wildly unbelievable. (Though some others thought it was laughable, I did find the weight-lifting sequence to be charming.) The flashback where the camera closes in and lingers on Willis as a young man as he is about to make his big, life-altering decision, was mawkishly overdone. And the whole bravura climax where Willis finally accepts his destiny made me squirm. It held my interest, of course, and I wanted very much to go along with it, but it all seemed wrong and ill-considered.Still, I find myself being very protective when others lash out against it. Mainly because the ending, the famous twist, is flat out brilliant. Not only does it cast everything you've seen up to that point in a whole new light, I LOVE the idea of stopping films abruptly and at an unlikely place, rather than wrapping everything up nice and neat. It makes the film live on in your mind afterwards and, to be truthful, despite its flaws (which I'm inclined to forgive considering all the things it does well) this is a movie that I very much look forward to seeing again.

I understand that Night conceived this as a trilogy and I'm sure she will play a much bigger role in the sequels (should there be any) but in the self-contained universe of this picture, she is a classic example of under-development.There are other scenes that just don't ring true or are just too much. The gun-wielding scene with Willis' son was wildly unbelievable. (Though some others thought it was laughable, I did find the weight-lifting sequence to be charming.) The flashback where the camera closes in and lingers on Willis as a young man as he is about to make his big, life-altering decision, was mawkishly overdone. And the whole bravura climax where Willis finally accepts his destiny made me squirm. It held my interest, of course, and I wanted very much to go along with it, but it all seemed wrong and ill-considered.Still, I find myself being very protective when others lash out against it. Mainly because the ending, the famous twist, is flat out brilliant. Not only does it cast everything you've seen up to that point in a whole new light, I LOVE the idea of stopping films abruptly and at an unlikely place, rather than wrapping everything up nice and neat. It makes the film live on in your mind afterwards and, to be truthful, despite its flaws (which I'm inclined to forgive considering all the things it does well) this is a movie that I very much look forward to seeing again. For the all the clues, the symbolism, the exquisite technique, and the rare opportunity to witness the work of a director whose mind is not dead, like so many others, but wide awake.After all, a Night misfire is quite a bit better than a Michael Bay direct hit.

I had no clue about the nature of `forbidden'ness before watching the movie. I have never read the original work, nor seen the Kubrick's version of the movie. Worse yet, I missed the initial credits and about the first five minutes of the movie as well, which apparently would have given me a good indication of how the movie ends (After being told what I missed, I thought it was a good thing that I missed it). All these resulted in one of my memorable-movie-watching experiences ever.The film is visually appealing, with a very graceful background score, which continues to ring in my ears as I write this sentence. Ever since `The Mission', Ennio Morricone is one of my all-time favorite music directors. The performances by the cast are commendable. (I beg to differ from some earlier opinions that Irons look lost in many places; I think he is exceptional and has almost brought Humbert's mental nature alive in to celluloid). A very decent technical work overall.But the very nature of the subject matter, and a script that supports it well, lies in the core of `Lolita'. Mild Spoilers What makes Lolita controversial? Is it the incest or the pedophilic nature of the love or both. If it is both, which one outweighs the other? I mean, is it possible to have the same strength of reluctance with one of these elements missing?And finally how much is Lolita or Humbert responsible for what had happened? I think the movie answers these questions as it flows along, if you could watch it with an open mind to the different characters in front of you.

A good part of the film's text is dedicated to educating the audience on what it is a navy diver does and why it's important.That aside, we're also shown the life of an extraordinary person. In one great scene after another, we watch Carl (Cuba Gooding Jr.) defy the rules and find the courage to accomplish his goals no matter what stands in his way. His determination is truly inspiring. One exchange between Carl and Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DiNiro) sums up the movie. Sunday asks Carl why he wants to become a master diver so badly. Carl's answer is, 'because they said I couldn't have it.' And that is the foundation. There is literally no reason that this man cannot achieve master diver status. He has the drive, the desire and the ability. The only thing that stands in his way is a military that still will not accept change. 'Someday' it says. But 'not now.' 'The country isn't ready yet.' Carl's resounding answer is, 'it's happening right now, whether you like it or not.'Even though this is a true story, don't go in expecting realism. Men of Honor is very much a Hollywood movie.

It's not bad, but it's not worth buying the DVD.  Hugh Jackman was the best thing about it. He brings depth to his tortured Wolverine. The movie basically is about him and why he is the way he is. The rest of the X-men are secondary, in fact, Storm and Cyclops are just one-dimensional characters thrown in the mix to trade lines with Wolverine and display their powers on occasion. Although I'm not a Halle Berry fan any more (ever since her hit-and-run incident), she could have used a few more lines or something to do in the film, other than wear white contacts and make wind (I said make wind, not break wind).  Cyclops is basically the cocky pretty boy.  I couldn't care less about his character. From what I remember about the comic book, he was the leader. This Cyclops couldn't lead the Backstreet Boys, although he looked like he could fit in with them.  And I just kept wondering, if his glasses can come off so easy, why not fix them so they don't? You're a frickin' super hero, Cyclops.  You can blow the roof off a train station but you can't fix some glasses to stay on your head?Jackman is great though. He should be getting a lot of good stuff in the future, following the footsteps of Russell Crowe (who's following Mel Gibson).  He kept me interested enough to watch the whole movie.  And it's understandable; super hero movies are not easy to make, especially when there are a million comic book readers who watch every move, question every action and put websites up to display their displeasure at events that don't coincide with the comic books its based on. X-men II doesn't hold any interest for me personally, although I'm sure I'll end up seeing it on video when there's nothing else to rent, which is about the rating this film should get Good video rental when there's nothing else to rent.

When I saw this film, it was apparent that no thought, no research, no intelligence went into the writing at all.Let's start with the basic premise of the film.  An asteroid is discovered and we have 17 days until it hits.  What do we do?  In the real world, we bend over and kiss our butt goodbye.  There is absolutely *no* way a mission such as this could be planned, trained-for and executed in this time.  17 days wouldn't be enough time to prepare a standard shuttle launch, much less one with this type of mission.  This movie blindly ignores this fact.I am always distressed when films treat people as mere cattle, props to use while pounding a point home and then forget.  In the open of the movie, New York is hit with a barrage of fragments, presumably causing untold death and injury.  In the real world, people might even see fit to comment upon this with the people they meet.  In Armageddon, this scene is presented as eye-candy (it *does* look pretty good) and then is promptly forgotten by everyone involved.  No one talks about it.  No one cares.There is so much that is wrong with Armageddon.  The science involved in splitting an Asteroid the size of Texas with a nuclear bomb implanted only 800 feet into surface (trust me, when you have driven 800 feet into Texas, you haven't driven very far.)  The idea that that bomb could divert the two large fragments enough to cause them to miss the Earth in the time they had left.  The amazing gravity on the asteroid.The thing is, I can enjoy a good fantasy movie.  Films do not always have to work by the rules of the reality I live in.  I can accept The Force and other such fanciful ideas, as long as the movie is true to its own reality. But Armageddon chose to place itself in *our* reality, and should have attempted to follow the rules that apply here.Put simply, this movie is pure trash.

The plot is well contured and grows logically, the characters are powerful, the scenes are very tensed and sometimes spooky, the actors play great. Especially Michelle Pfeiffer - am i out of line if i think that after this performance Michelle would definetely deserve an Oscar? Well she does.Well with so many good points, what's wrong with the movie? Why does it have an average of only 6,9? Why did i give it only a 7? Because of its lack of originality. During the whole film you have the feeling of seing a new Hitchcock movie. Well it's not Alfred Hitchcock, it's Robert Zemeckis, or more like... Al-bert Zemetchcock. The same tensed situations, of a rich guy living in a huge house, the same scenes with creaking doors and reflections in the mirror, the same many bathroom scenes, but this time the accent is not on the shower, but on the bath tub. This is related to Psycho. But it's not only this. The same haunted house story that we've seen many times. The same revenging ghost, the same situations with woman seing things and his husband doesn't believe her, the same (many) situations in which you are extremely scared and it turns out to be the dog, the same resurrection of the bad guy, who wakes up a few times before totally dying.In conclusion, a movie that's worth to be watched. Alone, in the dark. Just like Psycho. Otherwise you won't get scared. And without getting scared, it's no point in watching it.ORIGINALITY 4, PLOT 6, CHARACTERS 8, ACTORS 10 (Michelle is fabulous), DIRECTOR 8, OVERALL 8. TOTAL 7 out of 10.

Instead, it features a rather standard horror movie strings score that works rather effectively. While it isn't traditionally scary, the music (and quite masterful camerawork at times) really works to create a feeling of unease.So the lead actor is a pretty shoddy actor, and there is a little bit too much 80s trash involved, but this is an admirable attempt to take the Freddy motif to the next level.
