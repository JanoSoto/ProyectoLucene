","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 September 1999","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I should say  warning, contains spoilers  and I will do so to appease the IMDb staff, but this review contains no more spoilers than the trailer for the film.I am not a lawyer.  I am not a professor of law.  I am not even a law student, but I can certainly tell you that there are huge problems with this film, and I am not just talking about the double jeapordy law.  If that was all that was wrong with the film then perhaps you can overlook it.  But every frame, every inch of film carries more questions than answers.  For one, is it really that easy to fake your own death and then start a normal life with millions of dollars in your bank account?  Can you just change your name and then get a new birth certificate, drivers license, social insurance number and passport?  Don't they require you to show some proof of ID before you become someone else?  The answer is obviously yes.  Could you imagine if it wasn't a requirement to do so?  Anyone with credit problems could walk into the store that gives you new identities in the movies and ask for a new name.  The conversation must go something like thisPerson wanting to change name  Hi, I'd like to change my name. Name changing clerk Okay.  Can I have your current name?Person wanting to change name  No, I don't want to give you that. Name change clerk  Okay, can I have your old SIN or your passport ID number or drivers license number? Person wanting to change name  No not that either.  I don't want you to know that stuff because I just framed my wife for the murder of me and if I give you that information it will come up that I am legally dead and then I would have problems collecting the 2 million dollar insurance claim that I have and that would mess up my plans. Name change clerk  Okay, just sign right here please. ( she says with a valley girl tone and a glistening smile )So seeing as that is not the case in real life, then logic dictates that they would have to ask for some form of ID in order for the name change to be legal, and if that is the case then this movie is impossible right from the get go.  Simon or Johnny or Nick or whatever his name is in the film is a successful business man and he therefore has to fill out tax forms and that means that he has to have a SIN and he probably travels so he has to have a passport.  Wouldn't the authorities then wonder why his other ID was that of a dead man?  You would think they would.  That is just a hunch.  But again, all this is heresay as you can overlook tiny errors like this if the film is redeemable.  Sadly this one not only isn't redeemable, it down right stinks.  And I mean it stinks badly.As everyone has mentioned before, the trailer for this film gives it all away.  Why should anyone even see this film when you know that she is convicted of a crime that she didn't commit, you know she goes to jail, you know she is hell bent on revenge, you know she is going to have a confrontation with her husband and do the talking killer thing explaining to him that she can't be convicted of the same crime twice and you know that a resemblance or an ersatz Samuel Gerard is going to chase her around the country only to finally be the only one that believes her story.  I was honestly waiting for Newman to go fetch him a chocolate donut, the ones with the little sprinkles on top.  Or for him to say  do you know that Devlin and McGregor made 7 and one half billion dollars last year?  That company's a monster.  Or for him to say.... well you get the idea.  Tommy Lee Jones has the same everything that he did in the fugitive, only in here he is one dimensional and he is pathetically boring.  His character had a chance to be interesting because they briefly gave him a background and then they inexplicably forgot about that background.  To the makers of the film, Tommy's chance at character development goes no further than showing him in a bar sipping a shot of whiskey.  Just because his eyes are black like a doll's eyes, it doesn't exempt you from interesting dialogue.  Sometimes a dark and frustrated stare can work wonders in the right place, but not when I know nothing nor will I ever know anything about what makes Jones tick in here.  And that is the scripts fault for being so incredibly shallow and thin.  Actually thin is complimentary.  This script was anorexic.  I actually forget what Jones' name was in the film!Double Jeapordy is the kind of film that has nothing going for it.  When you have a film that can't even utilize Jones properly then you have problems.  He is in the class of actors like ( IMHO ) Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Kevin Spacey, Michael Rappaport and Omar Epps, guys that can keep you interested in a bad film just by their mere presence.  But not in this one.  Jones can do nothing to make his character work and consequently there is nothing that can make this film work.  I mean please, are you going to tell me that when you stuff someone into a coffin, you are going to keep them alive and just let them die over a period of what? seven or ten days?  If you were so concerned with this person, why not kill them first and then stuff them into the coffin?  This is just one of the tiny discrepancies in the film.  And as a reviewer and as a reader of reviews, you know it is a bad sign when you start cutting up tiny things like this.  This film is awful and the saddest thing is, it had so much potential to be a great film.  It had a good director ( Beresford ) and two really good leads ( Jones and Judd ) and a good supporting role by a vastly under appreciated actress (Gish) who is basically window dressing, she is given nothing to do.  The only reason this film opened strongly is because of Jones and my bet is when American Beauty is released North American wide on October 1st, it will bury this piece of garbage in the same cemetery that they found this script.  This is truly an awful film that leaves a stench so bad that it may be right outside your window right now.  Can you smell it?  I know I sure can. 1\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 1999","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I should say  warning, contains spoilers  and I will do so to appease the IMDb staff, but this review contains no more spoilers than the trailer for the film.I am not a lawyer.  I am not a professor of law.  I am not even a law student, but I can certainly tell you that there are huge problems with this film, and I am not just talking about the double jeapordy law.  If that was all that was wrong with the film then perhaps you can overlook it.  But every frame, every inch of film carries more questions than answers.  For one, is it really that easy to fake your own death and then start a normal life with millions of dollars in your bank account?  Can you just change your name and then get a new birth certificate, drivers license, social insurance number and passport?  Don't they require you to show some proof of ID before you become someone else?  The answer is obviously yes.  Could you imagine if it wasn't a requirement to do so?  Anyone with credit problems could walk into the store that gives you new identities in the movies and ask for a new name.  The conversation must go something like thisPerson wanting to change name  Hi, I'd like to change my name. Name changing clerk Okay.  Can I have your current name?Person wanting to change name  No, I don't want to give you that. Name change clerk  Okay, can I have your old SIN or your passport ID number or drivers license number? Person wanting to change name  No not that either.  I don't want you to know that stuff because I just framed my wife for the murder of me and if I give you that information it will come up that I am legally dead and then I would have problems collecting the 2 million dollar insurance claim that I have and that would mess up my plans. Name change clerk  Okay, just sign right here please. ( she says with a valley girl tone and a glistening smile )So seeing as that is not the case in real life, then logic dictates that they would have to ask for some form of ID in order for the name change to be legal, and if that is the case then this movie is impossible right from the get go.  Simon or Johnny or Nick or whatever his name is in the film is a successful business man and he therefore has to fill out tax forms and that means that he has to have a SIN and he probably travels so he has to have a passport.  Wouldn't the authorities then wonder why his other ID was that of a dead man?  You would think they would.  That is just a hunch.  But again, all this is heresay as you can overlook tiny errors like this if the film is redeemable.  Sadly this one not only isn't redeemable, it down right stinks.  And I mean it stinks badly.As everyone has mentioned before, the trailer for this film gives it all away.  Why should anyone even see this film when you know that she is convicted of a crime that she didn't commit, you know she goes to jail, you know she is hell bent on revenge, you know she is going to have a confrontation with her husband and do the talking killer thing explaining to him that she can't be convicted of the same crime twice and you know that a resemblance or an ersatz Samuel Gerard is going to chase her around the country only to finally be the only one that believes her story.  I was honestly waiting for Newman to go fetch him a chocolate donut, the ones with the little sprinkles on top.  Or for him to say  do you know that Devlin and McGregor made 7 and one half billion dollars last year?  That company's a monster.  Or for him to say.... well you get the idea.  Tommy Lee Jones has the same everything that he did in the fugitive, only in here he is one dimensional and he is pathetically boring.  His character had a chance to be interesting because they briefly gave him a background and then they inexplicably forgot about that background.  To the makers of the film, Tommy's chance at character development goes no further than showing him in a bar sipping a shot of whiskey.  Just because his eyes are black like a doll's eyes, it doesn't exempt you from interesting dialogue.  Sometimes a dark and frustrated stare can work wonders in the right place, but not when I know nothing nor will I ever know anything about what makes Jones tick in here.  And that is the scripts fault for being so incredibly shallow and thin.  Actually thin is complimentary.  This script was anorexic.  I actually forget what Jones' name was in the film!Double Jeapordy is the kind of film that has nothing going for it.  When you have a film that can't even utilize Jones properly then you have problems.  He is in the class of actors like ( IMHO ) Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Kevin Spacey, Michael Rappaport and Omar Epps, guys that can keep you interested in a bad film just by their mere presence.  But not in this one.  Jones can do nothing to make his character work and consequently there is nothing that can make this film work.  I mean please, are you going to tell me that when you stuff someone into a coffin, you are going to keep them alive and just let them die over a period of what? seven or ten days?

I don't think I'll ever look at another piece of paper, bag or leaves being blown by the wind again.  The imagery and the poetry evident throughout the film is staggeringly beautiful - all the true romantics at heart should appreciate this.  It's part of what I loved best about the film - the poetry and beauty in all things.As you can see, I am a great fan of this film.  So, I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid of taking a look at the darker, yet often funny side of life, those who are willing to see the uglier sides of themselves, those who are willing to look closer and find the beauty of truth.

This is by far Annette Benning's finest role.  I anticipate that American Beauty will sweep the top three Oscars in March, not to mention the other nominations it deserves for Supporting Actor (Cooper), Original Screenplay, Cinematography and Production Design.  And who is the new hottie, Wes Bentley?  I hope to see a lot more of him!

However, it also expands on the direction he took in Chasing Amy by dealing with subject matter and concepts that are personal and thought provoking. Dogma goes beyond the dick and fart jokes, which are reassuringly present, and gives the viewer something to think about.The film deals with thoughts on religion, Catholicism mainly, in a way that pokes fun at the institution but does not deride it. Dogma is by no stretch of the imagination an anti-Catholic movie. It embraces religion and points out the potential and actual problems that can occur within any religious institution. The film's comments and contents are definitely meant to be taken with a grain of salt.The cast is great and there are many instances of hilarious viewing, usually Jay and Silent Bob, as well as very sensitive and expressive moments from the various actors.In the end, Dogma is a thoroughly fun and thoughtful viewing experience that both old and new fans will enjoy. A movie outside the typical fare that is worth spending your money on seeing.
