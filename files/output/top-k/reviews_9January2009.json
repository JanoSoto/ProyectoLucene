I guess the over the top approach may be necessary in order to depict the life of drug addicts. The saddest story here is concerns an old woman. It was almost heartbreaking to watch the transformation from healthy woman to a drug addict.The story is quite simple. The main characters are Harold Goldfarb, his girlfriend Marion, his friend Tyrone and his mother Sara Goldfarb. The movie spans the four seasons and show the transformation of the characters because of their drug addiction. The sad aspect is that they have dreams like regular people. Harold and Tyrone plan on selling drugs and earn enough to get the perfect drug. This plan ends in bigger problems. Sara goldfarb, on the other hand, takes to drugs for different reasons. She is plagued by loneliness and depression. Out of nowhere, she gets a call from a TV show and she gets excited. She starts eating diet pills in order to reduce her weight. This then causes more problems.Ellen Burstyn's performance is one of the best I have ever seen. The portrayal of a lonely old woman who suddenly feels reenergised due to the drugs is absolutely amazing. I almost was in tears towards the end. It was great to watch the first few scenes where the boring routine of an old woman is portrayed perfectly. Jared Leto as Harold has also done well. He has expressive looks and his character seemed credible. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly fit the role and her performance was great, yet I feel her character has not been explored much in this movie. Marlon Wayans as Tyrone is also top notch but I also feel his character has not been explored much. The most often mentioned praise about this movie is regarding the music. The background score by Clint Mansell is quite amazing, though I still prefer his score for the Fountain(That was beautiful!). Music is a big reason why this movie works as it is perfect for the tone and emotions in the movie. The last scene had some great music especially which effectively brings out the sadness and hopelessness of the characters. Darren Aronofsy deserves special praise for certain scenes which show the gradual degeneration of Sara Goldfarb. The orgy scene is also effectively done and the emptiness in Marion is shown effectively in these scenes.I can't think of any negatives except for the over the top nature. I know the over the top necessary for drug movies. But I still don't have much of an affection for that style. It seems as if the director tried to force it into people's heads that drugs are harmful. Still it maybe necessary to highlight an evil which has been glorified by certain sections of pop culture.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2009","score":"","review":" This is one of the movies which are so depressing that it is not likely to be watched again by most people.

I have had many good things about his movies yet I haven't been in the mood to see them. At least until now. This movie is basically one of the best sci fi movies that have ever been released. That's weird considering I am not a sci fi fan at all. Of all the brainless action movies and pseudo sci fi movies that have come out recently, this is one movie that can actually stop and make you think. It has the usual sentimental moments of Spielberg that the critics hate. Instead here it is not an overdose with cute kids and harmless aliens. It is actually a tense atmospheric thriller which accurately portrays the emotions of a man who believes he is innocent and is on the run from the system he once championed. This movie is quite relevant especially in developing countries where the police have more power and people are even jailed without properly establishing their guilt. In this way it is not exactly a science fiction movie and it is more of a movie that can actually appeal to a lot of people who value justice and human rights.The storyline sounds quite ridiculous. But the execution - perfect. The story is about a policeman named John Anderton who is in charge of a system called Precrime. Precrime is a system where suspects are prevented from committing a crime. John Anderton fervently believes in the system and even justifies it to FBI agent Colin Farrell. He arrests these suspects based on the previsions(premonitions) from Pre Cogs which are three bodies lying in a pool of milk. The trouble here is that John Anderton himself is accused of the crime of murder by the system. He runs as a fugitive from the law and a nationwide hunt is in progress to catch him. The plot is quite confusing because of the advanced technology being described and in that sense it could be described as the most complex movie Spielberg has ever directed. The beauty is that everything comes together so perfectly in the end. The length of the film is not a hindrance at all.Tom Cruise is somewhat of an underrated actor. Although I don't think he deserves an Oscar, he has had some pretty intense performances. This one, particularly, carries the film and IMO might be one of Cruise's best performances. His confused emotions when his system betrays him are quite good and so is his acting with regard to the scenes with the memories of his son. Colin Farrell is OK but he doesn't have much to do, he should have been given a bigger role. Samantha Morton is also pretty good in her role. The special effects are quite advanced. Even though I don't really care about special effects, the special effects in this are quite impressive. What I loved most about the movie was the cinematography. The dark tinge reminded me mostly of directors like Fincher. The camera-work gives a dark and grainy feel to the whole movie and portrays the mindset of the main character. The complexity of the plot is not a hindrance as it doesn't have many loose ends. For this, praise must be given to the screenplay writers, Scott Frank and Jon Cohen who have written a fluid screenplay which moves smoothly. The background score should also have special mention. I feel this movie also has a feel of a horror film, in the sense that, it has some really tense sequences. The scene with John Anderton in the ice cold bathtub when the spiders check him out is of special mention.I can't really think of many negatives to this movie. Maybe the number of action scenes could have been reduced. But I still couldn't think of it as a flaw because I really enjoyed them.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't seen much of Spielberg's movies.

The fact that some described it as a semi porno gave me a bit of a shock, since McDowell was a well known and successful actor around that time. Why could they get him for such a movie? But I looked aside from that and took the chance because I adore his acting.The movie starts with nudity, and it's beautiful. Two people in love. Young, careless! Nothing like what you're about to see later in the movie. So you get something sweet and pretty that plays with your mind. Having said that, I love the costumes! They are so simple, yet so perfect, that they make you believe this movie.Tiberius played by Peter O'Toole, shows the madness that Rome stood for! A man with all that power. Of course he makes a whore house! For all the wealthy men of Rome to have endless pleasures for the money they own! It wouldn't surprise me if people in that time did have this much sex, nothing to do except war over power. But in this movie, it shows what women had no power at all, over themselves or their body. Which is so tragically displayed. These brutal sex scenes, you should not feel pleasure but disgust. Because they show nothing else but discrimination against women in that time.But one woman in this movie comes close to having power, even power over Caligula. His sister Drusilla. You can see how much she loves him and knows him. The look she gives him every time she sees him losing it more and more, is outstanding. He just drifts away and loses interests in what really matters. She's like an angel. You can see in a heartbeat that Caligula doesn't care for his wife as much as Drusilla. Which is sad, oh so sad. I love the scene where Drusilla doesn't wake up. When Galigula takes off all her clothes and starts kissing her all over, trying to give her a reason to wake up... heartbreaking. He realizes then, how much she meant to him, and falls apart. Completely. Although Caligula got the power over Rome with the death of Tiberius, you can see that no one respects him. Everyone looks at him like a child with a golden ring, and nothing more. It's only his name that gives him the time he got in the thrown. They know he knows nothing of his doings. And their right all along. People on the streets don't even know his face, because he's so self loving and does nothing for his country! Just stays in his palace, fulfilling his own pleasures. And then suddenly he thinks he can satisfy the people of Rome with yet another whore house... great idea? that scene I find a bit silly. But the idea behind it is OK.I made it through this movie because of the beautiful acting of Malcolm McDowell, Terresa Ann Savoy and Helen Mirren. This is truly a sad and tragic story, but it all fades away with these hardcore sex scenes! If they hadn't been so long, detailed and wet, the movie would have been much better to watch. But STILL I think the movie wouldn't have had such affect if the scenes weren't as shocking. I think it only shows the brutal truth!

A powerful performance by Al Pacino, several notable supporting roles and a story that's so eye-opening and fully developed are a few of the top reasons anyone watching this film today would call it great. So why nothing? Was it ahead of its time, or not far ahead enough? The only possible explanation is the latter. Though 9 years had passed since the last Godfather film, clearly Hollywood and its critics were not ready for something similar yet not as immaculate.Al Pacino is dynamite from start to finish as Tony Montana, a criminal immigrant from Cuba who works his way up the ladder of the cocaine business, becoming everything and losing it all. The story is the classic rise and fall of a nobody, of a man with nothing but an iron conviction, even if his values aren't the same as our own. Pacino nails the strong-willed no- fear attitude of Montana, but is equally as commanding when Montana borders on the insane and the emotional. He simply has a magnetism about him as an actor and that's something you have or you don't. Pacino flaunts it in this film and without him it wouldn't have been nearly as powerful.You simply can't compare Montana to Michael Corleone of The Godfather--Pacino helms both roles excellently, but they're different characters who handle power in different ways. As for the rest of the film, to compare it to The Godfather is unfair. Not only is it unfair to compare any film to something as masterful as the 1972 classic, but they're not even about the same thing one the Mafia, the other Miami drug cartels. Yes, both involve ordering hits and bloody ones at that, but it's a whole other story. Oliver Stone writes a great script full of memorable scenes and lines that are no less unforgettable than The Godfather. The only places where Scarface can't measure up--and reasonably so--are in cinematography, art direction and directing. Brian DePalma does good stuff, and he should be praised for his work on the film, but it's not a stainless piece of film-making. Simply put, if you feel forced to compare, which perhaps critics in the early 80s did, Scarface can't hold a candle to The Godfather, but there are a number of reasons it should not have been harshly judged.In supporting roles, Motana's best friend Tony played by Steven Bauer is a refreshingly nice, likable, character; Robert Loggia as the big drug guy Frank Lopez also commands attention in contrast to Pacino's character; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, given the difficult roller coaster ride part of Montana's little sister excels in her role, and even Michelle Pfeiffer, as stoic and loathsome as her love interest character is, has some moments. All in all this is a good ensemble--Pacino doesn't run the show as much as he steals the scenes.When viewed independently from similar material, the only really noticeable weaknesses of Scarface are it's poor soundtrack choices and miserable electronic score when something orchestral would have brought out the best in this film. Whoever made the decision at the top to let the film be scored like that really shot a hole in the film that while small, was in a bad place.Scarface is a great film that through its violence, swearing and general depiction of an extravagant but depressingly hollow and terrible lifestyle, manages to tell the story of the hunger and abuse of power in this country through one man in a complete and thorough way. There are no gaps in this storytelling and the script is full of lines that as sick, twisted and inherently flawed as Montana is, make him a compelling figure with considerably interesting things to say.

All in all this is a good ensemble--Pacino doesn't run the show as much as he steals the scenes.When viewed independently from similar material, the only really noticeable weaknesses of Scarface are it's poor soundtrack choices and miserable electronic score when something orchestral would have brought out the best in this film. Whoever made the decision at the top to let the film be scored like that really shot a hole in the film that while small, was in a bad place.Scarface is a great film that through its violence, swearing and general depiction of an extravagant but depressingly hollow and terrible lifestyle, manages to tell the story of the hunger and abuse of power in this country through one man in a complete and thorough way. There are no gaps in this storytelling and the script is full of lines that as sick, twisted and inherently flawed as Montana is, make him a compelling figure with considerably interesting things to say. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Anyone who watches Brian De Palma's re-imagining of Scarface has to wonder why it didn't get so much as a nod for an Academy Award. A powerful performance by Al Pacino, several notable supporting roles and a story that's so eye-opening and fully developed are a few of the top reasons anyone watching this film today would call it great. So why nothing? Was it ahead of its time, or not far ahead enough? The only possible explanation is the latter. Though 9 years had passed since the last Godfather film, clearly Hollywood and its critics were not ready for something similar yet not as immaculate.Al Pacino is dynamite from start to finish as Tony Montana, a criminal immigrant from Cuba who works his way up the ladder of the cocaine business, becoming everything and losing it all. The story is the classic rise and fall of a nobody, of a man with nothing but an iron conviction, even if his values aren't the same as our own. Pacino nails the strong-willed no- fear attitude of Montana, but is equally as commanding when Montana borders on the insane and the emotional. He simply has a magnetism about him as an actor and that's something you have or you don't. Pacino flaunts it in this film and without him it wouldn't have been nearly as powerful.You simply can't compare Montana to Michael Corleone of The Godfather--Pacino helms both roles excellently, but they're different characters who handle power in different ways. As for the rest of the film, to compare it to The Godfather is unfair. Not only is it unfair to compare any film to something as masterful as the 1972 classic, but they're not even about the same thing one the Mafia, the other Miami drug cartels. Yes, both involve ordering hits and bloody ones at that, but it's a whole other story. Oliver Stone writes a great script full of memorable scenes and lines that are no less unforgettable than The Godfather. The only places where Scarface can't measure up--and reasonably so--are in cinematography, art direction and directing.

Mind you, I could probably say the same about most movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. He is one of those directors who produces very long, boring movies that move at a snail's pace and are really difficult to withstand for more than a few minutes at a time. Movies such as 2001 A SPACE ODYESSY, DR. STRANGELOVE and SPARTACUS are examples of this kind of movie.As many other commenters have pointed out, Stephen King didn't like this movie because it was not faithful to the book. In fact he hates it so much that 15 years or so after, he made his own movie entitled STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING. I've never seen the other version. But anything with his name attached is normally worth watching so I'll at least make the effort to track it down. It really couldn't be any worse than this tripe churned out by Stanley Kubrick.I've heard THE SHINING being referred to as scary, terrifying, masterpiece, classic, thrilling, horrifying and so on. Yeah right! This movie does not even come close to producing anything equating to those words. The only horrifying thing about it is how it became so popular.Where can I start with the problems of this movie? Let's start with Jack Nicholson. I thought Jack Nicholson was great as The Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN, but in this he doesn't even seem to be acting. He plays a character who is supposed to become insane as the story progresses. Yet it is very clear from Jack's first scenes that his character has already got a few screws loose. And that stupid Here's Johnny! line. Was it supposed to be scary? Funny? What? Who knows? It was just downright stupid as far as I'm concerned. Yeah I know it was a reference to Johnny Carson, but what's Johnny Carson got to do with this movie? The answer absolutely nothing at all.And Shelley Duvall. What can I say about her? She looks like Olive Oyl from the POPEYE cartoons. How ridiculous! Somehow the viewer is expected to believe that her character and Jack are married with a kid. Yeah right! There is no chemistry between the two actors at all.Finally, Scatman Crothers. I have great respect for this actor. He appeared in TWILIGHT ZONE THE MOVIE and it was one of the very dull segments. Yet his superb performance gave it credibility and the story touched upon my emotions. In THE SHINING, however, Mr. Crothers is there just to be killed and I don't suppose he was bothered about his character being killed off considering how lame the movie is. It was probably just a paycheck used to pay off a few debts. And the ridiculous thing is that the character in question never dies in the book.I honestly can't believe that people think this movie is better than classics such as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN and THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. But yet this movie has a higher IMDb rating and is sitting very comfortably on the top 250 chart. Nonetheless, that won't alter the fact that the three mentioned movies put THE SHINING to shame any day.Stephen King's SALEM'S LOT was infinitely superior to this movie. Personally I think the director of that movie, Tobe Hooper, should have been asked to direct THE SHINING. We would have had an infinitely superior movie. Trust me. I've seen plenty of Mr. Hooper's movies and he very rarely fails to disappoint. THE FUNHOUSE was a low point of Mr. Hooper's career but even that movie looks like Oscar-worthy material compared to THE SHINING.Overall, I would not recommend this at all. I've not seen STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING, so I can't really recommend it just yet.

That's exactly how I felt the first ten minutes into The Believer. For years I had been hesitant to watch it because I didn't think it sounded plausible and my 14 year old macho aversion to artsy crap wouldn't allow it. But as I got older and a little more appreciative of the independent scene I became more open to artsy crap. So it finally was on Thursday of this week I sat down to watch the Believer and I was blown away.The movie tells the story of a young Jewish man named Danny Balint who suffers a crisis of identity because not only is he a Jew he is also a Nazi. At first it seems like a bad joke, but that is the point it makes you ask why? Why on earth would a Jew hate his people and himself so much as to become a Nazi? This is the hook of the movie; you want to know Danny and what's going through his head. As the movie shows us, there are no clean and easy answers to these questions.Danny is a tortured man, bright and articulate yet confused. He is torn between his faith and the utter helplessness in the Jewish conception of God. This struggle between helplessness and self sufficiency leads him to find empowerment in Neo Nazism. Throughout the movie we watch Danny as he engages in contradictory actions, such as an attempted bombing of a Synagogue and a reading from the Torah, and argues amongst himself and others over what it really means to be a Jew.Ryan Gosling gives a perfect performance as Danny. He manages to embody the character's internal struggle without making it seem silly or simplified. His performance gives the role the complexity it deserves.Carla Moebius gives a startling performance as the daughter of a Fascist and the girlfriend of Danny. The horrible secret that is revealed about her halfway through the movie is tragic simply because of the look of shame she gives Daniel as he watches her have sex. The dynamic between the pleasurable act of sex and the look on her face sent chills down my spine.The ending is both satisfying and ambiguous, leaving you to discuss it with your friends at length. It's also deep in symbolism and invites multiple interpretations. It demands to be watched more than once.

Swimming With Sharks seems to owe more than a little something to Dilbert. The movie is more about Corporate America than Hollywood. There are a lot of white-collar touches that apply to offices, cubicles and other such rather than the Hollywood spin machine. Like Robert Altman's The Player, this is one of those thrillers about people in the biz who are driven to the breaking point by how cruel L.A. can really be.The film's writer\/director George Huang himself was a former personal assistant to some of the biggest names in Hollywood, has described the movie as 20% autobiographical. Much of this one is said to be based on his experience working for noted mega-mogul producer Joel Silver for Columbia Pictures. So it should come as no surprise what-so-f**king-ever that his first crack at film was his own life story.Surprise, surprise, huh? Well, more or less.Despite Kevin Spacey being the big name in this movie and him getting first-billing, Frank Whaley (Career Opportunities) is the star of this one. Most of anything with him head-lining is a sign of a bad movie (Cold Dog Soup and The Jimmy Show), but this is one of those where he shines because he's allowed to. He's not the most versatile actor, the best-looking or the most charismatic. He's had a rep as being something of the life-long bit player. But when he's given a movie, script and part which allows him any headway, he damn well manages to make the most of it.Spacey, being one of Hollywood's finest and renown, is able to pull off the screaming antagonistic drill-instructor and the restrained, tortured hostage here pitch perfectly. Whaley effectively plays the green and naive wide-eyed rookie to the Hollywood spin machine with his usual perfection, but when the other shoe drops, he doesn't quite pull off the scorned, disgruntled employee seeking revenge. His Jeckyll isn't as convincing as his Hyde. He doesn't scare us. He never seems truly unhinged. Maybe that's why Whaley sticks to the youthful deer-in-the-headlights. Whaley doesn't really seem as demented and unhinged as he should in his captor scenes. He's best as a whipping boy--which is why he plays so many.1994 was the official year for Spacey. He got his breakout with the TV series Wiseguys, and made the big screen transition with worthwhile fare like his Oscar-winning supporting role in The Usual Suspects, The Ref, Se7en and this. Spacey monopolized himself in the '94 as absolute talent (my term).Benecio Del Toro, the Brad Pitt of Mexico (someone else's quote, believe me, I never dubbed him such) has a quickie cameo as Spacey's assistant who's given his three weeks notice and is on the way out, making way for Guy. But not before giving Whaley some final parting words of wisdom. Protect his interests, serve his needs. What you think means nothing. What you feel means nothing. You have no brain. He yells all the time. It's a lose-lose situation. This job is a fast-track shortcut to the top and if Guy does right and keeps his mouth open wide to catch all of Buddy's crap, he may very well be someday on the same mantel as Buddy and his former assistants. Everything Guy'll ever need to know about his job, he learns on day one.Enter Dawn Locklard (Michelle Forbes of Guiding Light and 24), another powerful Hollywood producer who Guy doesn't have the best first meeting with. She doesn't show a lot of warmth, which explains why she's a producer.She herself is angry and cynical, and throughout the course of the film, we will see why. She eventually warms up to Guy and asks him out. Guy is stunned. But she needs Buddy on her side and is interested in him getting behind her new project. Guy sees this as an opportunity. Her new project for the studio, Real Life may just be Guy's window of opportunity. She seems to be interested in Guy because he's the most real thing she's seen in the Valley for the longest time. But does she really feel something for him or is she just using him? Is Buddy two-faced and back-stabbing or is Dawn? Guy no longer knows what's real and what's what? Although when Guy starts to show some spine after a lot of Buddy's tantrums, the payoff is almost evenly matched with the artificial sugar scene. Buddy gets to emotionally, verbally (and at times, physically) abuses Guy (and apparently all his assistant's) on every possible occasion. He also gets to skewer just about everyone who crosses his path.Swimming With Sharks isn't a featherweight comedy for a slow night about a bullying boss like the trailer lead you to believe. It's a film which deals with white-collar office comedy and torturous drama. Shifting from a lightweight comedy to a torturous thriller. It's sort of schizophrenic thing. We're laughing heartily one minute and horrified the next. A lot of time, this one keeps us guessing as it criss-crosses from Buddy torturing Guy to vice-versa.But there's a lot to this movie (maybe too much) about this movie that rings true to life. A lot of moments filled with the harsh insights and disillusioned truths that one learns from living an uncharmed life. And so there's illuminating light and lessons, as well as laughs. Not to mention some great heavier moments where ugly secrets about Buddy and... well, surprisingly Dawn are revealed.The plot is over-developed and the ending is more poetic than anything else.But most of the movie really does does work and really does sticks with you... like all the great ones do.by Dane Youssef ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" by Dane Youssef Now here is a movie for those looking for an attack on white-collar corporate office life, the spinning gears of Hollywood.

Whaley effectively plays the green and naive wide-eyed rookie to the Hollywood spin machine with his usual perfection, but when the other shoe drops, he doesn't quite pull off the scorned, disgruntled employee seeking revenge. His Jeckyll isn't as convincing as his Hyde. He doesn't scare us. He never seems truly unhinged. Maybe that's why Whaley sticks to the youthful deer-in-the-headlights. Whaley doesn't really seem as demented and unhinged as he should in his captor scenes. He's best as a whipping boy--which is why he plays so many.1994 was the official year for Spacey. He got his breakout with the TV series Wiseguys, and made the big screen transition with worthwhile fare like his Oscar-winning supporting role in The Usual Suspects, The Ref, Se7en and this. Spacey monopolized himself in the '94 as absolute talent (my term).Benecio Del Toro, the Brad Pitt of Mexico (someone else's quote, believe me, I never dubbed him such) has a quickie cameo as Spacey's assistant who's given his three weeks notice and is on the way out, making way for Guy. But not before giving Whaley some final parting words of wisdom. Protect his interests, serve his needs. What you think means nothing. What you feel means nothing. You have no brain. He yells all the time. It's a lose-lose situation. This job is a fast-track shortcut to the top and if Guy does right and keeps his mouth open wide to catch all of Buddy's crap, he may very well be someday on the same mantel as Buddy and his former assistants. Everything Guy'll ever need to know about his job, he learns on day one.Enter Dawn Locklard (Michelle Forbes of Guiding Light and 24), another powerful Hollywood producer who Guy doesn't have the best first meeting with. She doesn't show a lot of warmth, which explains why she's a producer.She herself is angry and cynical, and throughout the course of the film, we will see why. She eventually warms up to Guy and asks him out. Guy is stunned. But she needs Buddy on her side and is interested in him getting behind her new project. Guy sees this as an opportunity. Her new project for the studio, Real Life may just be Guy's window of opportunity. She seems to be interested in Guy because he's the most real thing she's seen in the Valley for the longest time. But does she really feel something for him or is she just using him? Is Buddy two-faced and back-stabbing or is Dawn? Guy no longer knows what's real and what's what? Although when Guy starts to show some spine after a lot of Buddy's tantrums, the payoff is almost evenly matched with the artificial sugar scene. Buddy gets to emotionally, verbally (and at times, physically) abuses Guy (and apparently all his assistant's) on every possible occasion. He also gets to skewer just about everyone who crosses his path.Swimming With Sharks isn't a featherweight comedy for a slow night about a bullying boss like the trailer lead you to believe. It's a film which deals with white-collar office comedy and torturous drama. Shifting from a lightweight comedy to a torturous thriller. It's sort of schizophrenic thing. We're laughing heartily one minute and horrified the next. A lot of time, this one keeps us guessing as it criss-crosses from Buddy torturing Guy to vice-versa.But there's a lot to this movie (maybe too much) about this movie that rings true to life. A lot of moments filled with the harsh insights and disillusioned truths that one learns from living an uncharmed life. And so there's illuminating light and lessons, as well as laughs. Not to mention some great heavier moments where ugly secrets about Buddy and... well, surprisingly Dawn are revealed.The plot is over-developed and the ending is more poetic than anything else.But most of the movie really does does work and really does sticks with you... like all the great ones do.by Dane Youssef ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"9 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" by Dane Youssef Now here is a movie for those looking for an attack on white-collar corporate office life, the spinning gears of Hollywood. Swimming With Sharks seems to owe more than a little something to Dilbert. The movie is more about Corporate America than Hollywood. There are a lot of white-collar touches that apply to offices, cubicles and other such rather than the Hollywood spin machine. Like Robert Altman's The Player, this is one of those thrillers about people in the biz who are driven to the breaking point by how cruel L.A. can really be.The film's writer\/director George Huang himself was a former personal assistant to some of the biggest names in Hollywood, has described the movie as 20% autobiographical. Much of this one is said to be based on his experience working for noted mega-mogul producer Joel Silver for Columbia Pictures. So it should come as no surprise what-so-f**king-ever that his first crack at film was his own life story.Surprise, surprise, huh? Well, more or less.Despite Kevin Spacey being the big name in this movie and him getting first-billing, Frank Whaley (Career Opportunities) is the star of this one. Most of anything with him head-lining is a sign of a bad movie (Cold Dog Soup and The Jimmy Show), but this is one of those where he shines because he's allowed to. He's not the most versatile actor, the best-looking or the most charismatic. He's had a rep as being something of the life-long bit player.

She knows very little about her mother, from whom Nick was divorced when she was a baby, and is completely unaware that she has an identical twin sister living in England. Annie James is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in London with her mother Elizabeth, a successful fashion designer. She knows very little about her father, from whom Elizabeth was divorced when she was a baby, and is completely unaware that she has an identical twin sister living in America. And then, quite by chance, Hallie and Annie meet when they are sent to the same summer camp. They quickly realise that they are in fact sisters, and decide that it is their mission in life to reunite their parents. To achieve this ambition they hit upon a plan. Hallie will return to London, pretending to be Annie, and Annie will return to California, pretending to be Hallie. The one obstacle to their plans seems to be Nick's fiancée Meredith, attractive and seemingly charming but really scheming and mercenary. There are plenty of plot holes in this film. I cannot see any divorce court, on either side of the Atlantic, sanctioning the bizarre arrangement Nick and Elizabeth evidently made about the future of their children. (The courts are often reluctant to split up siblings, especially twins). The British aristocracy do not normally send their children to American summer camps. (Elizabeth's father, with whom she lives in a huge London mansion, is evidently from the upper classes). Is it really conceivable that neither Nick nor Elizabeth would have told their child that she has a sister? And is it conceivable that neither of them would have seen through the deception that was being practised upon them, especially as Lindsay Lohan's English accent, both as Annie and as Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie, often slips? (Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie is eventually exposed by her grandfather, and Annie-pretending-to-be-Hallie by her father's maid). Fortunately, this is the sort of film in which plot holes do not really matter, being a romantic comedy, not a serious, realistic drama. It effectively revives the comedy of remarriage, a sub-genre of romantic comedy which deals with a divorced or separated couple who rediscover their love for one another. This type of film was very popular in the thirties and forties (The Philadelphia Story is perhaps the best-known example) and to a lesser extent in the sixties (the original Parent Trap was made with Hayley Mills in 1961) but has become less common in recent years. There was perhaps a reason why Disney decided to remake this film and revive the genre. The story differs from most rom-coms in an important respect. Most romantic comedies focus upon the lovers themselves, but in this one Dennis Quaid as Nick and Natasha Richardson as Elizabeth end up playing supporting roles to the triumphal entry of Lindsay Lohan onto the world stage. This was, of course, the film which first launched Li-Lo onto an unsuspecting world, and it is she who steals the show. One film was all it took to establish herself as the most self-assured, charismatic and lovable child star of the age, just as Hayley Mills was in 1961. (Like Hayley, Lindsay plays both sisters). The focus on the film's child star makes it ideal for a family audience, whereas most romantic comedies are intended primarily for adults. I've never actually seen the 1961 version so I can't compare the two, unlike many reviewers who seem to have a definite preference for one version or the other. The 1998 version is no great masterpiece, but it is an amiable and likable family comedy with a great little heroine. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2009","score":"","review":" Hallie Parker is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in California with her father Nick, a successful winemaker.

Looks like the movie kicked me in the pants, so I could get somewhere in the world, and I thank it from the bottom of my heart.Based on the novella The Body, from the collection Different Seasons by Stephen King, the story introduces us to the four main players who live in the town of Castle Rock, Oregon, circa 1959. Sensitive, wunderkind scribe Gordie Lanchance (Wil Wheaton of Star Trek The Next Generation) still mourns the accidental death of his understanding jock brother Denny (a young John Cusack) while being invisible and a disappointment to his equally mournful parents; tough kid Chris Chambers (strong River Phoenix of Little Nikita and Dogfight) tries to be a good kid, despite coming from a family of reprobates.Wild-eyed and hearted Teddy Duchamps (Corey Feldman of the Lost Boys films) vocally dreams of army service, wanting to please his mentally unstable, abusive, WW II vet father, who burnt the boy's left ear against a hot stove, and goofy coward Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell of Sliders and Crossing Jordan) who provides loyalty and comic relief to the group. He also tells them about the location of a dead boy's corpse, after inadvertently hearing it from his older scumbag brother and a friend.This leads to a two-day trek for the four, during Labor Day weekend, through the Oregon wilderness. They seek fame and adoration, but they find themselves, especially during a dramatic moment over the corpse with a band of knife-wielding hoods, led by town bully Ace Merill (Kiefer Sutherland, who was probably practicing his future, iconic lead role on the hit, serialized TV action drama 24). Growing up isn't a solid timetable.Director Rob Don't call me Meathead Reiner (This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, The Bucket List) hugs the Oscar-nominated adapted screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon (Starman, Mr. Brooks) tender and tense, funny and tragic, humble and honest, beautiful and poignant, sweet and thoughtful. In their pre-teens at the time, the four players perfectly play their roles, reminding us of ourselves. Wheaton's Gordie is a reflection of me, and I decided to be a writer, after seeing the film. The pie-eating tale he tells to his buds over a campfire is a hoot and a half.However, it's the performance by Phoenix (who should have been also Oscar-nominated for echoing James Dean and Marlon Brando) that's forever haunting since he and his role met unfortunate demises, making the film all too powerful. Heart-breaking is the moment when he tell Gordie-crying-about a good deed he did, but goes wrong due to his family's rep.Kudos have to be given to Rick Dreyfus (Jaws, Silver City, W) who narrates the film and plays the adult version of Gordie, a successful writer with his own kid, who notes to a friend how weird he gets when he's writing. The 1950s rock music soundtrack suits the film and is enjoyable, even to those who didn't grow up in the era.Though I didn't have friends, let alone close ones, growing up because I was (and still am) a weird, old young man, I look at my childhood, and like others, find it temporary. I wish my friendships were like Gordie and Chris eternal (despite one's passing, in the case of the film).

The cinematography here is some of the finest I have ever seen. It also won a much deserved Oscar for Cinematography. There is a stunning dream sequence that is also very well done. All the filming creates the perfect mood for a Gothic tale of romance and tragedy. One thing Hitch was the best at was creating mood and tension and this movie highlights his skill perfectly. He accomplishes this through fantastic cinematography and direction that capitalizes on the use of shadows and tense angles, as well as a great mood-setting musical score. The lighting effects are also used with great skill.Fontaine is perfect as the nervous, insecure new bride. Her acting doesn't have a single insincere note in the whole of it. I understand Hitchcock helped achieve this superb performance out of a relatively young and inexperienced performer by telling her Olivier despised her because his wife, Vivien Leigh, lost the role to her. Hitch also told her the rest of the cast hated her as well. Can you imagine how insecure this would make a young, inexperienced actress? Olivier is at the prime of his physical beauty here, and does a superb job of handling the various depths of his character as they are revealed. Mrs. Danvers is enough to send shivers down your spine - what a creepy woman.Parts of the movie do seem to drag a little slow. And it seems to run long as well. But stick with it, and your interest will come back around. There are unexpected twists near the end.

Action, adventure, explosions, amazing graphics, poor writing, confusing plot gizmos, and ridiculous solutions to problems. Seeing how things are about half and half, I gave Titan AE 5 stars. Now, while this may seem like an unfair score for a movie that is so obviously visually aesthetic, the other 5 empty star spaces are because of a more in depth lack essential movie elements.To me, what was most disappointing about this movie was the absolutely unfathomable solution to problems that characters came up with. The main character, in a matter of minutes, not only is able to magically figure out how the enemy ship works, but also how to find his friends with the it's navigation. Every time there was a problem, someone instantly had some kind of ridiculous idea that always worked. For 15 years, the ship that will save humanity was hidden in a cluster of huge, shifting, floating ice boulders and maintained no damage from them. Gimme a break. As an animated movie, I would imagine that it would be somewhat geared towards kids, but I couldn't really see any of the characters or dialog to be that appealing to a younger demographic. There were too many obligatory curt remarks exchanged between them and a good deal of I must of heard you wrong, it sounded like you said.. kind of clichés.Its really too bad though. Between the over the top visuals and full cast of star actors, its pretty clear that Fox Animation was looking to make a blockbuster hit. Unfortunately, it made half as much as it took to make and for someone who loves animation, I really couldn't wait for the damn thing to end.

But it's not all comedy. It is also about crime. And the part when Hooch dies (near the ending) is very sad - I didn't like that part. The movie also has some characteristic stuff from the 80's, which is a good thing. The movie's best known actor is Tom Hanks, here in one of his early roles. I can't say I like him very much. I don't think he's that great as an actor. He often portrays ridiculous and annoying characters and his humor is usually too much clown-like, but here he is good. Even here he shows some of his typical trademarks, but far more natural and not in an irritating way. Tom Hanks is hilarious in this one, something unusual on him. This is one of the few (if not one of the only) films which he isn't annoying.Tom Hanks's character, the police investigator Scott Turner, is more of an obsessively neat guy and funny at the same time, however with a major tendency for anger (he loses his temper easily and yells a lot).Reginald VelJohnson is more funny than great, but one can't deny that his character, detective David Sutton, has sense of humor.The dog, however, is the real star of the movie and naturally a great actor. Beasley the Dog, a Dogue de Bordeaux, portrays Hooch, apparently a foul-tempered dog that loves to destroy things, but once we get to know him better, we realize that he's got an even temper. By the way, that dog drools in such a way that's unbelievable.

I would have loved to see the return, or at the very least a cameo, of Catwoman to explain her mysterious final appearance at the end of Batman Returns, which I'm sure Burton would have included. Furthermore, did we forget about Harvey Dent who was played by Billy Dee Williams in the first film? Why on earth was his character replaced by not only another actor, but another actor of a completely different race....? According to my research, Billy Dee Williams had a contract stating that he would reprise his role as Harvey Dent\/Two Face if there were to ever be a sequel created including his character. But apparently his contract had to be bought out JUST so Tommy Lee Jones could be recast as Two Face..... Evidently Warner Brothers would rather spend MORE money to replace an actor than to simply call back an actor and remain true to the character and connected to the previous films. CONTINUITY PEOPLE. Stick to it. You get more fans with continuity than you do families with cool-looking graphics. Idiots. Another thing that bothered me was the 20 second explanation to Harvey Dent's transformation into Two Face on a news broadcast, which could easily be missed if you have to lean over to scratch your knee. Unlike the other 2 films, Batman Forever took literally no time in explaining the background of its villains. They were thrown in there with no depth to their characters, wearing silly suits just to entertain the kiddies. I'm the sure the film was great in the moment and appealed greatly to 11-year-olds with flavor-of-the-year actors such as Jim Carrey replacing originally cast actor Robin Williams as The Riddler, but never will Batman Forever be looked back on as a decent film of it's time, or a legacy such as the two blockbusters preceding it.

Not to mention a standout performance by Talia Shire, who beautifully plays Adrian, Rocky's pet shop dame.The film follows the storyline of Rocky (Stallone), a leg-breaking loan shark working for mob boss Tony Gazzo.

The final fight scene, in my opinion, was the best in the entire series. Filled with viscous hooks and jaw-breaking uppercuts, it's a sequence of such exhilarating action you cannot take your eyes off it. A case of the brawler vs. the boxer, by far one cinemas best fighting scenes and most climatic endings ever illustrated on the big screen.Rocky himself is one of the main reasons why this film is so successful. People of any background can appreciate his desire and commitment to be the best. His character traits we can all relate too and gives us an emotional connection with him. He inspires and makes you realize your own potential to Go The Distance.

Yes it is a B-movie,sci-fi, and horror film all rolled into one spine-tingling package! While it is pretty cheesy in places, if you just take the movie for what it is, it's a hoot! I don't get into all the gory, realistic, blood-bath horror pictures they produce today. So this was tame enough to be right up my alley.I like Price's performance here. Sometimes he comes across a little wooden to me, but he does a good job here. There is a capable supporting cast as well. Patricia Cutts is quite effective as Dr. Chapin's (Price) trampy wife Isabel. I like how he gets back at her. Phillip Coolidge and Judith Evelyn turn in performances as Ollie & Martha Higgins who are the theater owners that play a significant role in the film. It's interesting to know that Ms. Evelyn appeared in Hitchcock's Rear Window as Ms. Lonelyhearts. She plays a similarly tragic role her as well (I won't give it away).I thought the cinematography was quite good for a B-movie and liked that it was in black & white. A particularly effective scene is the way they colored the blood red in the bathroom - cool effect and adds to the horror. Of course, nowadays, its pretty tame by today's standard - but back then, it must have caused quite a shock! The music reminds me a little of a Twilight Zone episode. In fact the whole movie could be compared to a long episode of TZ. I think they did a good job creating tension and fear with the camera angles, music and shadows. Some of the dying of fright was a little overacted but still fun.I liked the tie-in with the Tingler getting loose in a movie theater and how they planted buzzers and screamers in the theater audience to get people to scream and build fear. That must have been quite an experience if you were fortunate enough to see this in the theaters when it originally opened.Don't watch this expecting to see any Oscar worthy performances. But if you're looking for pure, campy fun - enjoy every screaming, spine-tingling moment of this!

The atmosphere of the movie is a large part of what makes it so good. Picture a New England mansion while it's raining in the dark. That's the feel of the college - and inside a comfortable home like area where the central characters hang out. The beginning interactions with these friends make them all very believable and real. Not shallow or just there to scream, run and get killed. One of the classes is about urban legends so the theme of the movie is are these really just urban legends or are they real? It's the 25th anniversary of the school's so-called massacre. Most students don't believe it but as friends go missing or turn up dead, one of the main characters, Natalie, believes it is not only real, but someone after her. Watching it now, so many years later, it's amazing how well known most of the actors have become. I was shocked to read that Michael Rosenbaum from the TV show, 'Smallville', was in this movie as one of the main characters. He looks so different, I would never have made the connection. And I've seen this movie a lot. I read someone call it predictable but I didn't think so at all. It was suspenseful to the end. Not knowing who you could really trust. Even after knowing what happens, something about this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. The characters become real and the ominous looking school with grounds going towards the woods gives it a real feeling of a New England town. In the dark...at night, would you say Bloody Mary three times in this superstitious place?
