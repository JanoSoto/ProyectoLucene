[{"date":"8 January 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Within this film, there is a restaurant scene, which in my opinion is without doubt one of the funniest scenes of cinema. I have never before laughed out loud so much at a seventy\/eighty second stretch of film. Although this one scene steals the film for me every time I watch it, the entire film is filled with gags that really appeal. I have to confess that the plot is entirely clichéd and pointless, but I find that it is a spiritual successor to the black, white and golden age of comedy epitomised by Laurel and Hardy et al. in terms of the facial comedy especially, with James Caan and Hugh Grant excelling in their close up work. If you are looking at this review as an indicator of whether you should watch this film or not, I urge you to ignore the measly mark of 5.7 and take a punt on it. It obviously doesn't appeal to everyone, but if it does appeal to you, you will absolutely love it.....

I believe that this film has some flaws, not to be denied. Some clichés, like the applause at the end, the bad guy being good on the inside and so on. I don't want to see this side. A movie doesn't have to be perfect, it should be like a human, with ups and downs, and I will evaluate by considering how high are the ups.In scent of a woman, the ups are high up in the sky, the story and the acting are legendary, absolutely magnificent and you are left with a feeling that makes you want to fight. Yes, that's right, makes you want to fight, against injustice, against cowardice, against...and that made me remember instantly about Mr. Smith goes to Washington. The supreme idealist, the child we should all be like.I feel this movie is one that should be somewhere in the universal patrimony of humanity because it contains and explains in one story all the themes of humanity, all our fears and ideals death, idealism vs materialism, honesty, richness vs. poorness, the mysterious course of life, illness, frustration, war, child innocence, sincerity, vulgarity vs academy and I could go on with this...It seems to me that all acting was great, except maybe the principal of the school that looked like a cartoon character. I don't even want to remind the flaws cause within my eyes this movie was flawless. There is no flaw, there is just the idea left deep in my head, in my soul. Only this and nothing more.
