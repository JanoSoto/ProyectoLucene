[{"date":"10 March 2008","score":"","review":" Aside from the more than entertaining plot line, I think this movie is really more about the development of each of the major characters. The lead, William, is young and ready to experience life after an upbringing involving an over protective mother and misunderstood educational life. After finally being able to sort of let go, William's mother lets her son set out to explore his passion of writing and rock and roll. Over the course of the film, William develops a relationship with a rock and roll band and a groupie\/band aid that needs help in finding themselves and their path in life. Russel Hammond, William, his sister, and his mother all have lots to learn about their individual lives as well as their personal and family lives. The addition of the more than provocative character Penny Lane makes this move a pure definition of character development. Everyone learns and grows as a person, add the perfect plot and music that comes with the movie, and it's a piece of pure genius. Any rock and roll fan will enjoy this movie, but any fan of slightly more complex film than a simple action movie will really find this to be a real enjoyable piece of art that will be cherished no matter how many times you watch. I highly advise it and I give it the top rating, something I never do unless it is one of my personal favorites.

Local Hero is quite the opposite. The more I think about it, the more appreciation I have for it. It's a low-key, deliberately paced quasi-comedy with good dramatic content that deals with questions of lifestyle, and the relationship between lifestyle and money.The ostensible star of the movie is Peter Riegert as McIntyre (I can't even remember if he had a first name; it seems to me he was always called Mac or McIntyre.) He's a pretty high-powered sales executive for a Houston based oil and gas company who gets sent to Scotland to negotiate the purchase of an entire town, because the company has decided that the beach and surrounding area are the perfect location to build a refinery. Mac doesn't want to go, but he has no choice. It turns out that the locals are quite willing to sell - there's nothing left for them, no employment, no future that they can see - and they're happy to take the money and run. But the strangest thing happens. Mac starts to fall in love with this place. It seems to start when the car he's in injures a rabbit, and this high-powered sales guy adopts it and tries to bring it back to health, only to have it killed and fed to him by a local - after all, here they eat rabbits. That whole incident brings out Mac's softer side. As the movie progresses, Mac evolves dramatically. It takes about an hour, but that was the point at which I suddenly realized that Mac - who always wore a suit and tie - had suddenly lost the tie. Then the dress shirt was replaced with a sweater, then the jacket was gone, then he grew a beard. He likes the calmer, slower lifestyle.If Riegert is the star, the protagonists are essentially Fulton Mackay as Ben and Burt Lancaster as Happer. Ben is the monkey wrench in the town's plan to sell. He owns the beach (his family has owned it for 400 years he says.) Aside from the beach, though, he doesn't seem to have much. He lives in a ramshackle home that looks ready to fall down. Mac assumes that a bit of money will convince him to sell, but it doesn't. The offers get higher and higher, but Ben can't figure out why he'd want to leave. He loves the beach. Mac tells him the company will buy him a beach - in Hawaii or Australia. But what would I do for a living? Ben asks. Mac is confused. He'll have lots of money after the sale; he won't have to do anything for a living. But there's the point - for Ben, what he does for a living isn't money or employment; it's about lifestyle. He doesn't have much, but he's happy. Happer, on the other hand, is the owner of the oil company. He's filthy rich, but he also understands that life is more than money. He's an amateur astronomer - he tells Mac to watch the sky over Scotland and keep him up to date on what he sees. Finally, to close the deal, Happer comes to Scotland and meets with Ben, supposedly to close the deal, except that another plan emerges - one that will save both the town and its lifestyle.The closing scene is powerful. Mac has returned to Houston. He pins up pictures of his time in Scotland in his kitchen and stands on his balcony, clearly not all that enthralled to be back, as he looks at the bright lights of the city and sirens wail in the background. Then, the movie cuts away to a scene of the town in Scotland. It's ambiguous does Mac give up his high-powered life in Houston to go back, or is he left wistfully remembering the place where he was so happy.I could relate a bit to Mac's dilemma. I grew up in Toronto, then lived for three years in a tiny fishing outport in Newfoundland. There's something about those kinds of towns and that type of culture that gets into you; that you never really get over, no matter where you end up. There were a couple of minor characters that are worthy of note here. Christopher Rozycki plays the Soviet sailor Victor, who seems to have a far better sense of capitalism that Mac does. They become friends, and as Mac is struggling with his dilemma, Victor simply says (not callously but realistically) you can't eat scenery. Then there's Gyearbuor Asante as the ironically named Reverend Macpherson. He came to the area from Africa as a student minister, he tells Mac, and he just couldn't leave. Which is the whole point of the story.If you need a lot of action and adventure and excitement, this isn't for you. But it's a great human story that deals with the important question of what really matters in life. It also has some great shots of the Scottish coast and the village in which it's set. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 March 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Often, the more you think about a movie, the more you realize how lame or shallow it was, and how many problems there were with it.

During this comparatively straightforward role, Wigand catches Bergman's interest by clearly stressing what he can discuss and not discuss. From this casual comment, Bergman starts asking and learns of Wigand's opinion that the CEO of his former employer perjured himself because the firm is very much aware of the addictive effect of their product. When Wigand decides to move forward with Sixty Minutes and act as a whistleblower, pressure is very quickly brought to bear on him, his family and all the companies involved in the story.There appears to be little debate on this site as to whether or not this film is long and slow &#150; it almost certainly is both. However where there is a lack of consensus is over the question of whether this is a problem or not. So we get comments saying how engaging it all is contrasted with those bemoaning it for its length and how boring it all was. I cannot say who is right or wrong, all I can do is add my opinion to theirs and say that to me there was the risk of this being quite hard work and I think it is credit to those involved that it is not. I was surprised by the fact that I still had not gotten round to seeing this film almost a decade after it was made, but in my defence the subject does make it sound like it will be dry as sand and as exciting as ironing. Still, given the stuff I do watch it is a real oversight on my part not to have seen such a high profile film.Watching it for the first time is to be impressed. As someone else has said, most people will know how it ends but yet the film still manages to grip the viewer. The story itself is fascinating not only in regards what happens but also its wider meaning. The script allows the viewer to understand the commercial forces on the tobacco companies but also on the news firms and this helps to make the film more interesting than just the very specific story of Wigand. However the central story itself is still interesting and it does fill the time with a steady (albeit slow) pace throughout. The liberal bias inherent in the telling is a little off-putting as the film seems to be aiming a bit too squarely for corporations and those making the money rather than just letting the audience draw their own conclusions. That aside though it is still a quality piece of work across the board.Mann's direction draws out strong performances and also puts the audience into the action even when, technically, there isn't any. He is greatly helped by cinematographer Spinotti, who delivers corporate blues and greys as well as alternating between a static camera in some scenes and a unsteady handcam that matches the increasing stress and strain being put on Wigand. The lead two are both excellent. Pacino of course chews the scenery but he does so in a way that is comparatively restrained to when he is particularly hammy &#150; here he is just right, a strong presence but not to the point of being detrimental. Crowe is just as impressive but provides a very subtle performance that has the material but lacks the flamboyance of Pacino's performance while being just as good. Support is solid with turns from Hall, Plummer, Gambon, Gershon, Torn, Tobolowsky and Venora and the cast doesn't really have a weak spot.It is long, it has very little in the way of action for those looking for explosions and such and the political slant on the telling is very much to the Left, but yet it is engaging and professionally done. The cast are impressive at best and strong at worst while Mann and Spinotti have produced a film that is beautifully crafted and uses the camera to engage the audience as well as the performances and story.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"10 March 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, a Southern lawyer who defends a black man (Brock Peters) unjustly accused of rape. (It was almost the other way round.) Peck does his best but Peters is convicted anyway by the all-white jury; this is 1932. In Macon. That's in Georgia. While being transported elsewhere for his safety, Peters tries to escape and is shot dead. The redneck father responsible for all this mishigas (James Anderson, who must be great pals with Bill McKinney because their parts are interchangeable) holds a grudge against Peck for defending Peters in the first place, and for proving Peters was innocent in the second place, and for thereby impugning the honor of the Anderson family in the third place. Anderson calls Peck a n***** lover and spits in his face, but of course Peck would find any response infra dig. Anyway, Anderson sneaks up on Peck's two kids on Halloween night and tries to knife them, but is prevented from doing so -- and is killed -- by Boo Radley (Robert Duvall in a powerful but wordless performance). Peck is told by the Sheriff (the ever-emotive Frank Overton) that, although Duvall may have killed Anderson, well -- Anderson was responsible after all for the death of the innocent Brock Peters. I say let the dead bury the dead, Mr. Finch. The story is told from the point of view of Peck's two kids, the eleven-year-old Jem (Philip Alford) and the six-year-old girl, Scout (Mary Badham). It's kind of sweet too, to see these goings on -- both comic and dramatic -- through the eyes of a naive girl like Scout. Kind of like Candide in Georgia. And if Alford gives a pedestrian performance as Jem, Mary Badham does a splendid job with the character of Scout. Credit, too, the direction by Robert Mulligan and the editing by Aaron Stell, who catches Badham's face at precisely the critical moments. (When her brother is in jeopardy and a sudden gun shot is heard off screen, her face jerks and her eyes open wide in an almost perfect take.) It's especially fine work because neither Alford nor Badham are particularly adorable kids. Jem is rather ordinary in a Tom-Sawyerish way. But Badham has a strange face, with keen, slitted eyes, freckles, and a nose that juts out at odd angles. Neither of them is pretty in the usual child-like way, although compared to their friend Dill (John Megna), purportedly based on Truman Capote, they could both be in beauty contests.Mulligan's direction could hardly be better, given the nature of the story. After lights out in this sleepy Southern household, we hear Badham asking Alford about their mother, who died some years ago. The Mulligan's camera drifts from the delicate lace of the window curtains to Peck sitting alone on the porch swing, his face lowered, his arm draped across the back of the wooden swing, as if he can still feel his wife's presence within the circle of that arm. End of scene. Had more been made of it, it would have been banal.The moral calculus of the film puzzles me a little. I'm not sure that the dead who have buried the dead are in quite the same position. An innocent man is shot and killed while trying to escape. A guilty man is killed while trying to murder two children. I don't know. Does that come out right for you? And Harper Lee, and the screenwriter Horton Foote, are pretty easy on the quiet town of Macon. That lynch mob that shows up at the jail to string Brock Peters up, for instance. They are momentarily stopped by the unflappable and imperious Peck, but what really turns them aside is the appearance of Peck's kids. They don't know what's going on. And Badham cheerfully greets the members of the mob whom she knows. She asks them to say hey to their kids, who go to the same school as she does. This innocence is so disarming that the leader of the mob says, Let's break it up and go home. Really? On the flip side of the coin, if the writers treat the town's peccadilloes a little gently, at least there are no Big Speeches -- no preaching. Peck never gives a speech (not even in his summation) about all men being created equal, and God made all of us, and we'd better get our stuff together if we ever expect to have a team like the Atlanta Braves.It's a good, sensitive movie. It may or may not sound like it in precis. (Almost all movie kids are repugnant, I'll grant you that.) But it's quite well done, and Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch has become part of our cultural data base.
