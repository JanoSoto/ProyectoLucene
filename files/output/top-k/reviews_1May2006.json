[{"date":"1 May 2006","score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous is set during the 1847 Mexican-American civil war where Capatin John Boyd (Guy Pearce) is found out to be a coward & sent to Fort Spencer in California deep in the Western Sierra Nevadas, a station for travellers in the middle of nowhere run by a bunch of social rejects & misfits. It's John's first night there & he notices a man outside, the man is helped inside the fort & given medical treatment. The man identifies himself as Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) & that he was a member of an ill-fated party of prospectors who were caught out by the harsh winter, they all took shelter in a cave but quickly ran out of food. Colqhoun then says that they turned to cannibalism to survive as they began to die from malnutrition... Colonel Hart (Jeffery Jones) organises an expedition to search for any other possible survivors, Colqhoun, John, Private Reich (Neal McDonough), Private Toffler (Jeremy Davis) & an Indian named George (Joseph Runningfox) head off to the cave to see what horror lie within. Once there they quickly discover that Colqhoun's story is a lie & he is the cannibal, a cannibal who can't get enough human flesh to satisfy his hunger...Directed by Antonia Bird I thought Ravenous was an OK film but didn't quite do enough for me. The script by Ted Griffin is a bit of a mess when you think about it, there are supernatural elements involved which are never fully explained, the character's are a bit thin as Boyd hardly says a word throughout the entire film which make sit almost impossible to care about him & the Colonel Ives character is sketchy to say the least, if he was indeed a Colonel what was he doing stuck in a cave in the middle of nowhere? Is Ravenous a horror film, or is it a historical drama, a thriller or maybe a black comedy? I think it tries to all of these things but doesn't quite manage to strike the right balance between any of them. There are scenes of people bing miraculously healed & a stupid bit when Boyd jumps of a cliff & survives (I don't care that those trees broke his fall, from the height he jumped he would have died). There are some decent ideas here & in the right hands it might have made for an effective horror, the twist involving Colqhoun & the subsequent confrontations between himself & Boyd could have been great but instead the best the film can do is have Boyd shut a book loudly next to Boyd so as to make him jump, great stuff. I was also seriously disappointed with the cannibal aspects of the story, it's only ever really talked about & I was hoping to see some nice gore, it never happened. Having said all that the film is pretty fun to watch, there's a fair bit to it, there's some decent plot twist's, it's something a bit different, it moves along at a fair pace & it kept me watching right through to the end if nothing else.Director Bird was the third choice to direct & a last minute replacement for Milcho Manchevski who only lasted two weeks into production, she does a fine job & captures the Czech Republic & Slovakian (where it was filmed in reality) scenery very well. There isn't much in the way of shocks or scares & while some say Ravenous is a very gory film I have to disagree, there is not one scene in Ravenous of someone engaging in cannibalism, well there is one brief bit but it turns out to be a dream sequence so it doesn't count, the stew scene doesn't count either as it looks like normal stew. There's a gory bit at the end when Major Knox (Stephen Spinella) is killed & chopped up on a chopping block but it lasts for a few seconds at most, the rest of the gore in Ravenous consists of some skeletons with bits of flesh & gristle hanging off, some dead animals, a couple of people with their stomachs cut open, a whole lot of fake blood & the best gore scene when someone has their throat slashed open with much blood spurtage as a result.With a fairly restrained budget of about $12,000,000 Ravenous still had a decent amount of cash to play with, the film is undoubtedly well made, the costumes & period settings look authentic enough & it has that Hollywood polish about it. The music in Ravenous seems to divide opinion, personally I hated it, it ruins certain scenes that with appropriate music could have been so much more effective. The acting was alright, Pearce hardly says a word & just walks around in a world of his own most of the time, Carlyle is great as the villain. David Arquette as Private Cleaves is barely in it despite almost top billing.Overall I was a bit disappointed by Ravenous, I don't buy the metaphor's, messages & moral dilemmas that the film seems to suggest as I couldn't take it that seriously. I think it's well worth a watch & is an entertaining film but ultimately it could have been so much better, good but not brilliant.
