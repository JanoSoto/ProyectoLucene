I can watch this again and again, because it is so well directed, acted, shoot, designed and researched.I have watched it several times and yet I have not discovered any flaws in acting or directing. (The flaws usually start to show if you watch something several times)This is one of the films that gets better each time you watch it as you discover new layers in the story and characters. John Malkovich and Glenn Close are absolutely brilliant as leading characters, the Machiavellian duo of 18th century aristocrats. Their acting is immaculate and powerful. Down to the very smallest nuances. This film contains lots of barely-there nuances on characters faces that speak volumes about their background story or true feelings. The nuances on the face of Mrs Merteuil are simply wonderful for a split second, when she knows nobody watches her she shows her true face; then puts on a most elaborate social mask at the next moment. I absolutely love that S. Frears has not chosen pretty faces for main characters. Some viewers have complained that Malkovich and Glose as principal master seducers aren't looking sexy enough themselves. I think this is a slightly primitive view of the matter. I love the fact that at the beginning they both come across as almost ugly and you think now really? But as the film goes on both become more and more attractive and seductive. Which means sexuality and attractiveness does not come down to pretty face. It is the character, soul inside the body that makes it attractive or not. And Mmoiselle Mertuil and Valmont both have this attractiveness of sinful and evil.But one of the masterstrokes of this film is that we eventually see that they are not fully evil, that even they have the piece of soul that is sincere, suffers and longs for true love. We understand, bit-by-bit that something has happened both to Mertuil and Valmont that has lead them to these evil games and ridiculing true love. Even though true love is what they foremost long, they would never admit it. That is why this story is timeless and very much contemporary. As what we see in the contemporary world, love, specially love between the man and a woman is what is least valued and cared for. Everything else seems to be more important &#150; imago, power, money, success &#150; and people stamp mercilessly over the gift given to them, disposing it as something inferior. And forgetting they once were able to love. As for comparison with Milosh Forman film &#150; the latter was OK, but not nearly as powerful and deep as Mr Frears'is version. In fact, the pretty faces in Forman's film made it more Hollywood cream-cake-like. This is not to say actors were bad, as I love Colin Firth and Anette Bening, but in this film their pretty faces simply did not cut. They were a kind of. too pretty, lacking the edge. I think it also the genius of Stephen Frears, how the film starts as a light comedy of manners and eventually escalates into a Greek tragedy.All casting was excellent. Some have complained about casting of Keanu Reeves, but I do not see why. I thought he like everyone else was spot-on for his role. He and Uma Thurman provided some very humorous moments as naive, puppy-like lovers, helpless pray for the sharks. If you liked this film then I assume you would also like Frears'is other masterpiece with a similar theme, The Grifters. It is set in the second half of 20 the century in USA and the protagonists are three con artists. It is as good as the Liasons, and these two belong to my top five films of all times.

So why does it start with gorillas? this film is meant to show the evolution of man and the overall film is just like nothing I have ever seen...it's just nothing happens and a really really boring film.Nothing can beat the opening music to this film everyone knows it from some form or another, however thats probably the only good thing about this film, it takes a total of about 45 minutes for anyone to actually say anything with the first lines being Here you are, sir, for the first half of this film I thought I was watching an episode of WILD LIFE ON ONE or something waiting for David Attenborough to say the famous works of here we have... or waiting for some form of sex to happen, however to my disappointment i wasted a total of 45 minutes watching this poor film, then when it does pick up and the space actually hits you...your either asleep or like me wanting to change the film...still i stuck with it.The part when it does kick in its so slow....the music is dull I was turning emo, but thats not my biggest dig, it's just NOTHING happens, OK I would rather have had two and a half hours of a romantic flick than this poor film. Its slow it's like sitting outside and watching the sky while sometimes hitting your self on the head with a massive stick to stay awake. It's also very much like watching someone with a load of cutouts. I mean come on the space stations are poor, you would see better in a primary school art room.This film however does have some good points, in that it's 3 stories about space. The first story is pretty slow seriously it just doesn't pick up on anything to make you want to watch it or even pay attention it's like they could have made in interesting I mean come on it's SPACE, but I guess that they where trying to make it seem as real as possible. If they where trying to make it as real as possible that was probably a bad idea because who wants to see people moving really slowly in a space ship they would be as much fun as being in a washing machine (in fact being in space for real in 1968 would probably have been like being in a washing machine) this film had so much potential, and OK the comment about the space stations was abit out of order they do look pretty good.The second story is the only good one with the HAL computer that one i only know because of Recess and the simpsons, but either way it is the best one of the stories in this film, and does try to be a good horror (if they remade this story it would be SO good, like Event Horizon or something and would be really good...in fact I think that might be the idea where Event Horizon come from however Event Horizon is just a better film) the one thing I didn't get at the end of this film was the ending but then I didn't pay attention to the rest of the film in all fairness I was more fixed on looking at my fish tank (which by the way at the moment has no fish in it - yes thats how interesting this film is) but maybe I don't want to understand the end of this film because people who have watched it and liked it say that you have to be intelligent to understand it.You have to be intelligent to understand it?

For that alone, I'll give her a pass in First Knight.Richard Gere First of all, I've never really got this guy. I can remember when he made a splash in Paul Scharder's American Gigolo (1980). The movie and the character perfectly captured a moment in time and culture in America as did Saturday Night Fever, albeit to a lesser, if not more seedy and shocking, extent. He followed that up with more success in Officer and a Gentleman (1982), which is not holding up well by the way, but then what? Can you name another memorable role Richard Gere has played since? (And Pretty Woman does not count. You could have put Richard Petty next to Julia Roberts in that puff fest and still made mega box office). Yet, every year they trundle him out again for another big budget shot. Like I said I don't get it. Anyway, casting him in First Knight made as much sense as allowing him to present at the Oscar's. I'm sure it looked good on paper, but what you got was something totally repellent. At least he had the decency to keep his Philly accent.Sean Connery In 1988 Connery won the Academy Award for his supporting role in The Untouchables. To his credit, he was able to parlay this into a major jump start to his sputtering career and carry it right through the 90's. His performances seemed to fall into two categories; well crafted, as in Medicine Man and The Hunt for Red October, or mailed it in. His work in First Knight was definitely a quick trip to the Post Office. There were scenes when I thought he was actually in danger of nodding off on his sword! He probably realized early on this was a loser. But a true professional (see Gene Hackman) will step up his game and make the best of lesser material. He might have made it tolerable had he tried, but trust me, watching Sterling Hayden run about in a wig is much more compelling then enduring Connery's uninspired speeches in a medieval hair piece! Next time I see First Knight peek above the parapets, I think I'll just call my ex-girlfriend and start a fight instead. It would be much less painful.

Since then I've done my best to put the painful memories of both behind me. Unfortunately, on a recent Saturday morning, when my FIOS package let me down again (oh, for reruns of MST3K!), TNT reopened those old wounds.I have nothing against the Arthurian legend. In fact, I actually enjoy it and there have been some well made movies on the subject (see Prince Valiant (1954) for a lost treasure). However, First Knight is not one for the ages. Why Jerry Zucker chose to step out of his successful Top Secret, Airplane, Naked Gun, etc; comedic comfort zone to produce this joust wreck is as mysterious as Excalibur. Although, people were laughing in the theater during some of the fight scenes and a bizarre scream in a church. And why did screenwriter William Nicholson sandwich such a woeful tale in between Nell and Galidator? Throw in industry nobleman like John Gielgud, Jerry Goldsmith, and Walter Murch how could this movie miss the mark so badly? First Knight does not work on any level. The plot is weak and contrived, the dialog is unbelievable, the costumes out of historical place, and the pristine period sets perplexing. Now some observations on the performances of the principlesJulia Ormond At least in those days they were still actually casting British born actresses to play British characters, sparing us from having to spend two hours listening to the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow or Texan Renee Zellweger blather on in their phony English accents. For that alone, I'll give her a pass in First Knight.Richard Gere First of all, I've never really got this guy. I can remember when he made a splash in Paul Scharder's American Gigolo (1980). The movie and the character perfectly captured a moment in time and culture in America as did Saturday Night Fever, albeit to a lesser, if not more seedy and shocking, extent. He followed that up with more success in Officer and a Gentleman (1982), which is not holding up well by the way, but then what? Can you name another memorable role Richard Gere has played since? (And Pretty Woman does not count. You could have put Richard Petty next to Julia Roberts in that puff fest and still made mega box office). Yet, every year they trundle him out again for another big budget shot. Like I said I don't get it. Anyway, casting him in First Knight made as much sense as allowing him to present at the Oscar's. I'm sure it looked good on paper, but what you got was something totally repellent. At least he had the decency to keep his Philly accent.Sean Connery In 1988 Connery won the Academy Award for his supporting role in The Untouchables. To his credit, he was able to parlay this into a major jump start to his sputtering career and carry it right through the 90's. His performances seemed to fall into two categories; well crafted, as in Medicine Man and The Hunt for Red October, or mailed it in. His work in First Knight was definitely a quick trip to the Post Office. There were scenes when I thought he was actually in danger of nodding off on his sword! He probably realized early on this was a loser. But a true professional (see Gene Hackman) will step up his game and make the best of lesser material. He might have made it tolerable had he tried, but trust me, watching Sterling Hayden run about in a wig is much more compelling then enduring Connery's uninspired speeches in a medieval hair piece! Next time I see First Knight peek above the parapets, I think I'll just call my ex-girlfriend and start a fight instead. It would be much less painful.

The Piano has enough layers for you to watch it ten times and analyze a different element during each viewing. It's also amazing how disturbing a story can be, at the same time it is touching; and how good a person can be, even when he or she is a bit crazy. I came to the conclusion that the three main characters of The Piano are good hearted people, but with big mental issues&#133;But that's just one of the layers of the film.Set in the 1850's, the story follows Ada (Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna Paquin) Flora, as they travel to New Zealand, where Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), an intended husband she hasn't met, is waiting for Ada to begin a life with her. Ada (she explains to us during a narration at the beginning of the film where her mind is speaking) is mute and plays the piano, so when she arrives to the beach, her piano is loaded down but Stewart refuses to take it to the house; so they leave it on the beach.There will be one person who will help her get the piano back, and that's Baines (Harvey Keitel), and that's the development of the film about which I can't say no more. The way Ada looks at the Piano (it is worth putting in capital letters because it's another main character) on the beach when she's on top of the hill as she walks to the house; that's the main element of the contemplation present in Jane Campion's direction.Not only that beautiful shot of the lonely Piano on the beach, but the way she pays attention to the jungle or the houses, when the camera shows empty spaces; in a metaphorical way that really seems to be saying something. That's another magical element let's call it unexplained understanding. Through Campion's astonishing script is that we also see the layers I'm talking about. She covers a lot in such few words that Holly Hunter's look is enough to understand what's going on.Believe it or not, I'm getting stuck with this review; but because I have many things to say. The intense character study is something from another world. Campion, both in her direction and script, makes sure that every scene has total importance, without differentiating between a main character like Ada or an aboriginal from New Zealand.Every scene is so intense with the focus on the characters that you can't keep your eyes off the screen, even when the film is slow and depressing like no other. Whether it is in the house, on the beach or inside the jungle, each scene takes the action from ten different angles with a big number of different shots. This is Stuart Dryburgh's flawless achievement in cinematography; which includes close-ups so daring and compelling as the ones he uses now, more than ten years later, in films like The Painted Veil.I can't forget about Michael Nyman's score, which is not the best thing in the world, but is perfectly combined with every piece Ada plays in her beloved Piano; in order to give a continuing musicality to the picture. Now, I don't know how much Nyman wrote of these pieces Ada play, but&#133;The moments in which she plays each of them and the way she does it and how the pieces sound; I could assure that they represent Ada's feelings in their most original form. I mean, I don't know much about classical music and that's what I'm saying. However, if those pieces existed and were at least known, their title or (as I said) their form would be incredibly connected to Campion's story.I don't even know how much Campion knows about music, but if she doesn't know anything, it didn't affect this beautiful piece at all. Realize how much I've said about The Piano and I haven't even mentioned the performances. I shouldn't have to, though Holly Hunter won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance here and it is as simple as it sounds; she doesn't speak a word. Little Anna Paquin, who is know big and talented, was also incredibly talented then with ten years old; and she also got an Oscar for it. She couldn't even watch the film when this happened because she was too young, and apparently she hasn't completely watched it yet.Sam Neil achieves a remarkable job with a character that requires several big changes of mood and decisions; and that angry actor that Harvey Keitel is presents an unexpected gentleness as the troubled Baines. But as I already mentioned; they are all somehow very troubled. And between this troubled and frightening and confusing and violent environment, Ada sits down and speaks, through her Piano; that, as a colleague of mine said, is her own voice.

The movie takes place in the 1920's when the mob warlord Al Capone ruled Prohibition-era Chicago. Federal agent Elliot Ness, quoting one of the plot outlines, assembles a personal team of mob fighters to bring Chicago crime boss Al Capone to justice using unconventional means. This team becomes known as The Untouchables. This is by far the best movie I've seen from Brian De Palma. I knew it was going to be good, but I was surprised that it was even better.The screenplay, the whole story, is just brilliant. It has this absolute flow, which I think was more normal back then, as it seems to me that less newer movies have that specific flow nowadays. The progress and the twists in the plot are just excellent and they keep you concentrated throughout the whole movie. The way the movie progresses itself is just pure glory for your eyes and it also compliments the directing. The directing is just so fitting with the screenplay that it's even better than it actually is, though it is honestly very good. De Palma has captured the soul and the whole feeling of the 1920's, making The Untouchables a real masterpiece of a movie and I can't believe I've missed it before. The music is superb, despite the fact that it has that cheesy 80's feeling in it at times. No wonder the music's so superb, as the composer is the master Ennio Morricone himself. He does compositions that are so recognizable that you just know it's Morricone behind the music.What comes to role performances, well there's one above everyone else and that is no-one else than Sean Connery himself, at his best. I just can't believe the work he has done, as it seems to me that every role he plays he does it perfectly. I can't do nothing else than admire him, there's just something so charismatic about him that it always makes me stare in amazement. In The Untouchables he plays a veteran patrolman who teaches Ness how to beat Capone and he just does it so believably that.. Well, read what said above. The role performance he does is just excellent and it is no wonder that he even won an Oscar from it. Robert De Niro is very fitting in the role of Al Capone; I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing it. I have to admit that I don't know much about Capone's real behavior, but to me Capone is everything De Niro does in this movie.

I think it's highly underrated, as I was so surprised how good it actually was even when I have really never liked mob-movies so much. It has superb role performances, excellent directing, a brilliant story and it is all in all, a great movie. A recommendation for everyone who haven't seen it! Everything just works so well together, giving it that flow and making it click in every aspect.

The music is superb, despite the fact that it has that cheesy 80's feeling in it at times. No wonder the music's so superb, as the composer is the master Ennio Morricone himself. He does compositions that are so recognizable that you just know it's Morricone behind the music.What comes to role performances, well there's one above everyone else and that is no-one else than Sean Connery himself, at his best. I just can't believe the work he has done, as it seems to me that every role he plays he does it perfectly. I can't do nothing else than admire him, there's just something so charismatic about him that it always makes me stare in amazement. In The Untouchables he plays a veteran patrolman who teaches Ness how to beat Capone and he just does it so believably that.. Well, read what said above. The role performance he does is just excellent and it is no wonder that he even won an Oscar from it. Robert De Niro is very fitting in the role of Al Capone; I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing it. I have to admit that I don't know much about Capone's real behavior, but to me Capone is everything De Niro does in this movie. The movie actually shines with the whole cast as well, including for example Kevin Costner as the tough Elliot Ness and Andy Garcia as one of the untouchables, master shooter George Stone. Everyone performs their roles so well that the whole movie is a real pleasure for eyes throughout.The Untouchables is a must-see-masterpiece. I think it's highly underrated, as I was so surprised how good it actually was even when I have really never liked mob-movies so much. It has superb role performances, excellent directing, a brilliant story and it is all in all, a great movie. A recommendation for everyone who haven't seen it! Everything just works so well together, giving it that flow and making it click in every aspect. The movie has this excitement and tension, this real feeling of pure man power, in a way that can not be described. A great movie indeed.

I rented its DVD and saw it again 3 times within a space of 1 day and couldn't believe how it just dosen't have any flaw in it.When the movie starts, it starts by introducing you to the different characters and to the family of Don Corleone, which is played to perfection by a legend, Marlon Brando. Right from the start it hooks you, you really need to be patient to see how great this movie is and how it transcends the boundary of cinema. I don't think any movie that I have seen even comes close to it, maybe Schindler's List but that's a different genre altogether.Francis Coppola did a fantastic job with the direction. The character development is as such I have never seen in any movie. The way in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone, son of Don Corleone gives you an insight how good an actor Al Pacino truly is. How he turns from a war veteran to a Don is really a treat to watch, you can actually see the ruthlessness, and cold heartedness growing in his eyes which gives a true meaning to the term Eyes, The window to your soul.Robert Duvall does a really good job playing the true confidant and a loyalist to the family, he makes you believe in him. All the other actors also remain true to their part.Really a must watch for a true cinema fanatic. I am going to go and watch Godfather 2 and post its review also ( Hope its as good as this).

A real upfront, idealistically nutter who eventually drives Chuck up the wall with his constant talking and ridiculous ideas. But the two eventually come to terms with each other, especially when Chuck informs Billy that's his prostitute neighbour Belinda is on the lookout for a pimp. Billy gets an idea, which would see them pimping and using the mortuary at night as their place of business.Ron Howard's second stab at directing brings us a crazy, maniac and no-stop comedy set in New York, involving pimping, hookers and a morgue. It might sound dreary and lowbrow and it could've turned out to be, but this hearty 80s product mostly steers clear away from that edge. However New York still comes across as one sordid location within that time period. What I loved form this exercise had to be the two wholesome lead performances and their interactions. Michael Keaton's highly enjoyable fresh-faced debut is excellent, as the neurotic motor mouth, Billy Idea-man Blazejowski and Henry Winkler is superbly deadpan as the timid, drab pushover Chuck Lumley. The two bounce off each other rather fittingly and stew up likable turns. Shelly Long is wonderfully teasing as the call girl Belinda. Gina Hecht beautifully overplays the part as Chuck's fiancée Charlotte. Bursting in with fun support roles and cameos range from Jim Staahl, Clint Howard, Richard Belzer, Basil Hoffman, Joe Spinell, Nita Talbot, Monique Gabrielle and a very young Shannen Doherty. The cast cooks up interest on hand. Writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (who would team up with Howard a couple more times) kick up an unconventionally witty, twitchy and warm-hearted character comedy, which was rich on the snappy and memorable dialogues, few surprising actions and oddball situations that skittle out of control, but it did start seem to drag and feel overlong towards the latter end. While being sentimental in patches, gladly it never reached any overbearing levels and the use of the running gags to show how much of a push-over Winkler's character is, didn't get too tiring. Howard's second shot at directing is patchy, but ably executed for such an itchy tempo and he uses the grungy locations well to capture the right feel with sturdy photography. Burt Bacharach's music score has that light jazzy flavour, with an upbeat, smoking soundtrack to boot.Night Shift might get swept under the mat and be terribly dated in its context, but for nostalgia purposes and Keaton's off-the-rocker performance, makes this an appealing comedy.

My main beef about the film is that martha is a 52 year old woman and George is 46. That very fact says volumes as to why these two people would treat each other this way and say the things that they say to one another. Elizabeth Taylor is just too young to play Martha and I've always found her performance over-reaching. Burton is of course always brilliant and could play George at any age and still make him believable. There is a scene where Burton does not have any dialog and all you see his the back of his sweater, but there is so much emotion in that scene that you know you are in the presence of great acting. Back to the age situation. George and Martha have been playing at this for years and with the diluting of the ages for the screen only makes the characters yelling at each other uncomfortable, and you wonder why would they stay with each other when both are young enough to find other mates. Anyway, Albee's dialog is worth the price of owing the movie. Now, if only some smart director would film the Kathleen Turner's stage version then we might have a Martha we could really cheer for.

I don't know why I said this, because if he were alive, *he* should be apologizing to *us* for Manos). The logic of the claim, Inspector Clay is dead. Murdered. And somebody's responsible! kind of escapes me. I mean, you'd think someone being responsible was kind of written into the definition of murder.That's not all. The entire thing appears to take place in a void where, to quote Rob Thomas, time falls away. Scenes take place simultaneously in broad daylight and pitch darkness. Did you know that the sun goes down at 345 am? The characters in this know, that's for sure.More heinous errors they never make it clear what kind of undead monster these things are. Vampira's character is listed as 'Vampire Woman', yet behaves like a zombie. Inspector Clay is clearly a zombie. Bela Lugosi acts like a vampire, yet is credited as 'Ghoul Man'. I thought ghouls ate people, and they never do anything that uncouth. I'm nitpicking, but it's fun.Also completely round flying saucers are described as being 'cigar-shaped' and have an obvious ninety degree angle when on the ground. The burning saucer looks (with good reason) like it's not much bigger than a tennis ball (the clue's in the size of the flames). And the logic of two people, each of whom have been attacked by the zombighoulpires (my word) at least once, behaving thusly when alone in a cemetery stalked by the undead one sits in the car with ALL THE DOORS UNLOCKED, and one stands outside. He then gets knocked unconscious from a light tap on the arm.This movie deserves a 0\/10 for technical skill, but gets a 7\/10 based entirely upon how hilariously funny it is to watch people utterly failing to get it right.

This is my 500th review on IMDb. I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather.For me The Godfather is true brilliance...I won't argue with it and I came into this review determined to nit pick this classic and try to find something slightly off with it. I couldn't do it...I couldn't find a single reason why I wouldn't slap a 10\/10 on this...so I did. The Godfather is far more than a 'gangster flick,' it's far beyond Goodfellas, Casino, or The Sopranos because The Godfather is a drama, a deep intense, disturbing, dark drama that draws you into this political, violent, gritty world that this family lives and breaths and has for years. You see a man who grew up in this lifestyle under the most powerful man in the underworld and yet chose to turn away from it but is almost destined to be pulled back towards it and take control of the powerful family. Every scene in The Godfather is done with the utmost care and respect, the characters are so intensely created from the smallest roles, to the biggest and you feel like you're right there. From the streets of New York, to the countryside of Sicily, from brutal murders and assassinations, to marriages, funerals, and births. The Godfather is quite simply an astounding piece of epic cinema.Marlon Brando because he is Hollywood Elite certainly gets top billing for the film. I admit I have only seen Brando in a handful of films and The Godfather is the earliest work of his I have seen so I have not seen Brando in his 'classic' Hollywood roles. I just don't think Brando should have gotten top billing, that being said Marlon Brand IS The Godfather. The only problem is that throughout the film he is aged, delicate and sickly so that we don't see him in what would have been his prime and yet with every movement and word that Brando does you can envision Vito Corleone as the powerful figure he once was. Brando IS The Godfather...period. Al Pacino is the true star of this film. He brilliant creates the son of Vito Corleone Michael. As a character Michael goes through more diverse changes than anyone else. In the beginning he is a returning war hero, desperate to keep his distance from his family name and family business and yet by the end he IS The Godfather...Don Corleone and single handedly has saved his families future. Pacino is downright brilliant and I love his work but this is one of his truly best performances. Pacino was absolutely robbed by not receiving a nomination or win for this performance when Brando got both and didn't even accept it. Pacino turns in a better and more depthy performance by far. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot headed and easily angered Santino Corleone who is forced into the position of heading the family when his father is almost assassination. Caan doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserved but nonetheless makes 'Sonny' one of the most memorable characters from the film. Robert Duvall turns in probably one of the second best performances in the film as soft spoken, legally minded and intelligent Tom Hagen who tries to guide the Corleone family through the worst of times both diplomatically and strategically. He never dirties his own hands but is always willing to do what necessary to protect the family. Duvall is brilliant as well. This main cast is supported by a brilliant supporting cast including Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, and Lenny Montana (all of these actors stand out from the enormous cast as important and well played characters.) As you watch the film you might even think it's dragging a little and thinking it's a little slow but then you're so incredibly caught up in every moment and every story of this family that you're completely enthralled. Their are more brilliant and shocking scenes than almost any other film in history including...Michael's first wife's death, the horse head in the bed, the Assassination Michael performs in the Restaurant and the downright poetically disturbing murder of all the five family heads at the end. Director Francis Ford Coppola set himself apart permanently in the history of cinema by making this beautiful, gritty and quietly violent film. Mario Puzo wrote characters that have so much depth and importance and such real emotion to them. It might take awhile to get through The Godfather but every minute is worth it because this film lives up to it's powerful name and is truly worth the title of classic. 10\/10Keep reading my reviews and see you at 1000!!!

But they manage to spend a pleasant snowy evening in Manhattan, first over coffee at a deli called (what else?) SERENDIPITY and then ice skating in Central Park. They promise to meet up again if chance should allow it, he by writing his name and number on a $5 bill and she by writing her name and number in a book. Don't ask how this is supposed to actually work. Some years later, they continue to pine for each other as they prepare for their respective nuptuals. Cusack is about to marry a gal about 10 times sexier and prettier than Hurley -- oops, I meant Beckinsale! -- and she is engaged to the incredibly sexy John Corbett. Plus she now lives in California while Cusack still hangs in the Big Apple. The point is, it's not as if these two don't have some pretty significant others. Cusack spends most of the movie chasing around trying to find his lost love, with best buddy Jeremy Piven at his side. Both are wasted, although Cusack gives it his best. If Beckinsale continued to make such movies, she'd be forgotten today. She barely registers here. Molly Shannon is Beckinsale's best buddy, and even the normally flamboyant Shannon barely registers. Every single step in this movie is as predictable as the fake snow that seems to fall at all the right moments in this hackneyed romantic drivel. And while you have to believe Cusack and Beckinsale will find each other in the end, it is sadly predictable that it will not be allowed to occur until the closing moments. Cusack and Beckinsale perform together for maybe 10 minutes of the movie. Eugene Levy has what used to be called a walk on, and you just know he must have been a last-minute addition thanks to his success as the kooky father in the American PIE series. He manages to grab a stray laugh or two playing a rather larcenous department store clerk. If you value your sanity, you will skip this one. Every cliché having to do with last-minute altar thoughts is employed. If it worked this way in real life, no one would be married.

Andrews, centers around a widowed mother (Victoria Tennant) who decides to whisk her four children off to live with their grandparents in their isolated mansion. The children consist of Chris, Cathy, and the two younger children, Cory and Carrie. Little do the children know, their mother has essentially given them over to their abusive, religiously-fanatical grandmother (played by Oscar winner Louise Fletcher), and they are locked away in the attic and kept there, while their health deteriorates and they are abused constantly. All the while, their evil mother conspires to receive the inheritance from her own dying father, and plans on starting a completely new life with another man - even if it means murder.A decent but semi-disturbing film, Flowers In The Attic is a strange movie. Keep in mind I haven't read the novel that the film was based upon, so I have no reference between the two (although I've heard numerous times that the film did the book not an ounce of justice). So, without comparing the film and the novel, I thought this movie was pretty effective. The storyline is nicely written here, it's an obscure plot for sure. The script was decent as well, and again I'm not sure how it correlates with the original book. Atmosphere and claustrophobia is consistent in the film as well, it isn't your typical bloody horror flick. Everything has a very Gothic, depressing tone, and the mood here fits everything very well. It's an eerie film, mainly because of the disturbing subject matter and the gloomy atmosphere that is present throughout. The film deals with some heavy issues as well (including incest, among other things), so you may want to be aware of that.As far as the acting goes here, I thought it was very good. Louise Fletcher (who garnered an Oscar for her stunning performance in the film classic One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) is terrifying in her performance as the abusive, psychotic grandmother of the children. As if her character isn't scary enough, Fletcher is a very tall woman as well, and her stature and attitude adds to the menacing nature of her character. I thought she carried the film in way of the performances and more notable than the others, but everyone else was good here too. A young Kristy Swanson plays the eldest daughter Cathy, and Victoria Tennant plays the manipulative and evil mother of the four kids. The ending of the film consisted of some good old bittersweet revenge, it's definitely one of those endings that you're likely to remember.Overall, Flowers In The Attic is a good movie. I haven't read the novel, so I don't personally know how it compares to the book. Based on other reviews here, the book apparently blows the film away, but since I've yet to read it, I'm just judging my review on the film alone. It's a decent psychological Gothic horror story about abuse, abandonment, human relationships, and revenge. Personally I thought it was an alright film, and worth watching if it sounds like your cup of tea (although, judging from what I've heard, if you've read the novel, you may be disappointed with it). 6\/10.
