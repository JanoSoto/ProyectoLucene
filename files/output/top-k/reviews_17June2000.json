And like all others it ends on a happy note, though we wonder whether Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox will ever get along professionally as they do personally. This films ends making you ponder on a possible sequel i.e. what happens after they get together? Can Kathleen with her angst for the commercial big-wigs stand a soul mate who is one himself? Does she relinquish her career ambitions to go into some kind of a collaboration with Joe Fox and his mega store which she so much hated and championed against?  Well, this film clearly chooses to ignore the after-the-romance part to concentrate solely on the romance and I have to say it succeeds to that end. Even though the pace of the movie at times slows down, it is an integral part of the movie. I'm talking of the part where Joe Fox tries to win over Kathleen. He knows that she won't over accept him as just the guy whom she is e-mail friends with, he has to win her over as the business man who drew her out of business. And when he almost succeeds he is ready to confront her both as who is and as her e-mail friend. I do agree with what one more viewer over here has commented that the movie seems to be partial to Hanks's character by making him privy to more knowledge than Ryan's character has. And by getting both the business and the girl in the end(a case of getting the cake and eating it too). But as I wrote above this movie is typically in the vein of romance and chooses to ignore the irritating technicalities of reality... I liked this movie because of it's atmosphere, supposedly shot in New York's West End area, it lends a beautiful aura to the movie. I liked the banter between Kathleen and Joe on their respective favourite books - hers being Pride and Prejudice and his Godfather(what a combo!). And last but not the least, I loved the that cosy Shop Around The Corner; being an absolute book buff it was a vision of my dream shop!  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are as adorable as ever! I'd recommend this movie strictly for those who like romantic comedies. The absence of sex in this movie is conspicuous and quite a relief actually.

A few days ago I decided to check out the video and watch this movie--the whole movie, just for the sake of watching it. I wanted to see why this movie is considered so great. It's quite notable that this movie was such a hit at the box office. The fact that this movie made nearly 250 million dollars in the 1981-1982 period says a lot.

","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"17 June 2000","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Warning - Slight Spoilers AheadI really, really dislike Judge Dredd. It's a surprisingly violent and soulless film; a patronising moronfest that treats its audience with no respect whatsoever. Even the titles annoy, the opening music with its silly bombast and a pompous monologue by James Earl Jones. The accompanying images are a series of the 2001 comic from which the Judge Dredd character came. It's quite exceptional that a major Hollywood picture should credit a minor British comic in such a prominent way. Even more exceptional as the film is nothing like the comic. Did the cartoon Judge really have romantic entanglements and monotonously quip anti-catchphrase I new yuud say dat?The film opens out with a future cityscape ludicrously indebted to Blade Runner. Except where that picture had depth, this one throws it all up on screen, a garish splurge of CGI movement. To be honest, they aren't that convincing either, particularly later scenes where Dredd is flying his bike. Yet this was made 12 years after the more realistic-looking Blade Runner. Odd. Other rip-off, er, homages are a flying bike chase sequence straight out of Return of the Jedi. Though a scene where Hershey (Diane Lane) saves Stallone from falling by telling him to take my hand is a nice spoof of Cliffhanger.Stallone makes his first appearance as Dredd with the musical cues and iconography hopelessly indebted to the Terminator. He then proceeds to tell us that he's in no danger standing in the street as the criminals firing on him from a tower block are using weapons that are non-lethal from their range. This is strange, as less than two and a quarter minutes earlier we had seen one of said weapons killing a civilian from the same distance. I mean, if a movie can't maintain continuity over a three minute period then what sort of confidence can you have in it?Maybe part of the reason I dislike the film so much is Stallone. I've always had a great deal of time for Sylvester, and feel he's extremely underrated as an actor. However, at this time the sheer number of cursory action roles he was playing were dampening his reputation. Particularly as the action roles were not the equal of those given to an actor with infinitely less talent, Arnold Schwarzenegger. There was also an interview printed around the time where Sylvester gave a great number of right-wing views, and also laughably claimed that he'd read Homer to study for the role of Dredd. Maybe it was Homer Simpson. However, I've since told myself that the publication probably made it all up, and a reputable publication, Empire magazine, conducted an interview with the star in 1998. When asked if there were any film he would want to apologise for, he apologised for not really applying himself to Dredd and claimed that the film could have been a great satirical farce. His dislike of Danny Cannon's methods also led him to suggest that Terry Gilliam would have been a better director for the movie. So at least Stallone is humble enough to admit his mistakes. Pre-Dredd we got a boastful, posturing actor - post-Dredd he said sorry. In a way that kind of makes it okay. Because Judge Dredd is Stallone's worst acting role bar none. Wooden, wearied and with awful diction, he seems most ill at ease when playing opposite Max Von Sydow. Maybe he was intimidated by Sydow's status, or maybe his stories of Cannon shouting Fear me! Just fear me! had led him to be frightened away from anything approaching a performance.Rob Schneider's irritating Fergie is only there for comic relief, though he's hardly comic and the only relief comes when he leaves a scene. His sole saving grace is to prick Stallone's ego with a cracking mickey-take of his I am the law! What really worries is the transparent formula of the piece.

It's a surprisingly violent and soulless film; a patronising moronfest that treats its audience with no respect whatsoever. Even the titles annoy, the opening music with its silly bombast and a pompous monologue by James Earl Jones. The accompanying images are a series of the 2001 comic from which the Judge Dredd character came. It's quite exceptional that a major Hollywood picture should credit a minor British comic in such a prominent way. Even more exceptional as the film is nothing like the comic. Did the cartoon Judge really have romantic entanglements and monotonously quip anti-catchphrase I new yuud say dat?The film opens out with a future cityscape ludicrously indebted to Blade Runner. Except where that picture had depth, this one throws it all up on screen, a garish splurge of CGI movement. To be honest, they aren't that convincing either, particularly later scenes where Dredd is flying his bike. Yet this was made 12 years after the more realistic-looking Blade Runner. Odd. Other rip-off, er, homages are a flying bike chase sequence straight out of Return of the Jedi. Though a scene where Hershey (Diane Lane) saves Stallone from falling by telling him to take my hand is a nice spoof of Cliffhanger.Stallone makes his first appearance as Dredd with the musical cues and iconography hopelessly indebted to the Terminator. He then proceeds to tell us that he's in no danger standing in the street as the criminals firing on him from a tower block are using weapons that are non-lethal from their range. This is strange, as less than two and a quarter minutes earlier we had seen one of said weapons killing a civilian from the same distance. I mean, if a movie can't maintain continuity over a three minute period then what sort of confidence can you have in it?Maybe part of the reason I dislike the film so much is Stallone. I've always had a great deal of time for Sylvester, and feel he's extremely underrated as an actor. However, at this time the sheer number of cursory action roles he was playing were dampening his reputation. Particularly as the action roles were not the equal of those given to an actor with infinitely less talent, Arnold Schwarzenegger. There was also an interview printed around the time where Sylvester gave a great number of right-wing views, and also laughably claimed that he'd read Homer to study for the role of Dredd. Maybe it was Homer Simpson. However, I've since told myself that the publication probably made it all up, and a reputable publication, Empire magazine, conducted an interview with the star in 1998. When asked if there were any film he would want to apologise for, he apologised for not really applying himself to Dredd and claimed that the film could have been a great satirical farce. His dislike of Danny Cannon's methods also led him to suggest that Terry Gilliam would have been a better director for the movie. So at least Stallone is humble enough to admit his mistakes. Pre-Dredd we got a boastful, posturing actor - post-Dredd he said sorry. In a way that kind of makes it okay. Because Judge Dredd is Stallone's worst acting role bar none. Wooden, wearied and with awful diction, he seems most ill at ease when playing opposite Max Von Sydow. Maybe he was intimidated by Sydow's status, or maybe his stories of Cannon shouting Fear me! Just fear me! had led him to be frightened away from anything approaching a performance.Rob Schneider's irritating Fergie is only there for comic relief, though he's hardly comic and the only relief comes when he leaves a scene. His sole saving grace is to prick Stallone's ego with a cracking mickey-take of his I am the law! What really worries is the transparent formula of the piece.

One This is a quality science fiction story. Two Will the style and violence overwhelm the story? - as too often occurs with potentially great sci-fi films inevitably by way of cheap scriptwriting. It is the nature of blockbuster type Hollywood films to screw up a good sci-fi thing by allowing the action to prioritize-to-death the story. As one might expect from an action film featuring Keanu Reeves, the dialogue tends toward the short-witted and stylish and there is plenty of gratuitous violence. But Hollywood has recently been on to this valid criticism of itself, and it appears to have been making some progress in this area.Matrix is an example of producers with an ear to those of us who want more than just ignorant dialogue and fast, violent action from our science fiction films. On one hand, they have basically a stylized kung-fu flick with an African-American heavily supporting a white lead, lots of black leather and overcoats, guns, action, state-of-the-art effects, futuristic spaceships etc. On the other, they have a sci-fi story that at first sounds typical but then unfolds into a well crafted tour of a potential futuristic human existence visualized through the context of what currently stands as cutting edge technology (virtual reality). This makes the idea hard science fiction, as in Arthur Clarke's Odyssey novels\/films which used NASA technology as their premise. There is also a biblical slant to the plot and names of characters and props.If I was to be picky, I might say that less gratuitous violence in exchange for more plot discerning dialogue would have improved the film. It would have made it more like a sci-fi book. But maybe I should just go and read the book for that (most blockbuster films nowadays have a book released along with them - Star Wars has several). Anyway, I hope there is a good book made from this story, because I would read it as avidly as any favorite sci-fi novel the plot idea is that good. Incidentally, the sequels to this film, typically are trash in comparison to the original. Very much disappointed, I had to realize that the producers\/director were far more involved in the stylization and special effects than the plot.

In the end, we may be victims of our own device, for we seek entertainment to help us forget about the drudgery of our lives. Our man-made systems, systems that were originally created to enhance independence from menial labor, may be creating a new form of slavery.It's a creepy thought. But maybe it's just fantasy.

Ignoring for a second that both Down and Boys both take place in college, Boys and Girls is a movie packed with talent, but a script so bad it should have been taken out and shot.Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan, a somewhat meek and nerdy boy who lives and dies by careful meticulous planning.  One day while waiting for a plane to take off he meets Jennifer (the very talented Claire Forlani) and thus begins their somewhat testy relationship.  Prinze backslides a bit here and becomes dull and cardboard onscreen.  I'm not sure if it was the dull nature of his character or that the script he had was full of hackneyed bull but watching him was like watching Al Gore speak at a retirement home.  It's called loosening up a bit...give it a try.Claire Forlani is Jennifer, a beautiful free spirited girl who lives life by the seat of her pants.  She is far too talented to be in this drivel (basically same plot as the other two...see my Down To You review for info).  Her talent shines through though and Jennifer becomes a character you sympathize with.  Well done Claire, but next time read the whole script.Amanda Detmer is Amy, Jennifer's friend and roommate.  A goofy girl who is constantly in therapy, this character was simply there to give Jen a gal pal at college.  YAAAWWWNNNN.Heather Donahue is Megan, one of Ryan's few dates.  I mention her because in her first post Blair Witch role she has been plugging Boys pretty hard. She has about a grand total of 5 minutes screen time and the Jackie O hairstyle doesnt work on her.  Maybe next time Heather.  I'm actually looking forward to seeing you act again.Now on to Jason Biggs.  After American Pie I thought we had a wonderful little actor breaking out.  I may have been wrong.  Loser will decide for sure later this year.  His Hunter\/Steve persona was a rewrite of his American Pie character and a bad one at that.  Lying and decieving girls to try to get dates, giving relationship advice while not having a clue. He does, however, have THE sequence in the movie.  Well, its actually in the credits...the notorious have you been with four women bit you're now seeing in the previews.  Stay for it..that 3 minutes is better than the entire 98 before it!!Boys and Girls requires no thought process, you have the movie figured out in the first 10 minutes and from there it goes downhill.

And while the theme and even the script are well thought out, Director James Clavell (who co-wrote To Sir, with Love and 1963's The Great Escape) makes a lot of choices that guarantee this movie will always be dated.For example, when Poitier's character takes his class to a museum, Clavell chooses to show the experience by still photographs of the students looking at sculptures, while 1960 rock music plays in the background.And speaking of music, Lulu's unspectacular title track from the movie is played three separate times during the movie, much to the distaste of anyone under 25.Plus, there are small technical problems that should have been averted. A party near the end of the movie showcases a band singing without any microphones. A conversation in the hallway is difficult to hear because of the echo. Small details that current Hollywood filmmakers would never dare try to get away with.All of that said, Poitier is brilliant, and makes this a film worth seeing. Poitier proved his ability to have fun with a character in 1963's Lilies of the Field. He showed his tremendous ability to remain stoic in 1967's In the Heat of the Night (which actually came out after To Sir, with Love). What he brings to this role, however, is a spectacular example of how a character can gradually grow throughout a one-and-a-half hour movie.A terrific example comes at the very beginning of the movie, when Poitier's character is in a bus surrounded by a group of lewd women. He remains emotionless for as long as he can, then shows just a hint of disgust, followed by just a hint of amusement.That scene provides great foreshadowing for the rest of the movie, as Poitier's character remains completely emotionless to his students, then loses his temper with them, and finally begins to care for them. Near the end of the movie, he actually tears up.Another good performance comes from Judy Geeson (Maggie Conway from TV's Mad About You). In this movie, Geeson plays one of the students who has a crush on Poitier's character. What makes her so fun to watch is not necessarily the chemistry she and Poitier have, but, instead the awkwardness that accompanies every scene they are in together.All in all, performances and a suitable script make this movie worth seeing. The directoral choices are cumbersome at times, but do not weaken the movie as a whole.I would not recommend the soundtrack, however.

This role played on his personality perfectly, tough, arrogant.  You get a good feel for this in Negotiator, but he seemed like he was held back, Shaft lets him really open up.Jeffery Wright was able to make the roll of Peoples larger than life while keeping it believable.  Portraying a very frightening master of the street.Christian Bale is instantly hate-able from his first line of dialogue as the spoiled rich butt-head Williams.  I think the ending should have been different.The story was well developed and really enjoyable. The audience laughed openly several times. It was refreshing to see a movie that relied on a good tale and had little or none of the slo-mo, trendy special affects that seem to have taken over.  Great job Singleton!

Mel Gibson really does shine and his Martin Riggs is quite haunting and disturbing at times. Danny Glover is also good, and he and Mel play off each other really well. Gary Busey shows potential, and probably this is his best role.The screenplay is surprisingly very well written, the characters are well rounded and their is some depth to some of them but the villains could've deserved more attention. Their motives are too cliche.The finale was a little too long but very well choreographed.Richard Donner certainly showed an eye for direction and the characters, he keeps the film going at a decent pace. I can see why he shot this film in 185.1The version I saw was the new director's cut, the extra scenes don't help the film, but worth watching.
