It's incredibly engrossing.As an example, consider the scene, where Alice (Nicole Kidman) and William (Tom Cruise) are kissing in front of a mirror in the beginning of the film. Alice is looking at herself in a horny, bad girl way. The light is orange. 'Baby did a bad bad thing' is blaring in the background. It's incredible. If you've seen it, you know what I mean.Stanley Kubrick was one of the great directors. We all know this. His choice of musical score, lighting, camera angles were as effective as they were bold. Where this film fails to reach the heights of 'Dr. Strangelove','Full Metal Jacket','Clockwork Orange' and the other great Kubrick films, is in the plot. The direction is flawless. The acting, especially by Nicole Kidman, is astounding. Whenever she is in a scene, she lights up (or should I say darkens?) the film. The joint scene in particular - I never knew Kidman could actually act! (That said, Tom Cruise seems to be free-wheeling through this film).But the plot.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"20 May 2000","score":"","review":"  Election is a terrific movie, one of the smartest comedies of the 1990s. As some other viewers have noted, it has certain similarities to To Die For; Election doesn't have quite as much technical and verbal brilliance, and its humor is more low-key, but on the other hand it doesn't caricature its characters quite as much and has a little more warmth.  No belly laughs here, but plenty of understated humor that bristles with intelligence and psychological insight.  (In one scene, an alienated, rebellious lesbian teenager is being lectured by her parents; her silent reactions to their comments are quietly hilarious.)The fact that there are no real good guys in Election, no one you can whole-heartedly root for, may be a turn-off to some viewers, but it's also what gives the film its complexity.  To some extent, we identify with Jim McAllister's loathing of the grasping, humorless control freak Tracy Flick. But when Tracy says that Mr. M. resented her so much because he felt stuck in an unsatisfying routine while watching many of his students go on to far more glamorous and successful lives ... well, she has a point, doesn't she. (Incidentally, I thought that using multiple narrators was a great touch!) And we also see that to some extent, his hatred of Tracy is driven by frustrated sexual desire.  While Jim McAllister's plight elicits sympathy, to say that his actions aren't admirable is an understatement.On the other hand, Tracy isn't just loathsome; her loneliness occasionally makes us feel sorry for her (though that side of her -- the yearning for human contact, which was obviously the primary motive behind her affair with the teacher -- isn't developed enough).  We also see that her single-minded determination to succeed at all costs is to some extent born of desperation, coming as she does from a relatively disadvantaged background as the daughter of a lower-middle-class single mother.  One can even understand her resentment of dumb (but nice) jock Paul Metzler's easy popularity.At least one IMDB reviewer has complained that Election puts down the work ethic by turning Tracy -- the only character with ambition and determination to make something of herself -- into the closest it has to a villain.  I disagree.  I personally dislike the term overachiever, which implies that too much achievement is a bad thing.  However, true achievement is about following your dream and excelling at something you love to do and something you have talent for.  The very fact that Tracy is involved in so many activities strongly suggests that she has no real passion for any of them, she just wants to get ahead in any way she can.  She's not an achiever so much as a status-seeker, a politician in the worst sense of the word -- adept at using cliches like I care about each and every one of you and when you vote for me, you vote for yourself, obsessed with things like perfect campaign posters, and sincerely convinced that her fellow students should be grateful to her for meaningless work like cleaning up group photos for the yearbook.Some people have compared the Tracy Flick character to Bill Clinton.  It's not a perfect analogy -- Bill is far more charismatic and much better at making people believe he actually cares about them.  But I guess you could say that Bill drives his enemies crazy in a way they can't fully explain, just as Mr. M. says of Tracy!In addition to a good script with crisp dialogue, Election is distinguished by excellent performances all-around.  Matthew Broderick is at his best here, showing his range an actor (very refreshing, after execrable trash like Godzilla and The Road to Wellville).  Reese Witherspoon is simply wonderful.  I've enjoyed her performances even in movies I didn't care for, such as Cruel Intentions and Fear.  She is one of those actors who can convey a lot just with their body language and facial expressions, and she certainly shows it here, in a role that often requires her to shift from sunny perkiness to grim rage in the blink of an eye.

","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2000","score":"","review":"  Election is a terrific movie, one of the smartest comedies of the 1990s. As some other viewers have noted, it has certain similarities to To Die For; Election doesn't have quite as much technical and verbal brilliance, and its humor is more low-key, but on the other hand it doesn't caricature its characters quite as much and has a little more warmth.  No belly laughs here, but plenty of understated humor that bristles with intelligence and psychological insight.  (In one scene, an alienated, rebellious lesbian teenager is being lectured by her parents; her silent reactions to their comments are quietly hilarious.)The fact that there are no real good guys in Election, no one you can whole-heartedly root for, may be a turn-off to some viewers, but it's also what gives the film its complexity.  To some extent, we identify with Jim McAllister's loathing of the grasping, humorless control freak Tracy Flick. But when Tracy says that Mr. M. resented her so much because he felt stuck in an unsatisfying routine while watching many of his students go on to far more glamorous and successful lives ... well, she has a point, doesn't she. (Incidentally, I thought that using multiple narrators was a great touch!) And we also see that to some extent, his hatred of Tracy is driven by frustrated sexual desire.  While Jim McAllister's plight elicits sympathy, to say that his actions aren't admirable is an understatement.On the other hand, Tracy isn't just loathsome; her loneliness occasionally makes us feel sorry for her (though that side of her -- the yearning for human contact, which was obviously the primary motive behind her affair with the teacher -- isn't developed enough).  We also see that her single-minded determination to succeed at all costs is to some extent born of desperation, coming as she does from a relatively disadvantaged background as the daughter of a lower-middle-class single mother.  One can even understand her resentment of dumb (but nice) jock Paul Metzler's easy popularity.At least one IMDB reviewer has complained that Election puts down the work ethic by turning Tracy -- the only character with ambition and determination to make something of herself -- into the closest it has to a villain.  I disagree.  I personally dislike the term overachiever, which implies that too much achievement is a bad thing.  However, true achievement is about following your dream and excelling at something you love to do and something you have talent for.  The very fact that Tracy is involved in so many activities strongly suggests that she has no real passion for any of them, she just wants to get ahead in any way she can.  She's not an achiever so much as a status-seeker, a politician in the worst sense of the word -- adept at using cliches like I care about each and every one of you and when you vote for me, you vote for yourself, obsessed with things like perfect campaign posters, and sincerely convinced that her fellow students should be grateful to her for meaningless work like cleaning up group photos for the yearbook.Some people have compared the Tracy Flick character to Bill Clinton.  It's not a perfect analogy -- Bill is far more charismatic and much better at making people believe he actually cares about them.  But I guess you could say that Bill drives his enemies crazy in a way they can't fully explain, just as Mr. M. says of Tracy!In addition to a good script with crisp dialogue, Election is distinguished by excellent performances all-around.  Matthew Broderick is at his best here, showing his range an actor (very refreshing, after execrable trash like Godzilla and The Road to Wellville).  Reese Witherspoon is simply wonderful.  I've enjoyed her performances even in movies I didn't care for, such as Cruel Intentions and Fear.  She is one of those actors who can convey a lot just with their body language and facial expressions, and she certainly shows it here, in a role that often requires her to shift from sunny perkiness to grim rage in the blink of an eye.

(God! It had only happened to me after watching 2001!) Magnolia is a complete masterpiece, a work of genius, which we need to see several times to catch everything. Every single detail has its importance and significance. Or not... Life indeed can't be explained... Things happen...Magnolia is a film about the past contrasting with the present. Many characters say this 'We are through with the past, but the past is not through with us.' It's a film about how our mistakes of the past reflect through our lives, and if we should be forgiven for those. The figure of a family is always there, specially the relationship between fathers and sons\/daughters. That's where coincidences appear. Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is a very well known TV presenter of a show where intellectual kids take part. He committed a mistake in the past, which may be the reason of the repulsion his daughter Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters), who is now a cocaine addicted, feels for him, even knowing that he is dying of cancer. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), producer of Gator's show, is on a more advanced level of the disease. He reveals to his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that he has a son, Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise), who is now a very famous misogynist. He also hates his father, because he left his mother when she was dying of cancer. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) was a famous kid at Gator's show in the '60s, but his parents took his money from him. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is now the star of 'What Do Kids Know?', but his father is only interested on the money he is about to win. Both Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) and Claudia do their actions by the effect of drugs. Both Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and Phil are kinds of helpers. Claudia, Donnie, Frank and now Stanley suffer from childhood traumas. Donnie, with the bartender, Linda, with Earl, and Kurring, with Claudia, suffer because of love. Claudia, Frank and now Gator's wife Rose (Melinda Dillon) can't forgive other people for their mistakes. Wow! And there are more coincidences by the way. But this is not important. What matters is what the film has to say, and PT Anderson does this job very well. In a year of so many complex films (American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), Magnolia may be the most complex and almost the most original (just behind Being John Malkovich). Complex because it talks about so many main subjects, and it does this perfectly well. As I said, everything has its importance. And original because it just doesn't have any cliché. Of course originality does not always mean quality (see The Blair Witch Project), but here it really works. Its similarities with Short Cuts and other Robert Altman's pictures are very small. The film editing is brilliant, the situations are beautiful and bitter and there are things we aren't used to see. The prologue is a joy, talking about amazing coincidences that can't be just coincidences, and prepares us for something unexpected. Near the end, all the main characters suddenly start to sing 'Wise Up', desperate as they are. Great! And... there is the conclusion. The rain of frogs. Yes, it has a sense. It is taken from Exodus 82- it's one of the plagues thrown by God at Egypt. Why don't throw a Bible plague at San Fernando Valley? We had already been prepared for this since the prologue and by characters' quotes and things written on bills, outdoors.PT Anderson, working with an amazing cast (I've already talked about that on my first comment), does a PERFECT job here. He even pays homage to Stanley Kubrick (my favorite director), with 'Thus Spoke Zaratrusta' (from 2001). And, as the master, he leaves us with some questions. For example, what does the black boy mean? Who is he? A kind of God's hand? And there's the end. In 2001, Kubrick gave us wonderful, unspoken 20 minutes of impressive images. In Magnolia, Anderson gives us a sudden end. Nothing of 'they lived happily ever after', but shows us that people need a second chance. The last scene takes place in the morning after the rain of frogs. It shows Kurring forgiving Claudia, saying that she is a good, beautiful person, who needs to love and to be loved. She smiles, looking at the camera. It is just... a wonder!I had to think to say this, because I was considering American Beauty as my favorite movie the week I saw it, but then I woke up.

What matters is what the film has to say, and PT Anderson does this job very well. In a year of so many complex films (American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), Magnolia may be the most complex and almost the most original (just behind Being John Malkovich). Complex because it talks about so many main subjects, and it does this perfectly well. As I said, everything has its importance. And original because it just doesn't have any cliché. Of course originality does not always mean quality (see The Blair Witch Project), but here it really works. Its similarities with Short Cuts and other Robert Altman's pictures are very small. The film editing is brilliant, the situations are beautiful and bitter and there are things we aren't used to see. The prologue is a joy, talking about amazing coincidences that can't be just coincidences, and prepares us for something unexpected. Near the end, all the main characters suddenly start to sing 'Wise Up', desperate as they are. Great! And... there is the conclusion. The rain of frogs. Yes, it has a sense. It is taken from Exodus 82- it's one of the plagues thrown by God at Egypt. Why don't throw a Bible plague at San Fernando Valley? We had already been prepared for this since the prologue and by characters' quotes and things written on bills, outdoors.PT Anderson, working with an amazing cast (I've already talked about that on my first comment), does a PERFECT job here. He even pays homage to Stanley Kubrick (my favorite director), with 'Thus Spoke Zaratrusta' (from 2001). And, as the master, he leaves us with some questions. For example, what does the black boy mean? Who is he? A kind of God's hand? And there's the end. In 2001, Kubrick gave us wonderful, unspoken 20 minutes of impressive images. In Magnolia, Anderson gives us a sudden end. Nothing of 'they lived happily ever after', but shows us that people need a second chance. The last scene takes place in the morning after the rain of frogs. It shows Kurring forgiving Claudia, saying that she is a good, beautiful person, who needs to love and to be loved. She smiles, looking at the camera. It is just... a wonder!I had to think to say this, because I was considering American Beauty as my favorite movie the week I saw it, but then I woke up. Well, I'm still dreaming of Magnolia, so that I can say it's the BEST FILM OF 1999!

His latest movie Small Time Crooks serves well as a case study in filmmaker lethargy.  Not only is this the unfunniest, most mind-numbingly boring film Allen has ever made, but it is also so half-baked in almost every aspect of its production that I'm certain it will be one of the worst films of the year.Small Time Crooks, as most people who have seen the film have correctly noted, is intended to be viewed as a trivial comedy.  Allen has not made a film like this in a long time; after his monumental Annie Hall (which, for the record, is on my all-time top ten list), Allen's films ventured into more cerebral comedy while often confronting large, existential themes. While I far prefer his later work both for its superior ambitions and more sophisticated and just plain funnier comedy, Allen's early work has its well-reasoning defenders.  Sleeper, Bananas, and Take the Money and Run were all zany, well-executed comedies that, if lacking in intellectual content or real wit, at least delivered the goods - good slapstick, original sight gags and those wonderfully incisive one-liners.In Small Time Crooks Allen's screenplay traps him and renders him powerless in utilizing his comic arsenal.  His character is written to be too stupid to be witty, and as a result he never capatilizes on any of the many comic opportunities.  When the Allen character arrives home to find his culture-seeking wife has purchaced an obviously hideous piece of modern art, Allen, as usual, stammers and wrings his hands. As the neurotic fiddling builds to a crescendo, we in the audience anticipate the put-down.  It never comes he stupidly turns away and says he'll never look at the wall with the painting on it, in more or less those words.  That same disappointment comes time after time.I suppose that Woody's wife (the extraordinarily gifted Tracey Ullman) is supposed to act as sort of a foil to him, but she too is written to be a boob and the few witticisms she is given are wasted in the film's first five minutes.  Throughout the rest of the movie she's involved in a painfully predictible plot as the rich cookie company owner whose fortune attracts Hugh Grant, who attempts to romance her out of it.  Now Hugh Grant, in all his films, has the kind of charming screen presence that makes you wish you were his grandmother so you could reach across the screen and lovingly pinch him.  Here as a smarmy art dealer out for Tracey Ullman's money he's so devastatingly sweet that we actually believe he is falling in love with her and not scheeming his way into her checkbook.  It's all wrong.The whole story meanders in a way that reminds me of amateur improv miraculously sustained on life support.  Episodes idiotically and tangentially succeed each other with no logic, and in the process Jon Lovitz, Michael Rappaport, and Douglas McGrath end up marooned in the film's first reel.  In most movies, knowing that these three talented character actors never come back would be heartbreaking.  In this movie it's a mercy killing since they were never given anything funny to work with in the first place.Why are none of the characters intelligently written?  Because writing smart characters and smart dialougue requires a great deal more effort than Allen has put into this bombshell.  The lines themselves are limp and lifeless - most of them just have the actors repeating what their scene partners said before them - and the performances are similarly devoid of any energy. Remember in Take the Money and Run and the other early films how hyper and utterly spastic the Woody Allen character was and how happy he was to be on camera?  In Small Time Crooks the comic vitality that this material requires isn't there.  It's fortunate that even the slapstick was minimal given this energy drain.  Unusually choppy editing (for a Woody Allen movie - he usually gives us long, continuously shot scenes with much more interesting and rapid wordplay) at times seems to be covering up for the director's laziness and ineptitude. Even the music selection, which Allen can normally pride himself on, here seems carelessly done. I remember at least one tune that played about six times that in any other movie of Allen's would have been replaced by six other livelier and more appropriate pieces.Small Time Crooks is so thoughtlessly made in its vexing build-ups that never deliver, its obviously hasty casting, its totally incoherent plot, its soggy dialogue, and its off-target performances that I refuse to believe that this film was made in more time than the lifespan of a titsi fly. This is not the same Woody Allen that gave us Hannah and Her Sisters or even the same Woody who gave us Sleeper.

This whole line of reasoning... did I say reasoning? Sorry. Was so contrived and obvious that it killed the momentum that was flowing up to that point. Suddenly *CLUNK*. The whole thing ground to a halt for me. The gay subtext was interesting, but superfluous. It could have been handled better. Despite this, I really enjoyed this movie. The performances were awesome! The art direction and cinematography were unparalleled. I thought the scene where Spacey was fantasizing about Suvari, with her on the ceiling (so to speak) and the rose petals dropping on him were amazing! Did it deserve to win over the other offerings at the academy awards this year? Dunno. But it certainly deserved to be nominated. Basically, I thought the perfromances were incredible, the actors really pulled this one off. The writing left something to be desired, but was okay overall.

Keep in mind, I *liked* this movie.***WARNING***Don't read the rest of this if you don't like spoilers.First of all, the gratuitous and unnecessary climax and denouement. I was satisfied after Spacey had his epiphany when he discovered the fact that Suvari was a virgin. A very nice touch. Perfect. But NOOOOOOOO!
