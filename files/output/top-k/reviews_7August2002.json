However, when I went to see it in a relatively packed theatre, everyone was into the movie. It did make you feel uncomfortable, and there were about 4 parts that made you jump. There were a lot of funny parts, and overall it was funnier than it was scary. But there are faults with the movie 1) If the aliens are allergic to water, why would they choose to invade a planet which is 70% water, and harvest human when the human body is mostly made of water also? 2)If I aliens had just been trying to get into my cellar door, there is no chance in hell I would pass out and go to sleep for 12 hours. It is far more likely that I would pass out for 30 minutes, and every slight noise I would hear would wake me up. The film had a feeling very similiar to the superior film called The Others, and it also reminded me a lot of Night of the Living Dead, but it is worth the money, and its an anjoyable film. As for if it is worthy of an oscar, I say no. The oscars are awards that have no basis on whether a film is good or not, its just a bunch of old people sitting around playing movie buffs. Come on, like a Beautiful Mind should have won best picture.

The clothes are ugly enough to be from the 70s.  The hair is too big. You are not assaulted with reminders that this is a period piece, although I did notice some of the dialogue seemed out of place - there should be some references to that time in which the movie takes place, like for example the expressions and slang that were popular at the time, but a lot of what the characters say sounds contemporary.  Not a big deal, but if the writers had rented teen\/kids movies from the time - Smile, The Bad News Bears and Little Darlings come to mind - or watched tv shows from that period, perhaps the movie would have felt more authentic.I laughed a couple of times but never got that feeling where the movie was good enough to just settle in and watch and know you are in capable hands.  During something like this, I am sometimes unrelaxed, hoping for something great to happen to bring me over that hump that presents itself when the going gets rough, and the going was rough during 80% of this, for me.

Maybe if it had not been so hyped I would have been less offended, but really what are people thinking comparing the directing to Hitchcock and Speilberg? I am less surprised by how bad the movie is, and more by people's reactions to it, which I find absolutely flabbergasting.***SPOILERS ALL THE WAY!**** The story, such as it is, has been summarized in other reviews so I will deal with its meager elements. I'm not sure whether these are spoilers because frankly I did not find anything suspenseful in the entire movie. But if you have made up your mind to see it anyway then you should avoid reading this paragraph. Mel Gibson stars as a wooden faced ex-priest who everyone still calls father but who has apparently given up his priesthood because his wife died in a car accident. First of all not much of a priest to put one's faith in - I mean what did he tell his parishioners who experienced tragedy - better you than me? Anyway take the director's word for it - the man has lost his faith in God. And the movie is about how he regains that faith in one revelating moment (the last 2 mins). That's it. Even if one is remotely interested in how an individual misplaces or regains faith this movie would not satisfy- there is no gradual questioning or development, there is no subtlety anywhere to be found. This is not one man's journey - there is no trip, the guy is standing in the same spot and stuff falls out of the sky onto his head. Faith is regained in an aha moment, just like it was apparently lost in one. Even though I'm not a remotely religious person (and this premise bores me silly) I can still see how insulting it is to pitch faith as an object one can lose in an instant. What about the fact that this guy does not believe, respect,or get any joy out of his son, brother or daughter? To me he looked like he needed to take some Prozac.Ok now for the mistreated aliens in the movie. People have billed the alien invasion as being scary. I wonder what movies these people have been watching? Hokey - yes, cheesy - yes, scary - no. Compare this to the Blair Witch Project ( a far far superior movie so I don't really want to suggest that they are comparable), and what you have is Everybody Loves Raymond. There are precisely 3 BOO! moments that you are fully expecting and that are very shabby. Getting into the specifics, these aliens are technologically advanced enough to come all the way across the universe - yet they have not figured out that water can kill them? What happens when it rains?! The planet is 3\/4 water for chrissakes! The alien part was so schlocky that all I can assume is that the director meant it to be that way. Why so lame? It was a way to get people into the movie theater - which has worked. When people attribute a subtler motive, i.e. the alien stuff is to distract you etc, that does not work because without the aliens the guy could not regain his faith - the big message. Contrary to what is being put forth, the alien part is crucial - i.e. no aliens - no plot. Then why was it done so badly? Because he could not figure out a way to do it well. If you want to see a real spoof of aliens see Mars Attacks. Signs is not a nod to bad B movies of aliens attacking earth - this is the genuine article.Now to the characters. There are 4 in the family and one policewoman. The two kids and the policewoman are all developed early and then they disappear. Why? I don't know. The kids don't literally disappear (the police does even though aliens are attacking)- but they don't have any roles once the aliens attack. Boy is laid low with asthma, girl stands around. At the beginning the boy is given a rather proactive role, he hears sounds on the baby monitor, checks a book out of the library and teaches his dad and uncle everything there is to know about aliens, makes tin hats for everyone to protect their thoughts. Then once the attack happens - kaput. Nothing, he's got no plan, no ideas, no role. The boy killed the beloved family dog with an axe to protect his sister in the first scene, and then when the aliens attack, all he;s asked to do is pass out. I think the director was too distracted trying to get Mel Gibson to develop a second expression for his face. Apparently the whole point of having that character in the movie is that he had asthma. Then all the stuff at the beginning was just to keep the actor busy cos it has no significance whatsoever for the movie. Same for the policewoman, just disappears in the second half of the film when these people are under attack! Perhaps the local law enforcement agency needs more funding. Then you have the director himself in an incredibly stupid vignette - a long winded melodramatic speech asking for forgiveness and then he revs up the car and drives off at high speed while Mel Gibson is still holding on to the side of the car. You'd think that if you ran over someone you would watch your wheels around remaining members of their family. The brother. The brother is a jock, albeit a somewhat unsuccessful one. Is that relevant for the movie? No. This jock does not even think of bringing a weapon with him down to the basement where they go to hide from the aliens.  So let's get this straight, somewhere in rural pennsylvania in the middle of cornfields, in a farmhouse, there are no weapons? I don;t mean AK-47s - no get this, as aliens are trying to break down the windows and doors, two able bodied men take two young children down to the basement, and they don't even have a kitchen knife with them! The jock even has to be directed to a baseball bat to smite one of the evil ones - otherwise he would just keep standing there with his mouth slightly agape while a slimy creature digs its long unpainted nails into his nephew's face.Of course the jock can;t reach for the baseball bat himself because faithless guy has to remember dead wife's last words and direct him to pick up the bat. All part of the subtle plot.I will stop now, reliving this film has been painful. But I have to add one last note - thank god for the last scene - that kept us laughing all the way home.

There are precisely 3 BOO! moments that you are fully expecting and that are very shabby. Getting into the specifics, these aliens are technologically advanced enough to come all the way across the universe - yet they have not figured out that water can kill them? What happens when it rains?! The planet is 3\/4 water for chrissakes! The alien part was so schlocky that all I can assume is that the director meant it to be that way. Why so lame? It was a way to get people into the movie theater - which has worked. When people attribute a subtler motive, i.e. the alien stuff is to distract you etc, that does not work because without the aliens the guy could not regain his faith - the big message. Contrary to what is being put forth, the alien part is crucial - i.e. no aliens - no plot. Then why was it done so badly? Because he could not figure out a way to do it well. If you want to see a real spoof of aliens see Mars Attacks. Signs is not a nod to bad B movies of aliens attacking earth - this is the genuine article.Now to the characters. There are 4 in the family and one policewoman. The two kids and the policewoman are all developed early and then they disappear. Why? I don't know. The kids don't literally disappear (the police does even though aliens are attacking)- but they don't have any roles once the aliens attack. Boy is laid low with asthma, girl stands around. At the beginning the boy is given a rather proactive role, he hears sounds on the baby monitor, checks a book out of the library and teaches his dad and uncle everything there is to know about aliens, makes tin hats for everyone to protect their thoughts. Then once the attack happens - kaput. Nothing, he's got no plan, no ideas, no role. The boy killed the beloved family dog with an axe to protect his sister in the first scene, and then when the aliens attack, all he;s asked to do is pass out. I think the director was too distracted trying to get Mel Gibson to develop a second expression for his face. Apparently the whole point of having that character in the movie is that he had asthma. Then all the stuff at the beginning was just to keep the actor busy cos it has no significance whatsoever for the movie. Same for the policewoman, just disappears in the second half of the film when these people are under attack! Perhaps the local law enforcement agency needs more funding. Then you have the director himself in an incredibly stupid vignette - a long winded melodramatic speech asking for forgiveness and then he revs up the car and drives off at high speed while Mel Gibson is still holding on to the side of the car. You'd think that if you ran over someone you would watch your wheels around remaining members of their family. The brother. The brother is a jock, albeit a somewhat unsuccessful one. Is that relevant for the movie? No. This jock does not even think of bringing a weapon with him down to the basement where they go to hide from the aliens.  So let's get this straight, somewhere in rural pennsylvania in the middle of cornfields, in a farmhouse, there are no weapons? I don;t mean AK-47s - no get this, as aliens are trying to break down the windows and doors, two able bodied men take two young children down to the basement, and they don't even have a kitchen knife with them! The jock even has to be directed to a baseball bat to smite one of the evil ones - otherwise he would just keep standing there with his mouth slightly agape while a slimy creature digs its long unpainted nails into his nephew's face.Of course the jock can;t reach for the baseball bat himself because faithless guy has to remember dead wife's last words and direct him to pick up the bat. All part of the subtle plot.I will stop now, reliving this film has been painful. But I have to add one last note - thank god for the last scene - that kept us laughing all the way home.

Yes, I enjoyed the special effects, which were beyond superb, but it takes more than special effects to get me to enjoy a movie.  When the Matrix was released, these effects were amazing, something brand new and outrageous, but now they are nothing unusual and when you take away that aspect of the film, you get nothing.  You get a stupid, uninteresting plot and a cast of terrible actors, minus Laurence Fishburne.  Not that the actors are terrible, just their acting in this movie is terrible.

Plot and acting are two things I look for ahead of special effects in a movie. I can enjoy a movie that has absolutely no special effects whatsoever and was filmed with an amateur home video camera, as long as the plot and acting are good.  This movie, with a huge budget, wasted all of it on special effects and none of it on teaching the actors how to act or paying the Wachowski's to improve the script and to learn how to direct.

If I am going to give the movie any praise it would have to be directed almost completely at Elliot Gould's character who provided the only funny scene with his re-telling of the most successful heists in Vegas history.  That was amusing and that was about it.I fully understand there are movies out there that just serve to entertain and do not deserve to be scrutinized because there's really nothing there but style and show (see the whole Bruckheimer collection).  If only Ocean's Eleven could have deviated from this formula a little more.  If the audience could have gotten into the characters and legitimately related to them, empathized with them, rooted for them, whatever, then the events of the movie would have carried some real weight.  Ocean's Eleven, in devoting so much time to showing this ridiculously complicated scam play out, didn't have any time left for the fine points like that.  All in all, it was too-big, too-stylish, and seriously too-forgettable.  Damn, what a disappointment.

I wasn't disappointed.I went into Signs expecting something completely different than what it was. I thought it would be more about the crop signs and aliens. Being a Shyamalan film, I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect anything like this. What surprised me was that this is not about an alien invasion or even crop circles. Yes, they are devices used to spark the story, but they could have been replaced with another setup and the film could have easily told the same story. More than aliens or crop circles, this is a film about faith, losing it and gaining it back.If I have a problem with the film, it's that I wanted to know more. More about what the aliens, more about how the rest of the world reacted. Ultimately, however, that is not what the movie is about. It is about Mel Gibson's character's search for his lost faith.I've read comments from this and other sites saying the aliens were too stupid with their strategies and they were weak and there weren't enough of them and other things the aliens should have done better if they were so advanced. The thing is, they explain that this is merely a small recon wave of them to check things out. That explains the small number of them and the lack of weapons.The movie is expertly executed, building up suspense, adding small character quirks and issues that seem insignificant- just minor character development, but in the climax come together perfectly without seeming contrived.This is a great film. Possibly Shyamalan's best (Unbreakable may still be better) and easily one of the best (if not THE best) of the year so far.

This movie points out the flaws of the Christian community but is never truly meant to be insulting (at least in my opinion), because I don't think Kevin Smith despises church. He just thinks there is room for improvement.The acting in the movie is great. Although I'm not the greatest fans of Matt Damon (Loki) and Ben Affleck (Bartleby)(although they do have their moments) they fit perfectly into this movie as two angels who want to get back into heaven. Linda Fiorentino is great as Bethany, the last descendant of Christ who has to stop Loki and Bartleby from going back to heaven as this will end humanity. This assignment is given to her by a character who is brilliantly interpreted by Alan Rickman, Metatron, the voice of God. Salma Hayek plays a former muse, Serendipity, who now works in a strip club.

Gibson's character, once a reverend, has lost his faith following the seemingly pointless and horrid death of his wife in an accident. The plot of the movie is mainly the renewal of Gibson's faith as he discovers his wife's death is not a random and pointless accident, but has a designed purpose behind it. The events that cause this renewal in the character's faith is an alien invasion. Frankly I found the film to be lousy - and not because of the film's focus per se. I did not expect a slam 'em bang 'em flick as Independence Day nor did I expect amazing special effects. Neither of those elements make any film good alone. I did expect a deep story about Gibson's character's faith. As noted above, the idea was there, but it was executed rather badly. Most of the film centers around these signs of the alien invasion - but they are useless to the story other than driving Gibson towards the ultimate rediscovery of his faith in divine purpose. The film therefore is simply a bunch of scenes that are driving to the rather short and unsatisfying ending. Because the ending is so important to the film and you realize that the alien stuff is just backdrop to the whole story, you sit in the theater just waiting for the film to end. It could easily have been a half hour episode of the Twilight Zone rather than the 2 hours (or near) that it is. The backstory of Gibson's loss of faith take up about 15 minutes of screen time if that. The rest of the film is taken up with 'tense' sequences dealing with the characters trying to figure out if the aliens are out there and what they're up to. But we the audience already knows the point of the film has nothing to do with aliens, so who cares? In additon, the tense scenes aren't scary or that tense either. The cinematography of the film was good. Mel Gibson and the actors playing his family did all do a good job with what they had - but very little they had actually added to the theme of faith in the movie. Other scenes and actors gave weak performances. Particularly I remember a scene where the 'uncle' is speaking to an army officer where I wondered why the scene was even taking place (oh yeah, to establish the whole baseball bat thing!) I'm rolling my eyes.POSSIBLE SPOILER I don't want to reveal too much, but the whole baseball bat idea of 'swing it' was a rather weak way leading to reinspiring faith. It almost seems like Gibson's character is stretching to give meaning to his wife's words so that he can get through the disaster that is at hand at the film's end. Perhaps that is the point, but if it is, nothing more is said or implied to give the film any true meaning.I liked the Sixth Sense. Unbreakable was okay. This film could have been good if it would have stuck to its main theme of rediscovery of faith. The focus of this film is instead misplaced around the aliens And thereby many theater-goers are understandably surprised when the end FINALLY comes to learn it's supposed to be all about faith. No matter what you go to this film for (faith or aliens) you should be disappointed.

People are talking about Shyamalan as the next Spielberg but he reminds me more of a modern version of Hitchcock with his directing skills and innovative camera techniques.However, despite the wonderful direction of the movie, it was very disappointing to me. Shyamalan seems to like putting a twist in all of his films. In the Sixth Sense, the big twist worked beautifully. In Unbreakable, it didn't quite work as well since the twist was rather poorly-developed and the story wasn't very good anyway IMHO (in spite of the excellent directing and acting in the film).In Signs, the twist is again rather poorly-developed and the premise for it is seemingly tossed in rather awkwardly (in my opinion) during a speech made halfway through the movie which is basically about beliefs as to whether everything happens for a reason under control of a god (fate) or not.By the end of the movie, the twist is revealed and we find out that the main focus of the movie is not so much about aliens as on a man losing his faith finding 'signs' of miracles happening. To remind us to go 'ooooh' and 'aaaah' at the poorly-developed twist, the scenes of the premise speech is shown in a flashback. The aliens turn out to be a rather exotic vehicle for testing the man's faith - convenient because they're the only things that keep the movie exciting and allow for neat but misleading trailers.Some people might find the religious revelations to be really great and exit the theater feeling really good about themselves. Personally, I just winced a bit and tried to shrug it off. I think the movie tries to be like Contact by mixing in questions of religion and faith with extraterrestrial activity, but falls short of being the great through-provoking film that Contact turned out to be.Nevertheless, Signs does manage to be a great thriller with some very suspenseful scenes heightened by Shyamalan's great directing and the film's effective use of music and sound effects. However, don't expect too much more or you might get disappointed like me. I think Shyamalan should keep to directing and try finding some other people to do the writing for him.
