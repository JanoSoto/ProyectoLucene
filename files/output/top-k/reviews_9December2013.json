It simply shows the small courtyard outside that can be viewed through the rear windows of the Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan, specifically James Stewart's character's, as the bright red blinds roll up, revealing each individual section of the window. Playing in the background is a peaceful score and after about one minute and forty seconds of credits and a static camera, Hitchcock moves us outside that window, showing us the sights of the village's backyard. From flower beds, to cats lounging around, to a dog being transported from the top balcony to the ground below, etc, the sight is familiar and commonplace to this specific setting. After a few minutes of a relaxing and almost romantic stroll through the wonders of Greenwich's backyard we meet out main character.His name is L.B. Jeff Jefferies (James Stewart), a professional photographed now confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. He remains in his apartment during a brutal heatwave, where he and his neighbors keep their windows open all day and night. Jeff passes the time by watching his neighbors go about their daily routines; one of which is a young, attractive dancer he cleverly names Miss Torso, a woman who often sits all by her lonesome, a pianist, a sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a wife confined to her bedroom because of an illness.Jeff frequently gets visits from his wealthy and gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), but while the two have notable chemistry and know how to take care of each other well, Jeff simply views her as too perfect. He confesses this to Stella (Thelma Ritter), the sassy, home-care nurse he has been assigned to and states how he would much rather have a woman with more visible flaws than one who seems to ooze perfection and gorgeousness with every step she makes.One night, however, this thought becomes nothing but a faint memory when Jeff awakes to the sound of a woman screaming and glass breaking. The noise comes from Thorwald's apartment, the apartment directly across from Jeff's rear window. Jeff then sees Thorwald leaving his home and is troubled by the sudden disappearance of Thorwald's wife over the next few days. Frequent spying and self-contemplation (along with bouncing the ideas off of the heads of Lisa and Stella) leads Jeff to arrive at the conclusion that Thorwald murdered his wife for reasons unknown to him. He then spends long hours watching Thorwald's every move, trying to arrive at a sensible conclusion for an action that is unjustifiable.Hitchcock achieves the power and impact necessary for a film like this thanks to his act of making the audience a voyeur in their own right. We can judge Jeff about snooping and eavesdropping on his neighbors all we want, but are we looking away during the film? Are we the ones covering our eyes when Jeff pulls out binoculars to see across the courtyard? If not, and we're criticizing him for his actions, we are not only hypocrites but we are condemning ourselves and our own actions. We are disagreeing with our own practices and not even recognizing them.Hitchcock leaves us with this uncomfortable feeling of seeing something we're really not supposed to or overhearing things that weren't intended for our ears. This kind of filmmaking is wonderful, especially for the time when audiences were most often used to being in a place of comfort. Films of the fifties, like Singin' in the Rain, offered a happier escape and put us in a place of joyful exuberance. Hitchcock dared to make us feel uncomfortable and make us feel unsettled at all times. He utilized lengthy shots, establishing a mood by showing off all the simple, day-to-day occurrences in a typical courtyard in America. These lengthy shots are key to the film's success. The only thing better than Jeff and Lisa conversing about everyday life or their relationship is when the scenes do the talking for us and that's key to Rear Window's success. It keeps a simple story relatively basic but also dares to let us experience the environment without the burden of chatter.Every Hitchcock film has, what he has dubbed, a MacGuffin, or something tangible (or intangible) that the characters in the film are searching for that we, the audience, may or may not care about. The MacGuffin here is simply proof, proof in favor of Jeff's case. With this MacGuffin, the audience is put in an odd place. We want Jeff to achieve the satisfaction of him being able to prove his case and not be made a fool of, but we also want this all to be a misunderstanding and find that Thorwald's wife isn't really dead. The way Hitchcock goes about trying to give us a two-faced MacGuffin is enticing entertainment.Rear Window is invigorating with tremendous features that make thrillers interesting. From lengthy shots, to great performances, to an interesting premise, and the idea of repercussions arising from unintentional actions. My knowledge and resume for Hitchcock films is depressingly low for a cinephile, and seeing Rear Window was a right place at the right time event considering my relatively low faith in modern thrillers and crime capers.Starring James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr.

The only reason Van Damme draws a crowd is because he is a good fighter, but you don't notice this in this movie, the fight scenes are rubbish.

The action in the movie was good but the plot seriously sucked. Basically there were so many holes in the plot that it created a movie that you only go and see for Van Damme, and I don't think that he is that great anyway. If you are wanting to see Van Damme's moves, then this is not the movie to see them in. In fact, if you simply want to see good fighting, hire out a Hong Kong video - there generally tends to be much better moves in them.The vice president is going to the Ice Hockey finals and some guy, the movie really never actually explains who he is, only that he knows the government security operations very well, holds him hostage so that he can force the president to remove money from frozen bank accounts. The problem is that they grab a nosey little girl who turns out to be Van Damme's daughter, and that brings him into it.Van Damme's character is a fireman who quit after a girl died in his arms. Now, the thing that annoyed me is that they showed this part, and it really had nothing to do with the movie. It could have just as easily been explained afterwards than to show it. I think that it would have been much better for the plot line if they spent some time describing who Foss, the antagonist, was. They dropped hints but they never actually went as far as outlining everything. Some might say that it is not important because this is an action movie, but I think it is. It makes for a very poor movie to simply disregard plot for action.Sudden Death is a better Van Damme movie and I enjoyed it. All but this stupid sporting commentator in the booth, but then this is what you expect from commentators. I generally do not watch sports because first I find them boring, but mostly because the commentators are prone to say the stupidest things. These guys tried to make themselves look tough, when they really just didn't think about what they were saying. Actually, it was even worse because it was scripted.I liked it, and I am sure Van Damme fanatics would love it. Personally I would rather go back to the original Die Hard.

But it was Boogie Nights that launched his career into the mainstream, and earned him several Oscar nominations. But it was robbed, BIG TIME, for at least a nomination for best picture. Boogie Nights is hands down one of the best American movies in the last 25 years. P.T Anderson is an undeniable master of drama, and he (really) should stand among the ranks of Tarentino and Scorsese. The way he weaved this tumultuous narrative was groundbreaking for any filmmaker of the time. The story is essentially a young man finally finding the love and affection he always needed from a new family. The only problem is, this family is in the smut business. It's a story as provocative as the centerfold of a Hustler magazine, but as thought provoking as Citizen Kane. The performances are some of the best I've ever seen. Mark Wahlberg's screen debut as Dirk Diggler is arguably his best performance to date. Burt Reynolds is captivating as Jack Horner, the pornographer who dreams of making Oscar gold. Julianne Moore deserved her Oscar for her performance of Amber Waves, a former mother who finds her sense of family with the people she sleeps with, and not with the children she birthed. Also, you've got Heather Graham as Rollergirl, Don Cheadle, the always funny John C. Reilly, the even funnier Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Then, you have William H. Macy as Little Bill, or what can only be described as the ultimate cuckold. His shattering performance ranks with Steve Buscemi's Donny from The Big Lebowski as one of the funniest characters in all of film. Who else could forget the scene at the drug dealers house with the firecrackers and the&#x85;.? OK for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, I might be getting ahead of myself. I just get so excited talking about this film! Its scenes like that that make the entire film an unforgettable experience. This film clocks in at 155 minutes which is precisely one minute longer than Pulp Fiction, but like Pulp Fiction, every minute is enthralling. Its the greatest 2 and 1\/2 hours you could possibly spend on Netflix. My love for this movie grows every time I think about it, and I want to share that love with all of you. Enjoy!

The truth of my initial viewing is Martin Scorsese's direction dropped me so far into Travis' mind and I never understood any of his actions as wrong. I didn't see him as a vigilante or even insane, I felt his struggles, loneliness, and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people. It was not until I read up on the film after the fact that it hit me, Taxi Driver is a diary of a mad man, not a hero's tale. This led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me, lined in a sour sorrow that maybe I was crazy because I've been extremely lonely. Maybe everyone's crazy. Are we crazy because we're lonely?We've all felt like that dead animal Travis focuses on as he watches TV, while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul. What Scorsese makes of Taxi Driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel, but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap. We try to reach out, but the people we want, do not want us back. There are people that accept us into their lives, even if we surround ourselves with them, we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want. This makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness.Betsy represents who Travis wants unmutually and Iris is the woman he can literally have, but has no interest in possessing. Using his masculinity, Travis can't extract revenge on Betsy by killing the man she looks up to (the presidential candidate), so he kills the man of Iris he is able to murder (the pimp).Taxi Driver show's Travis' loneliness in two specific acts in the finale 1) the need to change the world's problems (with the shootout) and 2) wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself. After Travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save Iris, he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. The light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint Travis feels. Loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to. Not only is it my opinion that I think this is Scorsese's best film, but I would guess this is one that's most personal to him. In particular with the placement of his cameos 1) by gazing at Betsy, he's acts as Travis 2.0, showing his fascination and love\/lust for her. 2) the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs Travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence. The framing of Scorsese to DeNiro make the director like the devil on the side of Travis' shoulder, telling him to feed into his dark side.Scorsese is aided by Robert DeNiro's portrayal, there's no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as Travis Bickle. One of the finest performances in cinema, he's a factor that made my first reaction so personal. DeNiro's finest scene is talking to The Wizard outside the coffeeshop. We understand Travis, we've been in his mind, we know what he wants to say, but he struggles to communicate when he tries.The point of view of Taxi Driver is crucial to the brilliance of Scorsese's work. He puts us in Travis' mind and his feelings. To realize Travis's violent, criminal actions fed me food for thought how do we know if we are like Travis? Inside our own minds, we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain. We have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds, even in Travis' head, we feel victimized by Betsy. However, if we look at the story from Betsy's point of view Travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move. Can we *really* blame her? Perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people's perspectives, not only our own in everyday situations in real life. During my most recent viewing, I took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness. The taxi itself boxes Travis in from everyone him, he's enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy. Taxi cabs are yellow, yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic, which gives Travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick. Travis sees New York as a filthy space with evil people. Scorsese makes us feel Travis is driving through Hell, with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab. The first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of Travis' eyes, full of confusion and fear of the unknown. The symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography, as well as creating new inspired camera shots.We are the people, is the slogan of Charles Palantine, it also becomes the tagline of the film. We are the people unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness. It impacts us all, even if the wave hits some of us harder than others. The last shot of Travis looking back into the rear-view mirror tells us that Travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring Betsy now that she desires him, but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface.

Karin hates her cold husband and what she does to keep him away from her is one of the most shocking scenes in the history of film.We're not told what childhood trauma, what tissue of lies of which Karin speaks that has driven these women to lack compassion or empathy; we know only that Maria was her mother's favorite.

There is a homoerotic undertone to Karin's relationship with Maria, which Karin seems to both want and reject.The cinematography in Cries & Whispers in glorious, from the vivid red that is used to punctuate scenes, to the women's surrounds.

It tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they head to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.The novel was a controversial one when it first appeared, largely because of the author's left-wing political opinions, which are clearly reflected in the text. It was perhaps an unusual choice for a movie to come out of Hollywood, an institution which was far less liberal in the thirties and forties than it is today, especially as it was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by John Ford, both generally regarded as conservatives, or at least as far more conservative than Steinbeck. Zanuck did, however, have a reputation for occasionally making films with a social message- Gentleman's Agreement is another such- and the film does tone down the left-wing emphasis somewhat, removing Steinbeck's editorialising passages in which he comments directly on social conditions, and providing a happier, more optimistic ending. Nevertheless, there is still something socialist about the film, especially in the scenes set in the Government-run camp which imply that it is Big Government, not Big Business, which offers more hope to the little man. Ford and Zanuck might not have been pleased to learn that their film was twice used by America's enemies to make anti-American propaganda. During the war Dr Goebbels used extracts from it, passing them off as genuine newsreels purporting to show that America under Roosevelt was a backward, poverty-stricken land. In 1948 it had a brief release in the Soviet Union, but was hastily withdrawn when the authorities realised that Russian audiences were drawing the wrong conclusions from it, namely that in America even the poorest people could afford a car, something which in the USSR was a privilege reserved for high-ranking Party officials. Apart from drawing attention to social conditions during the Depression era, Steinbeck's book had two main themes, the relationship of man to the land and the importance of the family unit. The first of these is largely omitted from the film; it has been pointed out that, although the Joads are agricultural workers by trade, we never see them engaged in any agricultural work. The importance of the family, however, is something stressed in the film. The scenes in which the Joads' son Noah and their son-in-law Connie walk out on the family unit, while not omitted, are very much played down. The main characters in the film are Tom, the family's eldest son, and its matriarch, Ma Joad. Both can be seen as symbolic of the American people and their struggle against hardship, although the ways in which they react to their plight are rather different. When we first see Tom he is a rather wild and angry young man, just released from prison after serving four years for killing a man in a brawl. In the course of the family's journey he learns to channel his anger and resentment into a quest for social justice and becomes a committed socialist, but ironically is forced to go on the run after killing another man while trying to protect a friend. While Tom reacts with socialism, his indomitable old mother reacts with a defiant stoicism and determination not to be beaten. To her are given the last words in the film-We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, cos we're the people.Jane Darwell, at 61, was probably rather older than the character imagined by Steinbeck. (The Joads' youngest children are still of primary school age). She gives, nevertheless, a compelling performance as the tough, determined Ma, one which won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Henry Fonda as Tom is equally good, but he lost out on Best Actor to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.Darwell's was one of two Academy Awards won by the film, the other going to Ford as Best Director. Ford's victory was controversial as he beat Alfred Hitchcock, whose Rebecca had taken the overall Best Picture award. Whatever the merits of that particular decision, however, The Grapes of Wrath is a fine film, and Ford's direction is one of the things that make it so. He was always a director with an eye for a striking image, something much in evidence here. His stark black-and- white photography is well suited to the film's social realism and unsparing look at the darker side of the American dream. Authors have not always been happy with film adaptations of their work, but apparently Steinbeck was delighted with this one, even though it is not always faithful to his storyline.

Briefly, however, it deals with the theft of a litter of Dalmatian puppies by a woman named Cruella De Vil (an obvious pun on cruel devil) who wants to turn them into fur coats. The human authorities are baffled, so it falls to the kidnapped puppies' parents, Pongo and Perdita, to track them down and rescue them- along with a lot more Dalmatian puppies acquired by Cruella for the same nefarious purpose. The film is rather different in look from a lot of earlier Disney cartoons, which were characterised by bright, even garish, colours. Here, by contrast, the colour scheme is surprisingly restrained for a film aimed at children. Much of the action takes place either at night or in the depths of a snowy English winter, and the palette reflects this. Black and white are much in evidence (as one might expect in a film about black-and-white dogs), and the other predominant colours are blues, greys and purples. Unusually for a Disney cartoon, the action takes place in a modern-day Britain, and this restrained look may also reflect American ideas of the British as a nation of quiet, restrained, phlegmatic people, qualities exemplified by the human protagonists, Roger and Anita Radcliffe. (In Smith's novel their surname was Dearly, and Roger was an economist or financier by profession, not a musician as he is here). Actually, these qualities are also exemplified by the animal protagonists as well; Pongo and Perdita are essentially Roger and Anita transmuted into canine form, and the various animals they meet in the course of their adventures generally represent recognisable British types, such as The Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog with a distinctly military bearing. (His friends, or should I say subordinates, are a horse named Captain and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs). One person, however, who is neither quiet nor restrained is the villainess Cruella de Vil. She is perhaps Disney's most memorable villain, a monstrously hyperactive woman with an obsession with fur; she is always seen wearing a fur coat. (In the novel her husband was a furrier, but he does not appear in the film). Her main distinguishing feature is her hair, half-black and half-white. The subsidiary villains are the comically incompetent Badun brothers, Jasper and Horace, whom she employs to steal the puppies.This was one of my favourite films as a child. I was a great animal- lover and generally found that Disney cartoons involving animals, like this one and The Jungle Book, were a lot funnier and less sentimental than all those boring girly fairy-tales like Snow White and The Sleeping Beauty. I also liked the fact that the action took place not in some fantastic never-never land but in the real England in which I was growing up. My one complaint was that the music (in comparison with something like The Jungle Book) was a bit forgettable; even though Roger is a songwriter there are only three songs. I recently saw it again for the first time in many years, and I can say that the animals- especially the spotty dogs themselves- are just as endearing, and their adventures just as amusing- as they were in my childhood. Some goofs. Although the Disney organisation seem to have gone to some lengths to make the film as British as possible, one or two errors have crept in. British television programmes were not directly sponsored in the early sixties. A creek in British English means a saltwater inlet, not a freshwater stream. The Suffolk landscape is not as hilly as it is depicted here. I will, however, let them off over that girder bridge- they are not common in Britain, but not completely unknown. I will also let them off over the name Perdita- strictly speaking, Latin grammar demands that it be stressed on the first syllable, but the actual pronunciation in Britain tends to vary.

Briefly, however, it deals with the theft of a litter of Dalmatian puppies by a woman named Cruella De Vil (an obvious pun on cruel devil) who wants to turn them into fur coats. The human authorities are baffled, so it falls to the kidnapped puppies' parents, Pongo and Perdita, to track them down and rescue them- along with a lot more Dalmatian puppies acquired by Cruella for the same nefarious purpose. The film is rather different in look from a lot of earlier Disney cartoons, which were characterised by bright, even garish, colours. Here, by contrast, the colour scheme is surprisingly restrained for a film aimed at children. Much of the action takes place either at night or in the depths of a snowy English winter, and the palette reflects this. Black and white are much in evidence (as one might expect in a film about black-and-white dogs), and the other predominant colours are blues, greys and purples. Unusually for a Disney cartoon, the action takes place in a modern-day Britain, and this restrained look may also reflect American ideas of the British as a nation of quiet, restrained, phlegmatic people, qualities exemplified by the human protagonists, Roger and Anita Radcliffe. (In Smith's novel their surname was Dearly, and Roger was an economist or financier by profession, not a musician as he is here). Actually, these qualities are also exemplified by the animal protagonists as well; Pongo and Perdita are essentially Roger and Anita transmuted into canine form, and the various animals they meet in the course of their adventures generally represent recognisable British types, such as The Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog with a distinctly military bearing. (His friends, or should I say subordinates, are a horse named Captain and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs). One person, however, who is neither quiet nor restrained is the villainess Cruella de Vil. She is perhaps Disney's most memorable villain, a monstrously hyperactive woman with an obsession with fur; she is always seen wearing a fur coat. (In the novel her husband was a furrier, but he does not appear in the film). Her main distinguishing feature is her hair, half-black and half-white. The subsidiary villains are the comically incompetent Badun brothers, Jasper and Horace, whom she employs to steal the puppies.This was one of my favourite films as a child.

His character design of Elves, Dwarfs, Wizards, Orcs, and Demons revolutionized the fantasy genre. Because of him, Elves are no longer small, have pointy ears, are green, and always play pranks. Instead, now they are tall, mysterious, and are looked up to for wisdom and guidance. Everything made post- LOTR has been influenced by J.R.R Tolkien. It shows even now, with The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim (often compared with The Lord of The Rings), Skyrims' character designs are similar, because it was influenced by J.R.R Tolkien's characters, and his re-design of fantasy. Although the books that the movies are based on sends this message, the art direction and special effects in the movie give an amazing visual representation of the complete fantasy over-haul in LOTR. With the Elves, in the forest when we first see them in their lands, there is a fog in the forest, and the Elves are walking gracefully, and they are emitting light. The special effects in this scene set a mood of the scene and make the elves look elegant, reserved, and mystical. The special effects are amazing, not only in this scene, but during most of the movies. During the entire trilogy, the Eye of Sauron is the antagonist, and an evil that is just effects. The special effects in all of the Mount Doom scenes, whenever there is one, looks dark, sharp, fiery, and down-right evil. The CGI and special effects in these scenes are very well done in the LOTR, because they are main villain of the trilogy. Saurons' eye is all special effects, and is very good at setting the evil mood of the movie, from when we first see him, to when he is destroyed, the mood is that of darkness, corrupted power, and being scared but brave.But of coarse, all the special effects in the world couldn't make these movies what they are today without the amazing directing. The film crew, producers, and directors who made this movie used camera angles, pans, zoom, and framing throughout the movies to set mood as well. Hero shots, landscape pans, and visual tricks were all in the movie to create certain visual representations in scenes. Visual tricks to show height differences in characters, landscape pans to show the long journey ahead, and hero shots to show the viewers the protagonists we have come to know and love. The camera work, the character design, and the special effects, make this movie a perfect example of a well-crafted film. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 December 2013","score":"","review":" J.R.R.

Now, after several months of pondering, I think The Lion King is at an even tie with another Disney wonder, Mary Poppins. Based upon the series of books by P.L. Travers, Mary Poppins is a film we should be very grateful to have. It took Uncle Walt 20 years to obtain the rights to Ms. Travers' fantastic tale and the bold Australian born author was very strict on what could be included in the 1964 classic. While Travers would ultimately hate the flick with all it's Sherman Brothers songs and animated sequences, Mary Poppins would still be a critically acclaimed flick in the public eye and after all these years, it's still one of the greatest fantasy films of the last couple decades. I love it so much, if it was in an edible form, I would gobble it up faster than you could say Bob's your uncle. Julie Andrews embodies Mary Poppins, similar to how Sigourney Weaver embodies Ellen Ripley or Carrie Fisher embodies Princess Leia. She's not as strict and hardcore as she was in Travers' original stories, but she is still stern and at times, very intimidating and bold. I sometimes think that Travers slightly based Mary Poppins off of herself, for she is not only no nonsense and outspoken, but demanding and truthful when she has to be. And Andrews also makes Poppins sympathetic and understanding at times, giving off that heartwarming smile that is debated to be the character's trademark. Looks like Mary Poppins went to the Oswald Cobblepot School of Umbrella Wielding, for Mary Poppins without an umbrella is like Indiana Jones without his whip. Dick Van Dyke is a clumsy, fun loving Bert. I am aware that some are not fond of his Cockney accent, but I think it's over the topness makes his character stand out. He's a jack of all traits, going from a one man jamboree to a sidewalk drawer to a chimney sweep to a kite salesman, and you can just tell that each job he takes part in, he enjoys doing what he does. He's also one of the most high energy characters I've ever seen on film, on par with Ray Bolger's Scarecrow or Charlie Chaplin. Every time Bert's on screen, you are guaranteed to get something off the wall, catchy and blood pumping. All the other characters are great as well. Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are innocent, yet optimistic as Jane and Michael Banks and the cook and the maid are great comic relief. David Tomlinson's Mr. Banks goes from a shrewd workaholic to a giddy, laughable goofball who realizes that we all grow up, but we can be children at heart. Even the Bride of Frankenstein, Elsa Lanchester makes an appearance as the children's first nanny, Katie Nana. The Sherman Brothers songs are fantastic. From Chim Chim Cheree to Spoonful of Sugar to Jolly Holiday' to Feed The Birds to Let's Go Fly A Kite, the songs of this movie will be imprisoned in your memory banks for the rest of time. And I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Feed the Birds turned my eyes into waterfalls every time I listened to it. It was said to be Walt Disney's favorite song, and I can see why. What else can I talk about? Well, the animated sequences are wondrous and very Disney like and the Step in Time sequence you'll never want to end, but why talk about it when you could turn this review off and see the film for yourself. It will delight you, thrill you and even move you. Either way, it's one of Disney's marvelous triumphs. It's simply scrumptious. One of my all time favorites, most definitely.
