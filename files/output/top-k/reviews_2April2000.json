It's a story about courage, strength, love. Not only because of the strong sexuality and violence, but also because of its serious thematics and the way it treats these subjects, Boys Don't Cry is the strongest film of '99.The story, which has been shocking many people, is about a girl named Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) who dresses like and considers herself a boy, and changes her name for Brandon Teena. After some trouble in his town, Brandon meets a group of people and go with them to Falls City, in Nebraska. There his life will change even more, specially after he meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny), a girl who is tired of her life. Many things will happen, and I'm not able to tell this here, even this being a true story.What is special in this film is that we forget that it is based on real life. And this is because of the amazing performance by Hilary Swank. I was quite unsure if she deserved to win the Oscar, because she was competing with Annette Bening and Julianne Moore! But she won, and now I can understand why. The film has many qualities, but it wouldn't have been so good without Hilary. It is one of the best female performances of the '90s. But Chloe Sevigny shouldn't be forgotten. She is worth of as much recognition as Ms. Swank, in a very difficult role too.With a great film editing and a very well written screenplay, Boys Don't Cry is a must-see. However, it is not for everyone. Some scenes can shock many people, and people who are not mature enough shouldn't see it.When the film ends, we get back to reality and realize that it was all true. It's so sad, unfair and absurd how things like that happen because of a dirty feeling. It gives a great discussion about how truly unfair and ugly inside some people are.

This story is about victims; the three main characters are victims even before the tragedy occurs.  Joe tragically lost his boat, the life of a friend, and much of his hope in life in an accident so long ago.  Donna seems to be victimized by men, even more than she lets on.  She seemed to be hurt by someone a long time ago, and keeps looking for men that will satisfy her in a way she's unsure will ever happen.  Noelle seems to be outcasted, and feels abandoned.  She has become somewhat of a narcissist, assuming the physical pain will relieve the pain she feels inside.  She seems to also have a poor self image and, like many teenage girls, forces herself to pay way too much attention to the commercial and material world.  All three characters were wrongly harmed, as they're all good people, yet they're lives have been stunted and destroyed.  There are many scenes in the movie that are so moving and so painful and so cathartic, they would make the movie great by themselves.  And we feel so bad that they are where they are in life.And we hope, we really do, that when Joe and Donna meet and speak to each other, that they will fall in love and cure what ails them.  This is what the story is about.  It is about how victims can come together and rid they're terrible losses.Yet Sayles might or might not have a different story to tell from this point on.  Without giving away too much, he seems to always be looking at everything from two opposite angles.  Look at, for instance, the completely pessimistic daughter and the overtly optimism her mother preaches. The daughter is always looking at everything in the past as being better than what could possibly happen in the future.  When the mother leaves the boyfriend, her daughter gets angry, saying the man wasn't that bad.  She doesn't really hate her mother; she just gets angry that the existance that she just was coming to terms with seems to keep being destroyed.  Perhaps she only came to terms with the life after she had to leave the situation, so perhaps she could never be happy.  The mother, though, always looks at the future as being someplace good, and that she isn't really a victim; she just hasn't figured out how not to be one yet.  Joe is sort of the middle ground.  He seems to be content wherever he goes; sometimes he hopes to the future, while other times he doesn't mind being just where he is.  Sometimes, being an optimist is good, as with the relationship with Donna.  Sometimes, his optimism creates a tragic happening; such as his hope of sailing and becoming a fisherman again.I do not think the strengths of this movie are that it keeps you guessing every turn of the way.  Instead, it answers the question Is the glass half empty or half full? in a new way.  The answer is every bit of cryptic as the question, and how the movie ends even depends on what type of person the viewer is.  Is he or she(the viewer) more like the daughter or the mother?  Or maybe the viewer will be more like Joe and try to make logical sense out of the mess.  If Joe were asked the glass question, he'd probably answer If the glass was empty and was only poured half full with water, then it's half full.  If, however, it was completely full and someone drank half, it's half empty.  He is more of the logical person, always seeing both sides, and wondering if it's in the best decision to be pessimistic or optimistic.  Each type of person(the pessimistic, the optimistic, and the logical) will end up watching a completely different movie, and also goes through life with a different point of view.  Sayles is trying to point this out.  One of my favorite lines in the movie, and one of the best lines that points this out, is said by Donna, who says If you think bad things are going to happen, they will.  The optimist will respond, Well, yeah.  The pessimist will say It will because it's going to happen anyway.  The logical will say What an absurd thing to say!  The movie somehow allowed me to think all three things at once right after she said this line.Perhaps Sayles isn't answering the half full half empty question, yet asking it, in a more subtle, artistic way.  The viewer will answer without even thinking about it.  My biggest compliment I could pay to this film is there is not one person that allows himself to watch the film that won't be affected by it, even if they think they hate it.  If there is one director whose goal in mind is more to affect the person watching it than he cares about how someone will review the movie, it's Sayles.  If Sayles wanted to end the movie in a more traditional and cinematic way, it would have been considered more of a Fargo type masterpiece.  Yet, he decided to sacrifice this in order to let the viewer think, which is what he feels is important.  Limbo is one of the most subtly thoughtful and moving movies I've ever seen, and what's spectacular about it is that Sayles doesn't even want the viewer to realize the movie was the reason he reaffirmed or changed himself and his views on the world.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"2 April 2000","score":"","review":"  There are some funny moments in this film and uniformly good acting and direction.  What's missing?  Well, a plausible story to begin with.Record store proprietor John Cusack's live-in girlfriend moves out, triggering a personal journey of discovery in which he tries to find out why he hasn't wound up with any of the significant loves of his life.  He revisits as many old girlfriends as he can and talks about it, mostly to the audience in monologues fired like a machine gun directly at the camera.But here's the rub.  Cusack plays a whinny, needy, totally dependent loser. At one point he says to the camera You're probably wondering how a guy like me gets all these girls.We are, and the answer is, he wouldn't.  Most intelligent, self confident and attractive women wouldn't have given him the time of day.  But this movie follows the current trend of playing to me generation fantasies, and one of the most popular is to take loser guys and show them getting somebody like Catherine Zeta Jones into bed. The truth is, it's rich, powerful, successful guys like Michael Douglas who get Catherine Zeta Jones into bed. Guys who work in record stores get to help these girls sort through the resale bins, but it stops there.Cusack's store and staff are colorful, filled with generation X types who have an encyclopedic known of record trivia, but probably couldn't have located Kosovo on a map if their lives had depended upon it. (I always knew ending the draft was a mistake.)The whole movie, as a matter of fact, is an ode to a generation that bases the measure of a person's intelligence on how well they can formulate top five lists.  Cusack's character admits he has been a professional appreciater all his life. He himself can find nothing more creative to do than refine the art of making compilation tapes.Cusack is a good actor, but he's becoming the sort of poster boy for the slacker generation.

This film drags out on the screen and slowly rots away before our eyes.  Oh the humanity!  The most disturbing part of this film is the people who made it.  These are honorable people.  They did The Accused for crisake'!  We expected more from you Mr. Kaplan.  You too Claire, was Jodie watching? Did she put you up to this?  Well, did she?  Why Ms. Danes?  Why?  Why? Why?  I sat in shocked horror at this and asked myself over and over again if it were really happening.  Did they spend money on this?  How much?  What could have been done with this money?  What other films were not made so we could have this...this waste of time, no not even that, this waste of time lite. As I sat outside the women's correctional facility in Bangkok, in March of this year, I was still asking why.  Why was I such a nut?  Why would any halfway rational person obtain a passport...go to Thailand....wait outside the prison walls to visit a stranger based on a film they did not think was worth 100 minutes of there time?  Oh God why?  If you have read this far you already know the plot.  You already know this film is rated PG-13.  Now there is a spoiler...PG-13 for a prison movie.  This must be a pretty tame prison.  It is.  It is the only prison in the world that, among other things, has a taxi service.  That's right, our heroine gets fed up and stomps her little feet were getting out of here she squeals to Darlene, Darlene is doing sand sculpture by the way.  She is into arts and crafts as well.  Thank God for arts and crafts in Thai prisons, who would have thought?  Yes, she walks up to a strange female guard I want to talk to the guard who left the gate open No problem.  Now one might think that after leaving the gate open once before, the guards might remember to lock it this time, it is a prison after all.  But no, after a $100.00 bribe (smuggled in a bra...A push up bra) the obliging guard leaves the gate open, I need to go to the bathroom Whines Darlene, off they go.  But alas there brilliant plan goes awry somehow.  It was such a good plan too.  Just tippy toe out the front door in orange prison jammies with no money or passports, get into the waiting car, as I said they provide taxis in this prison, then go to...oh I don't know, somewhere where no one will notice two barefoot American girls in Orange Prison outfits trying to leave an Asian country. One might have thought about some of the obstacles that might have gotten in there way...like say THE OCEAN!!!!! now there is a little problem, that pesky ocean.  Never mind that, they are caught, slapped in the face (the beasts) and made to sit in the corner and think about what they had done. That's right folks, attempted escape in Thailand gets ya a time out.  Oh the horror!  This still does not explain why I found it necessary to visit the prison there.  You really should go.  We all should.  Every one on this page, damn it!  Were going.  Anyway, about the film.  Yawn.  Who cares? Surely not the writers or the director or the stars or anyone remotely connected with this wheezer.  This film could have been good.  If it was supposed to be about two girls (the working title) then it should have been about two girls.  Not about building a fake Bangkok in Manila, or a soundtrack or disposable characters who wonder in and out of this film as though they were lost.  If they wanted to do a silly movie with pretty cinematography for Claire Danes to stand in front of, why bother with a prison at all?

I was foolish enough to believe that the man who wrote the screen play was honest about the inspiration for this film.  15 girls like Claire and Kate all doing life in Thailand.

Well, probably the most shocking thing in the movie nowadays is Toni Basil as a lithe prostitute, baring her breasts. The one-hit wonder (but what a hit) with &#147;Mickey&#148; in 1981, seeing her exposed derriere means when she innocently dresses up as a cheerleader I can never look at her in quite the same way again.Then there&#146;s Jack Nicholson, making an impact as a drunken lawyer with a stereotyped southern twang. Paid less than the union rate at just $2000, five years after this film was made he was earning a million dollars a movie, and the year after that his first Oscar. While only having a brief role, Nicholson acts as a perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda&#146;s characters. And what of Fonda and Hopper themselves? Well, the much-vaunted feud still continues, it seems. After famous spats during filming (one alleged incident involved Fonda threatening to defend himself against any attack by Hopper by hitting him in the face with a motorcycle chain &#150; &#147;you&#146;ll find that&#146;s a motherf****r&#148; he reportedly said), the two have still not made up. A recent 30th Anniversary Convention saw them on stage together for the first time, where Hopper accepted an apology because &#147;it&#146;s kudos to accept&#148;, though stated that he normally wouldn&#146;t talk to someone who had described him as a &#147;f*****g Nazi&#148;.Of course, the real plaudits go to this film for being produced on less than $400,000 and grossing more than $50 million. Effectively, it opened the gates to a slew of youth cinema and, so the cliché goes, changed the face of movies forever. This is something that cannot be taken away from Easy Rider. But taken on it&#146;s own terms &#150; that is, it being a single movie &#150; is it actually any good? Well, performances and direction cannot be faulted. But ultimately the film is a meandering one, covering the story of two bikers travelling to Mardi Gras in New Orleans to a backdrop of mundane country and western music. A song that has as a chorus &#147;don&#146;t Bogart that joint, my friend &#150; pass it over to me&#148; is the &#147;highlight&#148; in a stirring banality of incidentals, only punctuated by thankful bursts of Steppenwolf and Hendrix. In fact, the whole pace of the picture is laborious, reflecting its drug-laden theme. In terms of incident, nothing much happens until an hour and ten minutes into the movie, and then again only towards the admittedly stunning conclusion. What I can&#146;t really comprehend is the critical lauding of the movie&#146;s content, with some excitingly blathering about the &#147;blistering attacks on American conservatism&#148;. To be honest, apart from one or two small references, there really isn&#146;t any political thread to this picture. Slight references to statues of God do not religious symbolism make, yet there are countless websites thrown up in awe of this dialogue-light exploitation picture. It&#146;s nice enough to look at, and while you can respect its art, in a modern context it&#146;s pretty hard to take it all so seriously. Maybe I&#146;m just too young to really dig it, man. 7\/10.

Well, probably the most shocking thing in the movie nowadays is Toni Basil as a lithe prostitute, baring her breasts. The one-hit wonder (but what a hit) with &#147;Mickey&#148; in 1981, seeing her exposed derriere means when she innocently dresses up as a cheerleader I can never look at her in quite the same way again.Then there&#146;s Jack Nicholson, making an impact as a drunken lawyer with a stereotyped southern twang. Paid less than the union rate at just $2000, five years after this film was made he was earning a million dollars a movie, and the year after that his first Oscar. While only having a brief role, Nicholson acts as a perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda&#146;s characters. And what of Fonda and Hopper themselves? Well, the much-vaunted feud still continues, it seems. After famous spats during filming (one alleged incident involved Fonda threatening to defend himself against any attack by Hopper by hitting him in the face with a motorcycle chain &#150; &#147;you&#146;ll find that&#146;s a motherf****r&#148; he reportedly said), the two have still not made up.

Cusack plays a record store owner who spends the whole movie whining about his failed love life.  For the first 40 minutes of it, I hung in there, waiting for our main character to show SOME character.  After that, I begin to look at my watch.The problem with High Fidelity, is that our main character is too much of jerk to like.  He is totally selfish and immature for his age and his habits are a complete afront to women.  I was okay with that, at first. But a shallow main character can't carry a picture all the way through without showing SOME promise along the way. This is supposed to be OUR guy. We are supposed to be rooting for him the whole way through. But after awhile, I just wished that one of his many ex-girlfriends would have shot him in the head and put us all out of our misery.  John Cusack's character has no perspective or enough depth to carry a movie. John, GET A REAL PROBLEM.I was insulted, because Cusack was potraying someone my age and it just makes our generation look useless.  Cusack finally does get his act together at the VERY END of the movie. Not soon enough. And I never really believed he was a lover of music.  He didn't have the passion for it the way his employees at the record store did. They were believable.  Cusack could have been a shoe salesman for all we know. He says a few snappy lines about music trivia and owns a lot of vinyl, but he just doesn't fit the part.  He would have been more believable if he cut his hair, put on a suit and played a RECORD LABEL EXECUTIVE.THANK GOD for his co-stars.

Actually, as high school fare goes, this is pretty wholesome.  Of the three major teen staples, there is very little in the way of sex and drugs, but plenty of rock and roll.  The story revolves around a girl and boy who are next door neighbors.  Though they have known each other their whole lives, they travel in very different circles at school.  She is very &#147;in&#148;, popular and active.  He is very &#147;out&#148;, rebellious and counterculture.  When each of them gets rejected by their love interests, they form an unlikely alliance to make the rejecters jealous.  They pretend they are now dating, to the amazement of all their friends.  But be careful what you wish for, because you might get it.  Surprising to no-one in the audience, they actually fall for one another.  This complicates matters when the scam works and their respective love interests re-ignite and take up hot pursuit.  Not the most original story line, but it sets up some funny skits especially with the characters&#146; attempts to adapt to the formerly rejected culture of the other.  The writing has some good lines and the romance between Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) and Chase (Adrian Grenier) works well.  These two have good chemistry and seem to genuinely like each other.The ending is upbeat, and overall this is a feel good movie.  The acting, as is always the case in these movies, was not so much acting as teens portraying themselves.  Melissa Joan Hart has been playing a teenager since 1992, and at 24 it is probably time to move on.  As probably the most experienced actor in the film, she played the part very well and was one of the few players who actually had to do some acting outside the stereotype.  Adrian Grenier, (also 24), held down the male lead well, although he was much more convincing once he was &#147;in&#148; than as a rebellious outsider.All in all, it was a sprightly and entertaining entry into a crowded genre.  I gave it a 7\/10.  Worth a rental if you are in the mood for something light.

Adrian Grenier, (also 24), held down the male lead well, although he was much more convincing once he was &#147;in&#148; than as a rebellious outsider.All in all, it was a sprightly and entertaining entry into a crowded genre.  I gave it a 7\/10.  Worth a rental if you are in the mood for something light.

Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer.

My impression remains largely unchanged after all this time--it is an excellent film, superbly acted, especially by Brando and Clift. Even Dino comes alive toward the end, but he is severely outclassed by his two counterparts.Having said this, I must add that one way in which my opinion has changed is in my impression of the Brando character, German officer Christian Diestl. I now find the Diestl we see in the film not quite believable. In the Irwin Shaw novel, Diestl was a more typical fictional German, i.e., was an avid Nazi, loved Hitler, etc. In the film the character is changed so that he is much more of a good guy. This change is largely attributed to Brando, who so forcefully advocated for the change that he overwhelmed the screenwriter and director into making them. Not surprisingly, this infuriated Shaw. The change was considered daring, and a positive one, at the time. In other words, there had been so many evil movie Nazis, it was a refreshing change to see one who was a decent man and who questioned what his country was doing.The problem is, it doesn't work. Brando's Diestl now just comes across as dimwitted, and his disillusionment with what the Germans did during the war now comes across as completely implausible.

The captain of the ship is the nasty Captain Cortez, and when he finds them he orders them to be flogged and then kept prisoner to be sold as indentured servants when they arrive in Cuba.  Our two grifters, Miguel and Tulio, escape with the Captains prized horse in tow, and end up one step ahead of their captor, on the island with the fabled City of Gold.  They search out the city, find it, and then try to swindle the villagers who see the pair as gods.  I honestly believe that this film should be judged on two levels.  We should be looking at the animation, which is incredible, however, we should also be looking at the story, which, I hate to say, has a profound effect on how I feel about the movie as a whole.  Dreamworks produced this picture, and there is no doubt that they have managed to achieve the level of animation that Disney, the kingpin of all cartoon factories, has made famous, but they still have several lessons to learn.  The story is not only banal, it is slow moving and anti-climactic, the good versus evil thing seems to fizzle out.  Our heroes are almost as bankrupt morally, as our villains, and they never quite learn their lesson in the end.  The Road to El Dorado has a couple of cuddly critters, yet neither manage to tug at my heart strings.  The horse, who was crusty when owned by the ruthless captain, becomes a loyal, if not temperamental ally.  And then there is this possum who somehow decides to go along for the ride.

I particularly enjoyed the scene when Gabriel and Mark try to realise Gabriel's fantasy of being gone down on while he is playing the piano (I can't think of what to play). There's also a wonderful encounter with Ms Coco Peru, a drag queen (and former lover of Mark's), in the gay disco lavatory and some good one liners. As Mark leaves the disco after Gabriel he is distracted by another bare-chested hunk admiring his physique. A pick-up? No, he just wants to know where Mark works out.

Therefore, I decided not to go see it, but wait until video. Finally, I read the reviews of the movie in the paper. The Sixth Sense recieved an average of 4 stars out of 4 stars. In the paper, it stated the #1 Thriller of All Time. When I saw this, I decided to go see the movie. Good choice. Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcom Crowe, and doctor in child psychology. He recently won an award from the mayor of Phildelphia, stating his excellence in the field of child psychology. After losing his former patient to suicide, he decides to help a little boy named Cole Sear, noticing that both his former patient, and little Cole Sear are very similar. There's only one catch, Cole's problem is that he sees dead people, who abuse and torture him. When I stepped out of the theater after the movie was, done, I was amazed. The final ending was pulled off very cleverly. The clues were given to you throughout the whole movie, it's just that you wouldn't have thought they were clues. The acting was magnificent. Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job as Cole(Well deserved Oscar nomination). Bruce Willis was awesome as Dr. Crowe(Yet, there was no nomination in sight). Toni Collete was perfect as Cole's mother(Oscar nominated). All of the actors were great! Finally, I would like to talk about the Oscars. The Sixth Sense did not win even one Oscar out of it's six nominations. That's sad.It's one of the greatest movies of this decade. I would've at least expected the Best Directed Oscar, I mean, come on the ending was pulled of very cleverly. If you haven't seen this movie, go do it. It's even worth buying!
