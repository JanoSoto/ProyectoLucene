[{"date":"12 October 2013","score":"","review":" My friend commented on how the theme in this movie really appeals to him at this time. There a numerous ideas that come out of this movie, and most importantly, for me to describe it, I will have to give a lot away. As such, I shall warn those who are going to read this, if you don't want your enjoyment of this film ruined, then I suggest you cease reading now.The major theme in this movie is what is reality. As such it follows the themes of movies such as The Truman Show, News From the Good Lord and Dark City, all of which are movies that I love. The difference with The Matrix is that it is much more action orientated. As such it should appeal to those who love post-modern movies and want a lot to think about, and it should appeal to those who love special effects and huge amounts of action.The movie is based around a man named Neo. He is a computer hacker and is being sort out by Morpheus, an unknown person. Morpheus is also being pursued by agents of some organisation that seem to be able to remove peoples' mouths, though to Neo this becomes a dream. When Neo finally finds Morpheus, he learns that everything that he knows is a dream. Reality is in fact far different. Neo is one of billions of people plugged into a huge computer system. He is there because in the early 21st century, humanity lost a war with the machines, and during that war the earth was blocked off from the sun. To get the energy they needed, the machines began to use humans. As such, they created an artificial environment in which humans live, and as they live, the machines live off of the electricity that the human brain produces.Basically the world in which Neo lives is not real - it seems real, but in reality there are things that happen that suspend his disbelief. He asks somebody at the beginning of the movie if he ever feels like he lives in a dream. The reply is of course, all the time but this comes from the mouth of a drug induced person. Once Neo is out of the matrix, he learns that Morpheus considers him to be the reincarnation of a saviour, one who can manipulate the matrix to his will. He also learns that these agents are not humans but security programs created by the machine to stop the free humans from destroying their power. These security programs are incredibly powerful in the matrix, but have no power outside of it. In the matrix that can appear wherever they like, do whatever they like, and take whatever form they like. In fact they will possess other people (or personas - the person's computer image - their real existence is in a tube in the side of a huge machine).There are a number of Christian parallels in this movie (though they are not intentional considering the idea is more Buddhist than Christian). The major one is in regards to the matrix and the reality. The world is like the matrix - it is real but we refuse to look beyond it to the heavenly realms. To us the heavenly realms are a fantasy and the world we live in is solid reality and when it comes to miraculous things then we conveniently look for a way to disprove them and if we can't then we ignore them. The truth is that heaven is very much reality, and this world is only a temporary existence created by God for us to inhabit. Neo takes the form of a Christ figure. He was in the matrix once and began the plan to remove people from the matrix and give them back their freedom just as Christ came to Earth to die for our sins in preparation for judgement day when we face God and explain to him why he should not destroy us. Neo's return parallel's Jesus' return. At first he seems like nothing, but the oracle tells him that he will be the one perhaps in his next life. This prediction comes true as he is killed, but as he has died in the matrix, he comes back to life. The matrix is not reality, and though most people, when killed in the matrix, will die in reality, the most hardy and strong willed of people can survive - Neo is such a person - but when he returns to life it becomes evident that he has gained immense power over the matrix. The final thing that I must raise is the description of Zion - the place where everybody will party once the machine has been defeated. This is a very biblical reference, and I think this is made in the movie as well. Zion is the hill upon which Jerusalem is built, so wherever one reads the word Zion in the bible, one reads Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem does not correspond to the geographical city but it symbolises the place where God will live with his people. The reason that Jerusalem is used in this way is because it was the city where God's temple was built in the time of the Old Testament, and where the temple was, that was where God lived. The reference to Zion in The Matrix is a reference to the fact that when Christ returns, all who trusted in him will be in paradise, all that is rotten and decayed having passed away.

I loved it. Now after a few years I watched it again. It was terrible... but I still loved it!The movie is based on a classic cartoon of the same name. 4 mutated turtles are trained to become ninjas by a giant mutated rat named Splinter. They are the hidden heroes that live in the sewer but come out to fight a local gang called the Foot. The leader of the foot is the main bad guy and his name is Shredder. And the turtles are on a mission to save Splinter as he has been kidnapped by the Foot.The story is actually not that bad. It is quite good. This is a kids film really so there is a mixture of comedy and action all the way through the film. There was also a bit if drama too.Because this film is quite old now, the effects were not computer generated like they would be now. There were 4 guys dressed up in giant rubber costumes. Because of this you have to give them a little credit for the movement they had during the fighting scenes. They were not great. The fighting scenes were generally bad to be honest, but seeing as they were all dressed in those costumes you can forgive that. I also can't really comment on their acting. How can anyone act in a giant rubber suit? The actors in the costumes were David Forman, Michelan Sisti, Leif Tilden & Josh Pais. Other actors in the film were Judith Hoag as April O'Neil and Elias Koteas as Casey Jones. Judith was OK, but there were moments where she really was not good. I thought she was very average. Elias was the best actor in the movie. I liked the character and he did a great job playing him out. The only other famous name was the voice artist of Donatello. Corey Feldman was the famous voice.The drama that I mentioned before was very hard to connect to. It is not easy to feel sorry for a giant rubber costume. So when you see the turtles really sad and upset, I struggled to feel sorry for them.The thing I love most about this film is it has an classic 80's\/90's feel to it. It brought back a lot of memories watching this and even though it was not great, it was a lot of fun. If I had never seen it as a kid, I probably would have thought it was really bad... but due to the memories it made it a great, fun watch.I will give this film 7 out of 10.You're a claustrophobic.You want a fist in the mouth?

Unfortunately, the cop that tries to save Scottie ends up plummeting to his death, and Scottie is unwilling to accept what happened, and suffers from a condition called Vertigo. Scottie retires after these events, but he ends up getting an offer from a good friend named Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to investigate his wife's (Kim Novak) increasingly erratic behavior. Gavin seems to think she is being possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes. Scottie reluctantly agrees to follow Madeline around. He develops an uncontrollable infatuation for Madeline. He saves her from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, and the two have a romance, and fall in love. Madeline's erratic behavior leads to her death at the bell tower of the church, where Scottie is unable to save her, because of his fear of heights. Scottie's devastation doesn't go away, until he meets a woman named Judy Barton, who is an uncanny resemblance to Madeline. Scottie becomes incessant with wanting Judy to dress and look like Madeline, and falls in love all over again. What Scotty doesn't know is he is in a web of deception. It's really hard to fathom how critics lambasted and slandered this film when it was first released. After a thrilling opening, involving a chase on a roof, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie, a true movie lover should notice right away that they are in for something spectacular and special. Not only was it was way ahead of it's time for what it was going for, but Vertigo is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It rivals Psycho & North by Northwest, and Rear Window as Alfred Hitchcock's best film. I really loved Vertigo's dreamlike atmosphere, with all the visuals. Not only is it near flawless with the storytelling, but it is also tremendous visually. It's deliberate (Or as I like to call it, thoughtful) pace, gives us much more time to get to know our lead hero. Scottie (James Stewart) is a flawed hero, one with a huge fear of heights, and a syndrome called Vertigo. He's a regular, everyday human being, and one we can all relate too. Stewart is easily able to elicit sympathy from the viewer, because of the predicament he has gotten himself into. I thought the scenes where Scottie stalks Madeline (Kim Novak) were not only chilling, but thought provoking as well. As the stalking scenes continue to commence, you start to see Scottie's job begin to turn into a precarious obsession. His infatuation veers toward an uncontrollable desire to be with Madeline. It was really engrossing to watch James Stewart's character evolveThe cinematography deserves a lot of praise for still holding up to this day. We get various colors, and many beautiful images throughout the movie. James Stewart is simply a revelation in this movie. Even when he veers towards obsession, you can't help but feel for the guy. I felt James Stewart did a tremendous job with everything. His romance with Kim Novak is deeply felt to the point where I often couldn't keep my eyes off the two. James Stewart is especially phenomenal in the second half as his obsession grows. His depression and obsession with Kim Novak is something that chilled me to the bone. It's one of the greatest, and one of the most tragic romances in the history of movies. The two were almost hypnotizing to watch at times. Kim Novak's beauty is peerless. Her manipulative, yet at the same time, lovable performance as Madeline is unforgettable. Her vulnerability as Madeline was amazing, and so was her sorrowful performance as Judy Barton. She was absolutely magnetic at times, and amazing to watch. It's impossible not to be attracted to her. I'm not sure which pair I loved more, Scottie & Madeline, or Scottie & Judy. Both were amazing in different ways. Barbara Bel Geddes (Midge) is not only likable, but funny as the girl who has a major crush on Scottie. The ending of Vertigo is absolutely heartbreaking in every sense of the word. It felt like everything crumbled down around me, and I was just beside myself in a way. I sat on my bed with a blank expression on my face, and tried to process everything that just happened. It's one of the greatest movies in cinema history. Those that call it overrated, I feel sorry for. I respect people's opinions, but this is the definition of a masterpiece, and I can't praise it enough. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for?

After a thrilling opening, involving a chase on a roof, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie, a true movie lover should notice right away that they are in for something spectacular and special. Not only was it was way ahead of it's time for what it was going for, but Vertigo is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It rivals Psycho & North by Northwest, and Rear Window as Alfred Hitchcock's best film. I really loved Vertigo's dreamlike atmosphere, with all the visuals. Not only is it near flawless with the storytelling, but it is also tremendous visually. It's deliberate (Or as I like to call it, thoughtful) pace, gives us much more time to get to know our lead hero. Scottie (James Stewart) is a flawed hero, one with a huge fear of heights, and a syndrome called Vertigo. He's a regular, everyday human being, and one we can all relate too. Stewart is easily able to elicit sympathy from the viewer, because of the predicament he has gotten himself into. I thought the scenes where Scottie stalks Madeline (Kim Novak) were not only chilling, but thought provoking as well. As the stalking scenes continue to commence, you start to see Scottie's job begin to turn into a precarious obsession. His infatuation veers toward an uncontrollable desire to be with Madeline. It was really engrossing to watch James Stewart's character evolveThe cinematography deserves a lot of praise for still holding up to this day. We get various colors, and many beautiful images throughout the movie. James Stewart is simply a revelation in this movie. Even when he veers towards obsession, you can't help but feel for the guy. I felt James Stewart did a tremendous job with everything. His romance with Kim Novak is deeply felt to the point where I often couldn't keep my eyes off the two. James Stewart is especially phenomenal in the second half as his obsession grows. His depression and obsession with Kim Novak is something that chilled me to the bone. It's one of the greatest, and one of the most tragic romances in the history of movies. The two were almost hypnotizing to watch at times. Kim Novak's beauty is peerless. Her manipulative, yet at the same time, lovable performance as Madeline is unforgettable. Her vulnerability as Madeline was amazing, and so was her sorrowful performance as Judy Barton. She was absolutely magnetic at times, and amazing to watch. It's impossible not to be attracted to her. I'm not sure which pair I loved more, Scottie & Madeline, or Scottie & Judy. Both were amazing in different ways. Barbara Bel Geddes (Midge) is not only likable, but funny as the girl who has a major crush on Scottie. The ending of Vertigo is absolutely heartbreaking in every sense of the word. It felt like everything crumbled down around me, and I was just beside myself in a way. I sat on my bed with a blank expression on my face, and tried to process everything that just happened. It's one of the greatest movies in cinema history. Those that call it overrated, I feel sorry for. I respect people's opinions, but this is the definition of a masterpiece, and I can't praise it enough.

Unfortunately, the cop that tries to save Scottie ends up plummeting to his death, and Scottie is unwilling to accept what happened, and suffers from a condition called Vertigo. Scottie retires after these events, but he ends up getting an offer from a good friend named Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to investigate his wife's (Kim Novak) increasingly erratic behavior. Gavin seems to think she is being possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes. Scottie reluctantly agrees to follow Madeline around. He develops an uncontrollable infatuation for Madeline. He saves her from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, and the two have a romance, and fall in love. Madeline's erratic behavior leads to her death at the bell tower of the church, where Scottie is unable to save her, because of his fear of heights. Scottie's devastation doesn't go away, until he meets a woman named Judy Barton, who is an uncanny resemblance to Madeline.

A combination of Night of the Living Dead, The Omega Man, and Valley Girl makes this quirky film an essential addition to any fan's 1980's genre collection.Everyone is celebrating the return of a comet that hasn't buzzed by the Earth in 65 million years. The last time it swung by, the dinosaurs went extinct. How can it come as a surprise that this time around it incinerates humans and leaves survivors mutated and ravenous for human flesh? Two Los Angeles valley girls (Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney) join forces with a truck driver (Robert Beltran) as they run for their lives from the walking dead and scientists intent on draining their blood in an attempt to find a cure for the zombie outbreak.Night of the Comet perfectly captures the tone of the 1980s in every way. The feeling of paranoia about the world coming to an end is one element. I remember reading about the planets aligning and how this could cause the apocalypse.

Parts of the movie were confusing and didn't really make sense, like what exactly was happening at the end, but it still didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie.Maverick is based on a old TV series of the same name, and actually has the actors from the original staring in it (especially the guy playing Zane Cooper). The movie is based around Brett Maverick (Mel Gibson) who is trying to get $3000 so that he might enter into a poker championship on a riverboat and the adventures that he goes through trying to get there. Maverick goes through so much, that it would take too long to explain all of them, so I will just settle with talking about Maverick's character The reason I like Maverick is because of Maverick's character. He is a gambler, a smoker, and a champion bluffer. He does not survive in the west by his skill at brawling or shooting people, but rather his wits. He uses his ability to bluff to the extreme, and also his skills such as speaking an Indian language, and the money he has in his pocket, to not only survive, but to survive well off. He may not be a good shot, but he is a very fast draw, and he uses his fast draw to intimidate people into thinking that he is a good shot as well, but what he won't do is get into a direct fight, unless he knows that he is going to win.This is a cool little movie, and quite enjoyable from my end of things. As I said, the ending seems to fall apart as it does not have any reason for why the things happened, and just seems to be quite confusing. If they had reworked the ending, then it would have become a much better movie.

So you would think collaborations between the two were a given right? That similar to football where a team would do what they can to get the two best players in the world in Ronaldo and Messi on the very same team and that's what every director would do with America and Frances.

The guy, who also brought us an Academy award winner Rain Man, was the very same guy who was told by a certain aunt that You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough. Boy was she was wrong, but that's a great message for all you kids, people may say you can't do something, but if you believe in yourself, and with hard work you can do anything &#x96; anyway enough of the mum and dad speech, back to the review. Director Mike Nichols's The Graduate tells the tale of Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) and his chaotic whirlwind of life, similarly experienced by most college graduates, where constant pressure about your future, from both interior, parents and the media are perpetually subjecting you too, when all you really want to do is just lay about in your parents pool and do nothing &#x96; one problem, your next door neighbours wife, to answer the quote I started with, yes she is trying to seduce you.

If I sat down and gave you every superlative that came into my mind to describe what I felt whilst watching The Graduate, I would literally run out of words, not only in the English, but quiet possibly every language none to man, even the made up ones. And I say all this, because The Graduate is an absolutely masterful piece of cinema, that give us an interesting insight in middle America and their scandalous life's portrayed through articulate social commentary. And what I also love is the very later ball characters, despite being words apart economically; the film helps you remember we are all connected through love and pain. But the very best aspect of The Graduate is that it is blessed with quick, snappy and witty dialogue, cleverly architected by writers Calder Willingham and Buck Henry, based on a novel by Charles Webb. You just have to refer to the quote above, which I'm pretty sure you would have already heard thousands of time before, but couldn't quiet place it, but lucky for you I have come to rescue, the film is The Graduate.

Rocky it a film that the whole family can enjoy over and over again, well the first Rocky anyway, did I forget to mention that there were 5 sequels that all sucked, to the existent that they became a parody of themselves. But no matter how bad they get &#x96; and they do get bad, they will never distract from the genies and uplifting Rocky, with the killer sound track Gonna Fly Now  (my new ring tone) played over the montage(which inspired me to work out) is probably one of my favorite sequences in film, but wait we can't forget the stair running scene, so iconic it's ridiculous, I would literally swim to America just so I could run up the steps (if I still have the energy left over from the swim) But all in all in my opinion rightly so that Rocky was the winner of Best Picture award.

Ichabod denies this possibility and affirms the murder as a flesh and blood human being.

None of the characters is mere a secondary character, he\/she has an important position in the plot, no matter what. I know it is a kind of horror film thriller, but I recognized a comedy atmosphere from Johnny Deep sometimes. It is interesting and worth to noticed, very clever. At the end of my odyssey, I was stunned. The movie was spectacular. I loved the visual effects. Although, the visual effects crew and photograph director work is incredible, the colours were the diamond of the film. From my point of view, they were used as painters paint their paintings.

And because so many billions can be made producing, transporting and dealing in weed and coke those doing the producing, transporting and dealing manage to get by on as few scruples as possible. Oh, and they aren't at all bothered that a great many innocent people as well a great many of their own kind are murdered in cold blood to keep the industry going. If you want to be really shocked, google the figures of how many lives the drug trade has claimed in, say, the past ten years in Mexico, Colombia and surrounding states. You'll find they are in the the tens if not hundreds of thousands. Given that fact, the jokey tone of the film was to put it mildly utterly inappropriate.That is not, however, the film's worst failing. It's worst failing is that it is dull, dull, dull. Or at least the 35-odd minutes I could be bothered to watch. Quite how Blow gets an average 7.5 rating is beyond me.

But what if you did not see all of the film? What if the film you are reviewing was so damn dull, so damn unengaging that you gave up halfway and went off to find something better to do - the washing up, perhaps, or comb the dog for fleas. Perhaps you were so damn bored by the film that instead you decided to seek out the nearest newly-painted wall and sit before it for several hours to keep an eye on the paint as it dried.I have no idea why Blow was so dull and unengaging, but dull and unengaging it was and I would happily have swapped the 35 minutes or so of it I did watch for some more interesting pastime (learning by heart next week's TV schedule, perhaps). I was drawn to it because Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta, two of my favourite actors, are in it. But even they couldn't save it.Another reviewer here complained that the film was morally suspect in that it didn't condemn drug-taking and, in fact, almost seemed to condone it.

His unforgettable voice and his villainous demeanor just adds to delight in watching his performance. Sure the film starred the legendary Shakespearean actor Sir John Gielgud who is fine but not a true standout. Madeleine Carroll also acts in the film as the leading lady. The movie is based on a novel and is set during World War I about espionage and intrigue. I really didn't find this film as one of my favorites. Peter Lorre was one of the director's favorites. It is clear to see why he was unique in voice and talent. Lorre always stole the spotlight. The film's story isn't so clear to me even until the ending.
