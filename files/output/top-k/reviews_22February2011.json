Personally, I would have to agree... strongly. This movie is phenomenal. Not only is it a solidly great film for its time, it's just a purely good film out of any sort of time context. It's witty, intelligent, charming, funny, and exciting. It's the story of the acting world and the colorful and competitive people who inhabit it. Eve, played by Anne Baxter, is a young girl who has huge aspirations for herself on the stage. Aging stage star Margo Channing takes Eve under her wing, only to discover that Eve is a conniving little girl who tries to steal Margo's job as well as her husband. The film is loaded with laughs, all perpetuated through rapier wit dialouge. The film is an excellent dramady with plenty of style and poise, rich and vibrant, gleaming with life and excitement.The best scripts are those that keep at a consistent cadence that never falters and never loses your interest. All About Eve has one of those scripts. There is a very gracious flow to the dialouge in this film, and it is also at a level of intelligence much greater than the average script. It is loaded with double entendres, parallelism, and witty metaphors. It's the kind of dialouge that works so smoothly and every transition and every exchange between characters is so seamless and perfect. Every scene provides some new element of excellence to the poignant dialouge. Sometimes it's sincere and dramatic, full of sophistication. Other times its very light hearted and airy, bringing about a lot of laughs that come from the heart instead of being just mindless entertainment. Then other times it combines the two. There are those scenes in the film where the characters go on rants and tangents, insulting each others intelligence and social ability, and it is all done so eloquently and is delivered without missing a single beat that you can't help but laugh in esteemed approval of the masterful wordplay unfolding before your eyes and ears.Of course where would a near perfect script be without excellent actors to deliver it? Nowhere. So its a good thing All About Eve has some of the finest actors of the era performing their most sincere and dedicated roles ever. It all starts with Bette Davis as Margo. Her performance is nothing short of stellar. The sharp wit of the dialouge flows so naturally from her mouth its as if she wrote it herself. You believe that she believes every last word she says and at no moment do you believe this woman on the screen is anyone but Margo Channing.The male roles of the film also shine, each in their own unique way. George Sanders plays Addison DeWitt, a prominent figure in the performance world who speaks with a sort of slow, well thought out sophistication to his voice. He adds a lot of the sarcastic wit to the film, but delivers his best effort in one of the most important scenes of the film, and it is astounding. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe play the husbands of Margo and her friend Karen, and their performances are hilarious. They continue to further the profound development of the story and its statement on the acting world.

Personally, I would have to agree... strongly. This movie is phenomenal. Not only is it a solidly great film for its time, it's just a purely good film out of any sort of time context. It's witty, intelligent, charming, funny, and exciting. It's the story of the acting world and the colorful and competitive people who inhabit it. Eve, played by Anne Baxter, is a young girl who has huge aspirations for herself on the stage. Aging stage star Margo Channing takes Eve under her wing, only to discover that Eve is a conniving little girl who tries to steal Margo's job as well as her husband. The film is loaded with laughs, all perpetuated through rapier wit dialouge. The film is an excellent dramady with plenty of style and poise, rich and vibrant, gleaming with life and excitement.The best scripts are those that keep at a consistent cadence that never falters and never loses your interest. All About Eve has one of those scripts. There is a very gracious flow to the dialouge in this film, and it is also at a level of intelligence much greater than the average script. It is loaded with double entendres, parallelism, and witty metaphors. It's the kind of dialouge that works so smoothly and every transition and every exchange between characters is so seamless and perfect. Every scene provides some new element of excellence to the poignant dialouge. Sometimes it's sincere and dramatic, full of sophistication. Other times its very light hearted and airy, bringing about a lot of laughs that come from the heart instead of being just mindless entertainment. Then other times it combines the two. There are those scenes in the film where the characters go on rants and tangents, insulting each others intelligence and social ability, and it is all done so eloquently and is delivered without missing a single beat that you can't help but laugh in esteemed approval of the masterful wordplay unfolding before your eyes and ears.Of course where would a near perfect script be without excellent actors to deliver it? Nowhere. So its a good thing All About Eve has some of the finest actors of the era performing their most sincere and dedicated roles ever. It all starts with Bette Davis as Margo. Her performance is nothing short of stellar. The sharp wit of the dialouge flows so naturally from her mouth its as if she wrote it herself. You believe that she believes every last word she says and at no moment do you believe this woman on the screen is anyone but Margo Channing.The male roles of the film also shine, each in their own unique way. George Sanders plays Addison DeWitt, a prominent figure in the performance world who speaks with a sort of slow, well thought out sophistication to his voice. He adds a lot of the sarcastic wit to the film, but delivers his best effort in one of the most important scenes of the film, and it is astounding. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe play the husbands of Margo and her friend Karen, and their performances are hilarious.

The most striking feature of the movie seems to be the universally apathetic characters. In the opening sequence we learn that Samson, a very large, uncontrollable teenager has killed Jamie, a member of his group of stoner friends from school, and left her naked body by the river's edge.While there are many movies about heartless killers, Samson is fully realized, such as he is, and I was struck by the utter lack of any rime or reason to his actions, any Hollywood touches to humanize him or explain what he did. He killed a girl and really doesn't care. There was no planning, before or after, no moralizing, at most he is amused by it.Samson (also called John because of his last name) tells his friends, who display apathy that might be shocking. The only one who seems to care is Layne (Crispin Glover) who wants to cover it up so his friend doesn't get arrested and executed. But the rest don't really seem too shaken by it, they don't get mad at John, they even justify his actions, and they certainly don't go to the police right away.River's Edge works because there is no clear message. I'm sure many people can find one in it, but it's definitely not a movie that hits you over the head with some moral. It presents some very strangely behaving people, who are often over the top but depicted with just enough realism that you have to take what is going on seriously. The fun in this movie is that you get to float around in this shockingly apathetic teenage wasteland for an hour and a half, and see what you can make of it.The main problem I had with the movie was the direction and soundtrack, which coincide to create awkward transitions and moments where River's Edge feels like a crappy low-budget flick you'd find being mocked on MST3K. None of the dialogue or plot falls into that category, but it's the transitions between scenes, where they often just kind of end unimpressive and cut to the next one.The soundtrack also kept drawing me away from the movie. It includes some edgy metal for 1986, which is perfectly fine for the movie, but it doesn't do much with it, and instead most of the music is an orchestral soundtrack. Parts of it are very atmospheric and perfect for the movie's feel, but at other times it is hitting cliché film score notes during tense scenes and really seeming quite cheesy. I contrasted this movie with Picnic at Hanging Rock, a spiritual cousin of River's Edge I would say, where the score was so utterly perfect at always building the mood, and really think River's Edge could have been an incredible movie with a score that consistent.River's Edge isn't perfect. I had honestly never even heard of it until I saw it mentioned as a superior film with the same basic themes as Bully by Larry Clark. I am very glad I rented it, and am a bit surprised I'd never heard of it. It deserves to be better known. It has some flaws and not everyone will like it, but there is a lot of depth here, and of course its cast includes several famous people in early or debut roles.

He is hired by an old acquaintance, Gavin Elster, to follow Elster's wife Madeleine, who seems to be losing her mind, as if she is possessed by some other spirit. As he becomes more involved in her plight, Scottie finds himself falling in love with this strange woman, who may not be all she seems ...Vertigo is a masterpiece; one of Hitchcock's most stylish, daring, inventive and intriguing pictures. Technically, it is just dazzling, filled with astonishing moments, extraordinarily evocative locations, and masterful audience manipulation. But I think it's thematically where it really scores - it's one of those movies you can talk about for hours afterwards, interpret a dozen different ways, and has almost too many fascinating ideas going on. It also breaks so many rules it's hard to believe it's a mainstream Hollywood studio picture - the leading lady doesn't speak for forty-five minutes, the leading man is obsessed with her almost to the point of necrophilia, the clever trick-ending is given away half-an-hour before it finishes, and it concludes with perhaps the most horribly abrupt tragedy in the history of cinema. It's also a film which demands repeat viewings from the true movie-hound, not least of all to try to decipher what it means - all those shots of Novak reflected in mirrors, the moment in the woods where she seems to just disappear, her absence from the guest house when we've seen her at the window, the scene at Pebble Beach where she pleads, I'm not mad(eleine), the terrifying dream sequence where Carlotta seems to be haunting Scottie. Also, what is Jimmy Stewart, the all-American good guy, doing here ? Scottie is a washed-up coward, he covets other people's wives, he's self-obsessed, he ignores the one person who really loves him (Midge) - he really is a sicko and yet he's the hero !? I like to compare him (and the movie) to Norman Bates in Psycho, who of course is a monster, but is also kind of sweet, bashful, well-intentioned and humble, all qualities completely lacking in Scottie. This is not to say Stewart is bad casting - on the contrary, it's brilliant, and he's terrific in the part as he gradually descends into complete madness. Novak is equally stunning, easily the most enigmatic of Hitchcock's Blonde M's, giving a riveting performance of someone giving a riveting performance, constantly teasing us with little cracks in the facade of a woman we don't really understand. Hitchcock and his frequent collaborator, cameraman Robert Burks, photograph the actors with extraordinary intensity, but also use the glamorous San Francisco locations to enormous atmospheric effect; the quiet moments at the California Palace Of The Legion Of Honor, the crucial moment at the Presidio when Novak falls into the bay, the eerie possession scene in Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Here I was born, and there I died. It was only a moment for you, you took no notice ... ) and the unforgettable sequences at the beautiful Mission San Juan Bautista. Hitchcock creates a timeless sense of place, of characters moving across landscapes which are almost a part of the dreamlike story in of themselves. The final element in the movie's rich tapestry is the tremendous horror\/romantic score by Bernard Herrmann. Right from the very first image of the woman's lips in closeup, Herrmann's music is working to disconcert us, unnerve us, pulling us into an abyss of deceit and artifice. The music sweeps and dives, dizzying us along with Scottie, driving us along to an inexorable fate we don't want to consider. The power of movie music is something extraordinary and this is one of the finest examples of it; if you don't believe me, watch the nightmare sequence with the sound turned down and then watch it again with the music - you'll be converted. Nicely scripted by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor, from the book D'Entre Les Morts by noted French crime writers Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac (who also penned the novel on which Les Diaboliques is based).

You have to remember that the dialogue is robotic and unrealistic that I doubt Malcolm McDowell could have pulled off Anakin, and George Lucas was directing these actors. Samuel .l was miscast and the rest of the actors had no real reason to be cast as their characters. The story in this is somewhat compelling and sometimes even interesting, which is a lot in the Star Wars Prequels. It revolves around Anakin having to protect Padme and Obi-wan having to find the person who ordered her assassination. The beginning is solid, the middle isn't horrible and the end is kind of exciting. The worst element of the movie is it's love story. There's been so much said about this I don't need to add anything, but I concur with those who say it is pointless, doesn't make sense, cliché and dumb. The special effects (which I estimate twenty times the amount of time was spent on than the script) are pretty great. It doesn't really look that real, but it does open a lot of possibilities, like the arena scene and the droid-clone battle. This about wraps it up. It's not The Godfather, but it's a nice, decent Star Wars movie. And Jake Lloyd is gone. Thank Christ.

The movie is beautifully photographed... every frame is rich, lush, and looks like the box cover of a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. That might be enough to salvage a film if the story was told visually, but Barry Lyndon is a movie with little or no narrative. Ryan O'Neal- passive and blank- floats through the picture like Forrest Gump or Benjamin Button the lights are on but nobody's home. We get no sense of any inner life or personality, and the small amount of character we do glimpse reveals Barry to be a spoiled, selfish coward, and one hardly worthy of such a massively-scaled motion picture.The story follows Barry as he falls in love with his cousin, deserts the Army, lies about his bravery, marries a wealthy widow, cheats on her while squandering her fortune and abuses his stepson. He is an awful, unpleasant person, and Kubrick never seems to figure out WHY we're following the man's life in the first place.

Use of the special NASA lens was obviously part of Kubrick's reward for filming the faked moon landings, but this is not a device on which an entire film can rest. It astounds me that there are so few people willing to stand up and say the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. It seems to me that most people declare this movie profound because they feel they're supposed to, because if something looks and sounds like a classic, a masterpiece, then it surely must be... right?

Composition of frame and brilliant lighting do not make up for a poor actor playing an unengaging character in a movie that does its best to kill any sense of drama, suspense, humor, and action.

There's no generosity in them; Chris's problem is not one of lack of self-esteem but of egoism, as he sets no ethical bounds to his own behavior when trying to fulfil his romantic fantasies.

Through all of things it covers such as the Political Campaign to Sport and his girls, are only a small thought in the true Character study of Travis (De Niro). Its not really a day in the life of someone who's crazy, but a life of hardship and loneliness that has been brought to this very point the viewer is witnessing. If you watch the movie for more than ten minutes or review and try to get a better understanding you'll notice different details about what the movie is actually trying to display. ** SPOILERS ** The movie starts off in New York City where we first see Travis applying to be a night shift cab driver. He claims to not be able to sleep at night and drives around. Through the movie we evaluate how lonesome and anti-social he is by how many times he fails to befriend or make conversations with others. Through messing up a relationship with a woman working at campaign office, and other faults such as a murderous man in his cab, a teen aged prostitute, and the Scum observed on the streets, Travis slides deeper into a disturbed mental state which causes him to become violent and stand up against what he's finds wrong through the film. He attempts to assassinate the presidential candidate through the movie that Betsy supports because like Sport (Harvey Keitel) to Iris (Jodie Foster), he is a man holding her back from being set free or being with him.**THE ENDING**If you've seen the movie you would be aware of the ending that almost donned the film an X rating.Iris is declared free and is sent back home to her family. (this is the only part of the ending we can actually call true)Ending 1 The Viewers misunderstood, but emotionally well ending.After the massacre Travis spends time healing in the hospital and is eventually released and named a Hero by the press. Iris's family give him thanks for rescuing her and being such a good person. Life returns to normal and he continues to drive his taxi, he picks up Betsy and a fare. Through confidence they speak and she is impressed by his actions, she asks how much and but he doesn't take her money. Travis is finally known and loved for protecting the girl and taking wrong doers off the streets. Accomplished. Driving off he views himself in the mirror, and a piercing noise dissuades his attention and his mirror gets moved trying to view something in the street. This ending could be called true by the possibility of a sequel in the works.Ending 2 The Satisfying and perfect character study ending.Through the film we watch Travis go from being a sort of normal guy just trying to get by, from the end he slips up and finds himself working between assassin and vigilante. We watch him kill the people holding Iris from living what would be a normal life, and see him being wounded in the process. As the police come in Travis his fingers to his head like a gun and you see when his head tilts back his eyes roll back. In film thats dignified as a characters death. Directly after the scene, we notice Travis's life has improved and he has been renown as a hero by the press, thanked by Iris's family, a good guy, and also confident to the woman he's been trying to get the entire movie. Travis finally has the satisfaction he's been looking for the whole time, but doesn't it seem like its happening rapidly together? In the film you have watched Travis's persona changing along with the character analysis. Knowing his goals the entire time you finally get to see them flourish, after the tone of the film changes entirely. To the Point where Travis tilts his head back, to where he adjusts his mirrors, your seeing his fantasy and fulfillment he was always wishing for. To be seen and noticed, as a hero or maybe even less. Travis is finding satisfaction in what isn't actually true, as his last dying thoughts. He doesn't notice something in the rear view mirror with a sharp noise, he vanishes from his sight because he isn't truly there. His life has ended and his fantasy has finished along with the film. As the movie is a character study for insanity this ending would be perfect because you see him from his good descent to a vigilante to his last dying thoughts of love and being noticed he dreamed of. It makes the movie beautiful and worth all of the hype just to see, his character as detailed and deformed as it is. I can watch it over and over and notice something else every time. The ending is haunting every time, no matter how you think about it because it leaves you with a 'what just happened'? If it means a sequel to find out what happened with fiction or reality, life or death for Travis.

Its not really a day in the life of someone who's crazy, but a life of hardship and loneliness that has been brought to this very point the viewer is witnessing. If you watch the movie for more than ten minutes or review and try to get a better understanding you'll notice different details about what the movie is actually trying to display. ** SPOILERS ** The movie starts off in New York City where we first see Travis applying to be a night shift cab driver. He claims to not be able to sleep at night and drives around. Through the movie we evaluate how lonesome and anti-social he is by how many times he fails to befriend or make conversations with others. Through messing up a relationship with a woman working at campaign office, and other faults such as a murderous man in his cab, a teen aged prostitute, and the Scum observed on the streets, Travis slides deeper into a disturbed mental state which causes him to become violent and stand up against what he's finds wrong through the film. He attempts to assassinate the presidential candidate through the movie that Betsy supports because like Sport (Harvey Keitel) to Iris (Jodie Foster), he is a man holding her back from being set free or being with him.**THE ENDING**If you've seen the movie you would be aware of the ending that almost donned the film an X rating.Iris is declared free and is sent back home to her family. (this is the only part of the ending we can actually call true)Ending 1 The Viewers misunderstood, but emotionally well ending.After the massacre Travis spends time healing in the hospital and is eventually released and named a Hero by the press. Iris's family give him thanks for rescuing her and being such a good person. Life returns to normal and he continues to drive his taxi, he picks up Betsy and a fare. Through confidence they speak and she is impressed by his actions, she asks how much and but he doesn't take her money. Travis is finally known and loved for protecting the girl and taking wrong doers off the streets. Accomplished. Driving off he views himself in the mirror, and a piercing noise dissuades his attention and his mirror gets moved trying to view something in the street. This ending could be called true by the possibility of a sequel in the works.Ending 2 The Satisfying and perfect character study ending.Through the film we watch Travis go from being a sort of normal guy just trying to get by, from the end he slips up and finds himself working between assassin and vigilante. We watch him kill the people holding Iris from living what would be a normal life, and see him being wounded in the process. As the police come in Travis his fingers to his head like a gun and you see when his head tilts back his eyes roll back. In film thats dignified as a characters death. Directly after the scene, we notice Travis's life has improved and he has been renown as a hero by the press, thanked by Iris's family, a good guy, and also confident to the woman he's been trying to get the entire movie. Travis finally has the satisfaction he's been looking for the whole time, but doesn't it seem like its happening rapidly together? In the film you have watched Travis's persona changing along with the character analysis. Knowing his goals the entire time you finally get to see them flourish, after the tone of the film changes entirely. To the Point where Travis tilts his head back, to where he adjusts his mirrors, your seeing his fantasy and fulfillment he was always wishing for. To be seen and noticed, as a hero or maybe even less. Travis is finding satisfaction in what isn't actually true, as his last dying thoughts. He doesn't notice something in the rear view mirror with a sharp noise, he vanishes from his sight because he isn't truly there. His life has ended and his fantasy has finished along with the film. As the movie is a character study for insanity this ending would be perfect because you see him from his good descent to a vigilante to his last dying thoughts of love and being noticed he dreamed of. It makes the movie beautiful and worth all of the hype just to see, his character as detailed and deformed as it is. I can watch it over and over and notice something else every time. The ending is haunting every time, no matter how you think about it because it leaves you with a 'what just happened'? If it means a sequel to find out what happened with fiction or reality, life or death for Travis.

The artist, Mr. Crewe, attempts to rape her but she defends herself with a knife which ends up killing the man. So her and her boyfriend (a detective by the name of Frank Webber) attempt to cover up the murder of Mr. Crewe. That is until another man named Tracy has evidence that Alice did it so he tries to blackmail them. The question is how Alice and Frank will deal with this blackmailer. So I find this film as having a very entertaining and interesting plot with lots of twists and turns. It kept me entertained throughout the entire film.The acting in the film is a weird case because all of the actors do a great job except for Anny Ondra who happens to be in the lead role as Alice. She had a strong Czech accent so she ended up lip synching to another actress who was speaking next to the camera which really makes Anny's performance seem a little awkward. And other than just that she really doesn't display her emotions very well. Thankfully the other actors seem to pick up most of the slack. John Longden plays Frank Webber and he gets the emotions of being concerned and nervous across very well. And finally there is Donald Calthrop plays Tracy and really seems like a creepy guy and a criminal which means that he did a great job in his role.When it comes to sound this is Alfred Hitchcock's entry into sound cinema Blackmail ends up being a little bit of a hybrid. It was originally going to be a silent film until it was later changed into a sound one, at which point the small amount of already finished footage was dubbed and the remaining footage was filmed with sound. This makes the original silent parts seem a little awkward with only a few things having sound in these scenes while everything else is silent. During the parts where there is dialogue and things like that it works out well but music rarely overlaps with dialogue which is a shame that they couldn't have figured that out yet with these early talkies. The music seems to work very well though which is good. And the special effects are great for 1929 as it makes a lot of the scenes look pretty real for the time.So in conclusion this film is really an experiment with sound and a lot of the technical aspects of the film certainly show it. However, the story is good enough where it shines through the problems of early sound plus the acting is top notch (with the exception of Anny Ondra). Sound may not blend seamlessly into the movie but it definitely enhances one of the better Hitchcock films.

A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove and The Shining were all exceptional films, but no other Kubrick film, or any film, for that matter, has made something so emotionally twisting and beautiful. If a film can be art, this truly is. The story begins with a prologue concerning early humans finding a mysterious thing that looks like a door, and from there follows the story of astronauts on a mission to Jupiter accompanied by the computer HAL. But don't see the movie expecting that. See the movie expecting emotion. Unlike the traditional spectrum of Action vs. Character, 2001 is almost completely separated from those analysis. The two extremes of movies are movies filled with character and not much happening or filled with action and not much character, and when these two aspects are merged together in harmony and balance, you get a masterpiece, like the Godfather, There Will Be Blood, Goodfelas or Pulp Fiction. But 2001 is something completely different. The movie has very little to do with character, but is very slow-paced and events are far apart. This movie is pushed ahead by something hard to define. The closest I can come to defining it is a huge sense of wonder. Like, you sit through the whole movie just marvelling at it's beauty. But this isn't an art gallery.

Copying is what 80s cinema did in a big way &#x96; from remakes and spoofs to homage and reference, cinema thrived on recycling the past. Raiders of the Lost Ark borrows the adventuresome plots and exciting action of 1930s serials, classic swashbucklers and the James Bond franchise, while hinting at influences as disparate as Lawrence of Arabia and the Cecil B. DeMille religious extravaganzas. And like all of the great blockbusters of this era, its success comes not only from its derivative nature or its non-stop action, but from the fact that it is simply brilliantly conceived.Raiders of the Lost Ark also works by being somewhat tongue-in-cheek, pre-empting any sneers at the genre's clichés by spoofing them itself. The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan features such self-satirizing lines as You can't do this to me, I'm an American! But this isn't quite like the brilliantly daft 1980 Flash Gordon, for which your sense of irony must be switched to max. Kasdan's script is fully-functioning and wholly professional. Every moment and every line counts. Exposition scenes often dovetail into action ones, so we never have a chance to get bored. The scene where the army intelligence people come to ask Indy about Ravenwood and the staff of Ra serves two purposes. Firstly, it gives the audience the necessary background for the quest ahead without being too presentational. Secondly, the officials' lack of knowledge and sympathy endears us further to Indy, and lets us know that we won't be calling in the cops or the army for this one.Director Steven Spielberg has elaborated on Kasdan's work by fashioning action scenes that are both fun and inventive. Spielberg injects sequences with so many neat little ideas to continually amuse us and stop this from being a no-brainer. Take for example the local man falling onto the front of the truck during the road scene. Spielberg makes the moment both funny and exhilarating by showing us for a split-second the man's surprised face in the windshield. By-and-large the director keeps a rather detached eye, his camera often peeping through a bit of scenery or overlooking the action with a god-shot. It is this approach that gives so much of the picture its distinct, memorable look. Intense moments like Sallah's realisation that the dates are poisoned are composed of a series of attention-grabbing shots with no camera movement, creating a series of iconic images like the frames of a comic book. And this is really what Spielberg is at this stage of his career; a comic book director. But he happens to be a very good one.What really makes Raiders of the Lost Ark such a treasure is its fabulous characters and the way they are presented. The hero Indiana Jones is introduced as an enigma, a mysterious figure in hat. The opening shots reveal him to be a leader at the head of a band, an expert in the field and eventually, a handy man with a whip &#x96; and only then do we see his face. Karen Allen's Marion is easily the best of the Indiana Jones heroines, tough and resourceful in her own right, able to be his partner in adventure. And Paul Freeman's Belloq is the ultimate Indiana Jones villain. Smart and sophisticated, his enmity fuelled by rivalry rather than a simple conflict of interests, he's probably the most believable foe Indy has ever come up against. At the other end of the scale there's the sinister thug Toht, played with relish by English TV actor Ronald Lacey. Lacey makes his entrance as the campy and comical Gestapo stereotype, but when he coldly whispers Let me show you what I am used to his tone is utterly menacing and the character becomes genuinely scary. There are so many more perfectly written and played supporting roles &#x96; John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Brody &#x96; and it's not clear whether the actors were cast to suit the characters or whether the characters were developed around the actors.

The hero Indiana Jones is introduced as an enigma, a mysterious figure in hat. The opening shots reveal him to be a leader at the head of a band, an expert in the field and eventually, a handy man with a whip &#x96; and only then do we see his face. Karen Allen's Marion is easily the best of the Indiana Jones heroines, tough and resourceful in her own right, able to be his partner in adventure. And Paul Freeman's Belloq is the ultimate Indiana Jones villain. Smart and sophisticated, his enmity fuelled by rivalry rather than a simple conflict of interests, he's probably the most believable foe Indy has ever come up against. At the other end of the scale there's the sinister thug Toht, played with relish by English TV actor Ronald Lacey. Lacey makes his entrance as the campy and comical Gestapo stereotype, but when he coldly whispers Let me show you what I am used to his tone is utterly menacing and the character becomes genuinely scary. There are so many more perfectly written and played supporting roles &#x96; John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Brody &#x96; and it's not clear whether the actors were cast to suit the characters or whether the characters were developed around the actors. Most likely a mix of both.Raiders of the Lost Arc is really what all these early blockbusters were &#x96; a distillation of all the techniques for making high-quality entertainment. Yes, its ideas are cobbled together from the last five decades of action cinema, not to mention adventure literature and comic books, but it gets away with it. It gets away with it not just because of its knowing and light-hearted take approach, but because of how its makers have learned from the past, completely refining every aspect of the genre to make a modern classic.

This film tells us the story of the family that lived in the house before the Lutzes. In this one, the story shows the slow possession of young Sonny Montelli and leads up to him shooting his entire family dead. Now the real name of the family from the true story was Defeo, but in this it was changed to Montelli for legal reasons I'm sure. But anyway, the film goes along and by the end, Amityville II feels like a cheap rip off off The Exorcist.There is also a very depressing tone\/feeling to the movie which involves some incest, physical abuse Burt Young's character shows to his wife and children. And of course there is the slaughter of the entire family. I guess when you go to watch a movie like Amityville II, you don't expect a cheery feeling. But for a horror movie, this one really brings you down by the end of it.Burt Young (star from the Rocky series) did a decent job playing the abusive and belligerent father. Jack Magner who hasn't done anything in film or television since this was effectively creepy. But the story is all over the place and just fails to deliver many scares. The rest of the actors did a decent job, but the priest (James Olson) was no Rod Steiger from the first.There are so many sequels to the Amityville movies, this being one of the more serious one's. After part 2, the series takes a whole new direction involving demons and killer lamps. Somehow, those movies manage to provide more entertainment than this.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2011","score":"","review":" Amityville II is a prequel to 1979's The Amityville Horror.

It's maybe on the same level as the Vacation series minus the cultural part of those ones. But this movie deals with many clichés of the eighties and presents a couple of absurd, superficial and yet very funny characters that guarantee for many laughs, slapstick humour and absurd situations. At the end of the movie, you begin to appreciate those simple characters with all their weird behaviours, forces and weaknesses. The story and the reactions of the characters are simple and predictable, but maybe just because of that very entertaining and funny. This is a movie where one might switch its brain off and just laugh out loud as this comedy doesn't take itself so serious.A positive point about the movie is that there is also some action and some well hidden social criticism in this movie if you take a look beneath the surface. Another plus is the fact that the jokes are not all sexual as many movies of that kind but in fact quite simple but still diversified so this movie is a perfect entertainment for the whole family if you're not too severe and conservative with one or two slightly sexual scenes. That's why I highly suggest to watch this first part of the cult series.
