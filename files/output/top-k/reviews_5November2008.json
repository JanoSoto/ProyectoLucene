After the torture of plodding through through parts 4 and 5 (I kid you not it must have taken about 6 separate attempts for me to make it all the way through both those films) the sixth film is the series is actually a lot of fun and, thankfully, a change in direction.What I like about the stronger Puppet Master films is that rather than simply present a film about puppets killing people, there's often a lot more happening. Colourful characters, or set amidst a Nazi uprising, there have definitely been factors that make this straight-to-video series a little more sophisticated than you would expect.This film is not the strongest of the series, but still we're given some nice story elements that keep us watching- the shy Robert taken in by Dr. Magrew, who runs a showroom of oddities, a man who seems to have dark secrets that go beyond the living puppets he now owns.I enjoyed this film, it took the action away from Bogada Hotel, and it doesn't follow continuity with the previous 2 films (thankfully!) It brought a sense of fun, tension and mystery back to Puppet Master.Of course it's not perfect. Yes some of the acting is downright atrocious, and it's clear this film represents director Decoteaus' first steps towards his soft-core jocks in tight boxers style of horror film making, opting for looks over talent in some of his male actors, but thankfully it doesn't dominate this film- I watch horror to be scared, not aroused.Overall a fun way to spend 90 minutes, and one of the better sequels.
