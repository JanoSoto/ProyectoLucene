[{"date":"27 May 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999) Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Marisa Coughlan, Barry Watson, Vivica A. Fox, Michael McKean, Molly Ringwald, Liz Stauber, Jeffrey Tambor, Lesley Ann Warren, D Kevin Williamson. When falsely accused of cheating by a coldhearted history teacher, a straight-A student (Holmes) has her future plans and dreams sabotaged. Then while proving her innocence, Holmes and two friends accidentally knock her out, tie her up, and keep her hostage in her own house until she changes her ways. Good idea translates into this ludicrous premise that never accomplishes what it sets out to do, and with that never delivers real plot twists, just one tease after another. Mirren, the movie's most worthwhile feature, outshines the younger set with her hands literally tied behind her back. Disappointing film debut for SCREAM writer Williamson. Running Time 95 minutes and rated PG-13 for some language, violence, and sexual content. ** ","genre":null},{"date":"27 May 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999) Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Marisa Coughlan, Barry Watson, Vivica A.
