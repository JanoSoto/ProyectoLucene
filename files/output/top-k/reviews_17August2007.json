[{"date":"17 August 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Towards the beginning of the film, Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) chats with his girlfriend and fellow law student (Gretchen Mol) about his world of poker-playing, and she says that she can't believe that her boyfriend associates with someone named Worm (Edward Norton). In many ways, this short discourse describes largely what the story is about. It centers around the two worlds of Mike McDermott. There is Mike McDermott, law student, who habituates the very demanding and yet predictable world of professors and classmates at a nameless law school, maybe Columbia or NYU. And there is Mike McDermott, poker player or rounder, who inhabits the world of card sharks which seems like another planet when compared to the world of the law school. Much of the movie is about McDermott's straddling these two worlds and realizing that he may have to choose one or the other.This film is not about poker playing in the sense of strategy, tactics, folding, bluffing, etc, or at least we receive very little insight into the poker strategist's mind, except during the opening sequence. Instead, which is maybe a better focus, we learn about the world of the poker player. Where he plays, where he doesn't play, whom he plays, and what he's trying to accomplish. We learn about the different secret games and the strange characters that populate this other dimension which seems on the periphery of society.Joey Knish (John Turturro) is the rounder's rounder who plays poker for a living and is one of the few level-headed people among these cut-throats. Often he tries to guide the young McDermott and steer him away from the deadlier side of the game. Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), whose nickname refers to his high position in the Russian mafia, owns a strange underground poker facility that you won't find in the yellow pages. And the creme-de-la-creme is Worm, played with angst and nervous energy by Edward Norton, who is both a brilliant poker player but a reckless cheat who deals hangars even when he's winning. (A hangar is a cheated deal in which certain cards are dealt from the bottom of the deck to a particular player or players to either advantage or disadvantage their hand(s).) Much of the film is about their relationship, and how a scam got Worm busted before the story begins and how the two have to fight to get out of a much larger predicament than governmental authorities.The world of the law students, which ends up playing second fiddle to the poker world, includes McDermott's girlfriend and one of the professors, played by Martin Landau. The glimpses of the more refined world of the law school acts as an excellent reflection on the seedier poker universe to better define McDermott and how he fits into both. But as the movie progresses, the poker world monopolizes larger and larger amounts of his time, energy and attention.Briefly, the film begins with a devastating poker heads-up hand between McDermott and none other than Teddy KGB, the most feared man of the movie, down in KGB's own poker casino that looks like an underground detention center. The story fast-forwards several months later as McDermott tries to reconcile himself vowing to quit poker forever, like an alcoholic vows to stop drinking, and devote all his energy to studying law. But when he picks up Worm from prison, McDermott ends up getting sucked back into the game. And the more he plays, the more his law studies and his girlfriend take a back seat. Simultaneously, a sub-plot is brewing in which we learn that Worm has many obligations awaiting him when he was released from custody, and simultaneously, he has not shaken his interesting ways of winning poker hands which starts becoming a very dangerous game. Eventually, Worm's situations, both past and present, McDermott's willingness to get back into poker intersect providing an incredible tale of twists and turns that will keep you wondering who's got the hand and who's bluffing.Rounders is a gem of movie. The acting is absolutely first rate all around, particularly from the supporting cast. The movie has elements of a suspense thriller with high intelligence and yet always reminds you that this is about poker players. Johnny Chan, the twice champion of the World Series of Poker, makes an unexpected cameo. And of course, the highest acclaim for Matt Damon and Edward Norton. You might be able to bluff a bad hand but the acting and script is the real deal.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 August 2007","score":"15 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" I think Joel Schumacher is a really terrible filmmaker. Nearly every one of his films is an exercise in flashy stylistics with not a single thing to say. Look no further than his Batman films. But on one occasion, he managed to rise above his desire for eye-candy overkill. And produce something really worthwhile. And Falling Down was that film.Falling Down would have to be the best film out of Schumacher's mostly awful body of work. Its the one thing he's ever done where he actually forgets about battering an audience into submission with glorious light effects and pretty costumes and sets. He's produced a violent story to be sure. But a curiously humane one too. And Michael Douglas is its human centre.Douglas plays Bill Foster, a defence worker of seven years who gets laid off. He spends the next month and a half trying to make sense of the tattered shreds of his life. He's a man with no job. No wife and daughter because they've cut him out of their lives. And most importantly, he's a man without purpose.But on one particularly hot day in LA, he finds a purpose. The opening scene is filled with glaringly aggressive closeups of Douglas' face. Sweating and twitching. All while he's sitting in his car in the middle of an agonisingly slow traffic jam. You know something is coming. Something is about to erupt. And that thing is Bill. In a split-second he snaps, abandons his car and tells the baffled motorist behind him he's going home.Although Bill is indeed going home to his wife and daughter, he makes a few stops along the way. Bill has become so disillusioned by society's flaws and shortcomings, he feels a need to rectify it by lashing out at the mundane trappings of our everyday lives. With his crew-cut, white shirt and tie, briefcase in one hand and automatic weapon in the other, its Ordinary Joe meets GI Joe.Its hard to believe Falling Down came from the same director of mindless trash like Batman & Robin. This is an acutely observed portrait of the sorry state of our affairs. And Michael Douglas turns in a real showstopper of an acting performance. Its a style of acting brimming with raw honesty. He plays a man not at the mercy of madness, but someone who's grown accustomed to it. This is the film Michael Douglas should have won an Oscar for.The film is bold enough to portray Bill as an object of sympathy, even when he's committing shocking acts of violence. Bill is a middle aged man, who felt he was in control all of his life, and when everything that mattered to him fell to dust, it left him a broken man. His new mission gives him something to focus on, but I sense its not quite the liberating experience Bill envisioned it would be. Even when he tries to reassert control, his inherent emptiness still plagues him. What a brave, plaintively truthful performance!Falling Down has received a fair amount of criticism, especially from racial minorities, who have lambasted the film because Bill's targets appear to be Korean shopkeepers or Latino street gangs. It is easy to view it in that context. That Bill is nothing more than a walking megaphone venting his hatred towards foreigners. But that's too narrow a vision. Schumacher's direction is really more expansive then you realise.Yes he does trash the Korean's store, because he overcharges for a can of Coke, and Bill won't have enough change left over for the payphone. And yes he beats up Latino thugs. But these are just the bystanders along the way of Bill's inexorable journey. I don't think there's any intentional malice intended there.And Schumacher's direction is quite excellent. He stages self-contained vignettes that are tiny microcosms of what exactly is wrong with this world. Like the scene at the fast-food restaurant. A classic example of the bureaucratic red tape that deliberately sets out to entangle people like poor Bill. Who hasn't felt like standing up for they're rights as a consumer? Bill can't have breakfast because he's a few minutes late. These are the type of absurdities Bill is campaigning against.Falling Down works like a steadily unfolding carpet. And as Bill walks through the city of LA, he is wearing out the hollow material that its weaved from. There is a very natural flow to the film. Things fall into place quite beautifully. Such as when Bill makes the decision to carry a bag full of weapons instead of his normal briefcase. This is a man going through a steady metamorphosis from which there is no return.Some people have felt disappointed by the somewhat low-key ending. But I felt it couldn't have ended any other way. Its an ending of weary resignation. No matter how much Bill has tried to add meaning to his rootless existence, the truth is society may have to live with its flaws. No matter what Bill's efforts.One of the most daring films of the 90s, and any film that attempts to address society's failings with such frank honesty deserves strong commendation indeed.
