It was simply too easy to pass up. And sometimes writers fall back on easy cliches, especially in headlines.Actually, make that especially in headlines and in movies about substance abuse. Simply put, Permanent Midnight fails. And it doesn't fail because of the direction, or the writing, or the performances (thought there are certainly serious flaws with each), but because it doesn't have anything new to the discussion. Permanent Midnight on one hand is about the depths to which drugs can drive a man, but it's also about the superficiality of Hollywood. The problem is that neither angle has anything remotely original in it and so barring something remarkable in the execution, there's really no point in making the movie. Permanent Midnight, though, features many good things, but nothing remarkable enough to justify the been there\/ done that feeling that remains when the narrative is finished.Permanent Midnight features a framing story that feels made up. Since I haven't read Jerry Stahl's book of the same name, I cannot speak to the truth of the framing sequences which feature Maria Bello as an ex-drug addict named Kitty. I can only say how painfully convenient it is for recovering Jerry (Ben Stiller) to have this blond angel more than willing to hear his story of degradation. Not a moment between Jerry and Kitty rings true emotionally, but at least it gives writer\/director David Veloz and entre into the story, not that the story actually goes anywhere. You see, when Jerry arrives in LA he's already a junkie, living with his friend Nickie (Owen Wilson), who's also already a junkie. He marries a British TV producer so that she can get her green card and she helps him get a television writing job. As shown in the film, there's nothing about his life that leads the the progression of his drug addiction. He just gets deeper and deeper and befriends shadier and shadier characters.There's an arbitrary point at which he obviously decided to quit (since he's clean in the frame story), but by the time we get there, it seems so obvious and so unsatisfying as to make the journey feel wasted. No matter how bad things seems to get, the audience knows it could always be worse, because we've seen worse drug addictions in a dozen movies of varying qualities. Throughout the flashback, Jerry makes no real attempts at recovery and yet only falls to a certain level. He never makes it to hell. Nothing in the film has a payoff.Much of the problem, then, is in Veloz's episodic screenplay. Characters wander in and out and nothing really comes together. Jerry seems strung-out, but he never seems horrible, so we can't really pity the people who trust him and love him because he doesn't really do any serious damage to them. Everything just comes and goes. The film is filled with tiny star cameos which meet with only occasional success. Owen Wilson and Janeane Garofalo are always good to have around, as is the perpetually psychotic Peter Greene. Cheryl Ladd, Fred Willard, Andy Dick, and Connie Nielsen, though, provide uninteresting one shot encounters.Veloz perhaps wisely avoids drug movie hallucination clichés. Aware that he lacks the visual sensibility to rival Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Trainspotting, he restricts his flourishes to a single drug nightmare and to boring New Wave-y jump cuts and the like. Veloz clearly sets the film up as Ben Stiller's show.As Jerry Stahl, Stiller is never less than solid. He makes it clear why people would continue to trust Jerry even with all of his problems. The script, however, gives no indication of the genius that everybody attributed to Stahl, making it difficult to feel that the character is wasting his talent. Stiller, then, is fleetingly amusing, fleetingly harrowing, and always acting. When the character, in a moment of true desperation turns to his neck for an uncollapsed vein, it's Ben Stiller shooting up into his neck, not the character. It's tough to watch, but you feel for an actor on the edge, rather than a character. So people in Hollywood are so self-absorbed that they don't notice what's going on around them. OK. I've seen that before.  And amidst all that egomania, people with problems are allowed to fall through the cracks. And I've seen that before. And recovery is possible? In a one-day-at-a-time way?

Both end in somewhat gloomy warehouses\/factories, both have tanker chases, and the protector of the targeted Connor family member is killed in each movie.If you have the chance to get the special version, do so. It sheds a lot more light onto the plot. With the version that was in theatres, I always thought to myself, 'Sarah picked a good day to escape from the mental hospital, seeing how the T1000 breaks in that same day'. The Ultimate DVD edition shows why in a dream sequence featuring a visit from Kyle Reese (a la 1984). The Ultimate DVD edition also shows a cool scene when the Terminator is reprogrammed from 'read' to write modes. Several other tid bits are scattered through the movie, that were deleted in the original release.The motif is repeated throughout the movie, and is ultimately reversed when the Terminator gives his life to save humanity from its own self destruction.This is a way cool movie, a groundbreaking benchmark for a new generation of special effects, with bang on writing by Cameron and Wisher.Ps. Watch for Wisher's cameo as a tourist when the Terminator is thrown through the store window while in the galleria.Favourite line Terminator (to john) Whats wrong with your eyes? -- Terminator I know now why you cry, but it is something I can never do.....(runs a parallel with Sarah's voice over at the end of the movie) ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 May 2001","score":"9 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers herein.This film surely hit a mass marketing sweet spot, I suppose because it was competently crafted, had a twee love affair, displayed some quaint costumes and gave the faint impression that in spite of its fun, it held something important.

But then veteran action producer Joel Silver thrust Steve back in the limelight, put him on the Slimfast diet gave him slightly better material to work with. After all, an actor can only do as good as the script.From a novel of the same name by John Westerman (but bearing minimal resemblance to it) the plot centers on Orin Boyd, a cop busted down to patrolman after a rough encounter with the Vice-President. Once on the streets Boyd's suspicious nose can't keep him out of trouble with undercover cops who are trying to bust local Drug Boss Latrell Walker&#x85;or so it seems.There are many attempts at irony throughout the movie and surprisingly enough most of them work. Boyd is forced to attend rage control classes in which he meets eccentric TV host Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold) who becomes his wannabe partner. But sadly enough the classes don't work as Boyd continues to uses violence first, ask questions later. And there is a public service announcement too; Seagal survives a car wreck by airbag. A later car crash victim doesn't have one and dies.Dozens of cop movie clichés staple the flimsy script together. And the bad guys are obvious from the moment they appear on screen. Bartkowiak's direction is better than in his debut Romeo Must Die, and adds a heavy dose of frenetic rush to such a fast-paced film. However the set-up and execution of the story is so dull you'll forget about it half an hour after the credits roll.Seagal has learned a little, just a little, more in the acting area but still doesn't know how to express himself much.

Post-Rocky he made two solid but unsuccessful films, F.I.S.T (1977) and Paradise Alley (1978).  Seemingly down on his luck (again), Stallone returned to the formula that made his name in the first place.  Donning three hats (actor, scriptwriter and director), Stallone embarked on a sequel to Rocky.  The result is a predictable, occasionally slow, but strong ending film.  Rocky II lacks the charm of the original, but still pulls on the heart strings as the audience roots for the perpetual underdog in Rocky Balboa.The film begins with the rousing fanfare that featured at the start of the original.  In fact many features from the original exist in this sequel, making it somewhat too familiar territory.  Anyhow, we see how Rocky takes the champ, Apollo Creed (ex-Oakland Raider NFL player Carl Weathers) the whole 15 rounds after the champ claimed he would finish Balboa in less than four rounds.  In the final round, Rocky beats Creed up against the ropes and the champ is saved by the final bell.Rocky and Creed go to hospital wherein the champ wants a rematch with Balboa.  Balboa declines.  The film gets bogged down in a distinct lack of action for its next third.  Rocky has to learn to cope with his short-lived stardom.  He spends most of his prize money and when he decides to retire, he finds 'regular' work hard to come by due to his lack of schooling and qualifications.  With Creed talking up a rematch and playing down the fact that Balboa nearly beat him in their last fight, Rocky and his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) agree to fight Creed again.  Rocky does this against the wishes of Adrian.  He trains poorly (we are never told why) and Mickey casts him out of his training facility.  Just as this happens, complications arise in Adrian's pregnancy and she falls into a coma.After waking up from her coma, she suddenly changes her mind (was she thinking about it in her coma?!) and wants Rocky to beat Creed.  With a new child in his arms and the permission of his wife to fight the world champ AGAIN, Rocky is inspired and sets off on his training run.  A pumping 1970s orchestral soundtrack follows Rocky's old-fashioned training methods (smashing iron in a scrapyard etc) before cutting to another soundtracked scene where Rocky runs through Philadelphia with what seems to be the youth population of the city behind him.  To the theme of Gonna Fly Now Rocky reprises his run from the first film, where he sprints up the steps of Philadelphia Museum.  Only this time with a lot of kids following him.The fight itself is the real highlight of the movie.  Far longer than the short, edited match from the original there is some extremely over the top yet well choreographed fight scenes.Stallone followed this up with the bigger budgeted yet weaker scripted Rocky III in 1982.  While Rocky II is slow and less heartwarming than the original, it still delivers in parts.

I've never seen any of von Trier's works before this film, and I was not a Bjork fan, so no one can accuse me of being biased.I guess the greatest point I admire about the film is that von Trier is brave enough to do this film according to his vision. This is not a movie for people who have a preconcieved notion of what a film should be. Everyone comes in a theatre with some notion of how a movie should be like, from reading reviews etc. The difference between people who love it and people who hate it is their ability to erase their notions and accept what the film presents.Of course, people can argue that soap operas can be considered as art in this case. I'm not refuting the fact that the story is unrealistic and simple, but it WAS inspired by a children's fairy tale after all. But the way it was shot and the acting makes the whole process of viewing so intense, it's painful. Von Trier just strips away all the unnecessary bits that we commonly see in most films. He doesn't explain what he wants to convey, he shows us. This leaves the film with a climax at the very beginning and holds us (or maybe just me) until the very end, and leaves me so broken. To me, Selma is real. To me, there are people like that in the world, and most mothers are like that. Maybe you laugh cynically, but that's because we are all Little Genes, who do not realise how noble our mothers are until the very end.Von Trier goes back to the primitive method of using handheld cameras for the reality scenes and I admire him for that. It is an art to handle a shaky camera and yet still capture the essence of each scene. How many of us get so frustrated with a handheld camera cos it doesn't listen to what our hands say? Although the switch in style, between the musicals and the reality, makes the direction very evident, I seriously can't think of a better way to do it.I congratulate von Trier for being brave enough to accept all that criticism and snide remarks and still hold dear his own visions.

Despite its ingenious sci-fi trappings, at its core The Matrix is a simple tale of good versus evil, David versus Goliath . . . and it introduces its audience to an unexplored, wondrous mythos of murky history.  In the process of telling its tale, The Matrix hints at a richly plotted past that's never fully defined, but only hinted at with offhanded scraps of dialogue.  In this manner, it introduces a fictional world in many as breathtaking as the original Star Wars did twenty-two years earlier -- but The Matrix also tells a compelling story, unlike the more contemporary Phantom Menace. The hero of The Matrix is Neo (Keanu Reeves), who at first glance is just a geeky software programmer at a dull and boring company, looking to earn a paycheck just like everybody else. At home, though, in the small hours of the night, he's a computer hacker, and a good one.   His hacking activities draw the attention of two cyberpunk iconoclasts  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who exudes Zen-Master cool; and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a leather-wearing femme fatale. Morpheus and Trinity reveal a profound truth about the world to the disbelieving Neo the world doesn't exist.  Everything that seems real is in fact a forced form of virtual reality, designed to make the people of the world blindly subservient to an alien-run system. Morpheus and his group of cyber-rebels want to bring this system -- The Matrix -- down, and firmly believe that Neo is the messiah-like One who can lead his rebels to victory. The look of The Matrix is absolutely fantastic.  Taking a page out of literary works like William Gibson's Mona Lisa Overdrive, the film blends film noir with dirty high tech -- there's nothing bright and shiny in The Matrix; nothing to suggest the happy future of The Jetsons.  What's left is a gritty world where both intellect and imagination rule. From this world, directors Larry and Andy Wachowski create an epic comic-book conflict where the conflict between good and evil is blown up into slick, stylized, spectacular proportions.  The special effects, which includes CGI, traditional animation techniques, model work, and martial arts wire work, are all blended to make jaw-dropping action sequences . . . and to enhance the story.  (The opening scene with Trinity alone makes the film worth watching).  I don't know if anybody really knows what cyberspace will ultimately look like, but I hope when the time comes when people can immerse themselves in a world of virtual reality, it looks as cool as it does in The Matrix.  The performances, for the most part, are perfect for the film.  Keanu Reeves doesn't exactly flex his acting chops as the impassive Neo, but the low-key approach seems appropriate for the role.  As Morpheus, Laurence Fishburne is sensational, making the character a perfect mix of a martial arts master, a cryptic philosopher, and a full-blown action hero.  Fishburne never raises his voice once during the film, but he has so much presence and confidence, he still comes across as the most commanding, authoritative character in the entire movie.  Hugo Weaving is also impressive as the main villain, Agent Smith, although by the end of the film he's glowered and barked exasperated orders so many times, it looks like he's watched Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive once too often.  The biggest waste of a character, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss and Trinity, who still shines despite the criminal under-use of her character.  Trinity absolutely sets the incredible tone of The Matrix in the opening scene, showing off her potential as possibly one of the greatest female action heroes in cinematic history . . . and then she's immediately relegated to supporting character status the instant Neo and Morpheus show up.  Memo to the Wachowski Brothers Actually USE Trinity in the Matrix sequels; it'd be nice to see her live up to what was hinted at in the first film.The Matrix presents a number of interesting concepts, ranging from the philosophical nature of existence itself to the pure adrenaline rush of combat in the cybernetic world.  (Although, it's slightly disappointing to see that despite all the brilliant originality of `The Matrix', wars are still apparently fought with mundane nine-millimeter handguns and AK-47s.)

Despite its ingenious sci-fi trappings, at its core The Matrix is a simple tale of good versus evil, David versus Goliath . . . and it introduces its audience to an unexplored, wondrous mythos of murky history.  In the process of telling its tale, The Matrix hints at a richly plotted past that's never fully defined, but only hinted at with offhanded scraps of dialogue.  In this manner, it introduces a fictional world in many as breathtaking as the original Star Wars did twenty-two years earlier -- but The Matrix also tells a compelling story, unlike the more contemporary Phantom Menace. The hero of The Matrix is Neo (Keanu Reeves), who at first glance is just a geeky software programmer at a dull and boring company, looking to earn a paycheck just like everybody else. At home, though, in the small hours of the night, he's a computer hacker, and a good one.   His hacking activities draw the attention of two cyberpunk iconoclasts  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who exudes Zen-Master cool; and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a leather-wearing femme fatale. Morpheus and Trinity reveal a profound truth about the world to the disbelieving Neo the world doesn't exist.  Everything that seems real is in fact a forced form of virtual reality, designed to make the people of the world blindly subservient to an alien-run system. Morpheus and his group of cyber-rebels want to bring this system -- The Matrix -- down, and firmly believe that Neo is the messiah-like One who can lead his rebels to victory. The look of The Matrix is absolutely fantastic.  Taking a page out of literary works like William Gibson's Mona Lisa Overdrive, the film blends film noir with dirty high tech -- there's nothing bright and shiny in The Matrix; nothing to suggest the happy future of The Jetsons.  What's left is a gritty world where both intellect and imagination rule. From this world, directors Larry and Andy Wachowski create an epic comic-book conflict where the conflict between good and evil is blown up into slick, stylized, spectacular proportions.  The special effects, which includes CGI, traditional animation techniques, model work, and martial arts wire work, are all blended to make jaw-dropping action sequences . . . and to enhance the story.  (The opening scene with Trinity alone makes the film worth watching).  I don't know if anybody really knows what cyberspace will ultimately look like, but I hope when the time comes when people can immerse themselves in a world of virtual reality, it looks as cool as it does in The Matrix.  The performances, for the most part, are perfect for the film.  Keanu Reeves doesn't exactly flex his acting chops as the impassive Neo, but the low-key approach seems appropriate for the role.  As Morpheus, Laurence Fishburne is sensational, making the character a perfect mix of a martial arts master, a cryptic philosopher, and a full-blown action hero.  Fishburne never raises his voice once during the film, but he has so much presence and confidence, he still comes across as the most commanding, authoritative character in the entire movie.  Hugo Weaving is also impressive as the main villain, Agent Smith, although by the end of the film he's glowered and barked exasperated orders so many times, it looks like he's watched Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive once too often.  The biggest waste of a character, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss and Trinity, who still shines despite the criminal under-use of her character.  Trinity absolutely sets the incredible tone of The Matrix in the opening scene, showing off her potential as possibly one of the greatest female action heroes in cinematic history . . . and then she's immediately relegated to supporting character status the instant Neo and Morpheus show up.  Memo to the Wachowski Brothers Actually USE Trinity in the Matrix sequels; it'd be nice to see her live up to what was hinted at in the first film.The Matrix presents a number of interesting concepts, ranging from the philosophical nature of existence itself to the pure adrenaline rush of combat in the cybernetic world.  (Although, it's slightly disappointing to see that despite all the brilliant originality of `The Matrix', wars are still apparently fought with mundane nine-millimeter handguns and AK-47s.)
