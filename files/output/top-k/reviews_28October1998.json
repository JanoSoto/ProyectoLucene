[{"date":"28 October 1998","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Medem has been trying for years to show how two solitary beings can glimpse at each other's solitude. His three previous films are all interesting, but on the verge of being uncomprehensible and even pretentious. Los amantes del Circulo Polar is as beautiful as Tierra, as suggestive as La Ardilla Roja, as moving as Vacas, but so much better. Coincidences lack the mystical character they have in his other films. What Otto and Ana can see of each other, what Otto and Ana make of each other, is not a result of destiny, but of our constant attempt at not being alone, at finding meaning on a meaningless world. When you come out of the cinema, your life seems fuller and more significant. And, somehow, one wonders whether the lives of those already gone is not also meaningful from the life of those who remember them.
