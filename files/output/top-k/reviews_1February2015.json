By the end of the film, my fears were mostly quelled, but there was still a niggling feeling that something wasn't quite right. I couldn't immediately see what point Fight Club was trying to make, and for me it felt like it had mixed morals, but those are merely an afterthought in what is a stylish, humorous and very well acted movie.The unnamed narrator of the film is played by Edward Norton, and provides witty and nihilistic commentary throughout the film. His life is boring, he is an insomniac with mental health issues that go even deeper than that, and he needs to find some excitement. He starts going to support groups for the terminally ill just so that he can feel emotional outlet, a method that's also carried out by Helena Bonham Carter's character. It's a foul idea, but the film very nearly makes you able to see where they're coming from. On a flight one day, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and sees a man that is everything that he's ever wanted to be &#x96; successful, exciting, daring, attractive, not stuck in a boring day-to-day job. The Narrator and Durden start spending more time together, and that's when things get crazy.Through the pair's setting up of a Fight Club, initially as a substitute for the support groups, but eventually as a training ground for their minions, we are subjected to a horrific amount of violence and animalism. The Narrator gets carried away, spurred on by Durden, and they embark on Project Mayhem, an operation whose sole intention is to mess stuff up and 'destroy capitalism'. It is only after a sudden blackout from Norton's character that we are provided with our twist, a discovery that changes the entire meaning of the film, and the final half hour does an extremely good job of working out and justifying that.It's a film that is held up by its performances and styling. Norton and Pitt work off each other extremely well, with Norton's narration providing an interesting and witty commentary over the bleak events of the movie. In a film as dark as this, finding yourself laughing really does make you look at yourself. Bonham Carter is brilliant, yet severely underused, and her character could have been made so much more prominent to provide a bit more of the twisted moral compass that she seems to have. The film is shot through a darkened lens, which superbly captures the rainy, dingy and crumbling world that the characters inhabit.Fight Club is a film with a message, shown by The Narrator's eventual rejection of Durden's ways and philosophy, but only just. He doesn't want to become like him, ruining everything and destroying things for the sake of it. The problem I have with the film is the way that it gets there &#x96; in displaying the violent and anarchistic build up to its lead character's rejection of those ways, it glamourises it. The whole point of the film is that we too are taken in as followers of Tyler Durden and his ways, and I worry that, even though the actual Fight Club scenes are only a small part of the film, their extreme nature does more harm than good. It may not be advocating violence, but to people who don't quite absorb its message, it may seem like it does.Despite the hype and huge cult following of the film, it's not Fincher's best work. It has great set-pieces, performances and visuals, but the plot occasionally jumps around confusingly and the message has a tendency to feel muddled. It is worth watching and for the vast majority of the runtime really enjoyable, but perhaps my best advice would be not to read too deeply into it.

After watching it, I realized I wasn't alone, and that recurring dreams were normal. I remember afterward having a few dreams where I was being chased by men with brightly-colored, humongous butterfly nets.....dreams that were obviously influenced and driven by this movie.And like a lot of folks, I always felt I was trying to run through water....that sluggish feeling when your legs just won't move fast as you need them to move. But this is supposed to be a movie review...so let's look at a few things about The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T. First off, Hans Conried was a genius of comedy...and this role is perhaps his finest role and performance. He made Dr. Terwilleger into a maniacal, egocentric, hypnotic menace...the kind of pushy, abusive adult that all pre-adolescent kids dread...that parental-approved authority figure that kids are forced to deal with despite all protestations, usually found today in overpowering, intimidating sports-coaches, a perfectionist teachers, or any adult that looks DOWN on kids and treats them like lowly subordinates. The genius of Dr. Seuss's understanding of fears and insecurities of young children is quite evident in how he wrote Conried's role....and the sad and winsome song that Tommy Rettig sings alone as he feels abandoned by his only confidante, the plumber Zabrodowski after Terwillger entrances Zabrodowski with magic and tainted pickle juice is both touching and revealing of just how kids feel when they find they have no one, or no compassionate adult to turn to with their problems. Yes, Tommie, adults shouldn't ever push us little kids around. I have always felt this movie is VASTLY underrated, and it is a darn shame that Seuss never made another movie after this one....never again had the creative license and control to bring some of his other work to the magic, Cinescopic big screen. The sets, backgrounds, costumes, and music in this movie are brilliant and imaginary, and some of the script was pretty daring, for its time. Especially notable is the song sung by the Executioner as he describes what each floor of the dungeon is used for.....watch the movie and listen to the lyrics.There are many other moments in the movie that carry a not-so-subtle message about the vagaries of American child-rearing, even some commentary about the threat of nuclear Armaggedon that was very much on people's minds in 1953. I think Seuss was also making a jab as to how so many Americans were sending their children off to camp to receive instruction in whatever the PARENT thought the child needed, rather than what the children themselves were proficient or interested in. Well, done, Dr. Dr. Seuss's books are a recognized, language and decade- spanning treasure, and so is this movie. Although The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T. gave me some nightmares as a 2nd-grader....it has stayed with me all these years later...and every time I pull it out of my movie collection, I am reminded of the blissful, carefree picture of typical American life that Hollywood was always trying to project in the mid-1950's, highlighting our sunny blue-sky days, our disposable income, our perfectly-manicured, beautifully-dressed (but overly submissive) Moms and families, and all the other post-WWII aspects of pure Americana that the sudden, burgeoning post-GI Bill Middle-Class sector of America was creating for itself. Don't miss this MOVIE!! I've rated it a 9 for one main reason it is an utterly-unique reminder of what Dr. Seuss was really trying to tell us all in his many great books Children are a treasure, the most-perfect gifts we receive in our short lives, and they should be loved, cherished, and respected....

We are in 1971 before the emergence of profiling that will come from the FBI in Quantico. So both police departments (led by elected sheriffs or marshals) and political personnel, like mayors and district attorneys, do not know what to do with such criminals and they tend to take a conservative stance hiding behind the very famous Miranda (the tree hiding the forest) and treating the crimes separately, hence erasing the serial dimension. Clint Eastwood reacting along the same line as the general public considered that the police had to be a lot more responsive, hence active and even brutal with these criminals, to the point of shooting first without any warning and asking questions afterwards, and only if they did not have any bullets left in their weapons. Some yelled at abuse of power. Others applauded to support the use of force to protect innocent bystanders. We were in the post 1968 period, the post Woodstock period, and the post hippy period. That strong stance on Clint Eastwood's side was the backlash at excessive tolerance and liberalism that was shown for what it had become in films like Zabriskie Point or Fritz the Cat, a direct encouragement to criminal activities.That feeling of fear in the wide public was also racially motivated for some white people because that was the time when the Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam started using the second amendment to justify their decision to carry weapons in public in full respect of what all whites could do. This feeling was amplified by the persistence of the Vietnam War and the very conservative policy of Richard Nixon. The number of casualties in Vietnam and the cost of the war, not to speak of the cost of the veterans who were lucky enough to come back in one piece though quite often severely impaired, becoming more and more visible and expensive, the people were quite ready to ask for a change in policy, a return of money in larger quantities to security within the country, which meant the end of the war. And yet it was still to go on for four years, increasing all the time the exasperation of the public.This film is still slightly slow but it is stampeding away in 1971. That was an action film and it had to be fast, though it is here more endurance than speed, and yet many of the tricks that were to develop in the next decades were already there short sequences edited in clean cut ellipses. The camera did not have any time and energy to waste to give small descriptive details but it emphasized the successive moments in the action, even at times in a nearly impossible sequence, like Inspector Harry climbing to the top of the high building from which the serial killer had shot his first victim in less time than it took the coroner's team to wrap up the body of the victim and take it off the crime scene. Here the editing ellipse with Harry at the top point of the building and the body of the victim being removed makes it look extremely fast and meaningful.But this film is the matrix for many films to come that expose the inability of elected personnel, on both the police side and the political side, and even the judicial side, to understand that some urgent revision of police procedures has to be worked out &#x96; out of a magician's hat if necessary &#x96; that would at the same time respect judicial and legal procedures, empower the police to respond to such criminals at top speed, and protect the public against such criminals who cannot be saved in anyway because they like &#x96; sorry some of them do love &#x96; killing. From this obvious point to the idea that they have to be killed on the spot while committing a crime there is only one small step that is often climbed or taken in the heat of action. But we can be sure this film was the matrix of what was to become very popular detective &#x96; or rather nowadays police &#x96; series. Colombo is out and CSI or NCIS are in. And then you can work on details with Dexter or Criminal Minds and Bones. But it is always the same idea these serial killers have to be neutralized at best &#x96; or worst &#x96; and eliminated from society at worst &#x96; or at best. For Inspector Harry the second option is the only one. Since then a lot of thinking has been done and particularly we have understood that such serial killers may be psychopaths or sociopaths, but they are necessarily super intelligent and they cannot be considered as intellectually underdeveloped, let alone handicapped or differently abled if you prefer.That's probably why Clint Eastwood will come back to that character four more times over the next seventeen years.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU ","genre":null},{"date":"1 February 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is the absolute matrix for a series of four more films with and by Clint Eastwood as well as a new way to deal with the problem of extreme crime and both the police answer and the political lack of courage in front of this emerging serial killing practice.

That strong stance on Clint Eastwood's side was the backlash at excessive tolerance and liberalism that was shown for what it had become in films like Zabriskie Point or Fritz the Cat, a direct encouragement to criminal activities.That feeling of fear in the wide public was also racially motivated for some white people because that was the time when the Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam started using the second amendment to justify their decision to carry weapons in public in full respect of what all whites could do. This feeling was amplified by the persistence of the Vietnam War and the very conservative policy of Richard Nixon. The number of casualties in Vietnam and the cost of the war, not to speak of the cost of the veterans who were lucky enough to come back in one piece though quite often severely impaired, becoming more and more visible and expensive, the people were quite ready to ask for a change in policy, a return of money in larger quantities to security within the country, which meant the end of the war. And yet it was still to go on for four years, increasing all the time the exasperation of the public.This film is still slightly slow but it is stampeding away in 1971. That was an action film and it had to be fast, though it is here more endurance than speed, and yet many of the tricks that were to develop in the next decades were already there short sequences edited in clean cut ellipses. The camera did not have any time and energy to waste to give small descriptive details but it emphasized the successive moments in the action, even at times in a nearly impossible sequence, like Inspector Harry climbing to the top of the high building from which the serial killer had shot his first victim in less time than it took the coroner's team to wrap up the body of the victim and take it off the crime scene. Here the editing ellipse with Harry at the top point of the building and the body of the victim being removed makes it look extremely fast and meaningful.But this film is the matrix for many films to come that expose the inability of elected personnel, on both the police side and the political side, and even the judicial side, to understand that some urgent revision of police procedures has to be worked out &#x96; out of a magician's hat if necessary &#x96; that would at the same time respect judicial and legal procedures, empower the police to respond to such criminals at top speed, and protect the public against such criminals who cannot be saved in anyway because they like &#x96; sorry some of them do love &#x96; killing. From this obvious point to the idea that they have to be killed on the spot while committing a crime there is only one small step that is often climbed or taken in the heat of action. But we can be sure this film was the matrix of what was to become very popular detective &#x96; or rather nowadays police &#x96; series. Colombo is out and CSI or NCIS are in. And then you can work on details with Dexter or Criminal Minds and Bones. But it is always the same idea these serial killers have to be neutralized at best &#x96; or worst &#x96; and eliminated from society at worst &#x96; or at best. For Inspector Harry the second option is the only one. Since then a lot of thinking has been done and particularly we have understood that such serial killers may be psychopaths or sociopaths, but they are necessarily super intelligent and they cannot be considered as intellectually underdeveloped, let alone handicapped or differently abled if you prefer.That's probably why Clint Eastwood will come back to that character four more times over the next seventeen years.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU ","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"1 February 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is the absolute matrix for a series of four more films with and by Clint Eastwood as well as a new way to deal with the problem of extreme crime and both the police answer and the political lack of courage in front of this emerging serial killing practice. We are in 1971 before the emergence of profiling that will come from the FBI in Quantico. So both police departments (led by elected sheriffs or marshals) and political personnel, like mayors and district attorneys, do not know what to do with such criminals and they tend to take a conservative stance hiding behind the very famous Miranda (the tree hiding the forest) and treating the crimes separately, hence erasing the serial dimension.

However, its purely psychological, more to say, psychoanalytical appeal, truly makes us, viewers, voyeurs into the mind of the protagonist. That 'psychoanalytical' element made the movie not so much popular at the time of its release but makes it far more convincing nowadays. Fernando F Croce memorably points out that Viewed from the safe distance of four decades after its release, MARNIE, perhaps even more than THE BIRDS, emerges as the director's definitive late-period masterpiece. In that manner, we discover most remarkably the prolific and prophetic Hitchcock. Where is it best manifested? Viewing this film still brings its viewers into an unbelievable experience thanks to its protagonist, Marnie, played by Tippi Hedren, the star in THE BIRDS but a shabby substitute for Grace Kelly (Fernando F Croce). If the princess of Monaco could have played the role or not is not of such significance nowadays. What remains crucial is how Ms Hedren portrays her unbelievably complex, sophisticated character, how she handles the considerably psychedelic states of mind and helps viewers not only watch her on the screen but get into her world. Croce moves further in that respect observing that everything under the camera's scrutiny becomes a potential element of the heroine's subjective unreality. Nevertheless, we could argue to what extent the camera aids the great manifestation of a character, a tormented character that did not have a double before. Ms Hedren does a splendid job in keeping us alert, making us attempt to figure out the complications of her mind as well as the haunting past. In that respect, she greatly aids Mr Hitchcock while highlighting the powerful association of criminality with violence and sex (with reference to Charles Ramirez Berg's article on Alfred Hitchcock. There also lies fear which Emily Cleaver in THE GUARDIAN finely addresses saying that the fear here, does not lie in BIRDS but the fear and anxiety are in Marnie's past, invisible even to her. Sean Connery as Mark, her doctor and her husband is a wonderful leading man from a purely psychological standpoint. Not at all any romantic leading man! He is unlike any other leading man in both the contemporary understanding and other Hitchcock's movies. Perhaps, here there was also the reason why the film was not that popular initially. There is no love story as we get, for instance, in SUSPICION or NOTORIOUS. Here, we get a much more thought provoking situation where the past really haunts and where the complications of human mind can be cured by true discovery, understanding and patience in a relationship. It is interesting to note that the 'rape scene' was substituted by a scene of certain submission and reflection, where, partly deliberately and partly coincidentally, sex and desire gave way to reason. In years, it also works better.The character who appears here as a 'rival' so to say or, perhaps, a dominant female presence is Lil, Mark's sister (palyed with skillfully sensual undertones by Diane Baker). Her duality and coldness are perfectly delivered by Ms Baker who plays her role with ease and desirable distance combined with suspicion.The beautifully memorable sequences in the film as well as many details to which Hitchcock paid particular attention constitute another great merit of MARNIE. The scenes with the safe, the great hunting sequence, the use of red that plays a significant role in the storyline and Marnie's mind, the famous camera movement at the public event that bears resemblance to NOTORIOUS, the image of her mother's flat at Baltimore are just a few examples derived fro Hitchcock's early experience with German Expressionism. Yes, MARNIE, though made almost half a century later than the German Expressionism actually saw its heyday, is an expressionist movie.Some people call MARNIE Hitchcock's last great film.

For my money, it's a masterpiece in its genre. Comedy is a lot like music. It requires timing, choreography, and expertise to look effortless. That Old Feeling is the product of a master &#x96; director Carl Reiner &#x96; and it shows in every gesture, every beat, every scene. That Old Feeling is smart, witty, bubbly, bouncy, sharp and sweet from first scene to last. That Old Feeling doesn't make much sense; it isn't supposed to. It's supposed to make you laugh and feel romantic and good about life, and it does. Anyone, of any age, could see this movie and feel, afterward, that they could walk out the door and stumble across the love of their life. Though I've watched this movie several times, I still laugh out loud at favorite gags. Molly (Paula Marshall) a straight-laced twenty-something, is marrying Keith (James Denton), a ridiculously handsome politician's son. Molly's divorced parents have not seen each other for years. Lily (Bette Midler) is an actress. Dan (Dennis Farina) is a writer. They hate each other. They, in turn, are married to Alan (David Rasche) a therapist and self-help author, and Rowena (Gail O'Grady) an interior decorator. Lily is being chased by Joey (Danny Nucci) a paparazzi. The rules of the bedroom farce genre are that a roundelay of characters must rapidly pair off in unlikely ways, their pairings interspersed with improbable plot devices and lots of slamming doors and aghast hands to faces as couplings are discovered. That's pretty much all that happens in That Old Feeling, right up until the very last moments of the movie. It's no small feat that Reiner keeps all these juggled balls bobbing compellingly in the air. It's all funny and sexy and smart, but it's also actually pretty deep. That Old Feeling, like all good bedroom farces, comments on love and hate and attraction, commitment, fidelity, and adultery, and on relationship trade-offs. All of the characters in this film are likable and they are all flawed. If character X ends up with potential partner Y, she will gain in one area of her life, but lose in another. Charm v stability. Passion v consistency. Love\/hate v security. The exciting unknown v the old reliable. Every performance is terrific. Bette Midler is, well, Bette Midler. She's never been better than she is here. I often find her over-the- top but here she is just the right amount of the Divine Miss M. David Rasche, a former member of the Second City troupe, makes me laugh every time he is on screen as the therapist and self-help author. He's every bit as funny as Will Ferrell. Danny Nucci is appropriately sleazy and scruffy and he is also wonderful after his transformation via wet fingers and another man's jacket. Dennis Farina is amazingly, wonderfully hot as an arrogant, macho guy who gets what he wants by waving large bills between his fingers under the noses of hotel staff. I could go through the whole cast but suffice it to say that every performance is funny, tender, human, and expert. One of the lovely plusses of That Old Feeling. It depicts people over fifty having sex and enjoying it. I watch this movie over and over because I love the signature of a master's hand in every scene. In the opening scene, a man proposes marriage to a woman. In the background, there is a bouquet of flowers. The flowers are on screen for less than a minute, but they are lit so beautifully it takes my breath away. It's that kind of meticulous attention to detail that makes a movie worth watching for me.

All of the characters in this film are likable and they are all flawed. If character X ends up with potential partner Y, she will gain in one area of her life, but lose in another. Charm v stability. Passion v consistency. Love\/hate v security. The exciting unknown v the old reliable. Every performance is terrific. Bette Midler is, well, Bette Midler. She's never been better than she is here. I often find her over-the- top but here she is just the right amount of the Divine Miss M. David Rasche, a former member of the Second City troupe, makes me laugh every time he is on screen as the therapist and self-help author. He's every bit as funny as Will Ferrell. Danny Nucci is appropriately sleazy and scruffy and he is also wonderful after his transformation via wet fingers and another man's jacket. Dennis Farina is amazingly, wonderfully hot as an arrogant, macho guy who gets what he wants by waving large bills between his fingers under the noses of hotel staff. I could go through the whole cast but suffice it to say that every performance is funny, tender, human, and expert. One of the lovely plusses of That Old Feeling. It depicts people over fifty having sex and enjoying it. I watch this movie over and over because I love the signature of a master's hand in every scene. In the opening scene, a man proposes marriage to a woman. In the background, there is a bouquet of flowers. The flowers are on screen for less than a minute, but they are lit so beautifully it takes my breath away. It's that kind of meticulous attention to detail that makes a movie worth watching for me.

Because of this recording I made back then, I memorized the lyrics to all the songs, and most of the dialogue. When the VHS tape came out, I bought it, and right now I'm watching the remastered DVD on my wide-screen high def TV. I've also seen the movie in theatres a couple of times over the years. You'd think after all that, I'd be tired of it. No way. It's hard to say what makes this movie magical. So many people have written about it, here, I don't have much to add. One of those times I saw it in a theatre, I was walking up the aisle behind a couple of young guys and one of them was saying he had never seen Bing Crosby before. I thought he was fantastic, he said. What a charming guy! Try to picture this film with someone other than Bing in the lead. It's the only time Bing and Danny Kaye did a movie together, and the only reason is that Donald O'Connor fell ill and the replacements considered - reportedly, Fred Astaire and Bob Hope - weren't available. Yet Bing and Danny make a really compatible team. It's too bad they never tried another musical together.The casting just works. Think about how it wouldn't work at all if Bing had been paired with Vera Ellen, or Danny with Rosemary Clooney. Bing and Rosie got together on several albums as well as a radio series and later a concert tour. Their personalities and voices go so well together. And Danny and Vera had been together on the screen before, too. Dean Jagger is perfect as General Waverly, as is Mary Wickes as his housekeeper, Emma Allen.And the script is great! The plot may be thin but when the dialogue is as smart, sharp and with-it as this is, a fussy, complicated plot only gets in the way. This is a musical, after all. Norman Krasna, plus the writing-producing-directing team of Norman Panama and Melvin Frank (employed here only as writers), give the stars so many good lines! And these pros do such a fine job of making it all seem very natural and like it was all happening for the first time. Rosie proves she has acting as well as singing talent - watch how she listens and reacts in the most spontaneous way. And, like Bing, she had a marvelous speaking voice as well as a singing voice. Since Danny Kaye replaced another actor, he doesn't have as much of his usual shtick to do and, more interestingly, he doesn't play as neurotic or offbeat a character as he usually did. Just a regular guy, for once. He's still very funny, but he's more of a charming, good-looking leading man. And even though he is, technically, the second lead, he's just as strong as Bing and therefore doesn't seem like he's in support at all. It's his picture too.Vera-Ellen doesn't actually have all that much dialogue compared to the other three leads, but she does make her scenes count, has a believable relationship with Clooney as her older sister (Rosemary was actually younger), and is clever with Kaye. Her dancing is of course terrific, and she gets several numbers, with either Kaye or John Braccia (who seems to have been hired when Donald O'Connor was out), or both. Watching this so many times, I've started to notice a few errors in continuity. For instance, when Bob and Phil get on the train and are told by the conductor there are no more beds to be had, but they're welcome to purchase tickets and sit up all night in the club car. Then they pass the drawing room that was going to be theirs until Phil gave the tickets to the Haynes sisters. The Haynes sisters are in it. The boys then proceed to the club car, the Haynes sisters join them for some food, and a song (Snow)...and the next scene is in Vermont. The next morning? And we now see the interior a sleeper car, Phil and Bob entering, with Betty and Judy getting ready to leave their bunks, having spent the night in an upper and a lower! How did they get there? What happened to the drawing room? Did Bob and Phil end up back in it, rather than staying up in the club car? If so, how did the Haynes sisters score bunks, when there were none available on the train to begin with? Seems like they cut out a scene. Of course it doesn't make sense either than Phil has packed, and is now wearing, a long a furry coat, winter hat, long underwear, etc. He didn't get to purchase any of this stuff before boarding the train in Florida. But don't think too hard about it. As Alfred Hitchcock often said, It's only a movie. Anyway, this one is beautifully staged and directed, with melodious songs by Irving Berlin (including maybe his last great one, the gorgeous Count Your Blessings), fantastic Edith Head costumes, and terrific orchestrations by Van Cleave. All filmed in crisp VistaVision and Technicolor. What are you waiting for?

It's not quite Son of Sam, the nickname of the serial killer the movie is ostensibly about. It's also an abbreviation for SOS, as in mayday. These are on purpose. Spike Lee centers a movie about paranoia, changing times, metaphorical dog collars, war, post trauma, stress, sexual revolutions, disco vs punk and scapegoats into one electric, charged, throbbing explosion of a movie. It's a bit indulgent, maybe doesn't completely add up, and isn't quite perfect in its period detail (enough about this particular punk scene being a year or two off, this is art!).The film revolves around these murders because they represent another movement in American history. One in which the hangover from Vietnam is finally fading, and what's left is the feeling that we have been used and abused. Like dogs, wearing the collar. Adrien Brody's punk rocker represents this rebellion against the collar, against the causeless wars and manipulation. Punk, gay and uninterested in conformity. John Leguizamo (with a performance that questions how he never quite became the star he should have been), still wears the collar, refuses to treat his wife properly and sleeps around. He treats her as an object to be on a pedestal, not one to be shamed and used like all those other free love types.This PTSD serial killer is hearing orders from a dog wearing its collar (literally, in one of a couple surreal sequences that clearly establish this film as metaphor and fever dream), just like Nam' and he can't stop killing. So blame the punks, the gays, the unorthodox priests, anyone but the master. You gotta fight the powers that be.
