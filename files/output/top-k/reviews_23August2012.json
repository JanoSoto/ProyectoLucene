She would not mind at all if the bandit killed her husband. This echoed a melodramatic scene from my own life that knocked me for a loop for decades, so it really punched.You hear the story via the bandit, the wife, the husband's ghost and the woodcutter.

It is also quite hard to figure out the motive for the various lies. This movie will keep people puzzling for decades to come.

Compared to the other hits Disney already had (such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) this was an interesting choice of a story to adapt. From what I've heard, and not actually reading the novel, its quite a dark book almost even sadistic. And yet the movie pulls off a lot of the dark tone with say the part where all the boys get turned into donkeys on Pleasure Island. We never see them saved or rescued in anyway which leaves an unsettling feeling about what's going to happen to them. Geppetto's character to me was done quite well. You can feel how lonely the old man is and how much you want his wish to come true. He has energy, laughs, and I think he deserved more screen time. Also I must say that the animation for the Blue Fairy looks amazing. Its done in an older type style and looks much less cartoonish. And this brings me to the bad stuff. The rest of the animation is okay usual Disney standard, but after seeing the wonderful work done on the Blue Fairy it makes me wish the whole movie was done in this style. Next, Jiminy Cricket isn't that great of a role model, he warns against temptation but the only reason he's Pinocchio's conscience is because of temptation. Although he does sing a great song that shaped the image of Disney for years to come, and won an Oscar for Best Song, When You Wish Upon A Star. Lastly, I just found the character design for Pinocchio a bit boring in my opinion. Overall I found watching it again after all this time, for what the story was it wasn't bad. It had some likable characters and some good animation but in the end I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I used to.

Whenever I'm done with one story I always wait in anticipation for the next and I'm always wondering what will happen next, this sequel didn't disappoint me yeah I know I'm probably in the minority on this but I think this is a really good if criminally underrated sequel.There are just a lot of things I really like about it the fact the script is written by one of my favorite comic book writers Frank Miller. I've read the graphic novel which was based on his original idea of the sequel, that version I felt was better despite not being made. But I still really like this sequel all the same I think it's good in it's own way, I consider this sequel scenario B in my book.But getting down more to the jist of it, The score is great, I love the new theme of Robocop there is slightly more light touch to it where it still has that epic heroic tone but also slight comic book sensibility to it.I like the really really dark setting, we see that OCP has really fraked up bad, Detroit City practically looks like Hell on Earth, everything is just completely out of control there is crime left and right, let alone one too many lawbreakers enough to give Robo a field day. The fact that the cops are on strike unfortunately give big crime organizations an edge.I love the use of satire and humor which another of the best things about the franchise. From the commercials my favorite one is the Magna Volt commercial with host John Glover, yeah I'd get that security system for my car. Another was seeing Robocop reprogrammed into being a Dudley Do Right like character, it was both surreal and hilarious but was a satire on the fallibility of censorship and pacifism.The parallel between both the criminal organization and OCP just like in the first is still there, the goal is the same to make money lots of it, despite how many lives they destroy in the process. But it's also to make things better even though they overlook the flaw in their ambitions. Cain's ambition is to bring Paridise to the world despite how hazardous his Nuke substance is, OCP's is to build Delta City despite how nice the plan looks it also means neighborhoods would be torn down and even businesses would be shut down or bought out. There is even a couple of moment that cement the parallel when there is a Nuke case labeled Made in America Cain then says, Were going to make that mean something again. And of course the same label is brought up again by the Old Man in the grand presentation scene and he says the same thing. I feel that just shows how Greed is a narcotic.Characters are good. Robocop is still well Robocop, giving criminals exactly what they deserve. As well as Anne Lewis, I like that she gets to do a bit more action this time. And I even like the new villains Cain (played well by Tom Nonnan) whom is really creepy and despite really smart is also completely wacko from his Messiah complex. However the one villain I really like that I thought stole the show was Hob (Gabrel Damon) Cain's heir\/apprentice I think. He's awesome and just a darkly fun and funny villain. From his foul mouthed charisma, leadership skills, but I love that weapon of his the collapsible Uzi. That wouldn't work in real life but it's fun to think it could.The special effects as usual are awesome, there is no CGI. I love the use of model and stop motion effects. As well as some of the gore effects and chirography. The highlight and payoff no doubt is the final fight between both Robocop and Robocop 2, it was just awesome it's one of my favorite battles ever because of it's unrelenting intensity and it's variation in arenas of battle, almost like a battle in a Shonen Anime. It's sort of like a Transformers battle because this is two robots against one another, well OK there was ED-209 in the first film, but Robocop 2 I feel is a match for Robo, I love the design of Robocop 2, from the capabilities, it's size which makes it intimidating, and certain features like his head which looks like an Nazi Gustapo Helmet which in a way implies irony. But anyway practically all hell breaks loose both are just their just shooting the crap out of each other, they go though walls and floors, it even goes to the city streets of Detroit, cops are joining in the fight, there are explosions and multiple casualties it's just completely crazy but awesome.The only misfire of the film is in that scene where both Alex Murphy\/Robocop and his wife Elen have a meeting, that scene did nothing for the film and just felt like one that should of been deleted, since the film wasn't even going to bother tackling Robo's human dilemma like in the first film why even have it at all.Robocop 2 despite not as good as the first it still has enough firepower to get the job done.Rating 3 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the things I love about Superhero sagas are that they are always open to continuation.

But it does has its moments, like when Bambi's mom first enters the meadow, the suspense just builds to an incredible amount and the animation on her copies a deer's movements down to the bone. All in all the beginning has its moments that tie it together well enough, but it's the second half that makes the movie. I loved it as a kid and I still love it now, it is near perfect.

The director, who also made The Innocents which is another favorite horror movie of mine, knows how to craft an image. The acting is all good. Mr. Dark, Jonathan Pryce, is my favorite, stepping out as the evil carnival owner just a scant few years away from Brazil, even though I never knew him in this movie until it was pointed out to me.

The scene with Mr. Dark tearing out pages in a book to show Will's father's life passing by is wonderful, in fact, Jonathan Pryce, does a bit of a running monologue for the most part and makes it believable.

The movie was well-produced, well-paced, and well-acted, so I'm not faulting it on its technical merits. It's all perspective, and I know that. Some fool on here said the thing was all about power and control and anti- Semitism among WASPS, which simply doesn't scan at all to me and seems to indicate that some people really want to see things how they always see them anyway. The problem that I have with the movie is that pretty much the entire thing revolves around 'embarrassment humor'. Quite simply, I empathized with Greg's character enough that I didn't like watching him get beat on for nearly two hours, watching him make things worse for himself by being both stupid and pathetic, and then have a five minute resolution at the end that makes it all 'worth it'. It's just not funny to me. Rather, it's about the last thing I want to subject myself to, especially in the guise of a comedy. Some people enjoy this kind of thing, I guess because they're glad it isn't them or can think back to a time it WAS them and be glad it's over. Don't get me wrong, there needs to be some tension in any film and the risk of embarrassment works very well, even for me, in moderate doses. But this wasn't moderate. Watching 'The Passion of the Christ' is less painful for me, because as I see it, physical pain happens. This kind of social pain is more unjust.Good scenes? The cat milking discussion was hilarious. The lie detector scene was fun. The resolution at the end was far from adequate, but still a good scene. DeNiro is a far better comic actor than he's given credit for, and Stiller has made much of his career by being victimized by various forces on screen, so of course he does it well. It was just overload as far as I'm concerned.

His fascination with everything, even the 24-hour hot\/cold running water, gave him a childlike innocence.The Baron bounced between being a friend, lover, thief and backstabber. He was well played by John Barrymore, though I felt his character's storyline was concluded too conveniently.Thank the Stars for a Great Entertainment screamed the tag-line...I reckon If These Walls Could Talk would be a much better tag line for this film, as the hotel itself would be the only character who would know all that went on. There again it's 1932, just say Greta Garbo or Joan Crawford and you've filled enough cinemas to pay for it all. Even today, seeing all those stars together in one film makes it well worth watching.Overall it was good fun to watch though it didn't really flow smoothly or come to a decent conclusion.

And to be honest I still really like it. It takes an angle to the character which is new but also the same. He is treated like a superhero which is where superhero origins tend to get inspiration from. But it got down one of the parts of superhero's often ignored, that heroes are no longer just heroes but they are icons. With taking the superhero angle to Hercules it goes with it great. Next up is the animation. It's a very different style for Disney and it works and looks great sometimes, but then other times it doesn't fit the story at all. Like when he fights the CG Hydra, alone the hydra doesn't look that great or fits in, but all the different angles and creative turns it makes looks quite good. The comedy still works good but in say 10 years it will probably wear off. And finally the songs. This is where the movie works and doesn't work. I think the songs sung by the characters are alright nothing great in the end though. But the whole gospel song style that the goddesses sing to tell the story, well I enjoy the type of music but it does not belong in a story about Hercules, and leads all in all a disappointing soundtrack. Now I've read some other opinions on this movie and they were all pretty negative. And I must say I think for me this movie is a guilty pleasure and the my nostalgia blocks out most of the problems. But looking at this movie with a clean slate, I must say Disney could have done a better job in the end.

It didn't go over well at the box office to say the least. But in my opinion this has to be one of my favourites. It is by far the darkest Disney has gone, in my opinion at least, with their animated movies. All these adult themes such as lust and sin. But as usual lets start with the good things. The first thing I noticed is how great the animation looked. Just as with The Lion King it felt so grand and big, to a giant scale. It looks great all the time and the buildings, especially Notre Dame all look fantastic and Gothic mingle in with beautiful visuals such as the sun setting across the river. Quasimodo is a very likable character (although his singing voice could use work) and proves himself to the people of Paris in the end. Esmeralda is also pretty likable and designed very well, and Phoebus can be likable at times but it seems like they should have spent more time on his character for him to be really interesting. Frollo is most definitely one of Disney's greatest villains. He is not exactly a priest but he sets out to rid Paris of sin along with the gypsies. But he grows a liking for Esmeralda confusing his sense of justice as he learns how he must have her, which leads to the best song in the movie, Hellfire which is also one of my favourite Disney songs. It mixes all the No no's in Disney movies such as lust, the church, sense of judgement, and eternal damnation. Also the choir and orchestral parts in this movie always sound so epic and beautiful. But this also brings me to the bad stuff, mostly contained in two things. Except for what I mentioned about the soundtrack already the other songs are very bland and forgettable. The other is the comedy relief, the Gargoyles of Notre Dame, I just don't find them funny except for a few chuckles here and there and the movie could have done without them, and that's sad since Jason Alexander voiced one of them and he's normally quite hilarious. So in the end I found this movie even a better watch now then when I was young. Its one of the best and I highly recommend it.

It is by far the darkest Disney has gone, in my opinion at least, with their animated movies. All these adult themes such as lust and sin. But as usual lets start with the good things. The first thing I noticed is how great the animation looked. Just as with The Lion King it felt so grand and big, to a giant scale. It looks great all the time and the buildings, especially Notre Dame all look fantastic and Gothic mingle in with beautiful visuals such as the sun setting across the river. Quasimodo is a very likable character (although his singing voice could use work) and proves himself to the people of Paris in the end. Esmeralda is also pretty likable and designed very well, and Phoebus can be likable at times but it seems like they should have spent more time on his character for him to be really interesting. Frollo is most definitely one of Disney's greatest villains. He is not exactly a priest but he sets out to rid Paris of sin along with the gypsies. But he grows a liking for Esmeralda confusing his sense of justice as he learns how he must have her, which leads to the best song in the movie, Hellfire which is also one of my favourite Disney songs. It mixes all the No no's in Disney movies such as lust, the church, sense of judgement, and eternal damnation. Also the choir and orchestral parts in this movie always sound so epic and beautiful. But this also brings me to the bad stuff, mostly contained in two things. Except for what I mentioned about the soundtrack already the other songs are very bland and forgettable. The other is the comedy relief, the Gargoyles of Notre Dame, I just don't find them funny except for a few chuckles here and there and the movie could have done without them, and that's sad since Jason Alexander voiced one of them and he's normally quite hilarious. So in the end I found this movie even a better watch now then when I was young. Its one of the best and I highly recommend it.

Each day I find myself quoting The Crow at least a dozen times. Usually people just give me strange looks. Sometimes (like when I say, I got stabbed! I shot the sonnovabitch! I watched the bullet hole close by itself. And then my business gets blown up real good. Other than that, my day sucked!) people call security on me.This movie is a one-of-a-kind. It's grunge, it's goth, it's dark, it's funny, it's touching and it's inspiring... even if it merely inspires you to slap mime makeup on your face and walk the streets at night yelling, I guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy, huh SKANK?!!Seriously, as Roger Ebert said, it's an experience. Even though the plot is pretty straightforward (rockstar gets killed & comes back from the grave to seek revenge), it's done in a way that keeps you riveted every minute. The same way Peewee's Big Adventure is just about a guy looking for his bike, The Crow takes the same approach of using a minimalist plot and coating it in heaps of style, music and surreal visuals. Except The Crow has a few dozen more murders than Peewee.What makes this film a visual feast is the way it stylistically mirrors the comic book that inspired it. Like the comic, it's very monochrome... almost black & white, but with some icy tints to it. It has a very wet look to it, making it seem glossy and muted at the same time. Like another favourite film of mine City of Lost Children, it achieves a certain vivid appearance even though the colour palette is very limited.As far as action flicks go, this is quite a literary extravaganza. Quotes from Poe's The Raven, Milton's Paradise Lost, Thackeray's Vanity Fair and who knows what else, lend an air of classiness and antiquity to the film. And of course the movie generates its own memorable quotes. Like Greed is for amateurs. Disorder, chaos, anarchy... now that's fun! Paired with an entertaining script full of great zingers, the acting is first rate all around. Each & every character, no matter how large or minor, delivers a memorable performance. Of course Brandon Lee is the standout, playing the cold-hearted, vengeful killer but with a gentleness that makes you want to take him home to meet your folks. Conversely, the bad guys are brutal but so comic you can't help but love them.A word about Brandon's death... yes, it's true that he was killed by a malfunctioning prop gun during the apartment scene. But that reel of film was reportedly destroyed by the director. The movie still had several scenes that needed to be filmed, and the director compensated by recycling other scenes with some very interesting effects. For example, when Brandon punches the mirror, it's actually a double punching the mirror with Brandon's reflection (from another scene) digitally imposed on the glass. Tricks like that are not obvious, and they add a certain otherworldly feel to the movie. It also makes the film feel more fragmented and incomplete (in a good way), leaving more to the imagination. If you're like me and you hate movies that over-explain everything, the minimalistic presentation of The Crow will be right up your alley.Lastly, the music. If you were alive & remotely cool in the 90s you'll love the soundtrack. The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, Violent Femmes, Stone Temple Pilots, Henry Rollins, the list goes on...If you're familiar with the director Alex Proyas, you'll recognize this as possibly his greatest work (alongside Dark City, Garage Days and some great, surreal music videos like Sting All This Time). The feel of The Crow is also reminiscent of director Frank Miller's work (The Spirit, Sin City). And although I haven't seen it, I've heard the Batman film Dark Knight pays tribute to this film, particularly Heath Ledger's Joker who is hauntingly close to Brandon Lee's character. If you like artsy movies, this fits right in, reminding me of Jean Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen) and the darker side of Tim Burton (Sweeny Todd). Maybe there's even a bit of Blade Runner thrown in.If you get a chance, see The Crow on a rainy night with all the lights off. Lose yourself in the mood, the music and the memory of Brandon, the greatest star who never was. Halloween is coming up, so get your favourite Crow costume ready. If you live in a sheltered town like mine, chances are nobody will recognize who you're supposed to be. Although quite a few people think I'm Edward Scissorhands who is also pretty cool, so whatever...
