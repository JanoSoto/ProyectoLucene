It's also the driving essence of the film - from the mechanical thrumm of the industry nearby, to the singing radiator and to the baby crying continuously.Against this aural assault, in the grimy black and white of Lynch's darkest psyche, lie layer upon layer of absurdities and creepy oddities. Setting the scene is the tiny, claustrophobic room that the weirdly- haircutted Henry Spence (Jack Nance) inhabits, along with all its creepy idiosyncrasies, like the radiator that sings to him.Henry's girlfriend, Mary X lives with him and Henry gives her a child. This creature, partly the alien coming out of John Hurt's stomach in 'Alien' and half 'Little Otik', the tree-based part baby, part log from the Czech semi-animated film of the same name, could compete as the ugliest single thing you've ever seen. And win, no question.It demands constant attention but Mary X is too emotionally drained to look after it and so leaves Henry with the little, VERY ugly mite. Then it gets some sort of disease which made it look ten times uglier and horrific. From then on, it just seemed to get more and more weird, with more and more disturbing images.From about a third way in, I was questioning not just whether I actually wanted to watch this film now, but at all.

Any chance of being surprised at the ending is ruined because spoilers have long since become common knowledge. I knew who Keyser Söze was way before I ever bothered to hunt down the movie. Of course, if you're reading this there's a possibility you haven't seen the film and, on the off chance you've somehow managed to avoid exposure to the oft-spoiled ending, I won't mention it here. I'm just here to explain if I enjoyed it, which I did for the most part. The movie is your conventional crime drama with a strong cast and some sharp writing that prevent it from fading into obscurity. It begins in the aftermath of a boat explosion where three career criminals were killed and evidence of a rumored multimillion dollar drug deal is no where to be found. What brought these criminals together and what went wrong on that boat? Only one man might hold the answers Verbal Kint, a smalltime criminal with cerebral palsy and one of only two survivors from the botched operation. In an interrogation with Agent Kujan of US Customs, Kint will explain how it all came together how five con-men with their own agendas were brought together with the help of a police lineup and eventually found themselves employed by the mysterious Keyser Söze. But the question remains, who is Keyser Söze?Having seen this movie so long after it originally hit, I've got to say wow, it feels dated. When I was watching it, it consistently screamed 90's. The editing, the cinematography, just the overall style is firmly planted in the decade. In a sense, it kind of sucks. As much as I've heard and read about the movies over the years, I guess I expected something with a little more of it's own style. It doesn't detract overwhelmingly from the movie. It's still a solid story with a great cast of characters, but it's just visually unimpressive. It's a pretty basic premise for a movie and I think it was the twist ending that grabbed a lot of people's attentions. Really, it's not so much a twist because it didn't really have that much of a bearing on the story. Looking back, the big revelation could've involved any character and it wouldn't really have been any different. It makes the ending memorable, sure, especially the means in which it was accomplished during the interrogation. That much was cool, no doubt. Christopher McQuarrie has since gone on to prove himself a capable enough screenwriter and his nonlinear storytelling keeps the movie intriguing (even when, in my case, you know how it ends beforehand). I suppose the best thing to come from this movie was director Bryan Singer's first major success. I can't imagine he would've been able to bring his vision of X-MEN to life if he hadn't knocked this one out of the park with audiences.Going in, I knew Kevin Spacey was in the film and, as anyone who's even seen Kevin Spacey in a film can attest, he's guaranteed to be awesome. And he was. He brings his best in every role he adopts, and Verbal Kint is no different. Kint is a strange man, seemingly small time compared to the situation he's found himself in but you can't help but feel there's more to his character. Speaking of characters, let's go back to how I mentioned the overwhelming 90's vibe and take a moment to bring up the cast. If this cast doesn't feel ripped right out of the decade, I don't know what does Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, comedian (with a penchant for dramatic roles) Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, and (I kid you not) Stephen Baldwin. To be fair, Del Toro has gone on to continuing success in his career and I love his character, Fenster. Del Toro has admitted that Fenster only serves the movie as a plot device about halfway through and took the opportunity to have a little fun with it, giving him near indecipherable speech that steals scenes from the heavyweight performances going on around him. These guys make for an interesting, if eclectic, bunch. Byrne is great as the movie's hero. His character, Dean Keaton, is a formerly crooked cop who's gone straight but finds himself reeled back into the world of crime. Even Baldwin does well here.

There are few jumps, cheep thrills, and excessive gore. Instead, the film is eerily slow and full of tension. This mostly comes from the way the film is shot. Almost all of the sets are filmed in darkness, and the alien itself gets little screen time. This causes the viewer to feel unsure of the monsters whereabouts, much as the characters would feel.ACTING 8.5\/10The acting in this movie is good. The cast gives life to likable characters, something sorely missing from more recent horror films. There are no standouts however, and the actors have great chemistry. WRITING 10\/10The most well written horror film of all time. The plot is slow and dark, frighteningly so. The evolution of the alien is unique, the characters are well written, and the ending is satisfying. No complaints here. DESIGN 10\/10H. R. Giger is a genius! He alone designed some of the most unsettling sets of all time. He also designed the alien itself, which may be the most frightening creature ever in film.

But the purpose of Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion is less to demonstrate the hellish than the futile nature of War. Futile because usually instigated by upper classes in the name of profit, greed and imperialism (usually disguised as patriotism) while all the working-class people share the same desire to live in peace, harmony and solidarity. The tragedy of War is to make people believe in an illusory adversity while they're equal in life &#x85; and naturally, in death. This vision of war might surprise but this is Renoir's vision, it belongs to HIS generation, who grew up with a war still conducted by gentlemen, where the purpose was admittedly to defend a country but not to turn people into killing machines. Renoir, despite his military background, loathed the zealous and dehumanizing devotion to the Army, as he said in the film's commentary, the point of showing the rifle was not to learn a series of precise movements like a robot, but just to show a goddamn clean rifle. With that in mind, we understand the soldiers' cordiality in Grand Illusion and the peculiar way they were treated by the enemy. And on that aspect, the context of the film couldn't have been more significant as Nazism, the ideology that annihilated so many pillars of European civilization, hadn't undermined yet Renoir's nostalgic feeling; Germans were still 'good enemies'. We can assume that a film like Grand Illusion could never have been made after World War II although it's the very conflict that highlighted the film's prophetic value. Indeed, Grand Illusion belongs to the Greats, it was Orson Welles' favorite movie and it has always been compared to the glorious Citizen Kane in terms of impact on the field of filmmaking, as one of the first truly humanistic dramas. But as odd as it sounds, it's not to Citizen Kane that I feel like comparing Grand Illusion but to another masterpiece named Gone With the Wind. Grand Illusion is also about an Order, a 'Civilization of Chivalry and Gallantry' forever gone. It is the swan song of the Old Europe that died with World War I, and which is incarnated by two characters Pierre Fresnay as Captain De Boeldieu captured by the Germans with Lieutenant Maréchal, and Erich Von Stroheim as the iconic Von Rauffenstein. De and Von are the two prefixes that define the European aristocracy and both Boeldieu and Rauffenstein realize during the lunch following the capture, that they have many acquaintances and are familiar with the same things. Maréchal, the blue-collar officer played by a young and handsome Jean Gabin, is more down to earth and engages an even friendlier exchange with a German alter ego.The lunch scene sets up the tone of the film where the relationships between French, Russian and British prisoners and the German soldiers flirt so much with a 'comedy of manners' that it puts the whole meaning of 'War' into perspective. Renoir resisted the temptation to make a conventional war film and serves us in three distinct acts, a beautiful tale of humanity and friendship. The first act is the ancestor of all the POW movies such as The Great Escape or Stalag 17 where we'd meet a colorful gallery of French prisoners, digging a tunnel. They're well treated and sometimes eat better than their guards, thanks to Rosenthal a rich Jew, played by Marcel Dalio, who shares his goods with his fellow prisoners. Rosenthal incarnates the new wealth of France who'd ultimately be the target of the Anti-Semitism ignited by the Nazi occupation.The first act climaxes with the superb scene where a cross-gender musical number is interrupted by the announcement of the Douaumont Fort taken back by the French army, and in a patriotic outburst lead by Maréchal, the prisoners start singing La Marseillaise in a powerful and stirring moment that inspired Casablanca. The second act takes place in a fortress where Boeldieu and Maréchal, after a series of failing escapes, are affected. The part centers on the friendship between Rauffenstein and Boeldieu, two men aware that their world is about to collapse, regardless of their nationality. They speak English in the most intimate moments as to denote their similar cosmopolitanism, before a new generation would embrace modernity, for the better and for the worse. It's a poignant transition incarnated by the sacrifice of Boeldieu, playing with the flute, the famous 'steamboat' child song that relating a sacrifice story.Boeldieu's courageous act created a diversion that allowed Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape, and after this display of humanity and a poignant deathbed farewell between the two aristocrat officers, we follow Gabin and Dalio, in their struggle to cross the Swiss border, concluding in an anticlimactic way by their journey in a German farmhouse, inhabited by Elsa (Dita Parlo), a young widow and mother. They stay a while to recover from injuries and hunger until Christmas. Elsa proved to be trustful when she saved them from the German army, an act due to the fact that she also suffered from the loss of brothers, ironically, in three German victories. Victory is such an illusion when it comes to death, but it's the very illusion of borders that would save the life of Maréchal and Rosenthal when a group of German soldiers refuse to shoot them because they are in the Swiss territory. For a war movie, Grand Illusion strikes by an unusual absence of battles and fight scenes. Uniforms and brief but powerful occurrences of death remind of the historical setting but overall, Grand Illusion is an atypical war film, whose atypical message is precisely what elevated it at the rank of the greatest movies ever made. And that Joseph Goebbels named it 'Enemy Public Number 1' is probably the proof of its undeniable value.

But as odd as it sounds, it's not to Citizen Kane that I feel like comparing Grand Illusion but to another masterpiece named Gone With the Wind. Grand Illusion is also about an Order, a 'Civilization of Chivalry and Gallantry' forever gone. It is the swan song of the Old Europe that died with World War I, and which is incarnated by two characters Pierre Fresnay as Captain De Boeldieu captured by the Germans with Lieutenant Maréchal, and Erich Von Stroheim as the iconic Von Rauffenstein. De and Von are the two prefixes that define the European aristocracy and both Boeldieu and Rauffenstein realize during the lunch following the capture, that they have many acquaintances and are familiar with the same things. Maréchal, the blue-collar officer played by a young and handsome Jean Gabin, is more down to earth and engages an even friendlier exchange with a German alter ego.The lunch scene sets up the tone of the film where the relationships between French, Russian and British prisoners and the German soldiers flirt so much with a 'comedy of manners' that it puts the whole meaning of 'War' into perspective. Renoir resisted the temptation to make a conventional war film and serves us in three distinct acts, a beautiful tale of humanity and friendship. The first act is the ancestor of all the POW movies such as The Great Escape or Stalag 17 where we'd meet a colorful gallery of French prisoners, digging a tunnel. They're well treated and sometimes eat better than their guards, thanks to Rosenthal a rich Jew, played by Marcel Dalio, who shares his goods with his fellow prisoners. Rosenthal incarnates the new wealth of France who'd ultimately be the target of the Anti-Semitism ignited by the Nazi occupation.The first act climaxes with the superb scene where a cross-gender musical number is interrupted by the announcement of the Douaumont Fort taken back by the French army, and in a patriotic outburst lead by Maréchal, the prisoners start singing La Marseillaise in a powerful and stirring moment that inspired Casablanca. The second act takes place in a fortress where Boeldieu and Maréchal, after a series of failing escapes, are affected. The part centers on the friendship between Rauffenstein and Boeldieu, two men aware that their world is about to collapse, regardless of their nationality. They speak English in the most intimate moments as to denote their similar cosmopolitanism, before a new generation would embrace modernity, for the better and for the worse. It's a poignant transition incarnated by the sacrifice of Boeldieu, playing with the flute, the famous 'steamboat' child song that relating a sacrifice story.Boeldieu's courageous act created a diversion that allowed Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape, and after this display of humanity and a poignant deathbed farewell between the two aristocrat officers, we follow Gabin and Dalio, in their struggle to cross the Swiss border, concluding in an anticlimactic way by their journey in a German farmhouse, inhabited by Elsa (Dita Parlo), a young widow and mother. They stay a while to recover from injuries and hunger until Christmas. Elsa proved to be trustful when she saved them from the German army, an act due to the fact that she also suffered from the loss of brothers, ironically, in three German victories. Victory is such an illusion when it comes to death, but it's the very illusion of borders that would save the life of Maréchal and Rosenthal when a group of German soldiers refuse to shoot them because they are in the Swiss territory. For a war movie, Grand Illusion strikes by an unusual absence of battles and fight scenes. Uniforms and brief but powerful occurrences of death remind of the historical setting but overall, Grand Illusion is an atypical war film, whose atypical message is precisely what elevated it at the rank of the greatest movies ever made. And that Joseph Goebbels named it 'Enemy Public Number 1' is probably the proof of its undeniable value.

But the purpose of Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion is less to demonstrate the hellish than the futile nature of War. Futile because usually instigated by upper classes in the name of profit, greed and imperialism (usually disguised as patriotism) while all the working-class people share the same desire to live in peace, harmony and solidarity. The tragedy of War is to make people believe in an illusory adversity while they're equal in life &#x85; and naturally, in death. This vision of war might surprise but this is Renoir's vision, it belongs to HIS generation, who grew up with a war still conducted by gentlemen, where the purpose was admittedly to defend a country but not to turn people into killing machines. Renoir, despite his military background, loathed the zealous and dehumanizing devotion to the Army, as he said in the film's commentary, the point of showing the rifle was not to learn a series of precise movements like a robot, but just to show a goddamn clean rifle. With that in mind, we understand the soldiers' cordiality in Grand Illusion and the peculiar way they were treated by the enemy. And on that aspect, the context of the film couldn't have been more significant as Nazism, the ideology that annihilated so many pillars of European civilization, hadn't undermined yet Renoir's nostalgic feeling; Germans were still 'good enemies'.

Childhood and the early teen years can be a horrible period to live through and that is what 'Sleepaway Camp' is. What we have here is a nightmare about the pressures of growing up and vengefulness against bullies creating a horrible atmosphere, one strong enough to kill. For once these sex and prank crazed teens actually sort of feel real because what hunts them is a very real threat too. You kind of forget being removed from the real experience for a few years that teens only do have two things on their mind, sex and their inflated egos. And what better place to put these sick teens than summer camp? It really is a no holds barred hellish playground for teens to enact all their wildness. Camp is the perfect metaphor for growing up out of childhood. The summer brings everything to life and the boys and girls practice their budding sexual feelings with one another while still in the confines of being in a great childish place with games, swimming, and all the freedom to do it except of course the eyes of a camp counselor who themselves are young enough to let kids be kids. And yet for some there is awkwardness. They cannot get out of childhood, be they not ready mentally or physically and they stick out for bullies like a sore thumb. 'Sleepaway' captures all these elements pitch perfectly with it's young cast and locales.And that is why 'Sleepaway Camp' works, the theme of sex and blossoming maturity. I am sure if you are reading this you know the horrible secret of Angela Baker and despite it's shock value and novelty, it is a perfect device to build this type of horror film around. The chemical urges of puberty are really the building blocks for conflict and disaster. Angela Baker is warped because she has been so violated in her psychological and biological identity of herself that she cannot handle the adolescent experience offered by summer camp. Felissa Rose is very good at portraying a shy adolescent girl and this is exactly why the film is effective and why that ending is so memorable.

'Sleepaway Camp' is a memorable and effective entry in the 80's slasher pool because it takes this to heart and creates a highly memorable character with motives, mythos, and a terrible secret that drives them to be violent.What really drives me into 'Sleepaway Camp' and my recommendation of it is how well it captures the feeling of adolescence and bullying. Childhood and the early teen years can be a horrible period to live through and that is what 'Sleepaway Camp' is. What we have here is a nightmare about the pressures of growing up and vengefulness against bullies creating a horrible atmosphere, one strong enough to kill. For once these sex and prank crazed teens actually sort of feel real because what hunts them is a very real threat too. You kind of forget being removed from the real experience for a few years that teens only do have two things on their mind, sex and their inflated egos. And what better place to put these sick teens than summer camp? It really is a no holds barred hellish playground for teens to enact all their wildness. Camp is the perfect metaphor for growing up out of childhood. The summer brings everything to life and the boys and girls practice their budding sexual feelings with one another while still in the confines of being in a great childish place with games, swimming, and all the freedom to do it except of course the eyes of a camp counselor who themselves are young enough to let kids be kids. And yet for some there is awkwardness. They cannot get out of childhood, be they not ready mentally or physically and they stick out for bullies like a sore thumb. 'Sleepaway' captures all these elements pitch perfectly with it's young cast and locales.And that is why 'Sleepaway Camp' works, the theme of sex and blossoming maturity. I am sure if you are reading this you know the horrible secret of Angela Baker and despite it's shock value and novelty, it is a perfect device to build this type of horror film around. The chemical urges of puberty are really the building blocks for conflict and disaster. Angela Baker is warped because she has been so violated in her psychological and biological identity of herself that she cannot handle the adolescent experience offered by summer camp. Felissa Rose is very good at portraying a shy adolescent girl and this is exactly why the film is effective and why that ending is so memorable. We see Angela Bakers growing up and we know what drives this killer and it makes the villain tragic.
