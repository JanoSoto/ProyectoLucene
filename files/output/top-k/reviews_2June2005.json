Hearing the distinct pitch to Samuel L. Jackson's voice with that as one of the first and most memorable lines got me hooked into this film. However, it isn't the standard Tarantino-istic roller-coaster ride filled with ultra-bloody, sexist (to some degree like 'Reservoir Dogs'), and hip elements as his previous Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs had. This one feels different as if one of his buddies directed this instead and he took all the credit (which wouldn't surprise me either). For one thing, it is very slow-paced in storytelling in seventies traditional style. Even the title in the opening sequence has a Roger Corman-feel to it, but the film never seems to get over second gear. The acting and dialogue are commendable, and because of that, we seem to watch and empathize with fleshed-out, human characters. Each character seems to inhibit their own syntex (way and manner of speaking) from Jackie to Ordell, Louis to Melanie, Max and Winston, etc.I was so excited to see this film in late 1997 (but of course, my date wanted to see Titanic instead), but then heard a few weeks later that it wasn't really that good. So I missed it in the theaters and saw it on anti-climactic video, but I'm glad I did. The film seems to be overpraised at times-- being that it was a fair film, but it wasn't all that good! Now that QT's delivered us with crap like Kill Bill 1&2 (highly overrated to the point being where it's unsettling that your 60-year-old mother-in-law likes it and you don't), this movie seems to mystify me. Like the moments before the storm. I caught it again on IFC last night and I watched about 2\/3 of it, secretly I was hoping that there would be something that I missed that would fit nicely in the end. Didn't happen, though. But when Samuel was yelling at DeNiro for blasting Bridget Fonda, I was suddenly interested again. The heist was good, but once again, the pacing kept this film back from being any better.I can honestly say that Q.T. has shown a different style of film-making in him which I never thought existed. There's finally some degree of maturity in him, where I thought he would be a forever Generation X hack that would only be capable of conjuring movies like True Romance or what have you. This was once marqueed as a late show on Saturday nights for a while after it's release once upon a time. I wouldn't stay up after midnight on a Saturday to watch this-- more appropriate to view on a Wednesday afternoon double-feature (like what they used to do back in the seventies).

A character is placed in a tight, impossible predicament and yet somehow they thrive, kill all the bad guys, and everything turns out great. The films tap into our blood lust whilst simultaneously remind us that even in the darkest periods of our lives, it's possible to survive against all odds. It's comforting actually.Anyway, out of all the action films in the world today, the best one by a mile is often regarded as being Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Brilliantly acted with an evil performance by Alan Rickman, it is the ultimate action story.Aside from Bruce though, who else really is that good in action films? One film which showed that there are alternatives is this one, Under Siege. Starring the truly awful Steven Seagal, it is a brilliant film because like Die Hard you can't help but feel drawn to it. It's a classic, and rightfully so.As cook aboard an American battleship, Casey Ryback (Seagal) is more than happy to stay in his kitchen out of harms way. When an attack is made on the ship however, led by the deranged William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones), it is up to Ryback to remember his Navy Seal training and save the day once again.Steven Seagal is NOT a good actor. In fact, point blank, the guy is awful. He can't deliver a line to save his life, he has no emotion, and he's generally useless at it. One thing he is superb at though is choreographed fighting and the martial arts. Travelling through the ship shooting, stabbing and maiming the enemy, Seagal is unstoppable and always fun to watch. Out of all his films, the one example where Seagal's special skills are matched with a truly evil villain and a suitably violent plot is this film. Yes, despite Seagal ruining every line he delivers, Under Siege is really good entertainment.Just like in Die Hard, there is a fundamental reason for the brilliance of this film. Just like Alan Rickman in the other film, with Tommy Lee Jones we have a bad guy worth watching. Jones is perfect in his role as the psychotic Stranix, a man who is has been let down by the system and so wants to make a bit of money and get some revenge at the same time. He laughs, he cackles, he randomly waves his gun around, Jones is exactly what you want in a bad guy and he delivers with style.As Tommy Lee Jones' henchmen Colm Meaney and Gary Busey are both also up to the tasks put upon them. Both actors, screen regulars and quality actors in their own rights, are great as they strut around the ship, Meaney with a purpose, and Busey even more psychopathically than Jones. Combined with their leader, it is the ultimate evil trio and it works inexplicably well.Once you've considered the enemy and your main star, the one key feature behind an action film is how the enemy dies. Just like in Die Hard, Under Siege gives us a superb variety. There's the characters who just get shot, there are those who are gratuitously killed and there are those who are killed to allow a 'good' character to go through a renaissance. All different types are on display here, and it's hard not to smile as certain people meet their maker.It's hard not to like specific action films. Classic affairs like Die Hard and Under Siege. These films are the cornerstone of so many DVD collections and they are always something fun to put on when you want minimal plot and plenty of violence. In Under Siege we are given it all. We are given a woeful actor who is a lethal weapon, we are given three superb bad guys, and we are given countless different deaths. When you want to relax and satisfy your blood lust, there is little else you could possibly ask for.

Around 40 of these films, or 0,1%, are films so great, they need not only to be watched by every existing human being - but they need to dwell in the hearts of every human, at any moment, till their last breath. Terminator 2 is the first of them all.This is not only the greatest action movie, but it is the greatest movie ever made. It is a film that treats the highest possible theme in the art sphere - the theme about the self-sacrifice. In this movie everyone of the main characters sacrificed himself for somebody else. The child did it to save his mother, despite what she had told him about his importance. She did it for him and for the rest of the world. And at the end even the machine sacrificed itself, for the humankind - when it understood the value of human life and that its existence was a threat for it. The three of them did that without complaining, without expecting a reward or pretending for something. They did it because it was their duty, and they would fulfill themselves as humans by doing it. Plain, simple and genius.To the people, who are dashing pretentiously at the time paradox, and to the other ones, who moan I kinda didn't like it. I liked (place the name of ANY OTHER action movie here) more. There was more beating and explosions... - to these ones I say you have completely and tragically missed the point of T2, and as a result of this you have deprived yourselves of understanding and embracing the best film ever made into your hearts and souls. The last things Terminator 2 is about, are pseudo-scientific riddles with time, or creating the best special effects of early 90s in order to make the eyes of the riping teenagers open widely in surprise and disbelief.As I said, I will repeat again it is a movie about the personal sacrifice, the duty and the destiny of the strong ones - not the written by some unseen force destiny, which you cannot change, only follow; but the destiny of the people who have a strong character. The destiny that they CHOOSE to sacrifice themselves in order to fulfill their duty, and ultimately - their life; in order to prove themselves as humans. And they make this choice alone, on their own the weak ones would duck and cover, and run away in a similar situation.There is another character in that movie, who showed human behavior and in the end of the film - as he turned weaker and weaker from a physical point of view, due to the inevitable damage by the superior technology - became more and more human. In the last moments of the film, in one recent Bulgarian voice translation, they translated it a little bit differently, in an artistic way, and I want to translate it back and write it here, to show you what I mean. It is a TRANSLATOR HIT when the Terminator realized that it should sacrifice itself and go against its own nature, and in the moment when John started to cry, because he understood the necessity and the brutal fact that the T-800 WILL NOT OBEY HIM THIS TIME, because IT HAS TAKEN A DECISION ABOUT WHAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, T-800 said Now I know why you cry. I WISH I ALSO COULD. And then, after they hugged, HE - not IT - HE stepped on the chain. He had become human in that moment, in a certain way - as he was taking decisions on his own, and as HE HAD A WISH - a wish, that never turned into a dream, because he had to step on the chain. And if there is only one thing that I want to be remade in the original version, it's not all the goofs and inconsistencies, mentioned also in the IMDb trivia of the film - they prove that human beings, including the great directors, make mistakes - and they MUST - that's why they are human. What I dream to be changed in my favourite movie, is only this line. The line but it is something I can never do looks cold and alien to me now.It is a movie that will not be surpassed soon - because a new film needs to find a higher theme than self-sacrifice in order to do it (apart from all the rest, which is needed - a good scenario, which makes everything to cohere in perfect harmony; directing from a genius and a visionary like James Cameron; acting from people BORN FOR THE ROLE - like Linda Hamilton and Schwarzenegger; innovative, but not overdone, or with overexposed and misplaced effects; having well arranged and nicely corresponding music; and so on) - while if it uses the same theme, it will be a REPEAT. Terminator 2 was THE FIRST ONE, and THE GREATEST. And the way this film is made, the way EVERY FRAME IS SUFFERED THROUGH BY THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT, makes it both unbeatable and the epitome of all that is good and human in that world. And it is even something more it shows what we are, IT IS WHAT WE ARE. It's so universal and refined, that if aliens come and want to understand us, the humans, in the space of two hours; to find what is our basic philosophy; what our fears and problems, and aspirations are - this is what they have to see.

It is a film that treats the highest possible theme in the art sphere - the theme about the self-sacrifice. In this movie everyone of the main characters sacrificed himself for somebody else. The child did it to save his mother, despite what she had told him about his importance. She did it for him and for the rest of the world. And at the end even the machine sacrificed itself, for the humankind - when it understood the value of human life and that its existence was a threat for it. The three of them did that without complaining, without expecting a reward or pretending for something. They did it because it was their duty, and they would fulfill themselves as humans by doing it. Plain, simple and genius.To the people, who are dashing pretentiously at the time paradox, and to the other ones, who moan I kinda didn't like it. I liked (place the name of ANY OTHER action movie here) more. There was more beating and explosions... - to these ones I say you have completely and tragically missed the point of T2, and as a result of this you have deprived yourselves of understanding and embracing the best film ever made into your hearts and souls. The last things Terminator 2 is about, are pseudo-scientific riddles with time, or creating the best special effects of early 90s in order to make the eyes of the riping teenagers open widely in surprise and disbelief.As I said, I will repeat again it is a movie about the personal sacrifice, the duty and the destiny of the strong ones - not the written by some unseen force destiny, which you cannot change, only follow; but the destiny of the people who have a strong character. The destiny that they CHOOSE to sacrifice themselves in order to fulfill their duty, and ultimately - their life; in order to prove themselves as humans. And they make this choice alone, on their own the weak ones would duck and cover, and run away in a similar situation.There is another character in that movie, who showed human behavior and in the end of the film - as he turned weaker and weaker from a physical point of view, due to the inevitable damage by the superior technology - became more and more human. In the last moments of the film, in one recent Bulgarian voice translation, they translated it a little bit differently, in an artistic way, and I want to translate it back and write it here, to show you what I mean. It is a TRANSLATOR HIT when the Terminator realized that it should sacrifice itself and go against its own nature, and in the moment when John started to cry, because he understood the necessity and the brutal fact that the T-800 WILL NOT OBEY HIM THIS TIME, because IT HAS TAKEN A DECISION ABOUT WHAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, T-800 said Now I know why you cry. I WISH I ALSO COULD. And then, after they hugged, HE - not IT - HE stepped on the chain. He had become human in that moment, in a certain way - as he was taking decisions on his own, and as HE HAD A WISH - a wish, that never turned into a dream, because he had to step on the chain. And if there is only one thing that I want to be remade in the original version, it's not all the goofs and inconsistencies, mentioned also in the IMDb trivia of the film - they prove that human beings, including the great directors, make mistakes - and they MUST - that's why they are human. What I dream to be changed in my favourite movie, is only this line. The line but it is something I can never do looks cold and alien to me now.It is a movie that will not be surpassed soon - because a new film needs to find a higher theme than self-sacrifice in order to do it (apart from all the rest, which is needed - a good scenario, which makes everything to cohere in perfect harmony; directing from a genius and a visionary like James Cameron; acting from people BORN FOR THE ROLE - like Linda Hamilton and Schwarzenegger; innovative, but not overdone, or with overexposed and misplaced effects; having well arranged and nicely corresponding music; and so on) - while if it uses the same theme, it will be a REPEAT. Terminator 2 was THE FIRST ONE, and THE GREATEST. And the way this film is made, the way EVERY FRAME IS SUFFERED THROUGH BY THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT, makes it both unbeatable and the epitome of all that is good and human in that world. And it is even something more it shows what we are, IT IS WHAT WE ARE. It's so universal and refined, that if aliens come and want to understand us, the humans, in the space of two hours; to find what is our basic philosophy; what our fears and problems, and aspirations are - this is what they have to see. This film.Such a movie appears once in fifty years.

I cannot in good conscience call it a comedy, for the laughter that it causes is not a funny one, but one of sadness. You see this beautiful movie, so recent feeling half a century after it was shot, with extraordinary casting, acting, directing and attention to detail, and you recognize in it all the ugliness that resides in all humans and humanity as a whole. This movie is to be watched, seen, partially understood, then watched again and again.OK, Petter Sellers is the man in this movie. Not just a man, but at least three, as I am not sure of the soldiers that were shot from behind (by the cameras ) ). George C. Scott is great as a silly general, the rest of the cast performs great, too, although for a movie that shows so much attention to minutiae, I guess they couldn't have acted bad if they wanted to. Kubrick would not have let them.The humor is terrifying and present in almost every scene. You just have to watch this one. Just have to. One of the few movies I gave a 10 to.

I'm not saying he has had bad times as a director; I'm talking about his recognition as the pro he is. And I'm talking about the times he was overlooked, even with this movie, which is without doubt the best work he has done (or at least the best I've seen). I don't want to say what everyone says but we've seen Marty lost his Oscars with actors turned directors in those that for most people where his best movies. But many people waste a lot of time talking about those things; and I'm writing about Goodfellas. Yes, that Scorsese movie that is so his as most of his projects are. That movie, one of the few directed by Scorsese that he also wrote, in collaboration with Nicholas Pileggi; who would write with him again for Casino, a movie I haven't seen but I watched some parts and there's a clear parallel. In Casino, it's a guy talking about how the casino works; the movement. The guy works in the casino. In Goodfellas, it's a guy narrating his life as a gangster. He's a gangster, and if you don't realize at the beginning, it'll happen soon when he starts by As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster. Goodfellas is based on a true story, about characters that really existed and could have had talks with the movie's main actors. There's an unusual magic in cinema when it comes to narration; and this is one of the first movies that dealt with that. Frank Darabont was having doubts as he was writing his first feature, based on a book, as Goodfellas is. He was writing and discovered he was using a lot of narration, he was afraid it wouldn't work. Only just then he sat and watched Goodfellas again, and probably again and again&#133;The heck, he must have said. This is pure narration. Of course that movie is The Shawshank Redemption, today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts. When you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. I've recently seen Paid in full, where Ace, the main character, is telling a story. He takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. This atmosphere came before with Goodfellas, where Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. He introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. So we know that no matter what, Henry won't be dead at the ending. He'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. In Paid in full, Ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. He narrates the story; he's our hero. Goodfellas is another type of enchantment where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. Is Henry the hero because he tells the story? No; neither Jimmy or Tommy. This is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. As in Paid in full, we get to know everyone women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. This is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. The important wife role was in Lorraine Bracco's hands. Karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. This is all correctly managed in Bracco's astonishing performance. We get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like The Godfather. The man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. He's Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...In the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...It's all too big to be described.Ray Liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. Joe Pesci, with one Oscar he'll always thank to Scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. De Niro was already a pro at that time, but&#133;It is something amazing to see him in any performance. He graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. I didn't use to admire him as an actor; but I'm starting to realize, and Scorsese has a lot to do with that.With that and with everything, Marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. Again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. Sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need to&#133;It can be living the moment, or planning that violence Scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings.

Of course that movie is The Shawshank Redemption, today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts. When you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. I've recently seen Paid in full, where Ace, the main character, is telling a story. He takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. This atmosphere came before with Goodfellas, where Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. He introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. So we know that no matter what, Henry won't be dead at the ending. He'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. In Paid in full, Ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. He narrates the story; he's our hero. Goodfellas is another type of enchantment where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. Is Henry the hero because he tells the story? No; neither Jimmy or Tommy. This is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. As in Paid in full, we get to know everyone women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. This is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. The important wife role was in Lorraine Bracco's hands. Karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. This is all correctly managed in Bracco's astonishing performance. We get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like The Godfather. The man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. He's Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...In the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...It's all too big to be described.Ray Liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. Joe Pesci, with one Oscar he'll always thank to Scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. De Niro was already a pro at that time, but&#133;It is something amazing to see him in any performance. He graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. I didn't use to admire him as an actor; but I'm starting to realize, and Scorsese has a lot to do with that.With that and with everything, Marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. Again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. Sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need to&#133;It can be living the moment, or planning that violence Scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings. Scorsese, like Jimmy, Henry, Tommy or any other says; is a good fella. He's with us, he's OK, you can hang out with him; he's a good fella&#133;You know?. And his Goodfellas is another underrated cinematographic brilliance; as one of those all-time movie classics.

After watching this, I can plainly see why it is talked about so much. This is, by far, one of the sleaziest and most sickening and disturbing films I've ever seen. The film traces a psychotic serial killer as he stalks women and then kills them before scalping them and using their scalps for his collection of mannequins in his rotting apartment. Joe Spinnell's performance as the psycho. He seems to be channeling some sort of TAXI DRIVER version of Ed Gein. Joe Spinnell plays the part of a wacko perfectly sinister and disgusting. He blew my mind. The tone of the film is so nasty and cruel. The music is appropriately creepy and eerily memorable and beautiful. The gore effects in this movie, while realistic, are extremely horrific and truly disgusting. Some scenes in this film become so disturbing and so claustrophobic that it really makes you want to take a shower. The most talked about of all the gore effects is the car scene, which I won't give away suffix to say that it's brilliant. The ending has some special effects that look like they were recycled from a scene in Day of the Dead, though it was made prior to that. All of these scenes are truly horrific and extremely disturbing to watch, not only in the realism, but in the scummy feel of the film as a whole. There's a lot of sweat, screaming, shrieking, crying, and bleating, both from the killer and his victim. It's one of the most unpleasant films ever made. Overall, this film is very trashy, exploitative, and extremely disturbing. This film is definitely worth seeing for gorehounds and horror fans. It is an all too effective piece of film-making that will likely be forever remembered in the years to come.

Instead they came up with a near masterpiece.Two things make the difference (1) the gongoristic script, and (2) the glistening performances.You've never heard such dialog. You're maudlin and full of self pity. You're magnificent. But a thousand examples wouldn't do the script justice because it's all of a piece. It was written -- some might argue aptly overwritten -- by Joe Mankewitz and directed by him as well. For a few years he was all over the place, but he never turned out anything else like this film. Nobody could. It's unique.All of the performances are adequate and most of them are more than that. I had a little trouble with the Eve Harrington character, played by Ann Baxter. She seemed out of her depth somehow, which was a shame because she's one of the central figures. She's a likable and attractive woman and the grand daughter of Frank Loyd Wright or somebody, which is all for the good, but her breathlessness limits her range. Hugh Marlowe is better than usual. Marilyn Monroe is indescribable and has some of the funniest lines. The rest of the cast is superb. Gary Merrill's baritone is reassuringly masculine. Bette Davis gives a Saturday Night Live imitation of Bette Davis with her broad gestures and husky voice projecting to the balconies. Celeste Holm is so damned sweetly likable without being a stunning beauty or a bravura actress. Her devotion to Davis is solid without being stolid, just what the role calls for. Perhaps best of all is George Sanders. Great name for the character too -- Addison DeWitt. Addison, as in adder. Twice he's referred to as venomous. Okay, the dialog and performances are overblown, but unashamedly overblown -- I am once again available for dancing in the streets. Almost every line is equally juicy and ripe.In a way, All About Eve is what used to be called a woman's picture -- all that jealousy and backstage intrigue revolving around publicity, age, beauty, and men. Davis has a rather lengthy stint of monologue in which she discuss womanhood as a career. And the men are, frankly, all dummies except for Sanders who may or may not be gay. I only mention the possibility because he's the only man who really understands what these babes are up to. The other men -- even the reassuringly baritoned Merrill -- are as manipulable as Play-Do, but not Sanders. He smirks with his secrets throughout the movie until he cashes his knowledge in at the end. Actually, without wanting to be accused of stereotyping, the movie should have a good deal of interest for the gay community. It's got all the icons. Bette Davis at her bitchiest, the fear of aging and losing one's beauty, the skewering insults, the toughness under the froth and lace.I do kind of wish that Thelma Ritter hadn't disappeared half way through the movie, like King Lear's fool. I missed her a lot.It's curious that the agents of social control objected to a scene in which Betty Davis smokes a cigarette in bed. It sets a dangerous example. There was some static too over Gregory Ratoff's eructation after a glass of baking soda. Presumably, this might set a bad example as well.

Curiously, there was never a peep out of the censors about the brutal beatings and lethal shootings that were everyday fare in films of the period.

I first saw this when I was a child. I am proud to say I have it in my DVD collection. This movie has two big stars in it that I feel give a good performance. They are John Goodman and Jeff Daniels. Daniels plays a doctor from a big city who is to take over as the head doctor in a small town. When he gets there though the old man thats supposed to retire does not feel his is ready to retire. John Goodman plays an exterminator. You have to see the movie to know more on it.The story is pretty good. It may require some thinking. It is like this. The opening scene is a guy going on a trip to South America. After taking picture some pictures he goes to sleep in his tent back where they are staying. A very venomous and deadly spider crawls into his tent and bites him. They way this bite works is he goes into like a seizure for a few seconds and then he kills over. He complained of a fever when he was there so they though it was the fever that killed him. When they are shipping the body back to the US the spider crawls into his coffin.When they get to America the spider finds its way into a barn. In the barn it breeds and creates smaller faster versions of itself. Very slowly people in the town die. The new town doctor decides to get to the bottom of this.I recommend that everybody see this movie. I think it is a pretty good thriller movie.

I am proud to say I have it in my DVD collection. This movie has two big stars in it that I feel give a good performance. They are John Goodman and Jeff Daniels. Daniels plays a doctor from a big city who is to take over as the head doctor in a small town. When he gets there though the old man thats supposed to retire does not feel his is ready to retire. John Goodman plays an exterminator. You have to see the movie to know more on it.The story is pretty good. It may require some thinking. It is like this. The opening scene is a guy going on a trip to South America. After taking picture some pictures he goes to sleep in his tent back where they are staying. A very venomous and deadly spider crawls into his tent and bites him. They way this bite works is he goes into like a seizure for a few seconds and then he kills over. He complained of a fever when he was there so they though it was the fever that killed him. When they are shipping the body back to the US the spider crawls into his coffin.When they get to America the spider finds its way into a barn. In the barn it breeds and creates smaller faster versions of itself. Very slowly people in the town die. The new town doctor decides to get to the bottom of this.I recommend that everybody see this movie. I think it is a pretty good thriller movie.

On the face of it, this seems like a pretty safe theory - even I can't think of another reason why anybody would watch garbage like Committed, McCinsey's Island or Guest House Paradiso. Thankfully, Backdraft isn't anywhere near as bad as those films but those accusations came flooding back as I became aware that I was completely the wrong audience type. Easily the most homo-erotic movie since Top Gun, this is a rare action film that will appeal to women more than to men.Kurt Russell and William Baldwin plays two brothers, Stephen and Brian McCaffrey respectively, who end up working in the same fire brigade in Chicago. Stephen is a grizzled veteran, born to fight fires after following in his dead father's footsteps. Brian is cockier and more inexperienced, finally finding his way into the family profession after a string of nothing jobs. Both are fiercely competitive and end up scrapping with each other as much as burning buildings. Which is very bad news for Chicago as a crazed arsonist is on the loose, who is apparently choosing his victims at will.I'll get the good points out of the way first. Director Ron Howard has assembled a stellar cast (along with Russell and Baldwin, we have Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay and never-the-leading-man J.T. Walsh) and all of them are surpassed by the fire itself. This is a wonderfully shot film with flames almost alive with malice, dancing across ceilings and walls and generally wrecking the set. Credit must also go to the stars who do their own stunt work. The story itself is a bit of a no-brainer and at times, this film comes across more as a comedy than anything else. Nearly all the firemen smoke (without any hint of irony) and the overall acting quality is fairly hammy, to put it mildly. Sutherland, for example, appears to serve no purpose whatsoever and when he and De Niro whisper their way through an entire scene, I couldn't help but giggle.Like I said, this is strictly one of the ladies. Kurt and William do their pretty-boys-in-uniform routine, right down to the naked shower scene and the hilarious scene when they are cooling themselves off with their hoses... so to speak. All they needed a bit of beach volleyball and they're away! Mind you, I can't imagine Chicago being that sort of place. Other things also raise a smile at unfortunate moments. The best bit, for me, was seeing little Brian (Ryan Todd) pick up his dad's still-smoking helmet as he watched his dad go up in smoke, bottom lip quivering like a scolded puppy! One almost expected to see a pair of rubber boots standing to attention, smoke rising from the top! The first victim to the arsonist's reign of terror is blown from his front door through his car windscreen and so badly burned, you'd think he's an eyewitness to the Hiroshima atom bomb! It's almost as if Howard is trying to inject some humour when none is needed, to break up the shots of Kurt leaping through flames with a baby in his arms. Predictable, a waste of a good cast and not worth the effort - ER is a much better emergency-services-in-Chicago broadcast than Backdraft and men and women can enjoy that.
