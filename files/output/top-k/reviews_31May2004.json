I loved every minute of it and the story is told so well by Mr. Nick Nolte. I've never really been a fan of his or of Barbra Striesand but they played their roles to perfection in this. I won't go ahead and tell the story line because everyone who reads these comments already know!  I thought Barbra done a wonderful job at directing this movie. She didn't focus on herself too much and I think we saw more of Nick than we did her. I found the scenes of Tom Wingo's (Nolte) childhood disturbing. Especially when his father would yell at the children and fight with his mother over turning off the television or having something he didn't like for dinner. But the rape scene was the most disturbing of them all. It wasn't graphic or gratuitous, but seeing young Tom screaming and crying over what was happening to him is an image that is burned into my memory.  But I loved how his older brother Luke was very protective over his family and killed the rapists. He was a young man and it is disturbing to see an adolescent man killing three grown men with a shotgun but they deserved it! They broke into someone's home and brutally rape a mother and her two young children!  It was a sigh of relief when Luke blew the men away. Tom loved his brother very much and every time he talked about him he would become sad. I also loved the relationship between Tom and his sister Savannah. He loved her so much and I loved the scenes where he was visiting her in the hospital and reading to her. Very moving.All in all I thought this was an excellent movie and I loved all the performances. And I agree that it's a disappointment that this film didn't win any Oscars. Nick Nolte should have won because I think, in this film, that he gave the performance of a lifetime. Great acting by all the cast. Thanks for reading my review!
