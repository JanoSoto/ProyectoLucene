I had heard so many bad reviews for it, and with this being a Tim Burton film, I got me wondering how a fabulous director like him could have got something wrong. So I went to see it with an open mind. The first thing I must comment on, is whether you liked the film or not, I'm sure no-one could have failed to like the look of the whole thing. The film should certainly win an award for best cinematography because every single frame was beautifully composed. The atmosphere was brilliant, and it definitely had the name 'Tim Burton' written all over it. I must give top marks to Johnny Depp for the portrayal of his character. It was not always convincing, but he really threw himself into his role, and carried it off well. Not too sure about Christina Ricci, though, maybe it was because we did not see very much of her, but I didn't find her very believable. Unfortunately, to me, she is still Wednesday Addams, but I hope to catch up on her most recent films, because I know that she is a fine actress. I have to hand it to her, though, she looked stunning in 'Sleepy Hollow.' One final critism. I don't know what everybody else thought, but I didn't sense any electricity between Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. If this film was to be a romance, then I think more should have been made of their relationship.Anyway, criticisms aside, I thought that 'Sleepy Hollow' definitely sparkled with polish, and it has obviously been carefully crafted.

Did M. Night Shyamalan rip off Matheson, or vice versa? In the end, I guess it doesn't really matter - while Sixth Sense was somewhat enjoyable, Stir of Echoes is a plodding mess.The main problem is that there isn't a single likeable character throughout the movie. Kevin Bacon's character is slow and has no backbone. Kathryn Erbe, playing his wife, is a controlling, whining shrew. Their child (played by Zachary David Cope) is just plain creepy. And Ileana Douglas is her usual self - I can't understand how this woman still gets work. I had to stop the movie a couple of times just to let the aggravation subside - sitting through this movie is like sitting through Thanksgiving dinner, watching distant relatives bicker pointlessly. The guy sees ghosts. Do we really need to hear an argument about how happy he is that they're having another child? Do the people in his life have to be so unbelievably unsympathetic (oh, you see ghosts, but what about _my_ needs)? And are we expected to believe that this family will just reconcile its differences and move on, as the ending suggests?Also aggravating are the trite and silly methods Koepp uses to pad out the movie. The viewer has figured out the mystery long before it is even brought to the fore, and rather than being intrigued by what will develop, finds himself staring incredulously at the screen as the writer finds yet another way to delay the inevitable. Tell the truth - if you were seeing ghosts and spooky visions, and your son held the key to this, would you actually _listen_ to the brat when he says I don't want to talk about this right now. Of course not. But the characters have to, because the film needs to hit the 90-minute mark. And what happened to the others, met by Tom and Kathryn?

It's innovative in that no one has ever done a film like it, true, but that doesn't mean this innovation was a good idea.First, the idea that people thought the film was real disturbs me.  The fact that the end of the movie is immediately followed by the words Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez should indicate that the story is fictitious.  And the film isn't even realistic anyway, not if you think about it.Case in point - I have heard the movie called a psychological masterpiece even though it is psychologically ridiculous.  Even though the characters are obviously in terrible danger, they continue to film what's happening to them.  One character thinly justifies this by saying that the camera filters reality and makes the situation seem less serious.  I don't buy that, especially not towards the end of the film when the characters know without doubt that something is out to get them.  The fact of the matter is that any real person probably would not only cease filming, but drop the camera all together and run.A further flaw of the film is its terrible dialogue and relative lack of characterization.  This problem is likely a function of the fact that the directors sent the actors out into the woods alone and allowed them to improvise.  The end result is three one-sided characters that each possess only a single personality trait (for example, Heather is, shall we say, assertive - and nothing else).  Thus, the content of the dialogue amounts to Goodness, this is weird.  Where's the car?  Just add some cuss words.  Oh, yeah, and someone kicks a map.What's worse is that the movie is anti-climatic.  Oh, it tries to climax, it just doesn't.  After about ninety or so minutes the film just sort of ends.  And the scary part is supposed to be the unseen.  Whatever.  Maybe in some other movie.I'd give the Blair Witch Project a 2\/10, but only because it at least isn't a cliche.  If you really want a good psychological horror, pick up the original Psycho instead.

Dantes constant moan of  I should not even be here today became annoying and his acting was slightly wooden, saying that the acting was not the key to the film being great. The few scenes in which Randal & Dante were engaged in quick,sharp conversation  were excellent and easy to watch again and again. The  feeling you got that Jay and maybe Randall was gay was also clever and very amusing.This is another good example of the decent work to come out of the Sundance festival. Kevin Smith came out of this film shining, sadly the actors could not match his quality. If you go into this flick with an open mind not expecting too much, you will come feeling happy and probably still laughing trying to remember some of the great lines. 7.5 out of 10.

It's a shame they aren't being made anymore. Like the Star Wars, Batman, and James Bond films, they provide all the action\/adventure of the old-time Saturday morning serials and combine that with excellent music, rollicking humor, and intelligent and funny characters. But INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is probably the worst of the trilogy. Not that that's a bad thing, since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was astounding and THE LAST CRUSADE was absolutely perfect. TEMPLE OF DOOM is just a mediocre thrill ride of a movie that tries hard to be a crowd-pleaser and ultimately succeeds.      The plot feels a little iffy. The movie's set in 1935 and therefore has no familiar Nazis for Indy to fight, just scheming Chinese gangsters and bloodthirsty devil worshippers. It's not that these villains aren't threatening or fun to watch; they just start to seem trite after a while, just dumb foes for Indy to kill\/injure\/humiliate. And Indy and his friends aren't on some momentous quest this time. Instead of searching for the Ark of the Covenant or a cup that gives eternal life, Indy finds himself on a rather mundane mission to save a large group of Indian children who have been enslaved by the devil worshippers. There are no deep theological or intellectual musings this time around, no ironic twists to the nature of the mission, just Indy saving a bunch of cute kids from stereotypical villains. Still, the story works because Spielberg doesn't take the plot too seriously.      The special effects are spectacular (definitely better than in RAIDERS) and the humor and adventure sequences are top-notch. But I have to give a low rating to Indy's two sidekicks in this movie. A young Chinese actor puts in a likable performance as Short Round (Shorty), a precocious little boy who keeps the andrenaline flow of the movie going. While he is cute and you just love him, his performance is laughably over-the-top at times. And even worse is Indy's other sidekick, a lounge singer (played by Kate Capshaw) whom Indy and Shorty join up with by virtue of complete accident. Capshaw's character contributes absolutely nothing to the plot except scenes where she is screaming, complaining, or is nearly killed by the villains. I'm sure the movie could have been made without her.      Despite its flaws, the movie is a great diversion for older kids and teenagers (younger kids won't like this because of its bloody and often cult-related scenes of violence). It's not as great as RAIDERS or CRUSADE, but it's the little things about it (the hilariously grotesque banquet, the toboggan ride, the exhilirating mine ride, the rickety suspension bridge, etc.) that make the film fun. See it and you won't be disappointed.
