The film's surrealistic nature is frightening when the  viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today's society, and it offers a  great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would  react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as  an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder The way the real-life viewers  ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on  a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?

Mechanical chairs  that kill their user, high-tech underwater weaponry, amazing gadgets and  stunning women make this a truly memorable picture.  Although some viewers  may find the lack of action undesirable, it is made up for through an  excellent dialogue and some very quotable scenes, including the famous Not  from where I'm standing scene, I kept the gun under the pillow, and  Wait till you get to my teeth!  Emilio Largo is a truly amazing villain,  as he is one of the first SPECTRE agents who truly takes action rather than  shouts orders from a desk.
