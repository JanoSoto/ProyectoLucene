The characters draw you into the story and lead you to a perfect ending.  I can't understand the favorable comparisons of Shrek to this movie.  Shrek was a crude, predictable, boring and unimpressive movie that left me feeling like I had just thrown away 7 bucks and 2 hours.  Monsters Inc. left me anticipating my next chance to get to the theater and see this film.

Except for Shrek and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, I will downgrade the others to 9 (and some 9s down to 8, etc.). That's a bit of work, but The Sorceror's Stone is that kind of movie.Beyond that, the only rave that I can add to all the others is I have never before watched a movie that so duplicated what I had imagined when I read the book. Of all the characters including the minor ones, only Harry's mother was not exactly as I had imagined them. Even then when I reread the novel's description of her, I discovered my imagination had been in error, not the movie.Harry Potter fans who are skipping the movie so that it won't cloud their own personal visions are truly doing themselves a grave injustice.

I can think of dozens of childrens' movies that are superior to this one including Shrek and Monsters Inc. which are playing at the same time. Compared to a true classic like ET, this Harry Potter movie appears weak even by muggle standards.With only a few exceptions the acting here was wooden and uninspired. Maggie Smith as Professor\/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall stood out as did David Bradley as Caretaker Argus Filch. Robbie Coltrane as Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid also had his moments. The kids were cute, but they all acted as if they were reading their lines and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)had pretty well one expression for every occasion. The special effects were pedestrian.As others have also noted, director Chris Columbus would have been better off to leave out some parts of the book and concentrate on doing a better job with the parts he kept. As it is, the movie rushes forward, lurching from one scene to another and barely taking the time to develop characters or any kind of dramatic tension.What made the first book so enjoyable for me was the excitement of discovering a magic world existing side-by-side with the muggles. It was so much fun to experience Harry's surprise and wonderment when he is first introduced to that world. This movie captures none of that. For a movie about wizards and witches there is painfully little magic to be found here.
