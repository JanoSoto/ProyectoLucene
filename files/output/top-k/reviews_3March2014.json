It also happens to be set in the spring of 1861. For non-Americans, that date may not mean much, but no doubt most Americans would recognise it as the time when the American Civil War broke out (very early on in the movie, at the train station Johnnie pulls into, you do see two young black males carrying luggage&#x85;it certainly doesn't seem like the South is a Hellhole for black people&#x85;but then again, you don't see anymore blacks afterwards). When his love interest Annabelle Lee (played by Marion Mack) wonders when Johnnie will enlist to fight for the South after seeing her father and brother do so, he goes to great lengths to do so, to some comedic effect. Marion makes for a feminine and attractive co-star. Keaton himself makes for physical prowess and derring do in his performance.Being an ancient comedy (i.e. being in black and white and silent to boot), I think that the humour is no doubt dated for modern audiences (or at least adult ones), but I did chuckle more than once for its duration. E.g. when Johnnie contrives to be alone with Annabelle when there are two young boys inside the mansion with them (I have no idea who those two boys were meant to be&#x85;and it's also quite weird in how Johnnie and Annabelle first meet&#x85;it's by no means clear they are meant to be a'courtin'). The other scene which made me chuckle was when Annabelle takes it upon herself to do some sweeping on Johnnie's train (which is called The general, hence the title) at a rather odd moment. A few seconds after that event, there's a bizarre moment between him and her. Anyway, the humour for the most part is of the slapstick variety.The Wikipedia entry for this movie mentions that there are different versions of this movie which have different running times. The version that I saw was screened on ABC1 (Australia) on 06\/01\/2014) at 150 a.m. Of course I PVRd it to watch later, as well as the cult Australian movie Stone which preceded it. Yet to see the Australian movie though&#x85;and I saw The general some weeks after I recorded it&#x85;and am writing this review weeks after seeing it too. Anyway, in case the following information helps identify which version of the movie that I saw, the running time from go to whoa is 7530 minutes length. The score features a lot of piano solo music to it&#x85;I'm assuming some of the score references a funeral march piece one time, and I can definitely hear The teddy bears' picnic later on&#x85;it's played on a constant loop for a while and later on it is used to comedic effect at an apt moment. There is one scene where the advancing army of the North gets a jaunty score&#x85;which makes me wonder if this was a later version of the movie.The general has a cast of 100s at times and the cinematography is nice at times&#x85;with shafts of light breaking into a forest. There's also a probably a good example of special effects 'magic' in one scene where you see a lightning flash. For one scene with a shot of a train on a high bridge, I did wonder if that was a model, but I could see figures moving inside of it, suggesting it was not a special effect.In favour of this movie is the good, easy to follow narrative structure and the way that the captions linger on the screen even when there is the occasional slab of text, making it less stressful to read the dialogue before it disappears.One thing of interest to note about this movie is the fact that in it, it's the South (as represented by Johnnie et.al) which is the 'hero' of the movie. This relates to my earlier query about whether the score for the advancing Union army was a later inclusion.This is my first Buster Keaton movie. As an Australian, I have to point out that having seen this movie now, I can definitely see the homage being paid to Keaton by the Australian comedian Frank Woodley (of Lano and Woodley fame&#x85;in fact, they made a sit-com together as well, The adventures of Lano & Woodley). I was very impressed with his 2012 sit-c0m Woodley and found it funny and sweet. He leans on the kind of minimalist slapstick humour utilised by Keaton in this movie. In any case, I suppose I'm saying that if you are a fan of Keaton's work, I can recommend Woodley at least&#x85;his other work\/TV shows are too foggy in my memory to recommend.

Out of options and nowhere to turn,Brody enlists the help of Biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)and shark hunter and sea captain Quint(Robert Shaw)to hunt down the shark and kill it at all costs.What can be said about Jaws that hasn't been said before? It's one of the greatest and most iconic movies of all-time that is apart of Pop Culture,it was not only the first Summer Blockbuster but was the movie that also introduced film audiences to one of the greatest and most iconic Filmmakers of all-time in Steven Spielberg. Scary,frightening and unforgettable Jaws did for swimming in the water and ocean like Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece Psycho did for taking showers. Right from it's shocking and terrifying opening Jaws is a truly brilliant and amazing cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and power constantly putting viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time with white hot suspense that is like a tightrope and is an assault on the senses. The suspense and terror is Jaws is powerful and sensational and handled with great timing because the movie not only scares viewers with the idea of going into the water and being eaten by a shark but with fear of the unknown because we never see the giant shark that attacks but only the shark's point of view when it attacks for the first hour and the terror feels real. Spielberg and others have said that the shark didn't work right at first which was a blessing in disguise for the movie because it added to the intensity and dread of the film. The beauty of Jaws and why it's such a great film is the way the story is told and how the film is shown in two parts. The first half-hour is an examination in terror and fright giving viewers the set-up and showing us various characters while the shark terrorizes the beaches and waters putting you on the edge of your seat. The second half of Jaws is a sea Water Action-Adventure with Brody,Hooper and Quint trying to kill the shark while being on a boat in the sea with the same terror and fear of the first half. That's One of the things that I love about Jaws is that with those two different half's of the film the movie crosses into many different genres it's a Suspense-Thriller,a Sea Adventure,an Action movie and a Horror film all in one giving viewers the best of all of those genres with such excitement and great energy that never stops for over two hours. The three main characters in Jaws Brody,Quint and Hooper are some of the best characters in movie history and when you first see them you will love all three of them immediately and I think the main reason all three characters are likable is because they are real characters with humanity and depth and you will see that throughout the film. It's because of Brody,Quint and Hooper's humanity that when they are on the boat trying to kill the shark we are not only rooting for them but afraid for them as well because the three of them are in the ocean in the middle of nowhere trying to catch a shark where anything can happen. Brody,Quint and Hooper are three classic characters you will never forget. The shark in Jaws is one of the greatest villains in movie history not because the shark is an animal but because the shark is a killing machine who will not stop killing and you can't talk to it or ask for remorse because if Jaws sees humans or blood in the water the shark will eat and slaughter it's prey with no remorse or pity because the shark doesn't care one way or another. Jaws is a study of man vs nature and it is told in a classic and powerful way. The ending of Jaws is one of greatest and most intense endings in film history and you as a viewer will be thrilled,scared and happy with the results of what happens at the conclusion. A classic ending.The cast is amazing. Roy Scheider is excellent,memorable and heroic as Marcus Brody,with Scheider bringing depth and intensity to the role. Robert Shaw is brilliant and unforgettable as Quint,a sea captain. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific and humorous as Matt Hooper,the marine biologist. Scheider,Shaw and Dreyfuss are amazing and have great chemistry together. Lorainne Gray is fantastic as Ellen Brody,Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton is wonderful as Vaughn,the mayor of Amity.The direction by Steven Spielberg is brilliant and memorable,with Spielberg constantly moving the camera and bringing a great atmosphere and intensity especially during the scenes involving the shark. Terrific direction,Spielberg.The score and theme by John Williams is outstanding,frightening and iconic and one of the most famous scores in film history,with Williams' score being intense,scary and adventurous. Classic score,Williams.In final word,if you love Steven Spielberg or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Jaws,an excellent,suspenseful and terrifying classic that you can watch again and again and will never forget.

Out of options and nowhere to turn,Brody enlists the help of Biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)and shark hunter and sea captain Quint(Robert Shaw)to hunt down the shark and kill it at all costs.What can be said about Jaws that hasn't been said before? It's one of the greatest and most iconic movies of all-time that is apart of Pop Culture,it was not only the first Summer Blockbuster but was the movie that also introduced film audiences to one of the greatest and most iconic Filmmakers of all-time in Steven Spielberg. Scary,frightening and unforgettable Jaws did for swimming in the water and ocean like Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece Psycho did for taking showers. Right from it's shocking and terrifying opening Jaws is a truly brilliant and amazing cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and power constantly putting viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time with white hot suspense that is like a tightrope and is an assault on the senses. The suspense and terror is Jaws is powerful and sensational and handled with great timing because the movie not only scares viewers with the idea of going into the water and being eaten by a shark but with fear of the unknown because we never see the giant shark that attacks but only the shark's point of view when it attacks for the first hour and the terror feels real. Spielberg and others have said that the shark didn't work right at first which was a blessing in disguise for the movie because it added to the intensity and dread of the film. The beauty of Jaws and why it's such a great film is the way the story is told and how the film is shown in two parts. The first half-hour is an examination in terror and fright giving viewers the set-up and showing us various characters while the shark terrorizes the beaches and waters putting you on the edge of your seat. The second half of Jaws is a sea Water Action-Adventure with Brody,Hooper and Quint trying to kill the shark while being on a boat in the sea with the same terror and fear of the first half. That's One of the things that I love about Jaws is that with those two different half's of the film the movie crosses into many different genres it's a Suspense-Thriller,a Sea Adventure,an Action movie and a Horror film all in one giving viewers the best of all of those genres with such excitement and great energy that never stops for over two hours. The three main characters in Jaws Brody,Quint and Hooper are some of the best characters in movie history and when you first see them you will love all three of them immediately and I think the main reason all three characters are likable is because they are real characters with humanity and depth and you will see that throughout the film. It's because of Brody,Quint and Hooper's humanity that when they are on the boat trying to kill the shark we are not only rooting for them but afraid for them as well because the three of them are in the ocean in the middle of nowhere trying to catch a shark where anything can happen. Brody,Quint and Hooper are three classic characters you will never forget. The shark in Jaws is one of the greatest villains in movie history not because the shark is an animal but because the shark is a killing machine who will not stop killing and you can't talk to it or ask for remorse because if Jaws sees humans or blood in the water the shark will eat and slaughter it's prey with no remorse or pity because the shark doesn't care one way or another. Jaws is a study of man vs nature and it is told in a classic and powerful way. The ending of Jaws is one of greatest and most intense endings in film history and you as a viewer will be thrilled,scared and happy with the results of what happens at the conclusion. A classic ending.The cast is amazing. Roy Scheider is excellent,memorable and heroic as Marcus Brody,with Scheider bringing depth and intensity to the role. Robert Shaw is brilliant and unforgettable as Quint,a sea captain. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific and humorous as Matt Hooper,the marine biologist. Scheider,Shaw and Dreyfuss are amazing and have great chemistry together. Lorainne Gray is fantastic as Ellen Brody,Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton is wonderful as Vaughn,the mayor of Amity.The direction by Steven Spielberg is brilliant and memorable,with Spielberg constantly moving the camera and bringing a great atmosphere and intensity especially during the scenes involving the shark. Terrific direction,Spielberg.The score and theme by John Williams is outstanding,frightening and iconic and one of the most famous scores in film history,with Williams' score being intense,scary and adventurous.

It is impossible to not identify with Cage's character and impossible not to love Elisabeth Shue after watching it. And really, I am not a drunk and my wife is not a hooker, yet my heart breaks every time I see this film.I think somehow, perhaps by skill or maybe by accident, the makers of this film managed to capture the very essence of man and woman, their darkest core, and present it to us raw. We have Nicholas Cage, in what I think is by far his best role, playing the man who would rather die than be overcome by desperation. We have Elisabeth Shue, playing the whore, the girl who would do anything to survive, the openly accepting woman, but inwards trying to fix the man she loves. Just send this film with the Voyager probe; aliens would actually get us.The story is pretty simple, but the intricacies of the relationship between Cage and Shue, the wonderful soundtrack, the flawless direction, they all make this a masterpiece. Cage plays a man who decided to kill himself by drinking himself to death. I found it immensely satisfying that the writer did not need to explain the reason for this. When asked, the lead character just claims he forgot why he is doing it, but he is sure he must. That's what a suicide feels like, when you don't just want death, you want oblivion, you want the negation of your existence.Shue's character, by the very definition, is an angel. She doesn't come to judge or force change. She is accepting Cage for the simplest reason of all love. She hates it, but she does it anyway. You might think that there are a lot of love movies around, but they are actually quite a few. People who really love (and I know I sound like a pompous ass, but I actually believe this) accept the others as they are, they don't want to change them. Support them, yes, judge them, no. And that is what this hooker, the lowliest person on earth, without any moral standing at all, does. More than any primadona of romantic films.Bottom line this film is a deeply adult movie. Children can't possibly understand it. Teens, maybe, but I don't really believe that. It is a movie about souls, not people, and it touches my soul every time I watch it. Having a strong drink or ten does help get in the mood of it, too.P.S. Julian Sands plays in this film, in a tiny role. What happened to you, man? I used to love every movie you were in!

Directed by Mel Gibson, the film is about a 13th-century Scottish warrior, William Wallace (Mel Gibson). King Edward I AKA 'Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) of England invade Scotland in 1280, murdering many of Scotland's people. Patrick McGoohan is just chilling as Longshanks. What a great performance from him. In the film, Wallace, at first, tries to live a normal life with his childhood friend turn wife, Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), but the horrors of life under Longshank's reign became too much for him. With his fellow Scots, he launched a revenge attacked against the English causing the First War of Scottish Independence. Randall Wallace, the writer of the screenplay, has acknowledged that Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem 'The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie' as a major inspiration for the film. The film takes creative license on the piece, to make the film, more gripping like the like the hanging of Scots nobles at the start of the film or Wallace's getting help from Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). I have to say, Sophie Marceau was a great actress for this role. In real life, Isabella was 3 years old and living in France at the time. She was not married to Edward II until he was already king and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died. This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by the play, 'Wallace a triumph in five acts' by Sydney Goodsir Smith, which historically has adult Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a real man. Yes, it's a bit historical inaccuracy, but it's brings something to the table that works. Little things complains like the Scots not wearing kilts at the time could be passed over. The belted plaid (feileadh mór léine) was not introduced until the 16th century, 500 years after Wallace's death. Things like Jus Primae Noctis plot that supposedly allows the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serf's maiden daughters is still up to historical mystery. Still, there were some historic inaccuracies, I couldn't accept, like the film showing England's occupation and rule of Scotland being much longer. In fact, the English occupation of Scotland was just 2 years old before the battle of Falkirk. Prior to that, the Kingdom of Scotland was separate and fully independent. It was the Scots that gave power to Longshanks when they couldn't decide a king. I will defend the film for the depiction of the Prince of Wales, Edward II (Peter Hanly). His appearance in the film as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson. In real life, Edward II was believe to be bi-sexual who was very unpopular with his wife, the royals and the people of England. Many historians believe Edward II wasn't gay at all and that it was made up to discredit him. One of the few things, the film go semi-right was the portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen). Angus's performance is amazing in the film and my favorite character in the film. Some Scottish people got offended of the negative portrayal of Robert the Bruce whom is more a Scottish hero than Wallace. Even, the title 'Braveheart' is often refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. He got to play second fiddle. Other key figures in the war of Independence was cut out in the film like Bishop William de Lamberton and Andrew de Moray. They were replace by other characters such as Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, and the Irish Steven (David O'Hara). Madman Steven has some of the great one-liners of the film. A lot of Scots might hate the film, due to this misleading history, but in my opinion, a lot of Scots should be thankful because the movie brought a lot to tourists to their country. Some of the English media accused the film of harboring Anglophobia. Yes, because there is going to be a negative portrayal of antagonists in any war film. Doesn't matter if English or not. The action scenes were great. The battle of Stirling was missing the bridge part. The war tactics are not historical right, but it was still well done. It was brutal, bloody, and in close quarters. It's scary to think that men fought this way for years. Even the fake horse dying look real, that even Animal Welfare investigated the film. Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, with the final version being rated R. Some gory scenes are still disturbing, and disgusting for some viewers. Not a film for any young children. Still, there is some beautiful scenes in the film. I like the way, he shot the landscape even if it's Ireland, not Scotland. Braveheart theme song by James Horner is just beautiful to listen to. It's a very smart film. Then there is the famous quotes that continue to be overplayed whenever, the film comes on such as They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM! The film quote capture the spirit of Celtic heroism. The quote 'Every man dies - Not every man really lives' is from 19th century, American poet, William Wallace, no relation to the William Wallace in the film. I still love it. Overall it was worthy of winning the Best Picture at the Oscars in 1995. It's still worthy to watch even with today's films.

This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by the play, 'Wallace a triumph in five acts' by Sydney Goodsir Smith, which historically has adult Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a real man. Yes, it's a bit historical inaccuracy, but it's brings something to the table that works. Little things complains like the Scots not wearing kilts at the time could be passed over. The belted plaid (feileadh mór léine) was not introduced until the 16th century, 500 years after Wallace's death. Things like Jus Primae Noctis plot that supposedly allows the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serf's maiden daughters is still up to historical mystery. Still, there were some historic inaccuracies, I couldn't accept, like the film showing England's occupation and rule of Scotland being much longer. In fact, the English occupation of Scotland was just 2 years old before the battle of Falkirk. Prior to that, the Kingdom of Scotland was separate and fully independent. It was the Scots that gave power to Longshanks when they couldn't decide a king. I will defend the film for the depiction of the Prince of Wales, Edward II (Peter Hanly). His appearance in the film as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson. In real life, Edward II was believe to be bi-sexual who was very unpopular with his wife, the royals and the people of England. Many historians believe Edward II wasn't gay at all and that it was made up to discredit him. One of the few things, the film go semi-right was the portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen). Angus's performance is amazing in the film and my favorite character in the film. Some Scottish people got offended of the negative portrayal of Robert the Bruce whom is more a Scottish hero than Wallace. Even, the title 'Braveheart' is often refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. He got to play second fiddle. Other key figures in the war of Independence was cut out in the film like Bishop William de Lamberton and Andrew de Moray. They were replace by other characters such as Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, and the Irish Steven (David O'Hara). Madman Steven has some of the great one-liners of the film. A lot of Scots might hate the film, due to this misleading history, but in my opinion, a lot of Scots should be thankful because the movie brought a lot to tourists to their country. Some of the English media accused the film of harboring Anglophobia. Yes, because there is going to be a negative portrayal of antagonists in any war film. Doesn't matter if English or not. The action scenes were great. The battle of Stirling was missing the bridge part. The war tactics are not historical right, but it was still well done. It was brutal, bloody, and in close quarters. It's scary to think that men fought this way for years. Even the fake horse dying look real, that even Animal Welfare investigated the film. Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, with the final version being rated R. Some gory scenes are still disturbing, and disgusting for some viewers. Not a film for any young children. Still, there is some beautiful scenes in the film. I like the way, he shot the landscape even if it's Ireland, not Scotland. Braveheart theme song by James Horner is just beautiful to listen to. It's a very smart film. Then there is the famous quotes that continue to be overplayed whenever, the film comes on such as They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM! The film quote capture the spirit of Celtic heroism. The quote 'Every man dies - Not every man really lives' is from 19th century, American poet, William Wallace, no relation to the William Wallace in the film. I still love it. Overall it was worthy of winning the Best Picture at the Oscars in 1995. It's still worthy to watch even with today's films.

Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable bring a tale of southern love during the Civil War under the direction of Victor Fleming , who also directed The Wizard of Oz which was nominated for best picture that year as well. As the audience we see a story unfold for a total of four hours where we are never bored. Everything on the screen is beautiful, due mostly to Ernest Heller, the wonderful cinematographer who captured the beauty of the South. The costumes were breathtakingly designed by Walter Plunkett with my personal favorite being the emerald green curtain dress. Vivian Leigh plays the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara, a true southern belle. She was the envy of every woman and the desire of every man. She is in love with Ashley played by Leslie Howard, who falls for Melanie (his cousin) and chooses to marry her instead of Scarlett. Because Scarlett does not get the man that she believes she deserves, in anger she marries Melanie's brother. Enter Clark Gable...swoon...who plays Rhett Butler. He is your bad boy with a somewhat shady reputation, making money on the war and favoring no side. We fall in love with Rhett and know he's the man for Scarlett long before she does. Eventually realizing Scarlett is still too in love with her delusion of marrying Ashley to give him a chance, Rhett decides to fight for the South even though the war is almost over. Scarlett being born into a very prestigious family had everything at her fingertips until the war began and she lost everything. All of the men, including Ashley left for war for a short time but it becomes years. Scarlett must assume responsibilities she never wanted and is even forced to leave her beloved plantation, Tara, in order to survive.After everything is in ruins from the war Scarlett returns to Tara to keep her family together, while still pining for Ashley and waiting for him to return from war. She makes a vow that she will never be hungry or poor again, which prompts her to marry her sister's beau so she can get the money she needs to save Tara. Soon after becoming a widow for a second time, she is reunited with Rhett who convinces her to marry him. We all keep waiting for her to realize Rhett is her true love and forget wimpy Ashley. How long will Rhett put up with her rejection?To understand and get the entire story you'll have to watch the film. It is a story of love, loss, war, family, and drama great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. It has won several awards, been on must see lists, and has the number one quoted line in film history.

Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable bring a tale of southern love during the Civil War under the direction of Victor Fleming , who also directed The Wizard of Oz which was nominated for best picture that year as well. As the audience we see a story unfold for a total of four hours where we are never bored. Everything on the screen is beautiful, due mostly to Ernest Heller, the wonderful cinematographer who captured the beauty of the South. The costumes were breathtakingly designed by Walter Plunkett with my personal favorite being the emerald green curtain dress. Vivian Leigh plays the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara, a true southern belle. She was the envy of every woman and the desire of every man. She is in love with Ashley played by Leslie Howard, who falls for Melanie (his cousin) and chooses to marry her instead of Scarlett. Because Scarlett does not get the man that she believes she deserves, in anger she marries Melanie's brother. Enter Clark Gable...swoon...who plays Rhett Butler. He is your bad boy with a somewhat shady reputation, making money on the war and favoring no side. We fall in love with Rhett and know he's the man for Scarlett long before she does. Eventually realizing Scarlett is still too in love with her delusion of marrying Ashley to give him a chance, Rhett decides to fight for the South even though the war is almost over. Scarlett being born into a very prestigious family had everything at her fingertips until the war began and she lost everything. All of the men, including Ashley left for war for a short time but it becomes years. Scarlett must assume responsibilities she never wanted and is even forced to leave her beloved plantation, Tara, in order to survive.After everything is in ruins from the war Scarlett returns to Tara to keep her family together, while still pining for Ashley and waiting for him to return from war. She makes a vow that she will never be hungry or poor again, which prompts her to marry her sister's beau so she can get the money she needs to save Tara. Soon after becoming a widow for a second time, she is reunited with Rhett who convinces her to marry him. We all keep waiting for her to realize Rhett is her true love and forget wimpy Ashley. How long will Rhett put up with her rejection?To understand and get the entire story you'll have to watch the film. It is a story of love, loss, war, family, and drama great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. It has won several awards, been on must see lists, and has the number one quoted line in film history. It is a beautiful story that stands the test of time. I promise you will fall in love with these characters and their story, and if you don't... Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.

A fun film that is also slightly funny at times and I felt it was strongly a kind of good film and here below is why I felt that about Diamonds Are Forever.The story is fun and set mostly in the USA and when he is Las Vegas it works really well as Bond get's to show off his charm even more among the numerous bars and casino's there. I like the pace as it is slightly slower than Connery's previous outings but still churns out a good story and great villains all who make the film even more fun. I also loved the stunts as they are ridiculous but they also work with this film and make it much more fun and exciting to watch.Connery is back and his job in this is a firm one albeit he is very old I this to portray the kind of Bond he is trying to show. The Bond girl is Jill St. John and she is probably the most feisty Bond girl there is and seems to object to everything Bond does in the film. I loved the villains and not Just Blofeld(Charles Gray) but also Wint and Mr Kidd who play two of the most villainous Bond villains ever and are possibly the most calm yet sadistic movie villains in any film ever.The script and direction are average and to be fair are the same typical type of things we expect to see from Bond in his earlier showings. I loved the action sequences and well although Bond may take a slight back seat with the action he still manages to get in some great stunts and some good fight sequences that are we choreographed. One stunt you will see, I won't give it away, but it involves a car and Bond makes it do a certain thing which is well, well it must be near impossible but you will see.The movie can be slow at times and you can even feel it is becoming stale at parts but it manages to hold up enough not too. I said before he sits back on the action and he does very much so, maybe Connery didn't want as much action as he was older but he seems to get by with little action, although I did feel it did well even without the bags of action we usually see. Another criticism would be the apparent Homophobia in where the villains are seen as a Homosexual couple and it is sometimes thought that because of there sexuality they are evil, it is never confirmed and should do little to offend.Any Bond fan should like this as it show's off exactly what I feel Bond is known for, but also show's a more reserved Bond who studies the situation much better than in every other film. If you like a good crime spy adventure then this if or you too, it had gadgets, action and the fun criminals involved too, most should enjoy this as it can be very rewarding and fun.I give it a 7\/10 meaning a strongly a kind of good film, I felt maybe I overrated it after but hey it is a fun film and can be thoroughly enjoyed as well. When you watch just don't think about the plot and enjoy the quick snappy humour of Connery in his last Eon produced Bond role, in the truth the end of one of the best Bond's, and many consider him the best of all of them.
