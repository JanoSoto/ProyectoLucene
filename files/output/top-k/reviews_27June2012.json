An idea actually so believable and scary that the use of the phrase 'not-too-distant future' in the beginning is perfectly appropriate. It's a time when bioformed people are superior to all those, who are naturally born, and thus, prone to various infections, disorders or diseases. Parents are able to choose the perfect characteristics of the newborn prior to its birth, making him or her an adequate addition to the hierarchized society. It's a truly provocative concept, which might really seem not that inaccurate, as we live in the times when genetic modifications are becoming more frequent and easier to execute.This was definitely a bad time for little Vincent (Ethan Hawke) to be born. With a bad eyesight, heart problems and life expectancy of only 30 years, he is categorized as an 'In-Valid' and forced to work as a cleaner in a space center in order to earn some money. His big dream of flying to Saturn one day would probably never come true, if it weren't for a mysterious and highly illegal program, which lets an inferior man assume the identity of a, so-called, Valid, distinguished human being (with his permission). That's the moment when Vincent meets Jerome (Jude Law), a perfect example of a bioformed person. However, due to a car accident he is no longer able to walk. He wants to help Vincent to chase his dream. He supplies him with blood and urine samples, pumped-up heartbeats and all the other objects that will transform him into a different man. Vincent is really close to achieving his goal, but a few days before the flight one of the supervisors is killed. It puts his whole plan in jeopardy, as he (the real Vincent) quickly becomes the prime suspect. The tension increases, because he might be caught any minute. The game of cat and mouse with the police begins, and it turns out to be more surprising than one might think.Gattaca, apart from presenting a futuristic idea about our society, is also a rich and complex character analysis. It shows two completely opposing personalities - Vincent and Jerome - and how their perception of life differs from one another. The former is an overly optimistic dreamer, who would do exactly anything to chase his lifelong goal of traveling to space, even though most of the invalids generally accept their place in the hierarchy. The latter is a man, whose whole world collapsed with one tragic incident. He became suicidal. However, when he started to spend time with Vincent, and gave him means to achieve his dream, he began to realize that when Vincent will finally make it to space, he would actually accomplish the same thing. As he put it in his own words 'I only lent you my body - you lent me your dream'. All in all, Gattaca is a great position in the science fiction genre, because apart from the thrilling and spellbinding storyline, it tickles our imagination with its brilliant, but frightening ideas of a futuristic world. And in all this it is also able to offer great cinematography, convincing and impressive acting, terrific music, and a really touching ending. Highly recommended.

Knowing that there is no way he can prove his innocence in Los Angeles he sets off to find Fry; his only clue to his whereabouts a postcard he saw briefly when he bumped into Fry. This clue leads him to the ranch of Charles Tobin; he denies all knowledge of anybody called Fry but in a fortunate case of happenstance Tobin's young granddaughter takes some papers out of his jacket and Kane sees that one that confirms that he does know Fry; it mentions a place called Soda City. Tobin calls the police and Fry is arrested but soon manages to escape despite being in handcuffs. He makes his way to the house of a blind man who surprisingly believes his story and asks his niece Pat to take him to the blacksmiths to cut his cuffs off. She is less trusting and decides to take him to the police; he overpowers here though and eventually gets to Soda City with her in tow. Here they are separated when members of Fry's organisation turn up; Kane bluffs that he is the saboteur after all a they take him on to New York where there next act of sabotage is due to take place. Pat makes her way to the police but they are also working for Tobin and his group. Kane and Pat are reunited in New York where they learn that the saboteurs are part of a fascist group that includes some of the city's most noted citizens. They may now know where the attack is due to take place but before they can do anything about it they will have to escape from their captors! This was a solid thriller despite not featuring a well known cast; in fact not casting a star in the role of Kane probably helped as it gave him the feel of an ordinary man caught up in events rather than that of a hero. There are a series of exciting moments from the opening fire till a dramatic final confrontation on the outside of the statue of liberty; a scene that would foreshadow the more famous scene on Mount Rushmore in 'North by Northwest'. This is a particularly tense scene that is sure to unnerve acrophobes! Being made at the height of the war it isn't surprising that there is some propaganda to be found here; there is a clear message that just because somebody is a pillar of the community it doesn't mean they can't be a danger; thankfully this isn't too heavy handed and doesn't feel particularly forced. This might not be one of Hitchcock's best known films but is certainly well worth watching.

","genre":"Thriller, War"},{"date":"27 June 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This middle chapter of the James Braddock trilogy is a prequel to the original Missing In Action that traces the origin of Chuck Norris's not-quite-iconic franchise player. The film is centered around Braddock's detention at a Vietnamese prison camp with several other American POWs, who are held at the mercy of a malevolent colonel who subjects them to a variety of cruelties. Of course, Norris is never one to sit idly by while injustice is being done, and he soon navigates a daring escape, blowing tons of stuff up and gunning down dozens of bad guys in the process.Though The Beginning boasts all of the hallmarks of an enjoyable B-action flick (slow motion explosions, liberal use of machine guns, a hero seemingly impervious to damage, etc.), Missing In Action 2 spends a lot more time developing the characters and the scenario than fans of the genre may be used to. While this relegates most of the action to the third act and slows the pace a bit, the film benefits from the more immersive approach, and delving deeply into the horrors of the POW experience brings home the real-world resonance of the piece while simultaneously bolstering the pay-off when the guns n' grenades portion of the plot gets underway.The dramatic emphasis also allows the usually stone-faced Norris to showcase his acting chops a bit, and even when he's called upon to express actual emotions, he does a capable job of humanizing Braddock beyond the scope of an interchangeable action hero. I'm keenly aware that most people curious about the Missing In Action series aren't all that interested in seeing Norris cry, so I should post-script that endorsement by adding that even though this outing is a bit more serious-minded than some others you'll encounter from the era, Chuck still doles out plenty of vengeance upon his captors with flame-throwers, Uzis, explosives, and good old-fashioned karate leaps out of trees.Your basic good-vs-evil movie is only as strong as its villain, and we get a suitably malicious match for Norris in Soon-Teck Oh's Colonel Yin, who notches up serious baddie points by burning people alive, tormenting Norris with news from the home-front, and humiliating one prisoner by having the least attractive prostitutes you'll ever see strip him naked and mock his genitals. In adherence to the sort of muddled logic you only find in '80s action films, Colonel Yin is a rare breed of Vietnamese overlord who speaks perfect English and is proficient in advanced martial arts.The presence of veteran henchman Professor Toru Tanaka is a welcome addition, and always entertaining character actor Steven Williams lends his services as a conniving turncoat, who, in true Williams fashion, fights valiantly to steal the movie by taking big meaty bites out of every scene he's in.Most of the shoot 'em up aspects of the film are fairly standard, but MIA2 does boast a few truly memorable scenes during the extended prison camp segments, the most effective of which is the rat in a bag sequence. Though the majority of Colonel Yin's tortures aren't all that creative, when he orders his men to stuff Chuck's head and an agitated rodent into the same burlap sack, it becomes impossible not to recognize his ingenuity.Though The Beginning dramatizes the true fates of some American soldiers left behind in Vietnam, any parallels to reality are readily negated by Chuck's propensity for invincibility. He does get kicked around a bit as a prisoner, but once he assumes the mantle of heavily-armed liberator, his (we assume) highly-trained captors suddenly forget how to aim their weapons, and Norris is able to elude even the most voluminous volleys of gunfire by simply rolling out of the way. The absurd apex of Chuck's super hero capabilities arrives when he opens a hatch to free some of the prisoners, only to discover that he has been lured into a trap. Instead of POWs, the compartment is filled with a dozen enemy soldiers, who immediately open fire with their machine guns inches from our sturdy protagonist's face... and somehow miss him entirely.Of course, such silliness is to be expected from a film like Missing In Action 2, and when the result is a fun and entertaining 90 minutes, it seems beside the point to complain about the improbabilities. Judged against the other work being churned out by Norris and his contemporaries during the era, The Beginning is a surprisingly thoughtful offering that balances its heart and its gonads rather adeptly. Above average is definitely good enough in this case.

I'm keenly aware that most people curious about the Missing In Action series aren't all that interested in seeing Norris cry, so I should post-script that endorsement by adding that even though this outing is a bit more serious-minded than some others you'll encounter from the era, Chuck still doles out plenty of vengeance upon his captors with flame-throwers, Uzis, explosives, and good old-fashioned karate leaps out of trees.Your basic good-vs-evil movie is only as strong as its villain, and we get a suitably malicious match for Norris in Soon-Teck Oh's Colonel Yin, who notches up serious baddie points by burning people alive, tormenting Norris with news from the home-front, and humiliating one prisoner by having the least attractive prostitutes you'll ever see strip him naked and mock his genitals. In adherence to the sort of muddled logic you only find in '80s action films, Colonel Yin is a rare breed of Vietnamese overlord who speaks perfect English and is proficient in advanced martial arts.The presence of veteran henchman Professor Toru Tanaka is a welcome addition, and always entertaining character actor Steven Williams lends his services as a conniving turncoat, who, in true Williams fashion, fights valiantly to steal the movie by taking big meaty bites out of every scene he's in.Most of the shoot 'em up aspects of the film are fairly standard, but MIA2 does boast a few truly memorable scenes during the extended prison camp segments, the most effective of which is the rat in a bag sequence. Though the majority of Colonel Yin's tortures aren't all that creative, when he orders his men to stuff Chuck's head and an agitated rodent into the same burlap sack, it becomes impossible not to recognize his ingenuity.Though The Beginning dramatizes the true fates of some American soldiers left behind in Vietnam, any parallels to reality are readily negated by Chuck's propensity for invincibility. He does get kicked around a bit as a prisoner, but once he assumes the mantle of heavily-armed liberator, his (we assume) highly-trained captors suddenly forget how to aim their weapons, and Norris is able to elude even the most voluminous volleys of gunfire by simply rolling out of the way. The absurd apex of Chuck's super hero capabilities arrives when he opens a hatch to free some of the prisoners, only to discover that he has been lured into a trap. Instead of POWs, the compartment is filled with a dozen enemy soldiers, who immediately open fire with their machine guns inches from our sturdy protagonist's face... and somehow miss him entirely.Of course, such silliness is to be expected from a film like Missing In Action 2, and when the result is a fun and entertaining 90 minutes, it seems beside the point to complain about the improbabilities. Judged against the other work being churned out by Norris and his contemporaries during the era, The Beginning is a surprisingly thoughtful offering that balances its heart and its gonads rather adeptly.

And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is.¨ 12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas I've seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely (except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end) inside an enclosed room. So why is this so good? Because Reginald Rose came up with an excellent story, which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great Sidney Lumet. This was actually Lumet's first feature film and among his best movies all time, although it wasn't received really well when it first came out. This film paved the way for Sidney who in the 70's made one great film after another (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and Network). 12 Angry Men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. In order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what Rose was able to do. Many great plays have failed to perform well in film, so credit has to be given to Sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie. As the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character, and this was achieved really well by Sidney. The dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another. Sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men.The film opens in a courtroom where we hear the judge say his final words before sending the 12 men in the jury to deliberate over whether the accused young Spanish American is guilty or not of murdering his father. He reminds the jury that if they find the teenager to be guilty then he will be sentenced to death. The 12 men enter the jury room where the rest of the film takes place as they deliberate whether or not the kid is guilty. Everyone seems to have made their mind up and believe he's guilty even before beginning to debate the issue. The first thing they do is vote and 11 of the 12 men believe he's guilty pointing to the clear evidence, but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) claims to have his doubts. He isn't sure the guy is innocent, but he has reasonable doubts so he asks the rest of the jurors to deliberate about it for the next hour considering that the young man's life is in their hands. Once the jurors begin to debate the issue the more difficult the case becomes and doubts begin to creep in all over the place. The rest of the jury is played by Martin Balsam (#1), John Fiedler (#3), Lee J. Cobb (#4), E.G. Marshall (#4), Jack Klugman (#5), Edward Binns (#6), Jack Warden (#7), Joseph Sweeney (#9), Ed Begley (#10), George Voskovec (#11), and Robert Webber (#12). The debate escalates as tension builds and the jurors begin to grow impatient over one another's arguments. The small room and the heat also seem to play an important factor in the story.One of the greatest things about the film is that it actually serves as a case study as how small groups work and how important communication can be in these scenarios. Many of the jurors entered the room with prejudice and had their own conceived ideas, but sometimes in order to find the truth you have to discuss the issue as objectively as possible. As the men debate we see how all of this plays out, and Reginald Rose writes the story in such a way that it begins to unfold through the conversations these men are having about their own views. There is no mention of names (except for the final scene where we hear the name of two of the jurors), but we do find out a lot about each character through the way they think and act. Their personalities are very different and that always makes it hard to have everyone agree with each other. This is why the film is used in so many business and communication schools today. These characters are well crafted and we might even have come across a couple of these jurors in real life because their personalities and views are still very much alive in the 21st century. Overall I believe this to be a great film and a must watch for all cinema lovers. It is really well executed and one has to admire the talents of Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda who have left us with their rich legacy.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2012","score":"","review":" ¨It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this.

No simple romance, it is also an up close and personal account of the Russian Revolution and the devastation it would wreak on the Russian people. Easy to see why the film was banned for decades in the Soviet Union. It's quite a scathing indictment of the Bolsheviks and of Communist society. But it is the love story which truly endures. That is the reason the film is quite beloved by so many. It's a love story so grand you don't even mind that the lovers in question are a man cheating on his wife and a woman who slept with her mother's lover.Doctor Zhivago is one of those epics which director David Lean came to specialize in. It's movie-making on a grand scale. But for as big and huge and sweeping as the picture is there's that great, yet simple, love story at its heart. Fate brings Yuri Zhivago and Lara Antipova together. Fate also conspires to keep them apart. The trials and tribulations they go through could break anyone. But their love pulls them through. Even Yuri's wife Tonya, a sweet, loving, wonderful woman who has done nothing to deserve being cheated on would have to admit there is something special about Yuri and Lara. They are meant to be together, no matter how many obstacles the world throws up in their way.A movie which is 200 minutes long had better have some top-notch performers to carry it along and Doctor Zhivago certainly is not lacking in that department. In playing poet\/doctor\/lover Zhivago Omar Sharif goes through the film in rather bemused fashion. Bemused at times bordering on bewildered as Zhivago reacts to all that is swirling around him. But Sharif succeeds in conveying the good, gentle nature of his character. Not gentle at all is the vile Komarovsky, played with great relish and bombast by Rod Steiger. Tom Courtenay plays the committed revolutionary Pasha, a man who will have an interesting character arc to say the least. As Pasha changes so too does Courtenay, you can see his performance harden right before your eyes. Alec Guinness plays Yevgraf, Zhivago's half-brother. Guinness doesn't get much screen time, there more or less to serve as the narrator of the piece. But what he does get to do he does just as wonderfully as you would expect him to. And there are the two women in Zhivago's life. Geraldine Chaplin plays the wife, Tonya, in wonderfully endearing fashion. Chaplin proves to be so much more than a pretty face with a famous last name. But of course in this film she was always going to be overshadowed by Julie Christie playing Lara. Christie is utterly magnificent. Of course she looks the part, no great stretch to suggest any man would fall head over heels at the sight of Julie Christie. But Christie acts the part too. Tender moments with Zhivago, combative moments with Komarovsky, emotionally wrenching moments with Pasha, Lara really gets taken through the wringer. And Christie nails it every step of the way.It's not just the performers filling those six biggest roles who are excellent however. In a movie of this scope there is plenty of room for a large supporting cast and director Lean seemed to bring the best out of everyone. Nobody sticks out in any sort of negative fashion. It does help that there's a great story to work with. Two great stories really. The story of our lovers and the story of the world crumbling all around them. In a movie this long it's fairly inevitable that there will be some lulls and there are. But the movie definitely holds your interest throughout. It never, like some movies of its era, becomes too epic for its own good. Lean reins it in enough while maintaining enough of the grandeur which makes people love epic films in the first place. The film looks magnificent, photographed so beautifully. And everything is backed by a wonderful score featuring the famous Lara's Theme.

The plot is cynical and brilliant,the stark imagery is perfect and Ennio Morricone,s score is my favourite.What always surprised me about Good\/Bad\/Ugly was how underwritten Eastwood and Van Cleef,s parts were.Basically the film was about Tuco.But in this film,Leone actually seems equally interested in all three of the main characters and brilliantly fleshes them out.Eastwood was always meant to be quiet and mysterious,but in this,you get a sense of his personality and purpose,unlike the third,where he came across a bit bored,which he probably was by that time. And Van Cleef was a great addition to the film.Although I,m not usually a fan of his,he was great here in his most sympathetic role as the haunted army veteran. Together the two formed one of cinema,s greatest partnerships.Their stony eyed double act is a joy throughout,especially in the sequence where they shoot at each other,s hats in the street. Leone even put some thought into Volonte,s role.As Indio,he is not a cardboard villain.He is sadistic,psychotic,treacherous to his own men and (dare I say it)even almost human in sequences where he flashes back to a despicable act he,s committed.The first 30 minutes of the film are riveting,showing the main characters in unrelated incidents before the strands twists together for the main story,which is never short of suspenseful,involving and enjoyable.It combines black humour,melancholic moments and great shootouts that all build up to an unforgettable climax and tops off my favourite Leone film.

Hitchcock's films are often about more than a murder history. In Rear Window, he tackles voyeurism. When our own lives are uneventful, as Jeff's (James Stewart) is due to being confined in his apartment by a broken leg, we turn to others', or to gossip, in order to feel better.What's interesting about the film is that just like the audience is hoping for some excitement in the neighborhood, so is Jeff. Stella might plant the seed in his mind, by predicting that he will see things (he) shouldn't see. He then invites it himself, by gazing out the window and saying that (he'd) welcome trouble. With the things he observes from his apartment, he then fabricates a murder mystery that he macabrely wishes to be true even when all evidence speaks against it. Even his initially skeptical girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), whose looks and first appearance are like a dream, joins in after a while, maybe as that is a way for her to finally get Jeff's attention. The fact that the theory later turns out to be true, in the twist-less final act that might be more of an anticlimax than a climax as it only confirms what we have suspected since about 40 minutes into the film, should perhaps be taken symbolically rather than literally.With the apartment complex in Rear Window, Hitchcock has created a wonderful setting resembling a doll house, in which physical windows work just as well as windows into people's lives, or maybe one person's life, as there is sex, violence, loneliness and happiness to be found within the different apartments. Rear Window might not be Hitchcock's most suspenseful or entertaining film, but it is certainly one of his most fascinating.

It is also likely that 'Frankenstein' hasn't offered a piece of its score into the pop-culture domain due to fact that it doesn't actually have one(!) otherwise all three categories would surely have been checked.However, within the iconic power of 'Frankenstein' lie the seeds of some points of criticism which the fledgling cinephile should be wary of. One such criticism is that the film comes from an era when cinema was a young medium and struggling to distinguish itself from theatre and its conventions. As such, many aspects of the direction, editing, and narrative pacing owe a lot to theatre (Whale had previously been a theatre director) and may seem quant and\/or dated by modern audience standards.

Karloff's performance as the monster is legendary, and what makes it so effective is his choice to portray the monster as a victim who is able to evoke sympathy and terror in equal measure, a mix which finds its most controversial expression in the girl-by-the-lake scene which was cut from the movie in its full form for many years.

After being dismissed by interloping and incompetent CIA brass, Chuck designates himself a one-man infiltration squad and returns to the war-torn land to bring his family home.The nefarious General Quoc proves to be Braddock's most sadistic nemesis yet, and when our oft-abused hero's wife is murdered, his mission turns into a quest for vengeance. Captured by Quoc, Braddock and his son are subjected to a particularly harrowing bit of combined torture before escaping the enemy stockade, soon after which Chuck's son is caught yet again, thus setting the stage for Braddock's return to free his boy and launch the explosive bloodbath implied by the MIA moniker.Though ample time is spent developing the story, this installment of the franchise packs more action into the proceedings than either of the two films before it. The body count is likewise elevated, and Chuck spends a good chunk of the movie mowing down anyone wearing a Vietnamese military uniform with a variety of weapons. By far the coolest of the lot is a tri-barrelled assault rife that houses a machine gun, a revolving grenade launcher, and a nasty-looking bayonet, all used to great effect in a scene which features a would-be rapist being knifed in the chest and having an explosive canister burrowed into his guts. MIA3 is easily the goriest of the series, and the squib-happy special effects team seems to relish the opportunity to make every bullet hit explode toward the camera.As you'd expect, there's also plenty of the requisite silliness that goes hand in hand with the like-minded genre films of the era. My favorite turn of events revolves around a group of orphaned Amer-Asian children Norris rescues, who, in the brief span of time they're in Braddock's presence, get imprisoned in a military installation, see dozens of their countrymen being violently slaughtered, are repeatedly shot at with machine guns, become involved in a precarious truck chase with missiles from a pursuing helicopter detonating all around them, and are forced to march miles through the Vietnamese jungles without food or water before Chuck finally loads the lot of them into a airplane... which he promptly crash lands.Despite some of the goofier moments (Chuck I don't step on toes... I step on necks), MIA3 carries a fairly serious tone throughout, and much as the previous films drove home the real-world plight of American soldiers abandoned by their country during the conflict in Vietnam, Braddock sheds a little light on the civilian casualties of that dreadful war. The opening sequence in particular, set during the chaos amidst the fall of Saigon, features powerful images that wouldn't be out of place in one of the Oscar-ready portrayals of the Vietnam War fallout released during this same period. It certainly helps that the production values here are the highest of the series, and in that respect Braddock has aged better than its two predecessors (although the two cloying Journey copycat tunes that bookend the film definitely have not).General Quoc's final come-uppance isn't quite as impactive as it could be, but the film's closing moments provide a fitting conclusion to the story, and the series. General Braddock has ostensibly retired (I'm guessing that if Chuck had any interest in doing a Missing In Action 4, it would have happened by now), but the character's fairly short-lived screen presence proved to be a consistently entertaining sector of the '80s B-action canon. Even if Chuck Norris hadn't done roughly 400 other low-budget action movies like Braddock Missing In Action III, I'd like to think that his legacy would be secured by the not-unsubstantial merits of this outing alone.

My favorite turn of events revolves around a group of orphaned Amer-Asian children Norris rescues, who, in the brief span of time they're in Braddock's presence, get imprisoned in a military installation, see dozens of their countrymen being violently slaughtered, are repeatedly shot at with machine guns, become involved in a precarious truck chase with missiles from a pursuing helicopter detonating all around them, and are forced to march miles through the Vietnamese jungles without food or water before Chuck finally loads the lot of them into a airplane... which he promptly crash lands.Despite some of the goofier moments (Chuck I don't step on toes... I step on necks), MIA3 carries a fairly serious tone throughout, and much as the previous films drove home the real-world plight of American soldiers abandoned by their country during the conflict in Vietnam, Braddock sheds a little light on the civilian casualties of that dreadful war. The opening sequence in particular, set during the chaos amidst the fall of Saigon, features powerful images that wouldn't be out of place in one of the Oscar-ready portrayals of the Vietnam War fallout released during this same period. It certainly helps that the production values here are the highest of the series, and in that respect Braddock has aged better than its two predecessors (although the two cloying Journey copycat tunes that bookend the film definitely have not).General Quoc's final come-uppance isn't quite as impactive as it could be, but the film's closing moments provide a fitting conclusion to the story, and the series. General Braddock has ostensibly retired (I'm guessing that if Chuck had any interest in doing a Missing In Action 4, it would have happened by now), but the character's fairly short-lived screen presence proved to be a consistently entertaining sector of the '80s B-action canon.

After being dismissed by interloping and incompetent CIA brass, Chuck designates himself a one-man infiltration squad and returns to the war-torn land to bring his family home.The nefarious General Quoc proves to be Braddock's most sadistic nemesis yet, and when our oft-abused hero's wife is murdered, his mission turns into a quest for vengeance. Captured by Quoc, Braddock and his son are subjected to a particularly harrowing bit of combined torture before escaping the enemy stockade, soon after which Chuck's son is caught yet again, thus setting the stage for Braddock's return to free his boy and launch the explosive bloodbath implied by the MIA moniker.Though ample time is spent developing the story, this installment of the franchise packs more action into the proceedings than either of the two films before it. The body count is likewise elevated, and Chuck spends a good chunk of the movie mowing down anyone wearing a Vietnamese military uniform with a variety of weapons. By far the coolest of the lot is a tri-barrelled assault rife that houses a machine gun, a revolving grenade launcher, and a nasty-looking bayonet, all used to great effect in a scene which features a would-be rapist being knifed in the chest and having an explosive canister burrowed into his guts.

His character, Misery Chastain, is quite a woman and she has a lot of fans. However, Paul has just written a new book of his own choosing, for he has grown weary of churning out print for Misery. His agent (Lauren Bacall) is in full support. However, as he is going from a remote area to deliver his book, he has an unfortunate automobile accident. It's serious. Lucky for him, though, his number one fan, Annie (Kathy Bates) lives nearby and, as a nurse, she rescues him and takes him to her home. Very skillful, Paul is soon on the road to recovery but it will be quite sometime before he is on his feet. He feels fortunate that Annie was johnny on the spot. But, horrors, he won't be feeling lucky for long. Annie, you see, is deranged. As Paul's last book about Misery goes on the bookshelves, Annie buys it. She tells Paul how good it is. But, when she discovers Misery DIES at the end, she turns vicious. All of a sudden, Paul is a prisoner who is ordered to write a sequel to Misery's adventures, with a promise to continue the series. She drugs him, berates him, and breaks his legs. Paul does as she asks, for he is afraid for his life but he secretly spits out pills and does strength training, preparing for his escape, hopefully. The town's sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) becomes suspicious about Annie but the diabolic nurse sees that his interference stops. Forever. Will Paul get away from this Mad Woman of the Country? This is a terrific film in almost every way. It has a sensational Stephen King story to tell and two strong performances from Bates and Caan. Most of the scenes are between these two, in Bates' house, so the movie's success is no small feat. Director Rob Reiner should be commended over and over, for his shots, for his pace, and for his attention to detail. Scenery and costumes are also well chosen, for Bates' surroundings and choice of clothes are quite bizarre. Yes, the movie is somewhat scary but not overly so and most folks will be enthralled.

I have also enjoyed a number of the British TV adaptations of the Holmes stories over the years, with Jeremy Brett, Douglas Wilmer and Peter Cushing in the title role. I regret to say, however, that Young Sherlock Holmes is simply not my cup of tea. I like my Sherlock Holmes to be presented in a traditional fashion - with foggy streets peopled by urchins and beggars, smoke-filled sitting rooms and hansom cabs. We get little of that sort of thing in this film. What we do get are seemingly expensive special effects that are quite out of keeping with the world of Holmes and Watson in a film that reminded me in places of the Indiana Jones movies, The Goonies and even Back to the Future. I suppose that's the influence of Steven Spielberg for you (he's one of the executive producers of the film)!The plot centres on Holmes's adolescent years. Much of the action takes place at an English public school known as Brompton. The film suggests that it was, in fact, here where Holmes and Watson first met, when both were pupils together and shared the same dormitory. The story concerns the investigation by the teenage Holmes of a number of seemingly unrelated murders that involve a religious cult and the use of hallucinatory drugs. It's all enjoyable enough, I suppose, if you are happy to accept the use of special effects and, given what happens in the Conan Doyle stories, a somewhat unconvincing love interest for Holmes. There is no doubt that the special effects themselves are imaginative a roast pheasant on a restaurant diner's plate bites back; hat stands seemingly come to life; and Watson is attacked by cakes in a bizarre graveyard scene. But, as I say, they have no place in a film of this sort. The acting is good - the supporting cast is made up of a number of high quality British character actors such as Freddie Jones, Nigel Stock and Roger Ashton-Griffiths. And the direction is competent, if uninspiring. So, I give some marks to Young Sherlock Holmes for trying to do something slightly different. But the film just doesn't work for me. 5\/10.I should add that it is important to keep watching right up to the end of the closing credits, when a nice little twist is delivered. I wonder how many of the people who saw Young Sherlock Holmes in the cinema missed it, given that, in my experience, many cinema-goers seem to rush for the exit almost as soon as the closing credits begin to roll!

There's a variety of ways to deal with the situation but Cary Grant probably picks the most unorthodox and unconventional solutions in Arsenic and Old Lace, a classic Frank Capra comedy from 1944. Grant stars as Mortimer Brewster, a drama critique who, at the opening of the film, marries his girlfriend. He goes home to tell his aunts and prepare for his honeymoon to Niagra Falls. However, while at home he finds out his aunts have poisoned twelve men over the past few months and they are all buried in the cellar. This news sends Mortimer racing around trying to hide the fact that his aunts are homicidal, while also dealing with a variety of other problems as this kind of insanity runs in his family. At the same time as he is dealing with his aunts Mortimer has one brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and another a deformed serial killer who, after being gone for twenty years, decides to return home at the most inopportune time. It's a wild and bizarre ride that is chock full of innocently delightful laughs.Arsenic and Old Lace represents the Golden Age of the American comedy. Some of the most classic comedies were made during World War II in order to ease the troubled times America was involved in. Arsenic and Old Lace falls right in with these films, having been released in 1944. Therefore, it's only purpose is just to make us laugh. It aims to entertain and delight, and I would say it does just that. It's got a cavalcade of wacky and eccentric characters played by a fantastic cast of hilarious actors and actresses. The duo of Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha is one of the most hilarious on screen pairings I've ever seen and the two actresses, Josephine Hull and Jean Adair respectively, play the part so perfectly. They come off as the sweetest old ladies you could ever meet who just don't understand what all the fuss is about concerning the twelve dead bodies they have buried in their cellar.

This is a very strange film with all sorts of moments that make you scratch your head in confusion and chuckle at the same time. It's an incredibly offbeat film for its time, and this adds to the humor. As far as comedy goes this isn't quite my cup of tea, but I have the utmost respect for what a quality comedy film this is.

By some, it's considered Disney's best film, period. So after years of merely hearing about The Little Mermaid, I finally got the chance to judge for myself. Ariel, a young mermaid of just 16, is fascinated by the world above sea level. But her father and king of the ocean, Tritan, as well as a musical crab named Sebastin, is worried for her safety. But after saving a human, Prince Eric, from drowning, Ariel is determined to go back to the surface and not only see him, but to marry him as well. Naturally, Tritan doesn't allow it, so Ariel finally betrays her father, and accepts magic from the sea witch, Ursula. Ariel is transformed into a human, but only can remain as such for 3 days. If she fails to kiss Prince Eric before those three days are up, Ariel will belong to Ursula. And it doesn't help that Ariel completely loses her voice as part of the deal. I'll admit, I wasn't all that impressed during the first 20 minutes to half hour. Yeah, the animation was nice, and the songs were spectacular, but it was all just a little...good. I was expecting great, so merely good was a little disappointing. Thankfully, The Little Mermaid quickly got better after this. The songs, as I just mentioned, are spectacular. There's the grand Part of Your World, the upbeat Under The Sea, the sinister, Poor Unfortunate Souls, the romantic, Kiss The Girl, and my personal favorite, Les Poissons, which is a song that Eric's chef sings about the art of making sea food meals, much to Sebastin's distress. The characters are generally memorable. Sebastin is a bumbling stick-in- the-mud, Scuttle is loony and terribly stupid, and the film's villain, Ursula, is certainly one of my favorite Disney villains. However, I found Ariel to be a bit of a brat, and Prince Eric is no different than any other prince Disney has produced. I personally didn't see anything in the score that could've caused The Little Mermaid to win an academy award, but alas, it did. That's not to say the score (composed by Alan Menken) is completely dull, because there are some moments where the music really shines, it's just a little underwhelming for an award-winning score. The lyrical songs are much better. The Little Mermaid is undeniably entertaining. There are moments of fun, moments of romance, and lots of memorable songs and characters.

By some, it's considered Disney's best film, period. So after years of merely hearing about The Little Mermaid, I finally got the chance to judge for myself. Ariel, a young mermaid of just 16, is fascinated by the world above sea level. But her father and king of the ocean, Tritan, as well as a musical crab named Sebastin, is worried for her safety. But after saving a human, Prince Eric, from drowning, Ariel is determined to go back to the surface and not only see him, but to marry him as well. Naturally, Tritan doesn't allow it, so Ariel finally betrays her father, and accepts magic from the sea witch, Ursula. Ariel is transformed into a human, but only can remain as such for 3 days. If she fails to kiss Prince Eric before those three days are up, Ariel will belong to Ursula. And it doesn't help that Ariel completely loses her voice as part of the deal. I'll admit, I wasn't all that impressed during the first 20 minutes to half hour. Yeah, the animation was nice, and the songs were spectacular, but it was all just a little...good. I was expecting great, so merely good was a little disappointing. Thankfully, The Little Mermaid quickly got better after this. The songs, as I just mentioned, are spectacular. There's the grand Part of Your World, the upbeat Under The Sea, the sinister, Poor Unfortunate Souls, the romantic, Kiss The Girl, and my personal favorite, Les Poissons, which is a song that Eric's chef sings about the art of making sea food meals, much to Sebastin's distress. The characters are generally memorable. Sebastin is a bumbling stick-in- the-mud, Scuttle is loony and terribly stupid, and the film's villain, Ursula, is certainly one of my favorite Disney villains. However, I found Ariel to be a bit of a brat, and Prince Eric is no different than any other prince Disney has produced. I personally didn't see anything in the score that could've caused The Little Mermaid to win an academy award, but alas, it did. That's not to say the score (composed by Alan Menken) is completely dull, because there are some moments where the music really shines, it's just a little underwhelming for an award-winning score. The lyrical songs are much better. The Little Mermaid is undeniably entertaining. There are moments of fun, moments of romance, and lots of memorable songs and characters. In the end, it's not my favorite Disney film, and it's not quite a masterpiece, but I'd be a liar to say I didn't have a good time.

Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr.The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the positive Catholic overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs).One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director\/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go against the grain, to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive.Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as higher-ups disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from regular people therefore dissolves into thin air.To sum up, a Hollywood romantic comedy may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

It's like a game of cat and mice between the 'thing' (no one knows what it truly is, as it is able to morph and take shape of any organism that is nearby) and all the researches.

Hemingway, as the story goes, actively disliked the picture, and with its relatively brief running time of 78 minutes, it's easy to imagine that a good part of the author's original was given the Hollywood glossover. (The 1957 remake, generally regarded as the inferior of the two, is yet almost twice as long!) A somewhat dated, slightly creaky affair, the film is of interest today mainly for the excellent performances turned in by its three leads and for the Oscar-winning photography of Charles Lang (his only Academy Award, despite a more-than-impressive filmography).In the picture, we meet an American ambulance driver named Frederic Henry (played by Gary Cooper), who is serving on the Italian front during WW1. A doctor friend of his, an Italian named Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), introduces him to a British nurse, Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes, riding high after her recent Oscar win for 1931's little-seen The Sin of Madelon Claudet, and who largely forsook Hollywood after 1935, to become The First Lady of the American Theater). The two instantly fall in lust (American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, Hemingway's inspiration for the Hayes character, who he'd met while injured in Italy, had rebuffed the author's amorous advances), and after Henry is wounded at the front, Catherine tends to his wounds in hospital, becoming, uh, knocked up in the process. Forced to leave her nursing group as a result, Catherine hides out in Switzerland to have her baby, alone, leading to the mother of all tear-jerking conclusions....Released in December '32, shortly before the stifling Production Code came into being, A Farewell to Arms is, surprisingly, sexually frank. Catherine and Henry, scant minutes after being introduced in a hotel garden, are busily engaged in the ol' horizontal tarantella, their randiness attributed to the war more than their own natural inclinations. Still, Henry tells his newfound galpal I love you immediately afterwards, and, as events subsequently demonstrate, he means it. Cooper and Hayes do have a certain chemistry here, although they make an odd-looking couple, with Cooper towering over his girl by a good head and a half. Much of the dialogue that they utter is of the florid, purple-prose variety, and Hayes seems to occasionally overact a tad. Also (and please don't think me a superficial pigdog here), lookswise, Hayes was far from the comeliest actress on the lot, although Rinaldi refers to Catherine as the prettiest nurse in the area. Given her plain-Jane decent looks, this instant lustful infatuation on Henry's part becomes a bit incredible; a sweeter-faced actress of the period, say Claudette Colbert, might have been a better casting choice. Cooper, with his shy smile and diffident delivery, is always ingratiating, however, and Adolphe manages to convince as an Italian doctor. (Like many folks, I have a feeling, I've long thought that Menjou was French, whereas he was actually born in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.!) Director Frank Borzage, who would go on to work with Cooper in the 1936 Marlene Dietrich vehicle Desire, does a thoroughly admirable job here, while Charles Lang certainly did earn his Oscar, especially by dint of two powerful scenes the POV shots from Henry's moving hospital gurney, and the montage sequence of Henry's trek to find Catherine in Brissago, Switzerland. In all, a perfectly respectable film, and one that I might have appreciated a little more, had I not seen the WW1 classics Grand Illusion (1937) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)--two infinitely superior pictures--at NYC's Film Forum just a few weeks earlier. Still, those immortal classics are more antiwar films, whereas A Farewell to Arms is a romantic drama with a WW1 backdrop. The film concludes most ambiguously, with Henry proclaiming Peace, peace as doves fly high and the Great War ends. But whether he is praying for world peace, or peace and surcease from his tragic memories, or peace for the pitiful woman in his arms, is anybody's guess....

A somewhat dated, slightly creaky affair, the film is of interest today mainly for the excellent performances turned in by its three leads and for the Oscar-winning photography of Charles Lang (his only Academy Award, despite a more-than-impressive filmography).In the picture, we meet an American ambulance driver named Frederic Henry (played by Gary Cooper), who is serving on the Italian front during WW1. A doctor friend of his, an Italian named Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), introduces him to a British nurse, Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes, riding high after her recent Oscar win for 1931's little-seen The Sin of Madelon Claudet, and who largely forsook Hollywood after 1935, to become The First Lady of the American Theater). The two instantly fall in lust (American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, Hemingway's inspiration for the Hayes character, who he'd met while injured in Italy, had rebuffed the author's amorous advances), and after Henry is wounded at the front, Catherine tends to his wounds in hospital, becoming, uh, knocked up in the process. Forced to leave her nursing group as a result, Catherine hides out in Switzerland to have her baby, alone, leading to the mother of all tear-jerking conclusions....Released in December '32, shortly before the stifling Production Code came into being, A Farewell to Arms is, surprisingly, sexually frank. Catherine and Henry, scant minutes after being introduced in a hotel garden, are busily engaged in the ol' horizontal tarantella, their randiness attributed to the war more than their own natural inclinations. Still, Henry tells his newfound galpal I love you immediately afterwards, and, as events subsequently demonstrate, he means it. Cooper and Hayes do have a certain chemistry here, although they make an odd-looking couple, with Cooper towering over his girl by a good head and a half. Much of the dialogue that they utter is of the florid, purple-prose variety, and Hayes seems to occasionally overact a tad. Also (and please don't think me a superficial pigdog here), lookswise, Hayes was far from the comeliest actress on the lot, although Rinaldi refers to Catherine as the prettiest nurse in the area. Given her plain-Jane decent looks, this instant lustful infatuation on Henry's part becomes a bit incredible; a sweeter-faced actress of the period, say Claudette Colbert, might have been a better casting choice. Cooper, with his shy smile and diffident delivery, is always ingratiating, however, and Adolphe manages to convince as an Italian doctor. (Like many folks, I have a feeling, I've long thought that Menjou was French, whereas he was actually born in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.!) Director Frank Borzage, who would go on to work with Cooper in the 1936 Marlene Dietrich vehicle Desire, does a thoroughly admirable job here, while Charles Lang certainly did earn his Oscar, especially by dint of two powerful scenes the POV shots from Henry's moving hospital gurney, and the montage sequence of Henry's trek to find Catherine in Brissago, Switzerland. In all, a perfectly respectable film, and one that I might have appreciated a little more, had I not seen the WW1 classics Grand Illusion (1937) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)--two infinitely superior pictures--at NYC's Film Forum just a few weeks earlier. Still, those immortal classics are more antiwar films, whereas A Farewell to Arms is a romantic drama with a WW1 backdrop. The film concludes most ambiguously, with Henry proclaiming Peace, peace as doves fly high and the Great War ends. But whether he is praying for world peace, or peace and surcease from his tragic memories, or peace for the pitiful woman in his arms, is anybody's guess....
