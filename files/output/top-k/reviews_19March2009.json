These are 5 brilliant movies in their own right that any director would want to have had their name attached to in any way, shape or form.But the 70's, 80's and 90's seemed to be difficult for Kurosawa to make movies He only made 7 films from 1970 up until his death in 1998. He was getting trouble for funding his movies, some people criticised him for being too western and old-fashioned. Kurosawa even attempted suicide at one point, but thankfully he survived. He had wanted to make Ran for over a decade, but he couldn't find the funding, until Serge Silberman helped him out with the funding.So it was 10 years in the planning, the entire storyboard was painted by Kurosawa, the costumes were designed by Kurosawa and created over a 2 year period, 1400 extras and 200 horses were used in the battle scenes, Kurosawa's wife even died during the production of the film. After all the difficulty in making the film, how did Ran turn out? Extremely well, extremely well indeed.Ran is the story of Hidetora Ichimonji, a powerful Warlord in feudal Japan. A man who has spent almost his entire life fighting for control, and has decided to hand over his power to his 3 sons, hoping to restore peace to the land after a lifetime of bloodshed. However, his youngest son Saburo voices his concerns bluntly, which Hidetora does not appreciate He banishes Saburo and one of his vassals who defended Saburo (The fiercely loyal Tango).What follows is a glorious exploration of greed, sexual politics, ambition, madness, loyalty, corruption, war, faith and revenge. Beautifully photographed, hauntingly scored, with incredible acting and brilliant direction culminate into one of the most emotionally shattering and incredible movies ever made. Not only is it the best film Akira Kurosawa ever made, it is also one of the greatest movies ever made. Akira Kurosawa has cemented his place as one of the greatest director's of all time with this film.

Along with 'The great escape, Dirty Dozen and Where eagles dare' is one of the best WWII adventure yarn. Spectacular and evocative musical score by the master Dimitri Tiomkin. Colorful, luxurious cinematography by Oswald Morris and John Wilcox as assistant cameraman. This sweeping wartime movie epic from the director of 'Mckenna's gold' presents the historic events of hokey manner but it does so fascinatingly. All in all,it's a successful piece of warlike fluff. Although overlong ,has good battle footage ,solid acting , breathtaking scenes which help offset a sometimes far-fetched plot, but suffers on television, as the small screen damages its really spectacular images. This picture should please most action-war-adventure buffs.Followed by an inferior sequel also written and produced by Carl Foreman titled 'Force 10 Navarone(1978)' by Guy Hamilton with Robert Shaw,Harrison Ford and Edward Fox.
