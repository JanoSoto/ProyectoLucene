But at its best, we have a crazy wild ride to invest ourselves in! This is the latter case.The opening is the darkest part of the movie. We have a happy father going on the carnival with his son, and suddenly his boy is shot... Castor Troy, the killer, unfortunately gets away. Until one day, when Sean Archer finally catches him! But there is one problem left Troy planted a bomb which will destroy Los Angeles and Archer is the only one who can stop it! The best way to do it though? Going undercover as Troy by undergoing a surgery where Archer's face is cut off and replaced by Troy. And even getting a voice box so he can talk like him. However, more trouble stirs up when the real Castor wakes up and forces the doctor to give him Archer's face as well. And what we have are two faces with the wrong personalities...The plot sounds ludicrous, doesn't it? But that's also part of the charm! It's so impossibly complicated, yet the movie manages to make it work. And it's all thanks to the hilarious dialogue throughout, which is a mix of delicate wit, flat-out bizarreness and dark humor. In fact, this movie has so many laughs that it's a mystery why it's never listed as a comedy. John Travolta gets to go completely nuts with this movie as he for one of the few times in his career plays a villain. Equally, maybe even more, great is Nicolas Cage as his counterpart. He has shown that he can both be a great, great actor and someone who is just very entertaining to watch. Here, he is both! He is WAY over-the-top, and still you completely buy it. He hands out one of the greatest performances of his life.There are a few other side characters I really like too, such as Pollux Troy, Jamie Archer and Dietrich, who by the way has one of the best lines in the movie (Hey Sean, how's your dead son?). Almost every single character is exaggerated and sometimes you are not sure if the movie is self-aware or takes itself very seriously. Either way, it's a wonderful movie!The one weak aspect I guess would be that the ending is not very good, as it's very cheesy and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. Thankfully, there's an alternate ending, which I thought was far better. So I guess the movie is as awesome as it could be after all!

An adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's novel Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, it tells the tale of a widowed field mouse mother, who struggles to save her family. For harvest day is coming and her family needs to move before it, but her son Timothy has fallen ill and cannot leave. And so she must go to the rats living under the rosebush to ask for help, for they have powers and knowledge no other animal has. They are the escapees of NIMH.What makes this film so much more than a mere children's film is its substance. I've watched this film numerous times as an adult, and I'm still finding new things to learn from it. The story, the characters and even the tone are all much darker than you'd expect from an animated film, yet never so dark that you couldn't show it to kids as well. Its story is also simple enough, a struggle between good and evil, as well as technology and nature, that kids should understand it just fine, but it has enough subtext to please the adults as well. And often those are the best kind of stories.But what truly shines in this film is the characters. Especially Mrs. Brisby. She is, in my opinion, one of the greatest female characters ever put on film. Not because she's a woman that can do everything a man can do, with sword swinging and a song on her lips. But because of her courage. She has no special skills, no great wisdom or knowledge. In many ways she's completely overshadowed by her late husband, Jonathan Brisby, who the rats of NIMH held in high regard. And yet it's his wife who rises to become the hero of the story. Not because she can, but because she has to. And that makes her heroism all the more meaningful.The Secret of NIMH is a marvelous movie. Deep, dark, more than a bit threatening, but also wise and profound. From within the darkest night shines the brightest light.

Basically the film begins a few months after the previous film's conclusion, young Tina Shepard (Jennifer Banko) has an abusive alcoholic father John (John Otrin) who beats her mother Amanda (Susan Blu), and in a moment of rage Tina discovers she has telekinetic abilities, and accidentally causes the death of her father, he drowns and goes to the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later Tina Shepard (Lar Park-Lincoln) is still haunted by the guilt of this horrible memory, she is being taken by her mother to a lakeside residence to be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist Dr. Crews (Terry Kiser), he experiments and brings out her powers through verbal insults. Tina runs from the cabin upset and runs to the dock by the lake her father was drowned, thinking about him and wishing he was alive. Tina unintentionally wakes undead zombie serial killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder), previously seen beneath the water chained to a rock, she causes the chain around his neck to break, allowing him to rise from his watery grave and go on a killing rampage once again, ignited by the death of his mother, and the victims include vacationing teenagers in a cabin nearby. Jason's killing methods include stabbing in the head, a knife and machete through the bag, someone tied up in a blanket being smashed against a tree, drowning, crushing a skull with his hands, knife to the chest, being thrown out a window, a long spinning saw through the chest, an axe through the head and many more. Tina is tormented now also by Jason violently killing those around her, she sees no choice but to use her telekinetic powers to try and stop him, including forcing Jason's hockey mask to tighten, until it breaks off, to reveal a monstrous decaying and deformed face. The lakeside house is eventually set on fire, and it looks like even the powers of Tina cannot stop Jason, but then all of the sudden her father emerges from the lake and drags the killer back down to the bottom of the lake, he is chained once again and disappears, for now. Also starring Kevin Spirtas as Nick, Susan Jennifer Sullivan as Melissa, Heidi Kozak as Sandra, William Butler as Michael and Staci Greason as Jane. Jason being the menacing killer he is and some of the kills are fine, but the biggest problem is the storyline he is a part of and what goes on when he is not on screen, the telekinetic powers stuff is complete rubbish, and the accidental death of a father is a predictable idea, one of the only positives was seeing Jason's face under the mask again, other than that the whole film is almost entirely awful, a very disappointing horror.

The film was shot on 16mm film in one month's time for $110,000 in 1985. It did not premiere until 1990, and became one of a handful of international independent films to instigate the NC-17 rating. It does not contain buckets of blood, nor is it particularly explicit sexually. It is, from any and every angle, an omniscient portrait. Two naked women are shown dead, having already been brutally murdered, one in a field and the other in a bedroom, while a troubled man named Henry drives around Chicago. We hear their screams. All we see are their mangled bodies. That is all we need. And it is stomach-churning.Itinerant Henry and his prison buddy Otis are cold-blooded and chillingly casual murderers. Played by gravelly character actor Michael Rooker, Henry never appears or behaves like anyone out of the ordinary. We get the sense that he hardly ever thinks about murder, except for when he does it. As for Otis, played by the imposing Tom Towles, think of when you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, versus one after your morning coffee and one after dinner. Think of the discipline and organization inherent in the latter. That's Otis's problem kind of, only he's not just the one pack a day, he's about five and the tobacco is laced with children's tears. That's why he truly brings out the things about individuals we never see. He does many unforgivably monstrous things here, but he still manages to go about his business without remorse or fear of getting caught, so we presume he's just a good ol' boy with a short fuse. And he is; he just goes a few steps further than most.Portrait is not about the thin line between good and evil. Portrait sees no line. There are innumerable films about serial killers. It is a permanent fixture in the Middle American zeitgeist. We fear them, so we turn them into our own bloodthirsty entertainment. They have become mythology for us to use in order to take our morbid curiosities and sadistic fantasies out for a safe spin. Even after this definitive film on the subject, it is not often that a movie dares to portray the real ones, unmitigated by thriller tropes.John McNaughton and his late collaborator Richard Fire do not feel the need to pigeonhole or explain them, not just as movie characters but as people. Without a frame of compromise, McNaughton defies the hankering to pump up the volume, to frame Henry in chiaroscuro or Otis with Dutch angles. When most human beings see the things that Henry and Otis actually go through with---feeling no other rationale, it would seem, than that it's simply something for them to do---our immediate reaction is to ask how someone could do such things, and why. As Nick Nolte says as a homicide detective in Ole Bornedal's 1997 thriller, Even when we catch the killer, they wanna know the how and why.That character would agree with McNaughton and Fire that people like Henry and Otis, are well beyond the need to justify what they do. What explanation could there be for slaughtering an entire random family, while recording the whole incident on a camcorder to then watch it later with the blank beer-chugging catatonia of watching an inning of baseball? Horror films, though designed to scare us, are also designed to make us feel safe. The killer was humiliated by his quarries in high school, or has split personality disorder. This film is not a horror film. Explanations are just a fiction to make us feel safe. This film does not have explanations. It has events, key moments in the lives of guys who like to drink beer, smoke weed, hang out with Otis' sister and kill random strangers.

He does many unforgivably monstrous things here, but he still manages to go about his business without remorse or fear of getting caught, so we presume he's just a good ol' boy with a short fuse. And he is; he just goes a few steps further than most.Portrait is not about the thin line between good and evil. Portrait sees no line. There are innumerable films about serial killers. It is a permanent fixture in the Middle American zeitgeist. We fear them, so we turn them into our own bloodthirsty entertainment. They have become mythology for us to use in order to take our morbid curiosities and sadistic fantasies out for a safe spin. Even after this definitive film on the subject, it is not often that a movie dares to portray the real ones, unmitigated by thriller tropes.John McNaughton and his late collaborator Richard Fire do not feel the need to pigeonhole or explain them, not just as movie characters but as people. Without a frame of compromise, McNaughton defies the hankering to pump up the volume, to frame Henry in chiaroscuro or Otis with Dutch angles. When most human beings see the things that Henry and Otis actually go through with---feeling no other rationale, it would seem, than that it's simply something for them to do---our immediate reaction is to ask how someone could do such things, and why. As Nick Nolte says as a homicide detective in Ole Bornedal's 1997 thriller, Even when we catch the killer, they wanna know the how and why.That character would agree with McNaughton and Fire that people like Henry and Otis, are well beyond the need to justify what they do. What explanation could there be for slaughtering an entire random family, while recording the whole incident on a camcorder to then watch it later with the blank beer-chugging catatonia of watching an inning of baseball? Horror films, though designed to scare us, are also designed to make us feel safe. The killer was humiliated by his quarries in high school, or has split personality disorder. This film is not a horror film. Explanations are just a fiction to make us feel safe. This film does not have explanations. It has events, key moments in the lives of guys who like to drink beer, smoke weed, hang out with Otis' sister and kill random strangers. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"10 September 2015","score":"","review":" This is a classic example of how sequels are often very disappointing compared to the original. That's not to say that everyone will see this as a let down after MI1, but there is an incredibly different feel from the '96 installment to the '00 one. The first movie had some action, but was primarily concerned with its plot. Granted, that plot was fairly action driven, but not so much as in MI2. The first movie had an aesthetic similar to The Hunt for Red October, while here we had more of a James Bond aesthetic.The primary reason for this is the change in our protagonist, Ethan Hunt. Whereas the first film set him up as more of a Spielberg kind of hero where the situation has more control over him than he does over it, here Ethan makes active decisions and is treated more as a character. Now, on the surface that sounds like a good thing, but it entails him becoming a action hero that acts as a one man show. He has an internal conflict in his relationship with Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), which could easily come off as underdeveloped and overblown. Nyah, a former thief, is brought in to help the IMF stop Sean Ambrose. She has some personality but if far from award-winning on the whole. Sean Ambrose is a slightly clichéd villain, and is similar to Sean Bean's role as 006 in Golden Eye since Ambrose is a former IMF agent that often used Hunt as an alter-ego. This helps make some sense of the whole mask aspect of the MI films since some people's faces are incompatible. Luther is back, but something went wrong with his character this time around. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something about how he was played or scripted or something that was inconsistent with the Luther from the other installments. There are a couple of other minor characters like the biocyte big wig, Dr. Nekhorvich (who is also an antagonist of sorts), Ambrose's head crony, and the IMF superior. You can tell the filmmakers tried to make the characters prominent and somewhat deep, but it didn't come out all that well.The plot revolves around a synthetic virus called Chimera (the villain) and the antidote Bellerophon (the hero). Ambrose and Ethan's IMF team race to gain control of the deadly virus, and eventually Nyah injects herself with it so that Ambrose can't acquire it. Ambrose wants to spread the virus to a bunch of people so that he or whoever he's working for can sell the antidote, thus creating a hero through the creation of a villain. Like the characters, the plot attempted at depth, maybe trying to say that pharmaceutical companies are trying to play us, but ended up being action driven.John Woo made this a very visually vibrant film with a lot of slow motion, often in unnecessary settings, and exotic settings like the Outback and the Spanish festival, plus that inexplicable dove that makes the beginning of the climatic scene feel like it came out of a Lego video game. Hans Zimmer's score was also exotic, and it sounded pretty good with the opera, but it's not one of his best works. The action is shot to look cool and it does, but at a cost Ethan Hunt's invincibility mode is turned up to overdrive. The invincibility of it is not overblown like 2012 or Die Hard, but Ethan survives every battle where the odds are against him and has superior skills that we haven't seen before. The climax involves a sunglass-donning Hunt making a grand escape on a motorcycle and having a bunch of people not hit him with machine guns until he shoots them in one go with a handgun. This goes back to the new Ethan Hunt we see in this second installment, though he basically duplicates his air vent drop from the first movie. After that he proceeds to execute a bunch of motorcycle stunts. The closing fight with Ambrose was done pretty well and the slow-mo there felt called for.If I haven't already stressed this enough, you will be surprised if you expect this to be similar to MI1. It's good to watch if your just looking for action. You have to pay some attention to follow the plot, but it's pretty easy to grasp overall. It may very well come off as a Bond rip-off, but 3 and 4 aren't like that in case you were wondering (rogue nation seems to follow suit in this matter, but I haven't seen it yet). I guess it's a good pick for Tom Cruise fans, but take that lightly please. So watch it for fun and with relatively low expectations to start. Overall Rating 7.2\/10.

Cheung is dressed gorgeously in no less than 46 Cheongsam dresses, each vivid and ornate, and often descends from the shared apartment in this formal dress and make-up to purchase noodles for a lonely dinner. Leung's hair is always immaculately gelled and styled, and he wears his one wrinkled grey suit with a sense of modesty in his presentation. They are in the mood for love, but they do not consummate it, for fears of becoming just like their cheating spouses. Wong Kar-wai's direction ensures that Mr Chan and Mr Chow are never quite clearly sighted face to face, through precise blocking and composition. In one transition, we see Mrs Chow, her back facing towards us via mirror, making another of her excuses over the phone to a lonely Chow at home. We then cut to the same mirror, with Chow now inquiring at her wife's work, his face full and revealing, flushed with honesty, sincerity, and looming heartbreak. The first of the those evocative slow motion moments, where the tender and mournful strings of Yumeji's Theme and the rhythmic Pizzicato plucks rise, has Mrs Chow then Mrs Chan enter the dining room, both with a sense of elegance and beauty. These recurring musical motifs signal each little moment of weakness, of coincidence, of intimacy through unspoken words and emotions. They brush past each other whilst purchasing meals for one in the alleyway, they work closely (but not too closely) on the martial arts serial, they lament their separation and missed opportunities. One time, her hand flirts away when he tries to hold it. Later, they fully wrap around each other and provide comfort in the bottom lit taxi. They belong to their respective spouses, but in that first scene we are already shown an inkling of what is to come. There's a clever moment where we open with a OTS shot of a man and Su having dinner, where she brings up those fateful accusatory words. The confrontation is allowed to continue and simmer with denial, before we finally cut to reveal that they have been simulating the whole thing. But it's remarkably authentic - they choose to wound themselves with imaginary dialogue, too scared to face reality. Doyle's (and later Ping Bing's) cinematography plays plenty with depth of field, often framing Chow and Su's moments from behind curtains, or blinds, or shutters of a cupboard, which are in the foreground and blurry whereas the pair are crystal clear in their emotional intimacy and lack of physical intimacy. This voyeuristic aesthetic works within the context of socially conservative Hong Kong of the 1960s - the supporting cast do well to create an aura of gossip, judgement and scrutiny of every tiny detail of the pair's lives, even more so in the shared proximity of the apartment. Mrs Suen misreads the recipient of a letter from a spouse abroad, and that little mistake is enough to create a storm of doubt and fear within both Su and Chow. My parents lived through this period of HK, and by all accounts the cramped, claustrophobic set is pitch perfect, right down to the fly screen cupboards that served as makeshift fridges. It's limited in scope and size, encapsulating the lack of space and privacy of urban Hong Kong. But it's not grimy; these families live in relative financial comfort in spite their domestic strife. Lush reds, browns, yellow and greens saturate and seep into the screen and work with the bold multicoloured dresses and the noir elements - in one scene a lonely Chow retreats at night to his office, framed by the single overhead light of his desk, the swirls of cigarette smoke billowing in the light and shade. Doyle cuts off the heads frequently and lingers on the body language and the attire, on the pretense of innocence and naivety. A simple dolly of the camera from wall to wall emphasises each lonely soul, so close and yet so far apart. In a lesser film, the presence of convenient downpours of rain might be criticised for a plot device in bringing together a couple. Here, it becomes tragic, because although they have the opportunity (the whole double spouse cheating plot is pretty much a rom-com script waiting to be written), they can't bear to take it. When Su finally gains the courage, she is too late, and the film slows down to an agonising pace where Chow waits for no one in the corridor, the same place Su later stands still, the red of her dress matching the curtains. A hotel, ripe for infidelity, is the location for innocent activities, unable to bridge the gap. In that final scene, Chow travels to Cambodia, finding a hole into the stone of the Angkor Wat Temple before whispering a heavy secret and covering up any presence of his visit with an earthly mound of soil. We then cut, and the soil is now sprouting blades of grass - he has carried this secret with him beyond time. In the Mood for Love is about two people, wrapped up in intimacy yet so full of guilt and sadness and despair for what they have done, and what they haven't. My heart breaks for them.

Or for being stupid enough to get shot in the face? You tell them that they can shove it.If you were alive during the 70's then there is no question in my mind that your favorite actor was Al Pacino. He ruled during that decade. His performance in Serpico playing the title character, an honest cop who refused to participate in the corruptive system that surrounded the NY police department, is considered by many to be his best work, which is saying a lot when you take into account his other films during that four year span both Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon, and Scarecrow. He was nominated for an Oscar for his performances during four straight years and surprisingly came out empty handed. It wouldn't be until his eight nomination in 1993 for his lead performance in Scent of a Woman that he would finally receive his dues (a category in which he was also nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross). It's astonishing to look back at his career and see how many great performances he delivered over time, but especially during the early 70's. Serpico is a film that must be seen primarily for his energetic performance, which foretold what an illustrious career he would have ahead of him. It didn't hurt that the great Sidney Lumet was directing this true story based on the biographical book written by Peter Maas. His choices for location all over the different NY boroughs gave the film a sense of authenticity for this genre film. Lumet was interested in focusing on this character and portraying the emotional effect that the corruptive system had on him in the most realistic way possible and he succeeded. It's been more than 40 years since Serpico has been released and its themes remain relevant to this day.The film opens with a bloodied officer being rushed to a hospital in the back of a police car. We find out that he's an undercover cop named Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) and he has been shot in the face. When one of the police inspector's receives the news his immediate reaction is that a fellow officer must have shot him. The next scene is a close-up shot of Serpico's eyes that are still moving and then the film takes us to the 60's where we see a younger version of him graduating as a police officer from the Academy. From the very beginning we can tell that Serpico is self motivated and honest. He aspires to become a detective, but his idealistic world comes crumbling down when he witnesses his fellow officers accepting bribes from gamblers and drug dealers. They offer him money, but he doesn't accept, which in turns makes him new enemies. His next move is to enlist the help of a trusted officer named Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) who sets him up with higher ranked officers to whom he can report his partners' corruptive behavior, but all they end up doing is transferring him to new divisions. Their promises of cleaning up the department go nowhere and Frank's increasing frustration begins to take a toll on his relationship with his fiancée Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young) as several years go by with the same results. With very few friends and a lot of enemies, Frank knows that his days as a police officer are numbered, but he remains hopeful that someday the truth will be revealed. Lumet expertly manages to portray the passage of time in a rather convincing manner here without resorting to spoon feeding the audience. The editing is handled in superb fashion and Al Pacino's physical transformation is a great indicator of how distrusting of the system he's becoming. He is the driving force of the movie and the main reason why the film succeeds. He gets to shine in the subtle and quiet moments such as when he's simply enjoying his back yard listening to opera and starting a conversation with his next door neighbor, or during the powerful emotional scenes where he takes all his anger and frustration out on his fiancée or a criminal he just busted in the streets. Serpico shaped the genre and the way some action films were being handled by delivering a more authentic and true to life film that added resonance to the subject that was being handled. The material was handled seriously by the screenwriters who delivered an honest adaptation and weren't there simply to entertain audiences, but to deliver a message. That is what has made this such a memorable and thought provoking film to this date. Al Pacino is the only actor who really gets to stand out here because the entire focus is on him and as time passes the rest of the characters come in and out of his life, but he is reason enough to check the film out. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 September 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" What's this for?

That is what has made this such a memorable and thought provoking film to this date.

For bein' an honest cop? Hmm? Or for being stupid enough to get shot in the face? You tell them that they can shove it.If you were alive during the 70's then there is no question in my mind that your favorite actor was Al Pacino. He ruled during that decade. His performance in Serpico playing the title character, an honest cop who refused to participate in the corruptive system that surrounded the NY police department, is considered by many to be his best work, which is saying a lot when you take into account his other films during that four year span both Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon, and Scarecrow. He was nominated for an Oscar for his performances during four straight years and surprisingly came out empty handed. It wouldn't be until his eight nomination in 1993 for his lead performance in Scent of a Woman that he would finally receive his dues (a category in which he was also nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross). It's astonishing to look back at his career and see how many great performances he delivered over time, but especially during the early 70's. Serpico is a film that must be seen primarily for his energetic performance, which foretold what an illustrious career he would have ahead of him. It didn't hurt that the great Sidney Lumet was directing this true story based on the biographical book written by Peter Maas. His choices for location all over the different NY boroughs gave the film a sense of authenticity for this genre film. Lumet was interested in focusing on this character and portraying the emotional effect that the corruptive system had on him in the most realistic way possible and he succeeded. It's been more than 40 years since Serpico has been released and its themes remain relevant to this day.The film opens with a bloodied officer being rushed to a hospital in the back of a police car. We find out that he's an undercover cop named Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) and he has been shot in the face. When one of the police inspector's receives the news his immediate reaction is that a fellow officer must have shot him. The next scene is a close-up shot of Serpico's eyes that are still moving and then the film takes us to the 60's where we see a younger version of him graduating as a police officer from the Academy. From the very beginning we can tell that Serpico is self motivated and honest. He aspires to become a detective, but his idealistic world comes crumbling down when he witnesses his fellow officers accepting bribes from gamblers and drug dealers. They offer him money, but he doesn't accept, which in turns makes him new enemies. His next move is to enlist the help of a trusted officer named Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) who sets him up with higher ranked officers to whom he can report his partners' corruptive behavior, but all they end up doing is transferring him to new divisions. Their promises of cleaning up the department go nowhere and Frank's increasing frustration begins to take a toll on his relationship with his fiancée Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young) as several years go by with the same results. With very few friends and a lot of enemies, Frank knows that his days as a police officer are numbered, but he remains hopeful that someday the truth will be revealed. Lumet expertly manages to portray the passage of time in a rather convincing manner here without resorting to spoon feeding the audience. The editing is handled in superb fashion and Al Pacino's physical transformation is a great indicator of how distrusting of the system he's becoming. He is the driving force of the movie and the main reason why the film succeeds. He gets to shine in the subtle and quiet moments such as when he's simply enjoying his back yard listening to opera and starting a conversation with his next door neighbor, or during the powerful emotional scenes where he takes all his anger and frustration out on his fiancée or a criminal he just busted in the streets.

It's from 1999. This is most likely the actor Haley Joel Osment's, most memorable film. I haven't seen him in films in awhile, and if you look at recent pictures from him, you'll think about how he was a cute kid, but he hasn't aged well. That being said, I'm a little older than Haley Joel Osment and if you saw me you'd think I look young for my age. Like there are employees at work who once guessed I was 14, and then said I look 18. 14 is a little too young, I don't think I look that young. But, to people who feel old one thing is for sure and that's not all of us age the same. Some look old for their age, while some look young. You could look at names of celebrities who don't age online and celebrities from Modern Family would come up, like Sofia Vergara\/Gloria, and Sarah Hyland\/Haley. You'd also see names like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. But, if you look at celebrities who have aged badly, you'd see Haley Joel Osment's name.OK, talking about aging was off topic. But, I just wanted to leave a random message on an IMDb movie review. That's if you're feeling old, remember there's nothing you can do about your age. How old you are since when you were born. What you do with your body might age you faster or slower. But, we are not as old as we might think we are. Because, apparently not everybody ages the same.So, to get to my point this movie is a great Thriller. It was like the top film back in 1999 next to The Phantom Menace. It's been well received and well remembered. It also more than likely is the director M. Night Shyamalan's most memorable\/successful film. Some of his more recent films like The Last Airbender, and After Earth haven't done well. Another film of his is coming out tomorrow, The Visit. That film looks entertaining, but looks like it will be more cheesy and like it's a modern version of Hansel And Gretel. That film like this film is also taking place in my home state and has scenes in Philadelphia. Man, I don't hear about these movies in the news being filmed locally, or see any sign of a film crew around. I wonder if I could have been an extra in one of these movies? They show a scene in The Visit at the train station in Philadelphia 30th Street Station. I've been there lots of times, but never heard of a film project over there. It's interesting to think where movies have been filmed, and how the director of both movies who grew up around Philadelphia has his movies from there.So, I've mostly been off topic. But, what makes this movie great. Well, up until a couple of years ago I hadn't seen this movie for more than a decade. I remembered it, but it wasn't a movie I cared to see. I mostly remembered the movie being dark and depressing. Like yeah, even if you haven't seen it you more than likely are familiar with the line, I See Dead People from this movie. Also, we see the character played by Haley Joel Osment sad in a lot of scenes including deleted scenes. It almost seemed like a young, lonely, isolated boy who had problems that wouldn't go away, and focusing on dead people. Also, it seemed a little like a quiet dark movie, which it is. This isn't a fast paced horror movie. But, it will definitely keep you entertained. My perceptions from this movie have changed from the last couple of times I saw it. I even last saw this movie when I was having a depressing day myself, when I normally don't have depressing days. The movie definitely helped put me in a better mood, and I was able to laugh at a couple of scenes. I got myself into the movie both times I saw it, and it's not as depressing of a movie as I remember. This movie also is a clever story. Being able to see dead people. Though, if you look the the story wasn't something M. Night Shyamalan came up with on his own. He came up with the idea from an episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark. He already would have been an adult when that episode aired, and got his idea from a kids TV show. Though this movie won't feel like it's a kids movie even when the main character is a kid, and even if it was inspired by a kids TV show. It will also seem more serious than a TV show like Ghost Whisperer, which also involves a girl being able to see the dead.I ought to say, I won't tell you what it is, even if you haven't seen it you probably already heard of the twist. This movie is famous for a Twist At The End. Almost nobody who saw this movie for the first time and wasn't already told what it was, could figure the twist out that's revealed at the end. There are even clues leading to the twist, but they most likely won't seem apparent to anybody who doesn't already know what it is. I heard the movie coming out tomorrow, The Visit is supposed to have an ending Twist, and I'm not sure what it is?I'll give this movie an 8\/10. It's not my favorite movie, but it is still an entertaining movie to watch.

Black to send his pulp novel out on the big screen beat, Ernest Tidyman gives Shaft's lifestyle a slight Blaxploitation edge which is gripped by a strong,grubby Film Noir atmosphere.Taking their time to put Shaft in the middle of a gang war,Black and Tidyman brilliantly place Shaft as a Film Noir loner,with Shaft keeping his guard up as he speaks to white police officers,whilst never fitting in with the ruthless gangsters steeping down his neighborhood.Filmed on location,director Gordon Parks (who has a funny cameo in the film) and cinematographer Urs Furrer drain the Blaxploitation genre of any decadence,to unveil a tough,to the bone Neo-Noir atmosphere.Following Shaft as he searches every den for Marcy,Parks and Furrer open up every den with tightly held shots which fully display the brittle paint and rotting wood of the buildings which are inhabited by thugs who are rotten to the core.Taking on Shaft, Moses Gunn gives a fantastic performance as Bumpy Jonas,with Gunn opening wounds of doubt in Jonas unbreakable public image,as Jonas begins to fear that he has gotten his daughter involved in a deadly matter that he is helpless to resolve.Walking down the decayed streets, Richard Roundtree (who appears naked!) gives a dazzling performance as Shaft,thanks to Roundtree giving Shaft a cool swagger which never oversteps the sharp quick-wits that Roundtree shows Shaft use with a gripping determination ,as the audience discover who is the man.

The catch represents both baseball and Jessica Biel. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays an amateur baseball player who will romance Biel after he mows over a rose garden. His father is widowed, his brother is a bartender. His best friend is unable to cope with aluminum bats just as I am unable to cope with the entire running time of this film. This garbage is about as exciting as cleaning toilets. Mike Tollin does well directing the baseball footage while the rest looks as if he was half asleep, which would not surprise me given what the film is. Another horrible performance by Prinze Jr. with Biel featured for no other purpose than to rise bikini clad out of a swimming pool much to the delight of young hormones. We do not care about this romance nor do we care about anything else associated with the story. Matthew Lillard plays Prinze's frustrated best friend who may be even more frustrated when he realizes that this garbage will never be labeled a classic. Boring farce with sex scenes involving beer bottles between thighs. That is about the height of the creative energy within this film. Next time, instead of a rose garden, why not introduce this film to the lawn mower blades.

This powerful film is a deep examination of human psychology which explains how we often judge an incident based on our own perceptual biases, close mindedness and own experience rather than the facts produced from that incident. A Hispanic teenage boy, born and raised in a slum, was accused of killing his father and was in trial. There were two concrete pieces of evidences which were enough to put the boy in the electric chair. But the final decision has to come from the juries and so they retired to the jury room after the judge asked them to come up with their verdict. It looked like an open and shut case until one juror (juror 8) vetoed and wanted to go through the facts again. Eleven members of the jury did not think otherwise and tried to convince him that he was wrong. Juror 8 did not have any concrete proof of otherwise but he raised his concern about the authenticity of the facts and incidents that has been produced during the case. Slowly, through his power of logic, patience and negotiation, he inspired the other juries to look into the facts from a fresh and different perspective. In fact he leaded them with some insights which seemed impossible to comprehend to the others. Inspired by his insights some of them started to delve into the facts, came out of their stereotypical mentalities, started to ask the right questions and finally came out with some startling perspectives which made their own earlier statements doubtful. The colour and pace of this black & white film came from the cohesive storyline and the arguments and counter arguments presented by the juries. This is a drama where the characters flourished in their respective roles to their fullest extent and likewise this is a thriller where the excitement came through sharp arguments. The film never shows whether the accused is guilty or innocent, neither does it draw its curtains on finding the murderer. It does not show any arguments between lawyers, it does not even give away the names of all the juries. Even though the plot is centred around a murder, the concept is centred around unravelling the psychology of human decision making. Perhaps, these are the reasons why this film is so different from any other court room dramas I have ever seen. A perfect classic!
