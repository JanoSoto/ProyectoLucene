[{"date":"22 September 1998","score":"","review":"  Matt Damon plays another kid who is really good at something in another film written by first-time screen-writers (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) in John Dahl's  ROUNDERS.On one track, and one track only, this movie plays an adept hand When the action is focused on a decent card game, or the surrounding accoutrements of the rounder subculture, the often incisive writing and first-class acting (especially, by Damon, Norton, Malkovich, and Martin Landau as one of Damon's law professors) ROUNDERS hits its stride.  But, almost everything else surrounding -- and ostensibly, supporting -- this drama lacks luster, is cheap, clicheic, and ultimately one big bluff.Part of the reason ROUNDERS fails is that the conflict is weak.  The way that it is presented to us, the conflict is between Matt Damon having to choose between his law school career (and the girlfriend that goes with it, Gretchen Mol, just as dealt out of the game here as she was as DONNIE BRASCO's wife) and the cards.  But, the problem is that the screenwriters stacked the decks such that there is no real choice or conflict involved; the law school scenario is so thinly written that it's tedious.  All the characters associated with that world are forgettable, such that even Martin Landau cannot pull off a completely misplaced and tortured scene in the middle of act two in which he attempts to flesh himself out in a lengthy dialogue scene that was, at best, reminiscent of a similarly ill-placed soliloquy by a superfluous character in the middle of SCREAM 2.

The Last Days of Disco is essentially an incidental theme to Stillman's third film, the plotline really revolves around young Americans falling in and out of love at the same time as commenting on the various mores of their social set. The film is heavily laced with irony, as is typical to Stillman's other films Metropolitan and Barcelona. Again, many of the jokes and humour will pass over the heads of some people unfamiliar with Stillman's style but it is well worth sticking out and\/or viewing again. Stillman's obvious fondness for snobbery in modern American society is matched by his sharp perception. This third in an often (and perhaps erroneously) claimed trilogy examines the context of the club-going social set in the early eighties, unlike Metropolitan which examined the debutante set and Barcelona which was rooted in foreign perception of American culture. All are set in the early Eighties and make particular reference to those times. In this film, in particular, spot the many Disney references and the folly of the Railway Apartments. The film has a very glossy look to it, especially in the actual disco, and this draws clever comparison to the later scenes in the characters house, where affluence (or lack thereof) is denoted by the mise en scene. The film's soundtrack is excellent, featuring many forgotten disco hits. Kate Beckinsdale and Matt Keeslar deliver outstanding performances in their roles with Chloe Sevigny and Chris Eigeman providing their usual excellent work.
