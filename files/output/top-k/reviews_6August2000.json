It's not slick, or glossy, or brilliantly directed.  But it made me laugh, a lot, and loudly, and since that's all this picture, directed by In Living Color's Keenen Ivory Wayans, is going for, I guess that means it works.The picture's plot is a hodgepodge of elements from Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and countless other horror films from the last twenty years, as a dumb-ass fright-masked killer stalks a gang of epically dimwitted teenagers at B.A. Corpse High School.  During this story (and I use the term as loosely as possible), the plot finds time to take out-of-nowhere swipes at Dawson's Creek, Amistad, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, and probably about fifty other movies I'm leaving out. The screenplay (credited to six writers, including Shawn and Marlon Wayans) is one of those everything-but-the-kitchen- sink affairs, and to be sure, there's a fair share of groaners here.  But this film, even with all that, still has more laugh-out-loud funny moments than any comedy I've seen this year.A lot of credit has to be given to the cast.  It's really refreshing, after so many bad teen films with fashion-model types posturing and trying to look deep, to see a group of young actors throw themselves into this disgusting, ridiculous material with such unfettered gusto.  They're unafraid to look stupid, to make their audience sick, to embarass themselves, and it takes the film to comic highs.  Of course, there are a few standouts in this admittedly large group.  Anna Faris, as the film's Neve \/ Jennifer Love good girl, has a winsome sexiness in addition to a deft touch with a joke. Carmen Electra effectively sends up her bimbo image in the picture's opening sequence, and Shawn Wayans steals the picture from everyone as the most ineffectively closeted homosexual in cinematic history (he also gets what I think you will agree is the most delightfully vulgar death scene ever).Keenen Ivory Wayans' direction is not polished or comically elegant, but enough of his jokes hit that you realize you're in the hands of someone who knows his yuks.  And speaking of yuck, this being a contemporary comedy, many of the jokes skitter over the boundaries of taste into true gross-out territory.  There are genital jokes, breast-implant jokes, oral-sex jokes, and a sex scene that gives new meaning to the term It's a gusher!  Still, the yardstick for scenes like this, if this type of humor doesn't offend you, is simply whether or not you laugh.  Me, Myself & Irene left me cold. I laughed at Scary Movie's scatology.  And there you have it.What else is there to say, really?  If you like horror movies and are in the mood to see them get a roasting, or if you just need a good gross laugh, you can't do much better right now than Scary Movie.  It breathes new life into the parody genre, and one hopes that the Wayans boys do just as well with their next satirical target.  May I suggest a Battlefield Earth parody?

As of today, the series still have a prominent place in my video cabinet. I have T-shirts; posters; promotional cards; TV-scripts; books; newspaper articles, etc. I was one of the editors of Dutch fanzine `The Lynchburg Chronicles'. A couple of months ago, almost ten years after the pilot was aired for the first time, I flew to Seattle and decided to wander around in that strange twilight zone where places from a piece of fiction really exist. I took the greyhound bus to Snoqualmie and North Bend and shamelessly behaved like a crazy tourist, even taking pictures of cherry pie while having lunch at the Mar-T diner (renamed as Tweed's diner) which featured prominently in the pilot episode. Anyway, a friend of mine once stated that only a real Peakie should be allowed to review the bashed movie prequel Fire Walk With Me -- what do you think, folks, do I pass the test? But seriously, people who hadn't seen the series didn't understand what the heck was going on in that film. But, hey, neither did Peakies so I don't necessarily agree with that friend.A lot of filmmakers fail when they do something for television. In my review of `It', I pointed out that directors like Tobe Hooper and Tommy Wallace, whose feature film work heavily relies on violence and gore, had some trouble with dealing with TV censorship, resulting in little creative or scary projects. Although the feature work of David Lynch very often contains violence and gore, he is also capable of creating a very unsettling atmosphere. Lynch uses sounds, darkness, silence, lighting, and suggestions to make you feel uneasy. When he turned to television to do Twin Peaks, he had to leave the nudity, violence and gore behind, but pumped the unsettling atmosphere to the max, creating dozens of unforgettable moments, like the shocking death scenes of cousin Maddy and Laura Palmer.In 1992, Lynch did FWWM, which was a quickie as less than a year went by from producing company Ciby 2000 giving the director the green light, to the movie premiering in Cannes; it shows as the movie looks kind of cheap, less polished as most other Lynch features. The film's first cut had to be brought back from 4 ½ hrs to 2 hrs 15 minutes. As a result, the film isn't the story of the people of the town of Twin Peaks, but only the story of one of them, Laura Palmer. After a so-severely-cut-it-hardly-makes-any-sense-prologue featuring a bunch of stars &#145;investigating' the death of Teresa Banks, we move on to Laura's dark world of sex and drugs and stay there for more than an hour and a half. Do you expect any answers to questions you had in the series? Well, forget it, &#145;cause not only Lynch doesn't answer any one of them but even creates new ones with a incoherent story where (new) characters are doing weird things for the sake of weirdness. And yet, unlike the series, the tone has become serious and pretentious. There's no real story here, just a collection of moments from Laura's last week in no real particular order (Kubrick's The Shining had a similar flaw). But what mainly bothers me about this movie is the fact that not only Lynch couldn't resist the possibility to use nudity and violence this time, but that these particular Lynch characteristics replace all the other subtle one he used to full extend in the series and which made it so interesting, unique, and scary. So, this time around, we HEAR Laura and Bobby cussing; we SEE Laura getting raped, getting drunk, getting high, getting naked. Hey, Lynch starts the film with a television set being smashed to pieces. Was he making a point here? Was he happy to return to the big screen? What do YOU think? The most painful moment, emphasizing this film's primary flaw, comes when the movie concludes with recreating a scene we already saw in the series Laura getting killed. In the series Lynch uses sparse lighting, deep darkness, eerie sounds, silence, certain expressions on his actors faces and suggestive camera-angles to create a very haunting moment. In the film, Lynch just uses violence and blood to create...well, a rather dull scene.Of course I own the movie on video. Of course I (kind of) enjoy it. But whereas many critics slowly and carefully start to give this film a second look, I guess the film's many flaws become more noticeable with every viewing. I'm two steps away from calling it a butchered, uneven, incoherent mess.The acting? Well, Sheryl Lee delivers a performance that's somewhere in that gray area between Oscar-material and overacting. Same thing goes for Ray Wise. Chris Isaak and David Bowie ARE Chris Isaak and David Bowie. Moira Kelly is mediocre. The best acting can be found with the supporting cast Dana Ashbrook (Bobby); James Marshall (James); Walter Olkewicz (Jaques); Grace Zabriskie (Sarah).The scene where Chris Isaak comes to a small town and is ridiculed by a dumb deputy, a giggling secretary, and a bad ass sheriff is quite impressive and, in my humble opinion, the film's sole merit.6 out of 10.

Oh, by the way, I said produced didn't I, but I forgot to mention the masters name...Producer extraordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer adds yet another great movie to his resume (including Armageddon, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, American Gigolo, and Top Gun among many others).  Bruckheimer also maintains his reputation for producing movies that first and foremost deal with entertaining his audience...such as Coyote Ugly.  This movie offers something for everyone, whether it be attractive women controlling men completely, a great sound track, an aussie hunk, a decent love story, comic relief, a great new talent in Piper Perabo, or the time tested lovable antics of John Goodman... Coyote Ugly delivers.  What the critics seemed to have forgotten the occasional attraction we simple moviegoers have to a movie that is just fun to watch.  When it comes down to it, that is all Coyote Ugly really is, a fun movie that provides a solid two hours of entertainment for an audience weary of pumped up thrillers and human dramas that leave you in a far worse mood that if you had never even heard of the movie.  If you want an earth-shattering tale of tragedy I would suggest that you stay away from that rollicking good time that is Coyote Ugly.

All these aspects remain in my second viewing, but the ending seems to negate everything that precedes it.  Throughout the film the story is Derek's hatred and his subsequent enlightenment and how Daniel is headed down the same destructive path.  We're led to believe that Daniel, by being made to write about his brother, will realize the error of his ways and change his outlook while he's still young and impressionable to do so.So if this is the point of the story, why do the filmmakers have Daniel murdered in his high school bathroom by some kid that got in his face?  Obviously, since he's dead, everything that he just learned the night before means absolutely nothing.  Are the filmmakers saying that it was already too late to help Daniel?  Why give more pain to Derek and his family in Daniel's brutal, practically random slaying?  Derek's already learned what he needed to.  Or did the filmmakers just want one more final shocker to tidy up the movie. Why not have him live, and the audience walk out hoping, praying, that he becomes a better man?

This film is a genuine masterpiece of  the highest quality.Not a particularly difficult story but Bergman adds to the common strand a morality & immorality of God's existence along with the eternal contradictions of what the purpose of man's existence is upon this sacred Earth.After returning from the Crusades hundreds of years ago, Sydow (Antonius Bloc) and his squire return to a plaque ravaged Sweden where people are dying a horrid death and the sinners tour the country pleading to be exorcised of their sins.Bloc is confronted by the Grim Reaper (Bengt Ekerot) on (of all places )a beach. But before Death takes his soul Bloc offers him a game of chess for his life.The chess match continues throughout the film and as we do we see Bloc's tortured mind unravel as his rides between towns seeing the misery the plague (and its owner, Death) is causing. And he wonders why God is punishing these people so harshly.In addition we see other characters living their humdrum lives playing very close to the 10 Commandments, where individual steal,  murder, lie & betray. Very gradually these sad but doomed individuals all gather along with Bloc and end up in a great castle where their ultimate fate awaits them.You really have to see this movie at least twice to unravel the mind of both Bloc & the director, Bergman, for although the story is relatively straightforward, its the intellectual philosophising & existentuality that you really have to understand.Each character is nothing more than a symbol or parody for some human weakness or foible. Each character believes in God but sees him in a different way when it suits them and often don't realise until its too late that Death doesn't just reach out for the old, sick or the sinners of their world.But it is to Sydow's grand Knight that the real pain of human existence is focused upon. Having returned from the many battles of the Crusades, preaching the word of God & righteousness to foreigners he returns to his homeland to find a country ravaged by a plague that knows no social condition young, old, rich, poor, believer or sinner, they are all doomed.Sydow character is racked with so many feelings of guilt & hatred for both God and Death. Yet he wonders why he should die so soon when he has done God's work and is still left with so many things to do.Bergman is the master when it comes to magnifying our human frailties; his characters are nothing special, just ordinary people and yet they, like us, hide so many sins, that eventually we will pay for our crimes.Bergman doesn't have to hurry the film along, although you sometimes feel nothing very much happens between scenes. But everything is timed & framed for a reason that is not immediately obvious but only becomes clear later in the film.And of course filming in black & white gives the story a very bleak feel, and could also be seen as an allegory of life\/death &  good\/bad. I was especially moved by one scene near the beginning where Death & Bloc play their first moves with the sea in the background & dark clouds surrounding both of them like a deathly shroud.To some THE SEVENTH SEAL will appear too pretentious to really appeal; and I suspect a lot of the symbolism & reasoning will not be recognised. But its a film to be patient with, it deserves our respect because when we see these poor innocent characters waiting for their Calling, we are in fact looking at ourselves!!!*****\/*****  ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2000","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  No argument, no doubts, no reservations!

Jane Austen's novels are gems of societal observation, and although limited to the goings-on among the privileged classes of the time (early 19th century) they capture the essence and texture of their lives beautifully.In adapting works for the screen and a modern audience it must be tempting for the screenwriter and director to try to appeal to current sensibilities in the interests of the box office, but I think to do so with Austen's work would be to miss the point.The considered politeness, emotional restraint and carefully embroidered speech must seem quaint indeed to those brought up on a diet of murder, destruction and tawdry social mores, but portraying those qualities faithfully is surely the whole reason for making a film like this.Emma Thompson's screenplay is therefore a tour de force in retaining the feel and relevance of the piece and presenting us with a charming movie with large-as-life characters you can care about, taking only a few liberties to enhance playability and dramatic effect.The awkward balance between love, honour and financial pragmatism that affected both sexes at the time is finely drawn and acted so that we can empathise with the plight of the major characters and recognise the echoes of their dilemmas today.A first class cast, beautiful authentic surroundings and excellent cinematography demonstrate once again that for period-pieces the Poms are supreme.
