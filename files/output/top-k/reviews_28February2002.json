Scotland is in Britain, people, its that sticky-out part at the top. Scots ARE British, although a lot of us don't like that fact and would rather be considered Scots before we were considered British. (I'm not talking about everybody here though). Secondly, many of the reviews list all of the historical inaccuracies in this film. It is clear that there are many of these as we can see from the other reviews (i think someone even said that Edinburgh was an English town that the Scots took over? This is nonsense as far as i know - Edinburgh has always been in Scotland! I live there!) Yes, Murron was not the name of Wallace's wife (it was Marion), and yes, the French princess and Wallace never did have an affair and probably never actually met at all, and yes, Wallace did commit his fair share of atrocities against English people too, and yes, he was not a commoner etc etc etc i could go on, but this is not meant to be a lesson in Scots history, and neither is the movie.

It's an enjoyable movie for the most part, although some of the dodgy Scots accents are questionable and sound more like Northern Irish to me, but on the whole, it's an emotional and well directed film. The musical score is excellent too. One small grievance though - after the film was released, they put up a hideous statue in Stirling, supposed to be William Wallace, but it looked exactly like Mel Gibson!

I've seen Pink Flamingos, which features acrobatic genitals, a morbidly obese woman in a playpen eating eggs and a drag queen eating dog poop.  That didn't offend me.  I laughed the whole way through Natural Born Killers.  However, this seemingly innocent 'romantic comedy' made me want to destroy everything around me.I wish I could say that I'm not mincing my words.  Obviously, I have to. Which is probably for the best.If you don't know the premise of the movie already, good for you.  Matt (Hartnett) is a slut.  He has been single for six months and is having sex with any female in sight.  But, oh, the poor guy is still hung up on his ex-girlfriend.  So, even though he's a huge whore, he gets freaked out after the act, and sometimes during the act since he's still thinking about his one true love.  He confides his problems to his brother, a priest-in-training.  Matt then decides to do the 'unthinkable' - no sex (or sex-related activities) for 40 days!  But, then he meets a girl, starts liking her a whole lot, and, for some reason, feels compelled to lie about the fact that he's taken a vow of celibacy for Lent.  People are betting that he can't make it.  Stuff happens, and I hate this movie.From a technical standpoint, yes, this movie was well made.  Clever edits and sight gags.  Better than average.  The acting was well done.  The writing wasn't terrible.  It was a bit dated (Matt is a 'dot commer'), but, it was fairly snappy.However, this film made me sick.It made me sick on many different levels.  It sickens me when people are reduced to nothing more than their most base urges.  Yes, people get horny, but that's not the primary motivation in people's lives.  I refuse to believe that it is.  There are schools of philosophy that teach that we are little more than pleasure-seeking machines.  I disagree with those schools greatly.While I am not the most religious person in the world, I don't stand for religions being debased in this way.  Any religion.  It's one thing to make a religious satire like The Life of Brian or a song like `Every Sperm is Sacred'.  It's quite another to pass off a vow of celibacy for Lent as being equal to the temptations Christ faced while fasting in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights.  It's one thing make the suicide scene in M*A*S*H look like `The Last Supper'.  It's just plain wrong to make Josh Hartnett into a Christ-symbol by being handcuffed to a bed so he won't break his vow.Sex, or the lack thereof, can be a very, very funny thing.  `Seinfeld' did it very well on at least two occasions.  The `Master of My Domain' episode is a perfect example of this.  So is any episode of `Benny Hill' or `Laugh-In'.  Things like that deconstruct sex, show just how silly and stupid and just plain fun it is.  40 Days and 40 Nights elevated it to such a level, made it the primary focus of every character in the movie that there are no redeemable people in the movie.  Everyone in the film is a slut, or wishes that they were.  I wish I were kidding.The movie hates women.  Which sickens me even more.  I've been watching the Fight Club DVD for about a week.  Fight Club features such lines as `If I had a tumor, I'd name it Marla,' and `We're a generation of men raised by our mothers.  Maybe another woman isn't what we need in our life.'  One scene in 40 Days features 2 women trying to regain the 'power' of withholding sex back from Matt by making out in front of him to make him break his vow.  Another has a woman spreading her legs to show off the tattoo on her inner thigh, making the most unsubtle innuendoes ever, and then making a photocopy of her butt, just in case he changes his mind. The female lead, Erica, is frustrated because she has such a great relationship with Matt, but she isn't having sex with him.  Fine, we get the point. It's not just men that think about sex.  But, why portray women as being men without the same anatomy?  As I stated earlier, everyone in the movie is a slut.  A trollop.  A whore.What sickens me the most is that this movie will make lots and lots of money.  It comes out less than a week after Fox aired a show about a bunch of fat people gorging themselves on mayonnaise, hard-boiled eggs and butter to prove who was the most deserving of being executed by John Doe from Se7en.  Now, we are treated to a movie that reduces the audience to nothing more than genitals with bodies attached, and tries to make us laugh about it.  It takes one of the most sacred times of the Christian year and turns it into a joke.  It takes the concept of strengthening yourself through self-denial and turns it into a parlor game.  Perhaps I'm being puritanical. Perhaps I should lighten up.  Perhaps I'm just waiting for the return of vomitoriums so we can continue gorging ourselves until our society collapses under the weight of its own excesses.Did I mention that this movie offended me?

Not much is ever really developed about them, aside from the fact that they seem to like to whine a lot (never a good sign) and the young lady absolutely cannot use a manual car.From here it's all basically over. The movie commits several fatal errors that absolutely destroy the mood that it is trying to create. First of all the characters are completely without well ... character. They seem to just be shells of the average teenager with no real inclinations, wants or, humanity leading to a lack of interest in what happens to them. Further compounding this fact is that the characters can both be extremely annoying. At one point the young lady and the young man are simply calling each others names and making excruciatingly long pauses between sentences. At another point the young lady does nothing but grind their cars gears for upwards of five minutes in, hands-down, the most annoying scene in the movie. This seems to be a mistake throughout the movie. All the characters are exterminating before they can be developed. At one point there are actually 2 sympathetic police officers who try to help the kids...thwak...well there go those characters, and so on.Second the movie has not explanation of it. The creature (revealed half way through the movie, ruining the suspense, and showing the obvious shortcomings of the special effects in this movie) is never explained, why it does what it does, what it is, where it came from. Granted I'm not expected a thesis on the subject, but i certainly want an explanation. The whole movie felt similar to this, just sort of chugging along, assuming the viewer is going to understand the sometimes outright lack of sense in the plot (the inclusion of the psychic, who served no purpose). These people seemed to have forgottent here was an audience involved in the process when ironing out the continuity of this movie.Lastly, the ending (which i will not reveal) is absolutely criminal. It is abrupt, ill-timed, and completely unsatisfactory. I'm not opposed to the kind of ending portrayed here, just the sudden and empty inclusion of it.I will give the movie one piece of credit. The scene in the police station in which the police are communicating via radio and trying to combat the Creeper is suspenseful and delicious in so many ways, it's a shame that the rest of the movie wasn't as good. Still te fact that the police appear at the end of the scene in riot gear and with M-16's which are never used is downright unforgivable...In conclusion, there's a lot more I could say in oppostion to this movie, bt I'll just leave you with this... If you liked Dracula 2000 see this movie, otherwise steer clear unless you want to see a Tales from the Crypt episode stretched out into 2 hours in a worse fashion than the official Tales from the Crypt series.

Not much is ever really developed about them, aside from the fact that they seem to like to whine a lot (never a good sign) and the young lady absolutely cannot use a manual car.From here it's all basically over. The movie commits several fatal errors that absolutely destroy the mood that it is trying to create. First of all the characters are completely without well ... character. They seem to just be shells of the average teenager with no real inclinations, wants or, humanity leading to a lack of interest in what happens to them. Further compounding this fact is that the characters can both be extremely annoying. At one point the young lady and the young man are simply calling each others names and making excruciatingly long pauses between sentences. At another point the young lady does nothing but grind their cars gears for upwards of five minutes in, hands-down, the most annoying scene in the movie. This seems to be a mistake throughout the movie. All the characters are exterminating before they can be developed. At one point there are actually 2 sympathetic police officers who try to help the kids...thwak...well there go those characters, and so on.Second the movie has not explanation of it.

The plot simple enough, is even a bit overused in the film industry marketed towards women girl leaves home in search of her own.  Along the way she finds renewed friendship, romance, and her dreams come true.  Trite?  Of course, but MTV Films tries to make this coming-of-age movie more edgy and sexy, by adding the number one pop diva of our time.The outcome of the story is unsurprising from the beginning, a plot like this seems all too familiar (2000 film, Coyote Ugly?), but take the film for what it is  a modern-day cliche-ridden, and utterly predictable film from the start, but aren't most chick flicks now a days anyway?  Give Miss Spears a break--granted she hasn't been as successful as other crossover artists, such as Jennifer Lopez, but she hasn't been as unsuccessful as NSYNC's Lance Bass (his 2001 film debut in On the Line, reviewed far worse).  I'd give her performance a 6 out of ten.Crossroads isn't Oscar worthy, in the least, but does a movie have to win an award to make you laugh, or smile, or even feel good?  No matter how predictable, or even cheesy it is, Crossroads has a feel-good vibe, and if you don't read too much into it, could even be considered a good film. Spears is underdeveloped as an actress, but obviously puts her whole heart and soul into the film; lucky for the singing sensation they grant her a 5 minute karaoke scene in which she gets to belt out Joan Jett's hit, `I love Rock 'n' Roll', while swivelling her trademark hips and showing her famous navel.The Queen of Pop might be better suited to rule over her own kingdom, but for her first premier film debut, it could've been worse, and Britney definitely did leave me satisfied. As a skeptic from the beginning, I hesitantly paid my $5.00 to watch 94 minutes of the Queen of Pop prance around in her undies and a towel.  And surprisingly, I had a good time!

Simply said, if a plot centered towards pre-teen to young adults, starring teen idol Britney Spears doesn't float your boat, don't pay to see Crossroads.  Like many other MTV flicks that attempt to help music stars cross over, Crossroads isn't any different.  It doesn't have A+ actors or even Oscar-worthy script writers, but take it as it is, a film created by Music Television; these are the people who also brought you Road Trip, the grossly disgusting hit of 2000--I think they've come along way since then.If you can ignore the fact that Britney Spears is the star of this film (for those of you that are revolted by the thought!) there is the possibility that this film will bring you some enjoyment.  And for a pop star that's `not a girl, not yet a woman', Britney Spears gives a mediocre performance.

Sure, Bruckheimer's past efforts were laughable, unchallenging pieces of eye candy, so it would not be unheard of him making a war movie.  Pearl Harbour is evidence enough of that.  But Ridley Scott's films hold a special place in my heart.  Alien is a favourite, as is Blade Runner and I was even slightly stirred by G.I. Jane, not for its Demi Moore showboating but its style.  Scott's movies have often been so exquisitely stylish they border on mouth-watering.  But a Bruckheimer \/ Scott produced, Scott directed WAR movie?Still, given the visual treats Scott has offered audiences in his more recent films (Gladiator and Hannibal), Black Hawk Down was to be no exception.  And it isn't.  This is a film so visceral it begs the question of the audience Am I actually in this war scene?!  Only seeing famous faces like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor and Tom Sizemore can bring the audience back down to reality.  That only happens when there is an all but brief delay in the chaos of combat.The premise for this film is based on true events.  Taken from the non-fiction book of the same name, Black Hawk Down is the account of three platoons of US forces in Somalia during late 1993.  On one October day, US officials, in all their wisdom, decide to capture Somali warlord General Mohammed Farrah Aidid's two senior lieutenants.  Sending in elite Delta Force, Ranger and SOPR troops to capture the two men, the Americans run into stiff resistance as their helicopters are shot down.  What was to be an abduction turns into a desperate rescue mission.The film opens with a brief history of the US involvement in Somalia accompanied by some colour de-saturated shots of the famine and horror of the situation.  While it may seem overblown initially, as the film moves on you really do realise that this is what it was like for the people of Somalia pure hell.  The streets are littered with dead bodies, the buildings destroyed and the sheer hellishness of the place can turn even the most stout of all stomachs.  You have to pinch yourself and understand that this really did happen.With the historical background behind us in the first twenty minutes, a number of key characters are introduced.  Many of the players in the book (which was taken from the 29-part serialised Philadelphia Enquirer story by Mark Bowden) are omitted.  Despite this there is a big character list, some of whom we forget or mistake for other characters.  Huge cast aside, Josh Harnett plays Staff Sergeant Matt Eversman, a Ranger who has just been promoted to group leader.  His crew consists of some familiar faces, including Ewan McGregor as desk-jockey turned combatant Specialist Danny Grimes.  William Fichtner, who audiences will recognise from Contact, Go and The Perfect Storm, plays Sergeant First Class Jeff Sanderson.  He is the group leader of the ultra-elite Delta Force, which includes Aussie Chopper star Eric Bana as the Rambo-like Sergeant First Class Norm Hooten. Tom Sizemore plays Colonel Danny McKnight and leads the Humvee-driving SOPR team.  Sam Shepard plays General William Garrison, who envisioned the mission.  It's a big roll call, and I haven't included many other names and faces that you will recognise.Such is the pace of Black Hawk Down that you lose time.  The film is brilliantly edited, with quick cuts, slow-mo, fades, dissolves and colour filters used frequently. Scott delves deep into his bag of cinematic tricks to keep you pinned down or on the edge of your seat.  The quality of sound is spectacular with roaring gunfire dispersed with screams of pain.  Not an easy ride at all, but one you feel better for witnessing at the film's conclusion.  There are many similarities to other notable war movies including Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan, but Black Hawk Down is nowhere near as trippy as the former or gory as the latter.  Sure, it is violent and may not suit all tastes, but the violence is necessary as it simply reinforces the mental and physical torture of war.There is little room for character development or introspection, and despite its display of American military muscle, this is definitely an anti-war film.  Kudos must go to Bruckheimer, who has broken the mould here from his other films.  He even managed to borrow real Black Hawk helicopters from the US Army and convinced the President of Morocco to allow the film to be shot in its city streets.  Perhaps we can expect more high-budget, high-quality films from him in the future?As the opening titles of the film reads from Plato, 'Only the dead have seen the end of war', by films end we agree with that sentiment.  The final images of the film reinforce how desperate many of the world's hotspots are, and also, how easy and luxurious our own lives are.  Post September 11 Black Hawk Down may actually lose some of its impact regarding the use of American troops in foreign conflicts, but it is more so a timely reminder that war, no matter who is involved, is hell.

But Ridley Scott's films hold a special place in my heart.  Alien is a favourite, as is Blade Runner and I was even slightly stirred by G.I. Jane, not for its Demi Moore showboating but its style.  Scott's movies have often been so exquisitely stylish they border on mouth-watering.  But a Bruckheimer \/ Scott produced, Scott directed WAR movie?Still, given the visual treats Scott has offered audiences in his more recent films (Gladiator and Hannibal), Black Hawk Down was to be no exception.

On one October day, US officials, in all their wisdom, decide to capture Somali warlord General Mohammed Farrah Aidid's two senior lieutenants.  Sending in elite Delta Force, Ranger and SOPR troops to capture the two men, the Americans run into stiff resistance as their helicopters are shot down.

Directed by Carl Franklin from a script by Billy Bob Thornton, and starring Thornton, Bill Paxton, Cynda Williams, and Michael Beach, it begins with bloody bodies on the floor and ends with bloody bodies on the ground. There is some sprightly dialogue en route, some sharp editing, fine acting all around, and the dramatic tension is well maintained. We are intrigued by the clash of personalities and the degenerate hijinks. However, after awhile I began to feel that if they light up one more cigarette I will be forced to rip the pack from their hands, tear the stogies into shreds, and feed the debris to them with a large spoon. Also the standard quota of one thousand improvisations on the f-word was exceeded here. I am therefore condemning director Carl Franklin to an absurdist nightmare in which he dreams of getting scripts in the mail in which the dialogue for all characters consists of just that one word in its various grammatical forms, repeated for one hundred and twenty pages.Paxton plays a small town sheriff in awe of the cops from the big city who is nonetheless intent on proving his manhood. (One of the cops, by the way, in a bit of prescient genius, looks a whole lot like former L.A. cop Mark Fuhrman before he got all those bags under his eyes.) Thornton is a kind of murderous cocaine-addled urban animal in a long greasy pigtail whose life has neither direction, purpose nor insight. Williams, whose primal sexiness will keep your eyes open even if it's two a.m., plays a chocolate strawberry who can kill when she has to. Beach is an icy cold-blooded knife murderer who spends his off-duty hours worshiping his well-muscled body and practicing squeaky-clean living. The familiar Billy Bob Thornton fascination with things country contrasted with things city is explored here and reminds us a little of A Simple Plan (1998) in which he also teamed up with Bill Paxton. This genre, which I might call Grunge City gore, was morphed into an art form during the eighties and nineties in films from, e.g., Coen and Coen, Blood Simple (1984), David Lynch, Wild at Heart (1990), Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs (1992), Oliver Stone, Natural Born Killers (1994), and others. This is actually one of the better ones, but I think I need a break. Maybe a nice Disney favorite or something with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks...or even something with Bette Midler and Whoopie Goldberg.Then again, maybe NOT.Incidentally, the reason all these films made especially during the late eighties and early nineties contain some much blood and guts and cigarette smoke is (1) Sex had become somewhat taboo because of the rise of AIDS, and so Hollywood switched to violence, and (2) The tobacco companies fronted money for films that promised to have a whole lot of puffing going on.

I'm French (so sorry for my bad Anglish!) and I'm glad that American people like French cinema, because it's worth to be famous, as well as European cinema. Some great movies have been made this year and Amelie is one of them.Nevertheless, I can't understand why some of you compare Amelie to Life is beautiful ! It's amazing (and stupid)to compare those two movie because they're completely different. Is it because they're Europeans? Well, it's not a reason. Jeunet's movies and Benigni's movies are completely different. I can't imagine Benigni realizing Delicatessen ! I'm glad to be French and European, because I love cinema, and i have the possibility to see every kind of movies. In United-States, people seems not to have the possibility to see others movies but American movies. Am I wrong? Just because they are not distribuated in U.S.A. It's unfair, and fortunately this system starts to change. ( but it's not thanks to Jean-Marie Messier, the boss of Vivendi-Universal who tries to change the identity of the French cinema).About Audrey Tautou, I recommend you to see Vénus Beauté (institut) (I only know the french title), in which she's wonderful, once again.About Mathieu Kassovitz, this great director and actor, there is a movie which is on the french screens since this week (so not before a while in U.S.) called Amen by Costa-Gavras. It's a masterpiece, dealing with the silence of the Vatican about the Shoah during the second world war. Really great.Finally, I wish Amelie won an Oscar, but if it isn't the case, it's not a big deal because there are many wonderful movie this year. No man's land for example.

Summer blockbusters in particular, with their expansive special effects and distracting explosions; often have to be watched at least twice in order to get a clear view.When I first saw Tim Burton's reimagining of Planet of the Apes (Reimagining? Reimagining it as what? A pile of cack?) I was reasonably dumbstruck by the scale and spectacle as to be uncertain exactly what I thought. I had it pegged down as sort-of average, with the possibility of it either being very good in its own right or a soulless, braindead money-maker. Sadly, seen again, it's the latter. By far.Watching it again on video doesn't help either. When a film is so heavily reliant on the big screen then this says a lot about its content. Without the panoramic views, we're forced to concentrate on plot, dialogue and characterisation. Which is unfortunate as there isn't one, it's rubbish, and there isn't any.There are good points the opening space scenes are beautifully realised, shot with a cinematic grace, and not just computer generated FX thrown in your face. Also, credit must actually be given to the twist ending, which, while it may seem contrived, does credit the audience with some intelligence (the only part of the movie to do so) and is far more faithful to the source novel than any of the 60s\/70s Apes movies. And there's also the scary bit that they ripped off from Jaws.Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal pointed out the redundant subtext of the original by noting Today, I think we're living in the famous saying, 'The world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper.' However, it's unpleasantly ironic to note that since the release of this movie the prospect of nuclear destruction is again a possibility, and the 1968 picture has once again become as relevant as it ever was. Even without this it took pot shots at racism and famine. Burton's view sees it take on only the novel's Gulliver's Travels-style ape\/human reversal, with the odd religious musing and little else. So because it has less to say, it's forced to expand those issues, and basically beat you over the head with them for two hours. Every single line Helena Bonham Carter has is a corny platitude, while I almost heaved my guts at the moment where Wahlberg claims sometimes even a few can make a difference, to the tune of a full-blown orchestra. Yes, the dialogue is the weakest element all right, and while the originals could be a little hammy, this one makes them look like Shakespeare. There's not one exchange approaching a genuine conversation throughout, and the trademark warmth and charm of the original is blown wide apart by a breakneck pace and one-dimensional caricatures. There's no time to react to anything, yet despite the pace, I also found myself looking at my watch several times in boredom.One bit of merchandise I got my hands on was Leo's Logbook, a child-orientated intro to the series with lots of glossy photos. A short affair with just a few words here and there, it lasted less than 30 pages, though told me more about the characters and their backgrounds than the film itself did. Surely that's wrong somehow? In the 1968 film we learn that Charlton Heston's Taylor has both liberal values and is embittered, both within the first five minutes. These contrasting character traits forge three-dimensionality, yet we never get to know or care about Wahlberg's desperately underwritten Leo. Little is known about him from the movie, he's just a bland nobody with a bizarre chimp fetish and nothing else. Maybe it's that he's too young, too pop to really work in the expected way. Yet look at how we're supposed to believe that Carter's chimp wants a romantic involvement with Wahlberg, and that the Nova replacement is jealous... yet neither of them have exchanged more than a few words with him the whole time. Bonham-Carter (is it just me or does she remind you of Lisa Minelli?) seems ten times more irritating than I remembered, and the sexy but dull Estella Warren fails to make an impact also. I won't even mention the comedy Orang-U-Tang (the comedy tag a misnomer, of course) or the obligatory irritating brat.What's worse, rather than condemning humanity as the original franchise did, this movie seems to exonerate it. No longer are they the mute ancestors of their own destruction, but &#150; in a very Hollywood decision &#150; the all-speaking, innocent victims of fate. That the apes are reworked as mediaeval, right-wing sadists is also a character-lessening development, and makes Bonham-Carter's role as the sole liberal even more unlikely. Warren heads the batch of human slaves, proving that even in the wild there's still room for lipstick and mascara, if not Imac.And what of Tim Roth? Roth's a good actor, and his performance cannot be faulted. But, sadly, the character is one note throughout. Whether he's holding his dying father's hand or just having dinner, he spends the entire time angry. That's right... he keeps going ape-sh*t!

I'm not against violence, but this is just ugly, repetitive violence. Violence that only exists because there's nothing else to fill the film.

","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"28 February 2002","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Shogun assassin is a movie composed of scenes taken from the first two episodes of the Babycart series, a six-part epic following the fortunes of a master swordsman turned assassin (Lone Wolf) and his son (Daigoro, aka Cub).An excellent eastern\/electronic soundtrack replaced the largely silent original while Japanese language was dubbed into English. Surprisingly, the dubbing works, for the most part, extremely well, and this also allowed the producers to come up with script and plot changes which bridged the gap between the various scenes pasted together from the different episodes. What we are left with is the most visually stunning Samurai movie ever made. Forget Kurosawas slow ,arty and frankly boring 'epics', Shogun assassin has a tension that is tangible. At every turn, there is the possibility of attack for the duo, while the excellent soundtrack adds menace, beauty and suspense. The fight scenes are quite simply breathtaking. While many commentators decide to focus on the arterial sprays gushing from the victims, they are missing the point - the swordplay on display is almost poetic in its precision and execution. The period costumes and settings are excellent and if you like your heroes to be stoic and impregnable, they don't get any better than Lone Wolf. The young cub Daigoro provides us with the narrative to the story and this proved to be a masterstroke, as the simple childish tones add to the suspense and help to set up the scenes in the movie. Tomisaburo Wakayama turns in an incredible performance in the lead role, gaining your respect, fear and admiration along the way. If you haven't guessed already, I am a major fan of this film. Rather than go through the plot, which you can find anywhere, I decided instead to highlight the elements which make this a great film. If you haven't seen it, rent it now. Pure Genius.

Surprisingly, the dubbing works, for the most part, extremely well, and this also allowed the producers to come up with script and plot changes which bridged the gap between the various scenes pasted together from the different episodes. What we are left with is the most visually stunning Samurai movie ever made. Forget Kurosawas slow ,arty and frankly boring 'epics', Shogun assassin has a tension that is tangible. At every turn, there is the possibility of attack for the duo, while the excellent soundtrack adds menace, beauty and suspense. The fight scenes are quite simply breathtaking. While many commentators decide to focus on the arterial sprays gushing from the victims, they are missing the point - the swordplay on display is almost poetic in its precision and execution. The period costumes and settings are excellent and if you like your heroes to be stoic and impregnable, they don't get any better than Lone Wolf. The young cub Daigoro provides us with the narrative to the story and this proved to be a masterstroke, as the simple childish tones add to the suspense and help to set up the scenes in the movie.

I am with the latter group. I wonder how the first group could even survive. This should be said this is not a movie about plot, acting, or special effects (although it does all these magnificently). This is about raw human emotion. Watch Moulin Rouge, and you'll feel like you're dreaming. I was sad to wake up. The plot is simple, but I didn't care. (I love how people hate movies like these, and then go watch a teen sex comedy.) The acting was terrific you can tell these people are having the time of their lives. I own the DVD, and watching some behind-the-scenes footage, I only wished I could be there too. The singing voices of Ewan and Nicole are outstanding they put all the famous songs into a new light. I love, love, love all the music. The design of the whole film was fabulous.  I can never get enough of this. There is so much more I could say, but I don't have enough words to say it. Just go rent it, please. And if you don't like it, go rent that teen sex comedy. It's your loss, and I feel quite sorry for you.
