Chaplin's movies can be enjoyed today as much as they were back when and his physical and in particular his facial expressions are top notch and a must even today for any true comedic actor. With The Gold Rush you get Chaplin at his best comedic wise, and although maybe I don't think right now I think this movie is incredible, I can still see that Charlie Chaplin is one of the best actors of all time. We see our story set in the rugged gold rush times in Alaska and Canada known as the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin is a lone prospector and he has come to seek his fortune like many others, but some people will help him whilst others will not.The film is as much at times a drama as it is a comedy mixing gags with truly emotional scenes, Chaplin yet again proves himself not only a great actor, but also a director at that level too. Chaplin's little tramp persona (who kind of reminds me of a penguin) arrives to a stormy place and meets Big Jim McKay who is also a lonely prospector and Black Larsen a wanted criminal. I don't want to go into the plot too much as to not ruin it for those who have yet to see this but over time Chaplin's character comes to love, befriend and well ultimately get into some sticky situations. The story I felt was good fun and although maybe not amazing for me personally, it is still very well played out.Chaplin also writes this movie further proving his absolute brilliance as he basically does everything for this movie. His skill is most plain to see in scenes where his character is being flung around or blown away by the fierce storms, the direction is not only superb but the laughs that can be had are a plenty yet again showing Chaplin's awesome humorous acting. The stunts are really well done as well by all involved, in fact Chaplin seems to make a seemingly normal stunt funny, a certain scene in a cabin off a cliff edge is probably the pick of the scenes for me. This movie also shows us some of Chaplin's most famous moments with the shoes, the dancing rolls and well of course his not unique to this movie but Chaplin's walking stick and hat. I think if you feel before watching this that you won't enjoy silent movies then think again, I myself at the time of this review have not ventured into silent's as much as I would like to have but still know from this that many are enjoyable. Is this Chaplin's greatest work? Well it could be but I do feel his movies in the 1930's are what he will be best remembered for and his highest rated although Chaplin of course wanted to be remembered for this one the most and so he should, it is him at the top of his game, and that's even before he did a lot of his more famous one's. Yes this film is good in my opinion, a very likable little adventure and although one I would not say is great, it is still very much worth watching and again afterwards. It may have aged slightly through time but in any case for a movie like this to be better than most it shows that Chaplin not only understood film making but he actually put it into action, made films people loved and cried at whether that be tears of laughter or emotion and in the end made people happy with his cheeky smile and little moustache.

Before there was the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and before there was Batman; as well as any other comic book movies that were made. There was a movie that putted the test of its time for comic book movies throughout the decades, and that movie was called the one and only Superman. This was the first Superman movie that started it all before the sequels, and the two reboots. Not including the movie serials from the forties because I'm more concern on Hollywood's own attempt on making a Superman movie that was taken seriously. Also, making it look like that this was the real deal. The movie tells the origin story of Superman as he was born on a distant planet called Krypton, where Jor-El sends his infant baby son Kal-El to Earth as Krypton is about to be destroy. So, Kal-El goes by the name Clark Kent as he was raised by the Kents (Earth parents) in Smallville, and then moves on to Metropolis as he gets a job at the Daily Planet. So now you have Lex Luthor, who wants to make his own land while Lois Lane needs savings, and the list goes on and on. You already know the story, so why go into much detail? Because you know the movie from beginning to end. I know the character of Superman, but never was that much of a fan as I was a fan of Batman. As time goes by, I now am a fan of Superman and nothing more that I can say about. This is such a wonderful movie, as both the cast and crew had made such an achievement to make a movie about a man that can fly from the comics, and transform it into a movie on an epic scale. Richard Donner was able to make this movie as it was all done taken seriously, but also having the joy and excitement which it makes this movie very entertaining to watch; very talented that Donner is, and should be most proud of on making this movie. The story is perfectly told as we see Superman going from being a baby boy; a teenager and now becoming the Man of Steel. I love the look of the film, as it was all done on such an epic level and not have it watered down. Aside from Hans Zimmer's music from Man of Steel, which I do say that it is brilliant but John Williams' music really soars beautifully, and I really love the theme that he created. The special effects are still impressive, before technology has change by using computers; it was such a big task on how to make Superman fly, and the special effects team did such a believable job on making us believe that Superman can fly. Sure there are one or two parts that don't hold up, but I still believe that the effects are impressive. The film is filled with such a great cast of actors and actresses that are believable to bring their roles to life. Marlon Brando was absolutely great as Jor-El, while Gene Hackman is very good to play Lex Luthor. Margot Kidder really did such an outstanding job to play Lois Lane. Of course, she is the damsel in distress and there is nothing for me to complain about. At least, Lois Lane's characterization was changed from being a damsel in distress to a woman that is actually doing something in Man of Steel. Before I admired Henry Cavill's and Brandon Routh's interpretation, I really love Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and his alter ego Superman. He really captures that role perfectly, and he will always be remember as Superman. The movie does go at a really good pace, and I really enjoy for its wondrous moments. The movie is more of a character based, and less of an action movie. I know there is action, but its not like what Man of Steel did; so its pretty much all done in a traditional way. The ending where Superman turns time back does not annoyed me, nor about the whole glasses issue that no one can identify that Clark Kent is Superman.

At least, Lois Lane's characterization was changed from being a damsel in distress to a woman that is actually doing something in Man of Steel. Before I admired Henry Cavill's and Brandon Routh's interpretation, I really love Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and his alter ego Superman. He really captures that role perfectly, and he will always be remember as Superman. The movie does go at a really good pace, and I really enjoy for its wondrous moments. The movie is more of a character based, and less of an action movie. I know there is action, but its not like what Man of Steel did; so its pretty much all done in a traditional way. The ending where Superman turns time back does not annoyed me, nor about the whole glasses issue that no one can identify that Clark Kent is Superman. I know this movie very well enough, and it still continues to be a wonderful movie. I am giving Superman a 10 out of 10.

I mostly liked it to see the uncredited cameo of Kevin Kline playing Marcus Skinner. When Shaun (Colin Hanks) picked up Marcus's book, I got excitedly struck when Kevin's voice said Read me. I was shocked. I thought of the great times that I had when I was in high school. In situations where it's involved with drugs, it made me think of Alice in Wonderland because many people who took drugs think that it's something you watch when you take them. In a Disney UK opening of a VHS, a voice mentioned it as Where nothing is as it seems. I also didn't realize that Schuyler Fisk is the daughter of Sissy Spacek and Jack Fisk. I had to find it funny when Don Durkett took the pain medicine and acted like he was woozy. I'm not so much into Romeo and Juliet. 2 of my 7 men made uncredited cameo appearances. Kevin of course as I mentioned earlier played Marcus Skinner and Ben Stiller played a firefighter. On the back of the DVD I brought home it wrote Martin Skinner. That's a typing error. In scenes where Shaun met Marcus, I had to pretend to be him (Shaun) and say stuff like My hands are numb. My legs are shaking. And my heart is racing. I say that because that was how I felt when I met Kevin at age 16. It's sort of a mixture of I think of random stuff and I think of the wonderful times I've had with him. The only thing I would change for this is to make Marcus a bigger role and Kevin's name on the credits of any kind. Then at least I would enjoy it more. But that would've been a spoiler alert so I'm pleased that it's uncredited. I imagined myself seeing it on the big screen in 2002 and I would've sat and enjoyed the movie. Then I get surprised and shocked that he makes a cameo and people would ask Is that Kevin Kline? If I did, I would've never see him as anything but as Phoebus. Now I see him as more than that. Throughout the course of the film, I kept hoping that Shaun would get into Stanford. Then at the end of it, I realized the difference and said No. Let him stay in Orange County so that he can spend time with is friends and Ashley. This is amazing.

Only in this case it's not the FBI, it's a lawyer, trying to file suit against the town for more damages as compensation for the parents. Considering the many characters and the various ways they feel throughout the film, an alternate title for the film could be called The Bitter Simmering Grief.This is one of those rare films where one scene, and a choice of a narration-device, mars for me what is otherwise an excellent drama, and generally one of the better films of 1997 (a year with many great films). But before I get to that, some praise for Ian Holm. My God is he phenomenal in this movie. He has to do, as this character of Mitchell Stevens, appealing to the anger and grief of these victims and channel that anger (more than the grief, if he can help it) to go along with him in the suit. At the same time this character is dealing with his daughter, addicted to drugs and spiraling out of control, and it's always in phone calls where he can barely speak to her in a rational way.One of the scenes that can shake you up as you watch this film involves Holm talking to his daughter on the phone (this after a nasty encounter with one of the locals, played by Bruce Greenwood, who doesn't want him in the town), and he finds out from her that she's HIV positive. This relies in part on a monologue he gives to an old friend of hers he meets on a plane as he tells a story involving when his daughter was near death from a spider bite in her throat and having to come close to doing what he had to for her. Just seeing him speaking this, and then this in mind as he finds out this news, the way that Egoyan shoots that scene with the wide shots of her on the phone at a booth, the close-ups on him, then in to her, with brief flashes to her as a baby... it's a gut-punch. And Holm sells it, every single second. It's a cliché to call something a powerhouse in a performance, but that's what he's giving here, and often in very subtle ways, sometimes with just a look or how he's listening to people, or subtly appealing to characters' emotions.Sarah Polly is also really terrific too as the teenager who was one of the only survivors (along with the driver) on the bus. My problem with the film doesn't come with her, but with a certain story choice that is made about a third to maybe mid-way through the film - it's difficult to spoil it, but it involves a scene that seems to me just dropped right into the thick of things, and it doesn't have very much lead up for these characters. While it does ultimately pay off in the climax of the story, it is still a jarring move; even at 112 minutes long, I wish the film had been longer to develop these characters and this conflict that is clearly there. It's meant to be accentuated by the narration of the Pied Piper, which Polly's character is reading to the children and then comes back up from time to time. It's too on-the-nose dramatically speaking, especially for a film that is loaded with enough drama and tragedy as it is.And yet I can't recommend the film enough, despite my caveats on a first viewing. The Sweet Hereafter, beautifully shot in snow-covered Canada, is meant to look on into that terrible moment when tragedy rocks not just one family but a whole town - and yet these people, individually, have to deal with the pains of losing their children in their own ways, with Stevens most of all as his daughter is dying, yet so far away from him, and yet there's also Greenwood's character, who is gruff and mustached and full of the sort of pain that he will keep inside of himself for the rest of his life.

It's a about a promising baseball player whose career was shattered after damaging his shoulder and advice from his doctor, so he takes on a job as a teacher in his small town. He also takes on a job as a baseball coach for his district team but they haven't won that many games. In 1999, he makes a bet with his team to pursue his baseball career if they win the district championship and with determination and brilliant coaching, they manage to win. He then tries out for the majors and everyone is shocked that this near middle aged man can throw a 98mph fastball, so the offers start flowing in. He then makes the tough decision to leave his family and go on the road with a baseball team but he doesn't really gel with the other players because of his age. He soon starts to miss his family and there debts start to build up so he decides to give up his dreams and go back home to take on a ordinary job so they can pay there bills. Soon after that, he gets an offer from a major league baseball team and he becomes the oldest baseball player with a unique and amazing fastball. It's a basic zero to hero story which we have seen many times before but the real footage of Jim Morris makes the film a joy to watch. I'm not a big fan of baseball but films like Bill Durham, Field Of Dreams and Tin Cup have brought the sport too people around the world. I liked the relationship between Jim Morris and his son, who always believed that his dad had a special fastball but it took Jim Morris some time to convince his dad who always thought that he had to give up his dreams to put food on the table. It is an amazing achievement for a 35 year old rookie to make it in the majors so this feel-good movie is a emotional biopic about a baseball hero. Enjoyable!Round-Up Dennis Quaid, 61, really hit it big after starring in the Right Stuff in 1983 and then he had roles in major films like Innerspace, which I really enjoyed, Dreamscape, Enemy Mine, The Big Easy and Great Balls of Fire in the 80's. Since then his career was plagued with hit and misses but his professional acting style has never been questioned. He has some major blockbusters behind him like Wyatt Earp, Any Given Sunday, the brilliant Dragonheart and Flight Of The Phoenix but it's hard to see were his career will go from here. It's been a long time since he has starred as the lead in a big blockbuster but his old movies will always be a joy to watch. This movie was directed by John Lee Hancock who brought you films like the Alamo, the great Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks so he is known for his biopics. I would have liked to have seen the darker times of Jim Morris so it would have made it seem more real and not a typical happy go lucky Disney movie. With that aside, it is still an unique biopic which would be good if it was made for modern times. Judging by the movies takings, it obviously went down well with the audiences around the world so we are still suckers for the zero to hero concept.

This movie was directed by John Lee Hancock who brought you films like the Alamo, the great Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks so he is known for his biopics. I would have liked to have seen the darker times of Jim Morris so it would have made it seem more real and not a typical happy go lucky Disney movie. With that aside, it is still an unique biopic which would be good if it was made for modern times. Judging by the movies takings, it obviously went down well with the audiences around the world so we are still suckers for the zero to hero concept. Anyway it's definitely worth a watch if your fed up with all the doom and gloom in everyday life but for entertainment and excitement, it's very average.Budget $22million Worldwide Gross $81millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their sports\/drama\/family movies about a rookie baseball player who pursues his dreams into the majors after taking a bet. 5\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Family, Sport"},{"date":"6 September 2015","score":"","review":" The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie, a sub-genre all its own. There are many fine movies in this group, movies that can be watched again and again, such as Brubaker, Cool hand Luke, Le Trou, Birdman of Alcatraz, Escape from Alcatraz, House of Numbers, The Big House, The Criminal, Under the Gun, Convicted, Each Dawn I Die, American Me, and many others. There are several hundred movies in this category. Shawshank joins this group. It's different in some ways that I'll mention below.As far as my tastes go, I will sooner be re-watching any number of these other prison films than Shawshank. The reason for this is its mawkish and contrived quality. The story features a lot of narration by Morgan Freeman, who is one of the main characters, about its hero, Tim Robbins. Narration has to be used sparingly and craftily in any movie so as not to make us viewers aware that we are watching a story and so as not to prevent us from being drawn into the story. Since one character is talking about another here and at quite some length, we never forget that we're watching a story rather than being absorbed into it. A good many of the actual events are rather black and white, almost clichés, and this doesn't help either.I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first time with no idea of what it was about or very little idea of its great popularity. This movie takes a decidedly anti-prison system view. That's a plus. The warden is corrupt. The head guard and he conspire and commit an outright murder, rather overdone I should say. The warden uses Robbins as accountant for his money-looting schemes, which exposes him to what Robbins might eventually do and exposes Robbins to danger of being killed at some point. This is pretty far-fetched. Robbins improves the lives of his fellow inmates by his appeals to the legislature. It seems quite sentimentalized. Poor James Whitmore is let out after 50 years and proceeds to hang himself. Who writes this stuff? Well, not that it's so bad or even appears in other movies, but somehow it's all put together here in such a way as to feel contrived, exaggerated and too sentimental. The escape, a staple of many prison dramas, is not a big focus here; it's rather rushed over. The path by which Freeman is led to go see Robbins is concocted. Freeman's character is on the anemic side. He's the black man who has given up hope who is saved by the more educated white man. Is he a real black man? Is he like any black man sent to prison? This does not ring true. I think Freeman is a great actor who wants to work and make a living; but I can pass when he's in Driving Miss Daisy mode.Shawshank looks very, very good.

When people talk about the beauty in a post-apocalyptic future, this is what comes to mind. The landscapes are stark, the world cruel, the conditions demanding. But not so much that you can't take a step back and admire them. George Miller, you are a master.When I watched Happy Feet a few years back, I enjoyed it fine. But I was shocked to learn that it was made by the man who made these masterpieces. Now, every time I watch that movie, I expect gritty trucks to burst into the colorful frames and start running over the penguins. Kudos to Mr. Miller for managing to make an impact on both animation and live-action, there are not many people who can claim that.One would think those movies unconnected to these masterpieces. But think about it. If you're an animation buff like me, you know that animation often uses many different angles to establish the landscapes they have created, planting them firmly in your mind. Do you know what other movie series makes extensive use of that? This one. They may be tangentially connected, but they are connected nonetheless.And as a last note before I go from this series as a whole to the particular movie that I am today reviewing no, I have not seen the latest movie in the franchise. I hear it is fantastic and I plan to pick it up on DVD, but it was a bit inconvenient for me to go to the theatre for the time in which it was widely playing. With that in mind, I do say that this is the best of the original three movies and the one most people think of when they think of Mad Max.

Both second entries are stunning pictures that form the majority of the public's opinion of the series. And the third movie is a widely contested entry that probably receives more of a hatedom than it deserves thanks primarily to the fact that they did not live up to the heights of the previous two movies.There is a reason that this is the film that people think of when Mad Max pops into their head. It has a style all its own. While the first movie saw the world falling into disrepair, this movie goes full out dystopian and is better for it. The colors, the people, the ideas, the use of gasoline as a resource as valuable as water these ideas do not belong exclusively to the Mad Max franchise, but they are as tied to it as the Empire State Building is to NYC. Mel Gibson, though he delivers fine, stoic performances in these movies is not essential to making a Mad Max movie. These things are. And this movie has them in spades.To explain the plot would be an insult to the film. These are not Fincher movies and they do not try to be. The plot is as basic as the plot to an eighties video game. Go here. Do this. Pick up that. Bring it back here. Defeat the villain. The characters are not even much more defined tan your standard hero from that decade of gaming. The acting is not bad. But there is simply not much acting to be done. This is not a bad thing. Not in this movie, at least. Instead, it allows all the focus to put onto the two elements that define a Mad Max movie like the Burj Khalifa defines the current skyline of Dubai action and atmopshere.And oh is this film filled with it. I wanted to sink into the film within the first ten minutes of my first watching. And it helped me do it. To go back to how some of Miller's strengths fit animation perfectly, almost every great animated movie that I've watched, particularly the Miyazaki films, have created a world that my mind could and wanted to absorb.

Well no but it feels more promising, oh I know actually, lets just make an all out crazy movie with little realistic dialogue and some poor acting. See that seemed to do the trick because this movie is a poor one, I didn't find it completely bad but it's still pretty bad anyway.

Resident Evil is based on the popular video game of the same name and definitely see's the kind of action you might expect from such, not all together a really un-enjoyable ride, but just a movie that is unlikeable. We see Milla Jovovich waking up and not knowing what the hell is going on, we also see James Purefoy with the same old predicament and both seem to need to know what's going on. In steps a whole team of people who have been sent in to investigate a thing called the Hive an underground facility that seems to have done some bad things to test subjects and even employees. The film is packed full of insane action, kick ass stunts and zombies (including zombie dogs) and really does pack quite a punch. I didn't feel this film was bad because of the action actually, it is what makes this slightly exciting and at least the movie has a certain horror element too it and can make you kind of jump.It wasn't the directing that made me cringe, it was the writing which seems to rip this movie apart, the cast can seem almost lifeless at moments with this script and the small talk is well, none existent. The cast do give it their best at certain times but in others it can feel as if they are trying too hard to make this dramatic and Anderson does nothing to help them. I think the only real redeeming factors in this are that it is not awful and not even maybe fully bad but still just poor, as I said the fighting and all the things like that are the only things that keep this a float before it sinks into the abyss of movie garbage. As for the actors themselves I can't say I liked any of them, Jovovich is not bad but she fails as her role to lead the movie and ends up in moments being second fiddle to more exciting characters. Michelle Rodriguez is probably more exciting than her but even she can not make this any better, coupled with the writing too, I just couldn't forgive this movie and felt disappointed. The story is played out well kind of full blown just go for it which does work in it's favour somehow, I didn't want any plot for large parts of this because I was enjoying the fighting, there are way too many obstacles set in this movie but I can say at least you get a few thrills and that's what is important. So all in all it is Anderson who truly damages the film, not as much with Jovovich or the cast as they are just sucked into the director's work. I think in fact I know for a fact many will enjoy this and think me crazy for saying this is poor, but just look at the film properly and really don't let it take you for a ride without first showing you its poor skills. I do however recommend this to all horror fans and action aficionados as it basically will do what it says on the tin really, scare and thrill.

I do however recommend this to all horror fans and action aficionados as it basically will do what it says on the tin really, scare and thrill.

Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) has plans to get a job and an apartment, however Enid (Thora Birch) is decidedly less motivated, having spent her whole life just skating by. She must inevitably learn that there are very real consequences for her actions&#x97;even in indifference.The film makes for a very interesting social commentary about the difficulty of maintaining relationships and our struggle to find our place in the world, the quintessential tug-of-war to find the balance between being true to ourselves and hiding pieces of us to fit into society's accepted norms. It makes a provocative statement about how society and media make us feel we have to choose between acceptance and being who we are. The word normal is constantly thrown around, particularly by her best friend Rebecca, serving to illustrate the fundamental differences between the two girls, with Enid spending most of her life seeing what she wanted to see, only to discover her and Rebecca were not as alike as she thought.Enid's boredom leads her to play a practical joke on a lonely man searching for a woman he met in a personal ad. After the two girls observe his melancholy and follow him to his home, Enid discovers he collects and sells records. They hit it off and she starts to see that he's not so different than her. Believing she's found a kindred spirit in a man twice her age, she takes an interest and starts spending time with him, promising to find him a date.Her journey is an illustration of how we can get so caught up in our own lives that we fail to see that we are neglecting those important to us&#x97;our relationships&#x97;the very thing we rely on for emotional support. And when someone we care about fails us, we either internalize it or lash out. Enid's required art class poignantly illustrated that artistic license cannot so easily be acquired, but instead of working to cultivate her own creativity, she chose to use an old art piece borrowed from Seymour. This unfortunately would also prove to have dire consequences.Seymour finally got that call from the girl he'd been looking for in the ad and Enid encouraged him to meet her. After they hit it off, he sadly became self-involved and blew Enid off, never giving thought to the fact that she had genuinely cared for him. And so with that disappointment causing her to only think of herself, frustrated that he was settling for a woman he had little in common with to be 'taken care of', Enid recoiled back into her comfort zone&#x97;Rebecca. Unfortunately, she failed to see that while she was caught up with her infatuation with Seymour, she wasn't being a friend to Rebecca.Naturally, it hurt her when Enid only wanted to hang out with her because Seymour blew her off. Rebecca did not lie to be malicious, but to protect herself, as she was beginning to see for the first time that perhaps their 'friendship' was based more on convenience than true affection. I can relate on this point, as people continually undervalue the importance of balance in their lives in terms of their relationships as a whole. If you only focus on one, the others will suffer, and you can't play people like fiddles and expect them to still be around when the fog clears. Part of discovering how to be happy is figuring out how to balance all the elements within it, instead of ascribing to the misguided belief that you can hand pick a few and that will be enough.The story seemed to stretch a little beyond its reach as Rebecca grew increasingly frustrated with Enid's attitude. Instead of Enid simply admitting she didn't feel she could be honest with her, she insulted her, causing Rebecca to lash out. This hurt Enid, penetrating the walls she thought she had in place, and her pain sent her fleeing to Seymour for comfort, succeeding in getting out of him what she wanted only to turn on her heels and run. She practically begged Rebecca to let her move in with her, only to disappoint her by not keeping her promise. I found it odd the two girls never hugged despite supposedly being best friends since childhood, and I was a little miffed by Rebecca's disregard for Seymour's feelings, coming off as more malicious than jealous, which seemed wholly unjustified.The title represents Enid feeling as though she's a ghost in a world filled with people. She feels invisible and inconsequential, something I think we can all relate to. She struggled through the whole film to figure out what she wanted instead of settling on complacency. Once she realized her only dream was to disappear, she had to find the courage to take that final step.Throughout the whole ordeal, Enid didn't seem to understand that her irresponsibility and feigned indifference had real consequences, and that her actions were hurting people. The end felt a little disjointed to me, as if they were trying to wrap everything up in a bow so we knew where we left each of the characters with little statement on the friendship she had taken for granted, which is what I found more interesting, especially considering the comic focuses more on both girls which I would've found to be more intriguing.FINAL VERDICT More interesting that it appears, the in-depth look at what lies just beneath the surface of our lives and the intricacies of our relationships made for a profound watch, if only left feeling a little bewildered by the end.6.5 of 10.0 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 September 2015","score":"","review":" Reviewed September 6th, 2015 - 1st viewing (IFC HD) Based on the comic book by Daniel Clowes, the film centers around two teen outcasts struggling to find their place in the world after they graduate high school.

Watching this film at an young age I knew it was funny, but not as utterly hilarious as my parents seemed to find it. I think I liked it due to some of the adult humour in it that my parents were letting me see for some reason. Since then, I've watched this film many times, finding it funnier and funnier every time due to my age increasing. I turned 18 a couple of weeks ago and have just finished watching it for maybe the 20th time. I can honestly say it is my favourite comedy movie to watch and to recommend to people after all these years. From laughing for the sake of laughing when I was a child, to now bragging to my friends about how amazing this movie is at 18 years old, it is indeed a timeless classic.I love this film for many reasons, mainly due to the story of how it became one of my favourite movies. Not only is it amazingly funny with it's silly one liners and the presence of legend Leslie Nielsen, but it is an exciting, edge of your seat kind of movie that I cannot recommend more. If you haven't seen this movie already, do yourself a favour and get it watched! And when you do go to watch, I just want to wish you good luck... we're all counting on you.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"6 September 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" For my first review I have decided to review my favorite movie of all time, Fight Club.This blockbuster starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt entails a man known simply as the 'narrator' that hopes and dreams for a better life, if not then he is slowly planning his own suicide in his head, thus meeting Tyler Durden, a man the narrator aspires to be, the two of them begin 'Fight Club' where men have the satisfaction of beating the heck out of each other which for some odd reason gives them a sense of relief and purpose. Throughout the movie you begin to learn that Tyler is manipulating the system to create an underground force to attack the major financial points in the world to bring the world back to zero.This would have to be a career best for both Norton and Pitt. The intricacy that both characters portray is confusing at times as situations begin to take place where Maria, portrayed brilliantly by Helena Bonham Carter, is in a gray area with the narrator, as sometimes she hates him and sometimes she loves him. The big twist at the end of the film is that Tyler is actually an unconventional character that the narrator is imagining, the narrator wanted a better life so badly that he has imagined a voice and a guidance to help him start his new life of action.The growth of the narrator is truly a blessing to watch as he begins as a coward in life, outside a bar not wanting to punch Tyler in the face, but ends up in the film bashing Angel's face in, one of the darkest and most confusing parts of the film in my opinion. The narrator even comes to a stage where he is being interrogated by police, but without even himself knowing he has manipulated the police officers to kill him if he said any word about the operation.After each watch of the film the intricacy of the film grows but at the same time becomes simpler, each new viewing adds a new dimension that you are questioning to yourself why you didn't pick up on that in the last viewing. It is a phenomenal take on the world as it continually likes to point out how humans are inferior and how each one of us just makes up a pointless system.The movie has brilliant twist and turns that is like a puzzle, bits and pieces are forming everywhere, but when all put together, you understand the big picture. This movie makes a terrific drama film that must be watched. If you have not watched this film, this is a MUST WATCH for any film lover.That being said I give Fight Club a 9.2\/10To end this review I must mention the first rule about fight club, DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUBQuite side note, I will barely ever be giving a movie over a 9, let alone a 10. Movies are never perfect, they may be perfect in your eyes, but a movie always has flaws.
