Perhaps it was his passion project?It's the classic story of a young man taking a job as an assistant to a big Hollywood agent, in order to get ahead in life. One thing it really hammers home is that a year can be way longer than first it seems.You gotta love a young Benicio Del Toro performance, with that dour accent of an unknown nationality, like Fez in The Usual Suspects. Benny of the Bull plays a quietly excellent character as Rex, or the man who Guy, played by Frank Whaley, will replace answering calls at the desk.Speaking of Whaley, here's one of two shortcomings.His performance is ultimately the least impressive part of this movie. And as the protagonist, that's not the greatest sign.I'm not saying Whaley's acting is bad, but it's unconvincing. He can't keep pace with the whirlwind plot, and the coolness of Spacey.The scenery, settings and backdrops often leave much to be desired. They're not incomplete or shabby; the surroundings of the characters are just very bland.Perhaps this is a stylistic choice that somehow adds to the movie. Personally I think the budget wasn't very high (IMDb estimates it around $700,000) and this doesn't allow for tons of prep previous to shooting.At the same time, the movie doesn't need elaborate backdrops or an overwhelming amount of sensory detail. There's enough already packed in.More on that later.On a final note regarding casting, Michelle Forbes as Dawn Lockard is just spectacular. Her character is compelling, strong and nuanced. The scenes in which she interacts with Guy are gripping and covered in subtlety.Forbes played roles in lesser-known features, such as Escape from L.A. and Kalifornia. Recently she's much more prominent in television and her work includes a significant role as Maryann Forrester Maryann in the second season of HBO's True Blood. So noteworthy is her performance it's deserving of a sidebar. Skip the following bracketed paragraph if you couldn't care less.(Sidebar True Blood is no longer a good television show. It may never have been 'great' as an overall televised product, but the first two seasons had fabulous story arcs. It went off the rails because of the ever-expanding world building, and the perseverance of a character named Terra. The entire second season is carried by the introduction of the new antagonist, Maryann Forrester Maryann, and a large hunk of the show's success is due to the thoroughly riveting and convincing performance from Michelle Forbes.)Here's a smart exchange.When they first have a drink and discuss business, Dawn asks Guy if he'd like to go out. He orders a glass of white wine and she orders a cocktail. While they talk, she chews on the ice from her drink and smokes.Huang draws a dichotomy here between the typical male and female roles in social and romantic interactions. I think Guy's shorter than Dawn too, so they're really an odd pair.Nuanced scenes like this resonate throughout the entire film.When Buddy and Guy are conversing, pay close attention to the physical positioning of Spacey's body. At one point, his shoes are propped on the desk and uncrossed, displaying his crotch like a woman giving birth. This posture illustrates the relative difference in power between the two men and Buddy's attitude toward his assistant.So if you haven't seen Swimming with Sharks, now's the time, before the scenery and settings begin to feel any older. Stop reading here if you're sensitive to spoilers.Anyway, a final few things are worthy of discussion.First of all, the wind-up toys on Buddy's desk, and the discussion of 'Equal' versus 'Sweet-N- Low' artificial sweeteners. The symbolism in these details are too numerous to note; some of which I can't wrap my head around either. Aside from the lack of 'artificial sweetener' present in Buddy's rhetoric, I'm assuming there's value to the color of the packets (blue and pink, reminiscent of early-life gender roles) but can't complete the analytic connection without further research.In retrospect, the existence of the toys throughout the earlier portion of the movie seems off. As the narrative unfolds, the mechanisms don't draw our attention, but it's odd to think a man with such a business-oriented lifestyle would adorn his workspace with playthings.The resolution is built around a technological quirk of a distinct age in history. Only in the '90s could a conflict revolve around the oddities of call waiting and conferencing. But hey, it works.The ending is a bit confounding in its value. It's an original twist and the correct way to wrap up the story. But quite a bit gets lost in, what seems like, a rushed conclusion.It's not hurried; it's just a drastic and almost unprecedented turn for the story to take. The viewer is never convinced Guy's passion for the business outweighs his love of Dawn.And I hate to harp on this, but it goes back to Whaley's acting ability. When he shows up at Buddy's house and threatens him at gunpoint, the seriousness of his intent doesn't feel real. Further, the torture scenes aren't genuine because we don't see the capability for this level of aggression in Guy's behavior.All things considered, Swimming with Sharks is a classic that shouldn't be forgotten!

To give it antagonistic slant, it might be called 'delighting in death.'Why? For two reasons1) I can cite two credible books on writing supporting the use of violence in stories (particularly those slated for a male audience).2) Show me a dude that doesn't like the gunfight from The Matrix or the 'one versus many' battle between Neo and unlimited Agent Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded, and I'll lose one more potential friend. Or even just the bar fight in The Replacements.I feel the same about sexual content as I do violence.It's strenuous, but I must be even-handed about this movie; this film doesn't deserve its stigma.What stigma?When I told a movie buff pal from college about watching Mulholland Drive, the reply text read 'Second best lesbian scene to Wild Things.'The scene she (thought my friend was male, didn't you?) refers to is when Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engage in a steamy threesome.Yes it's fun to watch, but wow it's blown out of proportion.This isn't a pornographic film, Proverbial Audience.Just because she's scantily clad in most scenes, doesn't detract from Richards's performance as Kelly Van Ryan. She's very good in this movie, just like in Starship Troopers.Does Richards lose points for being super hot? She isn't discussed very often.Perhaps partially because Kelly's midriff is bare in almost every outfit. But criticisms proclaiming an excess of skin don't belong in my book.So the movie is very sexualized. Without that tension, I don't believe it's half as enjoyable.What is Body Heat without the sexual tension? How about Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct or Cruel Intentions or anything featuring James Bond?(See those movies if you haven't.)Neve Campbell's acting is very good. She comes off a little strong in the contrarian role. Perhaps it's her liberal use of the 'F-word.'Overall she does a good job with a tough part, though.Kevin Bacon's solid as usual. For most of the movie he's the thoughtful, more reserved Bacon, but towards the end a hint of his character from Diner peeks through.Bill Murray is more reserved as well, doing more 'bare bones' acting than in his usual roles as the funny guy. His character's quietly humorous, but compelling too.Finally, Matt Dillon's fine. I'm afraid he did what he could with a difficult role. Just like Campbell's character, I'm not sure how to improve upon the acting performance. He could use a bit more characterization outside of being the 'handsome and friendly smooth-talker.'The problem is a generalized feeling you get. An awareness you're viewing a movie that's generally accepted as 'good' not 'great,' at its very best.There are some minor details I can name that are more concretely weak. Such as the Van Ryan family's ability to live above the law.But overall, I wish I'd seen this when I was younger and unaware of the famous threesome scene. I'm afraid I would have enjoyed it more without the stigma in mind.The greatest part of this movie is the additional scenes, featured at the beginning of the rolling credits. The shots tie up all loose ends (most of which the audience is unaware of), and twist the story in a few final (and rather satisfying) ways.Overall, Wild Things is very good. It's well made, features an intricate storyline and is just a lot of fun. Plus, it's available for instant streaming via Netflix.Movie fans!

Or even just the bar fight in The Replacements.I feel the same about sexual content as I do violence.It's strenuous, but I must be even-handed about this movie; this film doesn't deserve its stigma.What stigma?When I told a movie buff pal from college about watching Mulholland Drive, the reply text read 'Second best lesbian scene to Wild Things.'The scene she (thought my friend was male, didn't you?) refers to is when Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engage in a steamy threesome.Yes it's fun to watch, but wow it's blown out of proportion.This isn't a pornographic film, Proverbial Audience.Just because she's scantily clad in most scenes, doesn't detract from Richards's performance as Kelly Van Ryan. She's very good in this movie, just like in Starship Troopers.Does Richards lose points for being super hot? She isn't discussed very often.Perhaps partially because Kelly's midriff is bare in almost every outfit. But criticisms proclaiming an excess of skin don't belong in my book.So the movie is very sexualized. Without that tension, I don't believe it's half as enjoyable.What is Body Heat without the sexual tension? How about Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct or Cruel Intentions or anything featuring James Bond?(See those movies if you haven't.)Neve Campbell's acting is very good. She comes off a little strong in the contrarian role. Perhaps it's her liberal use of the 'F-word.'Overall she does a good job with a tough part, though.Kevin Bacon's solid as usual. For most of the movie he's the thoughtful, more reserved Bacon, but towards the end a hint of his character from Diner peeks through.Bill Murray is more reserved as well, doing more 'bare bones' acting than in his usual roles as the funny guy. His character's quietly humorous, but compelling too.Finally, Matt Dillon's fine. I'm afraid he did what he could with a difficult role. Just like Campbell's character, I'm not sure how to improve upon the acting performance. He could use a bit more characterization outside of being the 'handsome and friendly smooth-talker.'The problem is a generalized feeling you get. An awareness you're viewing a movie that's generally accepted as 'good' not 'great,' at its very best.There are some minor details I can name that are more concretely weak. Such as the Van Ryan family's ability to live above the law.But overall, I wish I'd seen this when I was younger and unaware of the famous threesome scene. I'm afraid I would have enjoyed it more without the stigma in mind.The greatest part of this movie is the additional scenes, featured at the beginning of the rolling credits. The shots tie up all loose ends (most of which the audience is unaware of), and twist the story in a few final (and rather satisfying) ways.Overall, Wild Things is very good. It's well made, features an intricate storyline and is just a lot of fun. Plus, it's available for instant streaming via Netflix.Movie fans! If you've been putting it off because you're afraid the quality's 'ungood,' now's the time to watch it.There. You have my permission.Check Wild Things off the list.

The shape-shifting architecture was fine, but the Strangers floating thru the city, and worst, the laughable 'mind-battle' between Sewell and Ian Richardson at the end, oh dear.-One of the worst music scores I've ever heard.

Yo, menacing bald albino guys--want to know why your race is dying out? No women! How do you reproduce? I think, though, the real issue is that the movie just ages badly.

Both of them are good actors, dancers, singers and has charm - simply adorable together! The rest of the cast are just as great as the two leading characters which brings the film to elevated heights.

One of the most under rated classics of all time. Robert De'Niro plays a hustler set in the roaring twenties to the dirty thirties where his gang does odd jobs for either bosses, or whoever asks for a price. Set in the gritty hood of Manhattan he and his posse become widely known as one the toughest gangs in New York. What surprised me was how Sergio used a director other than directing it himself. Since his own films were just as tough looking with outlaws.But this film was not your usual mobster flick. All dialogue was set in a way where one could disseminate the plot. Although most gang films like The Godfather, or Goodfellows are loosely based on true fact, this was not. It had simpler character dialogue. Hardly any sense of awareness in each of the actors. Although that might have been Leon's intent. I especially liked the detail for every scene.Hard wood panels, lustrous items such as glass, or brass highly polished. The sets gave off an antique quality I look for in mobster films such as this. Elizabeth Mcgovern was also highly polished. Her way of acting, and showing her convicting gaze captures the imagination. James woods also gave off an audacious performance as De'Niro's long time friend Max. Both give this movie the needed boost, and Sergio provided really well with his actor picks.Lastly, are the scenes of Violence. In most mob movies the violence can be grotesque but graceful in its own particular way. Gun shoot outs to fist fights without reserve. Gratuitous blood shots, as well as the honest, and open sexual natures between actors. In many ways this could rival the top gang films in all aspects. Although Francis Ford Coppola is my favourite director for the classics such as Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, Sergio Leon has shown us his true way of creating an Ultimate Classic.Once Upon A Time In America is long, over three hours of film. But it is well worth it. Epics such as this movie needs to be told in this length or it doesn't work well with the audience. Cutting it down to just two or an hour and a half breaks away the most important ingredients in a film like this. The details are everything. Ghandi, Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, and so many others over three hours need to be told in its entirety or it won't work. I recommend this film for those 17 and above who love this genre. Excellent example of of the great Sergio Leon. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2014","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Sergio Leon's last film.

I think you need at least two decades under your belt before you can grasp the implications behind the character interactions, the political banter and all the cultural references.Annie Hall is only the third Woody film I've seen besides Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. And I like it just as much.The plot is basically a self-narrated character study of Alvy Singer (played by Woody) during the time in his life when he loved Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton).This thirty-six year old movie holds up! I watched it with my Dad yesterday and we were both having a laugh.It took home the Oscar for Best Picture in 1977 as well as three others two for Woody himself (Best Director, Best Screenplay) and one for Diane (Best Actress).Christopher Walken must be bummed because he was in two best pictures in back to back years (Deer Hunter nabbed the Oscar in '78) and hasn't been in one since.What makes this film great is the humor and the style. I get the feeling that every beat, every complete thought contains some sort of joke. It's all about subtlety, nuance, irony and implication when it comes to the funny.At times I'm consciously deciphering the wording of a dialogue exchange, and will give up because the discussion's moving ahead without me.For example, there is a scene in which Annie and Alvy are talking on a rooftop, and subtitles translate the implications of each statement. I try to digest each sentence and corresponding subtitle, but can't keep up.And that's how all of Annie Hall is Packed with material and moving along at a lightning-fast pace.The subtitles are only one example of the many occurrences in which the characters break the fourth wall. Alvy, Annie and Rob (Alvy's best friend) revisit the scenes of his memories in a number of ways.Rob, played by Tony Roberts, is great. There's a scene where Alvy watches along disgusted as Rob orchestrates the laugh track for an episode of his sitcom. And, again, this is exemplary of the entire film, which keeps the audience chuckling ironically from a distance.One narrative quirk that confuses me is an interaction between Rob and Alvy. Early on in the film, Alvy says, Don't call me Max, and Rob replies, Why? It's a good name for you. For the remainder of the movie, Alvy and Rob refer to each other as Max. It's hilarious, and I'm sure it's written that way for a reason, but these types of stylistic oddities are scattered throughout.The plot revolves around the settings of New York and Los Angeles, and compares\/contrasts the traditional Jewish and Christian families of the main characters.I love how Alvy grew up beneath a roller coaster, and the scene where he's introduced into the psychotherapy that never seems to work out.There's a smart scene in which the frame is split in two and the main characters conduct therapy sessions concurrently. In this dichotomy the monetary, sexual, emotional and psychotherapeutic health of each individual becomes a form of currency in their relationship. It's a fascinating, not to mention pessimistic, method of breaking things down.The discussion with his elementary school classmates, whose hair is similar to his adult self, is nothing short of brilliant. They remain children in his mind, but morphed slightly over time to better reflect himself.I bet that sounds complicated. What's not complicated is Jeff Goldblum's cameo. He's on the telephone at a party and says, I forgot my mantra.Larry David pays homage to the Wagner joke in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. And that animation scene was probably very original filmmaking for its time, but if I hadn't heard about it previous to viewing, it would have blown past me.The ending is fantastic. Like the rest of the film, it's nothing short of brilliant.Hopefully Woody's got a couple good ones left.

I remember there was talk about it at the time and then it quickly fell into near-obscurity.The title -- Broken Arrow -- refers to a nuclear warhead that's been lost. The plot revolves around a duel between two Airforce pilots, Deakins (John Travolta) and Hale (Christian Slater) Deakins steals two warheads in the Utah desert while Hale teams up with a good-looking park ranger (Samantha Mathis) to stop Deakins and his sinister cohorts.I have to admit that I usually don't like mindless action flicks, like 2001's The Mummy Returns, mainly because the stories are shallow and nothing more than an excuse to string together endless absurd action sequences. For an action film to work, the story & writing have to capture the attention of the viewer, like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Terminator 2 Judgment Day, both superb examples of the genre. I was pleased when the plot of Broken Arrow pulled me in and the film took me for a good ride. No, it's not great like those other two films, but then not many action films attain their level of expertise.Roger Ebert complained that Travolta makes an unconvincing villain. Poppycock. Travolta easily owns the role, swaggering around in over-confident non-glory. He's one of those villains you both hate and enjoy to watch. Surprisingly, Slater makes a quality protagonist and believable action hero. And Mathis is just a pleasure to behold from beginning to end. Some complain that she's somehow annoying, but I feel the opposite She totally enhances the movie. How so? She's a likable and comely protagonist, pure and simple. How exactly is she annoying? She falls upon a questionable situation and reacts in a cautionary way. Once Hale wins her trust and she understands the situation it's easy to root for her. Moreover, she looks great in tight ranger pants climbing a railcar, lol. So where's the problem? There are other positives, like the great location cinematography (shot in Utah, California, Arizona and Montana); the outstanding score and the wall-to-wall fun action scenes.

For an action film to work, the story & writing have to capture the attention of the viewer, like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Terminator 2 Judgment Day, both superb examples of the genre. I was pleased when the plot of Broken Arrow pulled me in and the film took me for a good ride.

When Chaplin first abandoned silent cinema (at least technically speaking) in The Great Dictator (1940) he used cinema to directly attack on Nazism. After the war he made Monsieur Verdoux (1947) in which he, more or less directly, accused war and capitalism of fascism as well. In the following decade his thought was sharpened by McCarthyism and the Cold War which gave birth to A King in New York. A story about an English king who, on his exile in the States, is first turned into a product of the media and then a communist suspect, goes even further in social criticism. It might just be Chaplin's most anti-American and perhaps most cynical film. At its heart, A King in New York is a satire of the American way of life which is dominated by falsity, betrayal and competition, emerging as the capitalist ideology whose weaponry includes the culture industry, superficial worship of youth; and the media as a de-democratizing power. McCarthy might accuse Chaplin of un-American activities, but Chaplin would shake his hand on this one for if America is this, there's a good reason to isolate oneself from it. When it comes to history, A King in New York is famous for its portrayal of the age of McCarthyism and HUAC. The film was received poorly and had major difficulties with distribution not only in the States but also in Europe. But when one comes down to it, one sees that there's no film like it from the 50's; no film with such courage and clairvoyance with regards to this subject. A film historian, Peter von Bagh has claimed in his new book on Chaplin that although the committee scenes may be stylized in an exaggerated fashion, they are nearly documentary in their nature. With his critical touch, Chaplin infiltrated an era and humiliated it. Although one can clearly note the connections of the film to Chaplin's personal life, the film isn't merely an autobiographical settlement of his, but an insightful social and historical observation. Many people who would use one of their three wishes to wipe this film out of existence do this because of the film's striking conflict with Chaplin's previous film Limelight (1952). Limelight is indeed different. It is lyrical, whereas A King in New York ironic; it is an elegy, whereas A King in New York is a satire. In a word, LimeLight might just have been the perfect farewell. Satire is of course a hard genre to master. Although Chaplin's references to reality TV, plastic surgery and the totalitarian power of the media are prophetic to say the least, and arguably he has succeeded in creating a great film, some of his satirical touches may seem conventional from today's perspective. Not only, however, are these elements to be appreciated from a historical point of view but also we must acknowledge the poignant and continuing relevance of Chaplin's satire. If Theodor W. Adorno's thoughts about the loss of the individual's autonomy in the reality dominated by the culture industry were timely back in Chaplin's day, they would be even more so today. The oppression and the submission of the people in front of the capitalist ideology has become a reality. Unfortunately, this awareness is something that is scarcely found in contemporary cinema, and maybe Chaplin was an exception even in his own day.
