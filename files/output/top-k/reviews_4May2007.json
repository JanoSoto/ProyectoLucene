The special effects are very well done and it is entertaining to see futuristic versions of well known cities (you will se Manhattan under water due to global warming). What also makes it unique is obviously that it is a Kubrick script. It contains the concept of emotional robots (like HAL in Space Odyssey, but this movie takes it to the step of a physical boy), and his search for identity. However hard it is to appreciate child actors, Haley Joel Osment has a lot of talent and is almost not annoying at all. Jude Law will show up as a prostituted robot and has a interesting and entertaining character, which he pulls of very well. However, I see some problems with this film. 1. It tries to reach too many audiences at once, which makes it end up with no real audience. At times, it is very childish and you wonder if it is a Pixar movie you are watching. But at other times, it has the bleak atmosphere of for example Blade Runner. The concept of the movie is serious but it has a lot of Disneyish features (this is also enhanced by the overdose of color in the picture). It is obvious that Kubrick would have made this movie a lot less lollipop-ish (Hollywood). 2. It baked in too much in the plot. You are already in the future, but in the ending you go 2000 years further and the robots are hyperintelligent and they apparently admire humans. You get no background why. And Osment can bring his mom back, but ONLY for one day. This just seemed like a last-minute solution to give the audience that are used to cliché movies a little reward, but to audiences that don't like cliché movies it was just unessecary. It should have ended when Osment was underwater.A.I. is despite these reasons a fantastic visual experience for sci-fi lovers, and an interesting suggestion to the scenario humans vs. robots. See it and get an opinion.

It's a foreign film, Dutch, and it provides a contemporary alternate point of reference for the many examples of mathematics involved cinema in American film. And what it tells Americans about their society, it's institutions of film and government, how they are seasoned with psychological, anti-intellectual propaganda is fascinating. Those conditions have their pronounced features for different historical reasons, geography, culture drift and the unique roll of the U.S. since WWII and of course the synergy between mathematics, war technology and the evolution of the Cold War to permanent information war. Part of that war you see has opened up a front specifically treating mathematics whereas it had long since considered the public and public education critical targets for softening and fluorochemical bombardment directly linked to today's epidemic mental retardation anomaly--The war not only against information, but the war against mind; and the staple brand manufacturing of the U.S. public educator as motion picture laughing stock in a devil may care, entertainment commercialized riot zone on what the electorate is supposed to keep throwing away its taxes and the students their disposable income, trend adoption, affected attitude, style, mannerisms and other grievously wasteful contaminations.The movie sets its own pace, follows the development of a little girl and her close-knit communal ties. Indeed it would appear that in the structuring of the mathematician here it does 'take a village'. And she turns out to become a remarkably gifted algebraist\/group theorist of some kind. We could parallel this film through a procedure often employed in mathematics, what's called an Extension to another European movie Mindwalk, where we could imagine catching up to her after her career had gone through a government military closure working on SDI in physics. This is the woman the politician's friend takes him to see on Mt.

So the film is a great relief from the mental cruelty heaped on intellectual aspirations in a perennially bullied and sinking American educational decline, promoted through the mass industry of Hollywood film propagandas marketed as so called 'entertainment'. 'Buyer beware.' Not to bother comparing it with the far inferior movie 'Proof', even in the biographical abundance that would have been available to structure a film about John Nash, A Beautiful Mind, a wide ranging set of life experiences also caught up in Europe for an extended time, instead a hack biographer is selected to play up the crazy smear in order a distortion in film can be manufactured from that template. Chalkboard scenes are important litmus for calibrating the realism or contrivance, in Antonia's Line you have a far more natural setting, in the Nash film something completely different, i.e. yet another instance of 'throwing away the textbook', similar to the classroom setting in 'Dead Poets Society', and a storming of the lecture by an overzealous psychiatrist's Gestapo when Nash lectures on The Riemann Hypothesis. Induce, then blame the victim&#151;the usual knuckle-dragging monkeyshine's half-truths and characteristically feckless White lies. The American audience is dismissed as childish enough to have those sorts of overt propaganda coercions foisted on them without comment or feedback, what are really unqualified abuses of portrayal, demeaning to education and educators and really amount to nothing more than the usual crass bullying of another intellectual that has come to supplant better film and literature development in this country domineered instead by 'Animal House' and high school movies trying to reduce our establishment to zoos and mockeries in terms of international standards.

If, upon weighing the available fare, interpreting and selecting from the alternatives this review stimulates a greater interest to seek out foreign film equivalents rather than continue to be bludgeoned by the bad parent of Hollywood imitations, hopefully the better informed consumer choice will result in a healthier film-going experience avoiding such obstacles to unhindered aspirations.

Then again, not every actor is Barbara Stanwyck, and she accomplishes this daunting task beautifully in The Lady Eve. Jean Harrington (Stanwyck) and her father, the Colonel (James Coburn), are a daughter\/father con artist team who prey on unwitting rich folks on cruise ships. On one such cruise, they meet their richest, most naive victim Charles Pike (Henry Fonda), a hopelessly gullible reptile lover who's just spent a year in the Amazon. He's been far away from civilization... and from women, so imagine his stunned reaction when sexy, worldly Jean makes a pass at him. Jean initially just wants Charles's money, but she unexpectedly falls in love. Charles, however, finds out about Jean and her father's shady ways and unceremoniously dumps her. This really throws Jean for a loop she's used to breaking hearts, not having her own broken. She's refuses to let some pampered rich boy permanently wound her pride, so she decides to exact her own unique revenge on the deserving Charles...The Lady Eve is indeed a fine comedy, but I didn't quite love it as much as I thought I would. I think it's because, in the end, they completely de-claw Jean and have her throw herself back at Charles. I don't care what anyone says there's no way a vibrant, feisty, independent woman like Jean would ever fall for an effete nincompoop like Charles. She may be a con artist, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't have standards! I thought Charles could have been written better; there's a huge difference between innocence and stupidity. I much preferred the relationship between Jean and her father. While hardly a good role model, he obviously loves his daughter and even supports her when she toys with the idea of going on the straight and narrow to win Charles.Stanwyck owns this movie. Like Bette Davis, she was never a conventional, classic beauty, but it was her confidence, style, and way she carried herself that made her a knockout. Stanwyck also gets to don gorgeous Edith Head dresses, including that resplendent, sparkling white gown with cap sleeves (you have any idea how hard it is to carry off cap sleeves?) that she wears when she re-enters Charles's life.So, in my humble opinion, the romance falls a little flat, but the comedy sure doesn't! To see Stanwyck at her most seductive and Henry Fonda at his most ridiculous, don't miss The Lady Eve.

While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath, a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In The Grapes of Wrath, Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, The Grapes of Wrath takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, The Grapes of Wrath avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed Stagecoach, Young Mr. Lincoln and Drums Along the Mohawk in less than 12 months. The Grapes of Wrath would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, The Grapes of Wrath was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln, one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2007","score":"23 out of 28 people found the following review useful","review":" During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever.

It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed Stagecoach, Young Mr. Lincoln and Drums Along the Mohawk in less than 12 months. The Grapes of Wrath would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, The Grapes of Wrath was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln, one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"4 May 2007","score":"10 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" Ho boy, where to begin?

One year later and with a lot more energy, his immediate action once he's able to move is to off the bum and head back to town, hoping to hunt down his niece who now has a psychic connection with him. A troop of teenagers are introduced, and the movie promises carnage. Sort of.This movie is bad. By bad I mean incompetent on pretty much every level. In horror movies, part of the delight and part of the terror is the fact that the teenagers die, but one character at least we hope will live. Not so in this one. Every single character is a hateful, stereotypical 80s idea of idiocy, and Michael's carnage can't come soon enough. This storytelling is backed up by probably some of the worst editing and directing I've ever seen, as characters move sporadically through jump cuts to... well, they don't really do much of anything, except ignore the warnings of a traumatized little child with a psychic connection to a serial killer. That role is given over to Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis, who somehow still has a practice and still is listened to, despite the fact that at this point he breaks about every rule of clinical ethics and the fact that he's an obnoxious jerk.Breaks every rule... that's what this movie does. This movie is so unable to bring actual horror, suspense, or gory delights to the fore that it literally just bumbles around hoping for something to photograph until Michael comes around, and then the storyline and directing are so incompetent they can't even make Michael seem cool. The scenes in the barn are pretty much must-see for film students who want to know exactly what NOT to do. And then, as if it's not enough, the movie has the audacity to introduce a new character for the sole purpose of letting Michael out of prison... who he is, what he's there for, what he knows, even if it's a he... there's no explanation. They literally wrote a character into the script because they were too lazy to know how to end this movie. That's like THE single basic screenplay no-no.Of course, there's always room for camp, but camp only works when the film goes in outrageous directions and does things creative and fun. This movie isn't even creative enough to come up with crazy, out-there ideas like Halloween 3, it just lazily serves the tropes of its genre without even the craft and skill required to make a successful continuity cut! By the time this movie ends, you will feel frustrated, bored, betrayed, and uninterested. While this movie plays, you will wish for every character to die just so that you no longer have to watch their stupid, mindless antics, and you will regret renting (or buying) the disc. Halloween 5 isn't even worth the plastic it's printed on, and that's bad considering how cheap it is to put things on DVD.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2007","score":"10 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" Ho boy, where to begin?

Uttered by the Terminator just before he launches into a murderous rampage as he looks for Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the savior of humanity in the future. The Terminator is not simply an action film. The Terminator is not simply a sci-fi film. It is both rolled into one. However the Terminator breaks away from the norm of all flash and no show.Sarah Connor is a regular woman living in Los Angeles. She's normal until someone attempts to assassinate her and then protected by a man claiming to be the future. The story is pretty much this stranger attempting to protect Sarah from this assassin who says very little. However the assassin is not human, he is a cyborg and the man claiming to be from the future actually is from the future sent back in time to protect the mother of the future savior of humanity against the machines who will attempt to destroy it.When I first read the plot for this I was so confused I was uncertain I wanted to watch it. Finally I did and I loved it and go back to it for a good story. The film could have been terrible. Everything could have gone wrong but Cameron was the driving force behind the film. He makes everything work how it should from the action to the plot to the acting. Everything flows as it should. It showed how much skill Cameron had even in his younger days of directing. (Remember this is 13 years before Titanic would come out)The acting is nothing great. Yes Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton give convincing performances. Michael Biehn in my opinion was one of your top actors in the 80's and he pretty much disappeared. In The Terminator he is cool, bright, sexy, and all else convincing as a soldier turned bodyguard. Linda Hamilton shows how true actresses should act. She convinced me she had no idea what was going on when she first had that gun pointed in her face. Both leads give strong and worthwhile performances.Of course the most famous of the film is Arnold. Cold, cunning, and silent he portrays the Terminator. I really must comment that Arnold barely does any acting whatsoever except for walking, shooting, and a rare word or two. However, it doesn't mean he is a waste on the screen. Arnold, when he found out how little acting he was going to have to do made sure he was using the weapons correctly and acting as much a machine as he possibly could. The story is actually very strong. Instead of no evidence being given of the future a ton of information is given including flashbacks (or would it be flash forwards) of battles Reese has gone through in his life. Nothing is set directly, many things have to be figured out on your own but nothing is really difficult to understand. The plot line is complex and an amazing world is painted around the storyThe action scenes are some of my personal favorites, especially the showdown in the police station. Cameron got exactly what he wanted when he directed the film. He wanted darkness, rage, violence, a story line that worked. However, the film isn't all about action and violence, it is about humanity and how it is destroying itself. He wanted to show what the future could hold for humans with the possession of nuclear weapons and advancements in technology. He got exactly that.

Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are intruders in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.

Can death be overcome? West thinks so, and with his reagent serum he might just prove to the world how right he is.Re-Animator ranks at the very top of my all-time favorite horror movies. For a guy who has seen probably one thousand horror films, that's quite the accomplishment. For me, the film is paced perfectly, has plenty of gore, a fair amount of nudity (and a scene of sexuality you won't find elsewhere), some black comedy and a simple plot premise (a variation on the Frankenstein story).This is the film that gave Jeffrey Combs his place in cult film history. On the basis of this movie alone, he is sought after to appear in other horror films and appear at horror conventions. Sure, some of his other films are pretty good, and he had an impressive run on both Star Trek Deep Space Nine and The 4400. But he will always be known as Herbert West. None of the other stars (David Gale, Bruce Abbott, Barbara Crampton) has gone on to such a level of recognition.The film has some flaws. The score, which is supposed to be an homage to Psycho sounds more like a blatant ripoff. And my biggest pet peeve is trying to find a complete copy of the film. I owned the longer, R-rated version on VHS. Now I own the shorter, unrated version on DVD (the Millennium Edition). I have yet to find one that combines the gore of the uncut version with the plot of the R-rated one (which I think really drives home the story and fleshes out the motives and power of Dr. Hill).But the sheer fun of the film makes up for the flaws. Jeffrey Combs is clearly having plenty of fun, and the way they approach such things as the reanimated cat and the use of the reagent as an intravenous drug tells me they knew that the key was just letting a good time fly.The people involved with this film (Combs, director Stuart Gordon and producer Brian Yuzna) went on to make a variety of other Lovecraft-inspired films. So I guess I have to thank the success of Re-Animator for giving them the chance to pursue these other projects (even the less wonderful ones like Necronomicon or Dagon (which many people like but I wasn't impressed)).If you're a horror fan and haven't seen this, shame on you.

Wandering home after their encounter, he is abducted by Jesse Hooker, (Lance Henriksen) and his gang, Severen, (Bill Paxton) Diamondback, (Jenette Goldstein) and Homer, (Joshua John Miller) and offer him to join their group. Reluctantly accepting, he is soon ingrained into the group, and after a couple of encounters with other people on the road, he soon learns that he's not a human anymore. When his family, Loy, (Tim Thomerson) and Sarah, (Marcie Leeds) track them down to get him back, and when he must decide where his allegiances lie, forcing a fierce battle to the death.The Good News This here felt overrated, but it did have some good moments. The best qualities in the film are it's three solid action scenes. The bar scene is quite fun to watch, simply due to it being the first time there's some actual victims. It's hard to pick out the best scene there, as there's some great stuff here. From the stalking of the bartender to the assaults on the patrons and the short little intermission with the teenage cowboy make up some great scenes. The later shootout in the motel amounts to the film's greatest action scene, as the bullets fly around inside the small room, with the sunlight filtering in burning the vampires, and a fiery, gory climax really make it stand out. The final showdown, which is right up there as a really standout moment and allows for some really nice gore scenes as well. The one main gore scene in the film, where one of the vampires is seen after being hit by a truck with the side of the face completely smashed to a pulp, bloody bruises across most of the head, the side caved in slightly and a large amount of wounds on the arm. We see it very briefly but clearly, and it really manages to seep in and become memorable. There's a nice, fiery ending as well that really gets the film out at the right spot and high, and is one of the film's best points. There's also one of the most novel and interesting ways of having a vampire walk around in sunlight, with the constant blackening of windows on their cars. It's remarkably creative and original, and is another bright spot in the film. Otherwise, this was a really overrated film with just a few things to like about it.The Bad News This isn't all that great of a film. There's a lot to dislike here, including the fact that the villains here are so obviously vampires and nothing is specifically mentioned about that. As there's no mention of the term, fangs or even the traditional methods of dealing with vampires, such as being staked in the chest, garlic, crosses and holy water, are completely missing in any way, shape or form from the movie. The only one it manages to get right is the being exposed to sunlight. The change in appearance and behavior are enough to cause some grievances with vampire fans. These don't act like the traditional impression of what vampires, and the change is kinda out-there for a lot of the old-school to adapt to. That accounts to a lot of what's wrong, although the complete lack of action. Since the beginning is relegated to just having the new recruit around and his ability to accept what has happened, which just drag on and on. There's only two big action scenes, and they're both near the end of the film, leaving it to wallow in boredom at the beginning, what with all the rules being explained and what's going on biologically. This is just deathly boring and nothing of much happens during this part, rendering it so hard to sit through. The ending is also one of the film's biggest flaws. The reversal of the vampiric condition applied to the one character is quite believable, as it was a short while ago that it occurred, but to have it done to the second participant is a little out there. It's been mentioned that the one had been a vampire for several years before the film started, and with the amount of time to get used to the specific variations between the two, and to have that simply changed in a simple operation is quite stupid. All things considered, this one felt overrated.The Final Verdict With only a few good moments in this, this is a severely overrated vampire film that will disappoint.

One of them contains short stories from South America like The Flying Donkey and Pablo the Cold Bloodest Pengiun, the second pops out his good friend from the 1943 film Saludos Amigos, Jose Carioca, as I said, one of Walt's best 1940's characters shows him around South America in the storybook then the bizarreness begins when Panchito the rooster comes out of the third present with guns a blazing! It all turns into a Topsy-turvy South American Mania!! Yowee! Along the way, it was the first film in history to use cartoon characters mixing in a normal world environment as Donald fall for a real life Mexican actress. That must have been big new sign of technology back in those days. In remember as old photo in England from July, 1945 when people were sadly queueing up for rationing and the Three Caballeros was up on a billboard behind them being advertised. That must of brought them joy during the most hardest of time. I strongly recommend this movie and if you don't like it, then you're a bean-head! 10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"}]
