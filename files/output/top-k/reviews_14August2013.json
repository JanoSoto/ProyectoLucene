[{"date":"14 August 2013","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I hate this movie, I really do. George Lucas squanders whatever talent and reputation that he had left on this god awful film that sadly has made one billion dollars. In the world's defense, they did not know what they were getting into. The beginning of the film tells us that it is doomed from the start. Zero character development... Just light sabers. Hard to believe the previous installments were compelling. However, I can see what Lucas was trying to do. He was trying to find familiarity. He did it in the wrong thing, it is better to find familiarity in plot points and certain details, sadly he tried to find it in more lasting things, like characters. That is where surprisingly, where the film reaches its lows. He tries to make it an ensemble thing. In a film like this, that setup cannot work. He needed to give one character, and I do mean one character a focus, or a journey. You need to get attached to characters before they engage in risky situations, it will have more of an effect because your emotional effect resonates into making the characters go through real peril. This setup does not work, that's why the film fails. The performances do not make this film better, not one bit. Liam Neeson and Ian McGregor give decent performances, but the real weak link is Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, and Ahamed Best as Jar Jar Binks. Both easily some of the worst performances from a child actor, and an actor in general I have ever seen. In Anakin's case, he needed to be a teenager or a young adult, that will make more of the situations he goes through believable. But Jar Jar, I despised every waking moment, every dollar wasted through CGI, every second I heard his grinding, agonizing voice, the bottom line is that this character was not needed, ever, what were you thinking George? What were you thinking? There actually was something I liked from this film- Samuel L Jackson as a Jedi! Best casting ever, enough said. In the end, this is fortunately the lowest possible point in the prequel trilogy, if you saw it, stay as far away as possible.

But such is the elusive nature of this endeavour, it never has quite has been attained in the history of film &#x96; well that's before a certain masterpiece going by the name of Apocalypse now graced our screens with this almost mythical alliance of this magnitude. The director Francis Ford Coppola (Godfather trilogy). The story a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness almost ready to descent into primal madness, as Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) has to navigate his way through hell on earth to find and kill AWOL Col. Kurtz (The actor) Marlon Brando (On the Waterfront and Godfather 1) - whose very name is translated into greatness in almost every language known to man. The epic tale of this coming together will probably never happen again or would even have another three components assembled that will ever parallel it. So it something to be marvelled at, as you sits down in your comfortable chair to watch such a spectacle. It has been widely reported from a variety of different sources about the hardship endured by the production team. Such as shooting in a country notorious for typhoons, even at one time the place they were story the film burnt down, but luckily it remained safe, and the little fact that the main character Martin sheen was a supposed alcoholic, and would turn up on set with hangovers. All this helps to perpetuate the legend that is apocalypse now, and the irony that they were facing their own war, just at the same time they were filming it.But what I love most in film, is when bold story and director hold up a mirror to society, penetrating through the shards and illusions of morality and believing that we are able to distinguish between good vs. Evil as if it was between black and white, that we like to delude ourselves with every day, but then when we enter the battlefield it seems our civilised selves gets left behind as lines get blurred. And that is what Apocalypse now does best, it blurs the line. And with lines blurred it not a surprised that the main characters go insane, pretty much anyone would, in the face of a world that turns the world you lived and knew upside down. But my only criticism of film, is the focus of the film, I feel it waved far too much into the obsession of Martin Sheen's character as he tries to find Marlon Brando, when I feel that they could have taken time aside to explore the war from the perspective of the other men accompanying him on his journey, particularly Laurence Fishbuornes character who was just 17, so it would have been interesting to hear things from a black boy fighting in a white man's war.It obvious my stance on the film, that I believe is must see for all, but if the first paragraph wasn't enough to persuade you into watching Apocalypse now, here is another, I would go as far as to say that Vittorio Storaro cinematography was as if watching a walking and talking Picasso piece, such was the extent of the visual art mastery he conjured up in Apocalypse Now, as if he were the offspring of Gandalf and Dumbledore. The final few scenes with Marlon Brando were simply captivating, short but sweet. Vittorio Storaro's blending of darkness and shimmers of light streaking across Brando's face was simply breathtaking, giving Brando an almost god like aura. The scene itself probably belongs hanged up on a wall in the Tate Modern as much as it deserves to be on a film screen. The benchmark for all to follow.

Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make.As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in To Have And Have Not, Dark Passage, and Key Largo just isn't that evident here.And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences.Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a good film. Not a great film.For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective.Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it.Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in The Maltese Falcon. I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall.Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight.It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great.

If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi\/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made.But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much phatter, cooler, crasser action in the decades since 1984.Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film.The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible.There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly.One reviewer commented that the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first. Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes.Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole\/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the future. Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?. But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi\/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made.But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much phatter, cooler, crasser action in the decades since 1984.Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film.The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible.There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly.One reviewer commented that the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first. Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes.Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole\/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the future. Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?. But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends.Then, along comes Alien Resurrection, which is the true road to ruin for the Alien movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of Alien 3. Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship.The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true Alien film. That is what it felt like to me.My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. Alien introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, Aliens gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most cliché things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature.Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in Poseidon as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In Alien and Alien 3, they had little to no weapons and in Aliens they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience.While I would watch Alien Resurrection over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the Alien franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a what happens now? thought running through the audience's brains.

When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?That is the question that the audience has to ask itself during this sci-fi mentally ill time traveling futuristic movie. Is the lead character mentally ill or is he really on a mission traveling through time in order to find a cure to a deadly virus that has wiped off nearly all the population and forced the few survivors to live underground? Director Terry Gilliam has created a memorable sci-fi flick that like all time traveling films has a few in-congruencies but still manages to hold the audience's attention. Gilliam is better known for his work in Monty Python, but he's also directed different types of genre films like The Fisher King (dramedy), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (adventure), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (Fantasy). He has a pretty respectable filmography as a director, although I still think he did his best work in the 90's. This film has a strong screenplay, but it will be remembered for the strong performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Twelve Monkeys is a dark futuristic film similar in some ways to Blade Runner although it kind of diverges all over the place with so many ideas. This is an inventive film but I don't know how many ideas were taken from Chris Marker's 1962 short film, La jetee, which inspired this movie. The screenplay was adapted by David Webb Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) and Janet Peoples. His influence from Blade Runner seems to be mixed in the screenplay here as well. This is a very fun sci-fi film although full of really weird moments.The film takes place sometime in the future after a deadly virus wiped out over 5 billion people and the few survivors were forced to live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict who is sent by a group of scientists to the past in order to gather information about the virus. The scientists want to study the virus so they can create a cure and live in the outside world once again. Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 instead of 1996 which was the year in which the virus began spreading, and he ends up in a mental hospital after attacking several police officers. At the mental hospital he is treated by Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and he also meets another patient named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who happens to be the son of a famous scientist (Christopher Plummer). Cole at first begins to search desperately for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys because they are believed to be the group responsible for spreading the virus, but later he begins to question himself and believe that he might actually be insane himself. This is a puzzle that he will have to piece together with the help of Railly. This is the puzzle that Gilliam invites the audience to solve along the way and keeps us guessing as the plot unfolds before our eyes. I'm not a huge fan of futuristic films, but Gilliam's vision here is pretty hypnotic and poetic. Most of the film actually takes place in the past, but there are several elements introduced that keep us guessing what will happen next. There were a few stand out scenes like the one in which Cole and Railly are at a movie theater and begin commenting on how despite having seen the movie before the perception of it changes every time, similar to what is happening with Cole through his time traveling. Does his presence in the past change things in the future? Can he find the virus on time in order to save the people in the future? These are a few questions that the film raises. The more you think about things the more flaws you will find, but that doesn't take away anything from this sci-fi film. I really liked Brad Pitt's performance here for which he received an Academy nomination, although he lost to Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects). The film runs a bit long, but it never ceases to entertain.Rating 7,1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2013","score":"","review":" I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here.

The screenplay was adapted by David Webb Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) and Janet Peoples. His influence from Blade Runner seems to be mixed in the screenplay here as well. This is a very fun sci-fi film although full of really weird moments.The film takes place sometime in the future after a deadly virus wiped out over 5 billion people and the few survivors were forced to live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict who is sent by a group of scientists to the past in order to gather information about the virus. The scientists want to study the virus so they can create a cure and live in the outside world once again. Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 instead of 1996 which was the year in which the virus began spreading, and he ends up in a mental hospital after attacking several police officers. At the mental hospital he is treated by Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and he also meets another patient named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who happens to be the son of a famous scientist (Christopher Plummer). Cole at first begins to search desperately for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys because they are believed to be the group responsible for spreading the virus, but later he begins to question himself and believe that he might actually be insane himself. This is a puzzle that he will have to piece together with the help of Railly. This is the puzzle that Gilliam invites the audience to solve along the way and keeps us guessing as the plot unfolds before our eyes. I'm not a huge fan of futuristic films, but Gilliam's vision here is pretty hypnotic and poetic. Most of the film actually takes place in the past, but there are several elements introduced that keep us guessing what will happen next. There were a few stand out scenes like the one in which Cole and Railly are at a movie theater and begin commenting on how despite having seen the movie before the perception of it changes every time, similar to what is happening with Cole through his time traveling. Does his presence in the past change things in the future? Can he find the virus on time in order to save the people in the future? These are a few questions that the film raises. The more you think about things the more flaws you will find, but that doesn't take away anything from this sci-fi film. I really liked Brad Pitt's performance here for which he received an Academy nomination, although he lost to Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects). The film runs a bit long, but it never ceases to entertain.Rating 7,1\/10 ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"14 August 2013","score":"","review":" I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?That is the question that the audience has to ask itself during this sci-fi mentally ill time traveling futuristic movie. Is the lead character mentally ill or is he really on a mission traveling through time in order to find a cure to a deadly virus that has wiped off nearly all the population and forced the few survivors to live underground? Director Terry Gilliam has created a memorable sci-fi flick that like all time traveling films has a few in-congruencies but still manages to hold the audience's attention. Gilliam is better known for his work in Monty Python, but he's also directed different types of genre films like The Fisher King (dramedy), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (adventure), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (Fantasy). He has a pretty respectable filmography as a director, although I still think he did his best work in the 90's. This film has a strong screenplay, but it will be remembered for the strong performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt.

I have seen it, and to be honest, I really like it. It is campy and a little stupid, but it really doesn't deserve to be given the same title given to other horrible movies like 'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie' or 'Jaws The Revenge'.I'm not saying that people should stop hating on this movie (because I can see what people have against it) but I do think that people need to calm down about it. There are far worse superhero movies out there like 'Superman IV' and 'Catwoman'.Onto the film itself, like I said, I can see what people have against it The acting is awful, the story is campy and the movie overall isn't well directed.I don't think the acting is that bad. There are a few characters who are terrible (like Batgirl, who was meant to be British but it is obvious that the actress is American), but some characters do pretty good performances. George Clooney does a good job as Batman, Michael Gough does a great job as Alfred, Uma Thurman is a convincing Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a pretty funny Mr Freeze (although I do agree that most of his ice puns are painful). The rest of the characters are pretty mediocre, but not terrible.The story is no Oscar-winning masterpiece, but it is still a good story that flows well. The (very) basic plot synopsis is that Batman and Robin are trying to stop Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing Gotham City and taking over the world. (Of course!)That may sound like a boring and clichéd story, but it is actually quite good. The sub-plots fit into the story perfectly, especially one about Alfred dying of MacGregor's Syndrome.Overall, I feel that Batman and Robin is one of the most over-hated movies of all time and should really be given a chance. Like I said, it isn't perfect, but it really isn't as awful as everybody says. If you watch the movie with the knowledge that is a campy flick, you'll have a good time, just don't listen to the people who say that it is a horrible abomination to cinema, because it really isn't.7\/10P.S. - If you want to know what I think of Bane, I think he is closer to the comics than Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' because the inclusion of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength.

People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here.

I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird.

You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie.Rating 10\/10Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2013","score":"","review":" The Birds I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans.

The attempt may backfire in more than one ways. Ferris Bueller's Day Off thankfully stays crisp till the end, a genre-defining film that manages to revive you with a fresh verve on a familiar concept. No, I'm not saying its the best film I've seen on the subject but it's a thoroughly enjoyable fare that wasn't aiming for that anyway. Or was it? Doesn't matter. It manages to charm in many ways, and that's the whole point.Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a teenage miscreant who fakes an illness to skip school on a beautiful summer day. Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), his best friend, decides to join him in his plans to spend a memorable albeit intuitive day. Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) is also picked up by them from school right under the supervision of the dean, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who is out to nail Ferris for his poor attendance record. As the gang spends the day roaming around the city, Rooney repeatedly tries to apprehend Ferris but to no avail. Ferris' sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), jealous of her brother's ability to wriggle out of any tight situation, longs to catch him fooling around. The story revolves around how Ferris and his friends spend an entire day that is both unforgettable and life-changing.Ferris Bueller's Day Off starts off on a great note, with a few of the film's funniest scenes playing out in the first-half itself. Broderick sneaks into his character effortlessly, being charming and fascinating from the very beginning and never letting his character be someone you won't like. Apart from the many things that impressed me, I was most inspired by how director John Hughes made it seem all so familiar. I chuckled at how many of the scenes in the movie took me back to certain points in my life when I faced a similar situation, and when you're reminded of something like that in a movie, you know that the director has done his job well. The characters are endearing, likable and that helps when the film starts to slog after a while. Hughes has always been great at creating rascally characters who are affable enough to carry a parodic story to its end. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is no different. It doesn't even seek to try anything else other than delight you with its vigor and observations. And, in parts, it's pretty hilarious.When attempting a coming-of-age film, one should keep his indulgences in check. Though Ferris Bueller's Day Off targets the younger generation, I found it a tad too childish. And that's not entirely bad, but after a while, I found it difficult to invest into the characters. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a corpus of the fantasies of an average teenager, which is also the reason why the touch of pragmatism is almost entirely abandoned. Hughes creates a world where nothing can go wrong for his protagonist, where everything is sorted out with absurd ease and a few clever pranks. The character of Ferris Bueller is a synecdoche, just a synecdoche. If you like him, you'll like the movie. But if you don't, you might find it more annoying than amusing. Me, I liked him when he first came on-screen but I found my likeness wearying as the story progressed. But your viewpoint about the him may differ.Broderick, in his most important role to date, infuses Ferris with charm and wit that gives the movie its legs. It's a candid performance and surely Broderick's best. Sara is absolutely gorgeous to look at and she brings a quiet confidence to her role. Ruck is fascinating as Cameron, and when I grew tired of Ferris' antics, I found myself looking forward to watching Ruck's elucidation of his character. He hands in a wonderfully nuanced performance and the best of the lot.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a watchable film, supremely entertaining, a good-looking film with its heart in the right place. Though I was expecting it to really dig into the genre, and was disappointed when it chose to stay away from being too ambitious and played it safe instead, it's one of those films that delights in everything it does.

Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused.Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules.Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny.Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place.So its a 6 from me. ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"14 August 2013","score":"","review":" Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called Star Wars program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - It's in your nature to destroy yourselves. So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words No Fate meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization.But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do.

Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party\/wine cellar\/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the villain and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it.
