However, if you are fine with a film that actually attempts to do something, instead of aliens shooting at a protagonist who utters bad-a** one liners as he wins an impossible fight, then you will in most likelihood, love this one. Stop now, if when I say sci-fi you think of stuff like BattleLA and Avatar. Stalker is a movie that explores the human condition. Throughout the movie, the scenes are defined by the long, drawn out, even sometimes awkwardly so, harrowing shots. Paired with the intensity with which the shots are taken, switching from a pan showing a lush green with three lonely figures centered within the frame, to tight over the shoulder glances following Writer down the Meat-grinder, the film builds its own unique, ethereal grasp. A common remark made on the lower ratings is that despite how dangerous Stalker keeps claiming the Zone is, nothing ever happens to them. If you have watched the actual movie, then you would know this to be false. Though, tie this to the over arching complaint that nothing happens in this movie. The point of the movie is not what physically happens, they want to get somewhere, they get there, then they come back to the bar, but what they understand due to this journey. The idea that men are, in essence, flawed by their selfishness, the death of hope in society, spirituality\/empiricism etc, all are reflected in the resolution of the plot. All the men find that they are unable to actually find out their base instincts, as it is too horrifying for them to want to see. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredibly hard movie to watch, but it is more than worth the effort. It is resounding, deep, and unfortunately for some people, forces you to think.

That's because I made the mistake of starting the film around midnight--intending to only watch a few minutes and then go to bed. However, at almost 230am, I was still awake--ratcheted to the TV screen watching Brubaker until its exciting conclusion.The film is essentially the experiences of Tom Murton as warden of a hellish prison in Arkansas--although unlike the movie, he did NOT enter the prison disguised as a prisoner. The horror of it all is what makes this very compelling viewing--and a film you should NOT let your kids watch. Rather vivid depictions of beatings, rapes and other violence against the prisoners (mostly by other prisoners) make this tough viewing--and the viewer should think about this first. Now this is NOT a criticism--the harsh language and violence is necessary to adequately show the horrible conditions existing in this prison in the 1960s. In many ways, it's much more horrific than The Shawshank Redemption--and unlike this Stephen King story, Brubaker is true. Corruption on a massive scale and the state's unwillingness to reform make this a very compelling movie.Excellent acting by the ensemble cast make this an amazing movie to watch. And, not surprisingly, Robert Redford is his usual exceptional self. The only negative is that despite a great story and acting, the direction and editing are poor. An egregious example is late in the story. One of the trustees escape during a rain storm and is being tracked down by Brubaker and some other trustees. However, as they track him down there is dust everywhere and no trace of rain---talk about sloppy! Still, this is a minor technical quibble and the film is one of the best prison films I have seen.

This movie could have been a great action comedy. It had the right screenplay and the right actors for that. But... Here is the problem - Steven Soderbergh did not have a clue how to make it entertaining. You know, that is what an action comedy is supposed to be - entertaining. But 'Out of Sight' is far from being an entertaining movie. There are visual experiments. There are long pseudo-meaningful scenes which do not add anything to the story. This movie is pretentious. But! There is just one problem but it is HUGE! The screenplay of the movie is not meant to be turned into a high art. There are some buddy-cop jokes for Christ's sake! Had this movie been directed by Richard Donner or some director like him it would be a lighthearted action movie. But no, Soderbergh wanted to be Serious. But the seriousness of his direction just doesn't go well with the jokes. This movie had to be fast paced. Instead it's pacing is incredibly slow. This movie had to be entertaining. Instead it is boring. This movie had to be funny. But it is not.I don't know why it is rated so high.

How could Sofia Coppola be such a good director unless by some kind of genetics, or osmosis? I mean, she has as many bad films as her father, but she has three good ones (one of them the brilliant Lost in Translation) This one, The Virgin Suicides is based on a book by Jeffrey Eugenides, who has a detailed and somewhat superficial style that depends more on a sequence of events than on depth of character. And that carries over to this movie. It may not be a brilliant affair in the end, but it's inventive, it has a unique glow to it (both from the camera and from the pacing, the odd aura of the movies plot), and it's quirky, unafraid to takes some important little chances.The basis for everything is an absurd situation if you look at it straight--a tightly buttoned up family with five gorgeous girls in high school that all the boys are interested in. Pressures build inside and out and the eventual suicide or two or more take place. The nostalgic voice-over removes the emotional devastation these events would normally demand, but even the filming, with its artificial construction and even occasional liberties (showing time passing or seeing through a dress to some writing on a girl's panties) make everything a faraway experience. We are only to watch, with wry appreciation, not get sucked in and ruined.You could easily critique this film hard, and point out its inability to talk about family dysfunction, or to explore high school angst and social structure, or even to get into the head of one of the five girls (Kirsten Dunst, most likely, since she has the largest role). But Coppola isn't interested in true depth. She's making a glossy, affected entertainment, a clever and surprising one, a surprisingly original one. The feel to a lot of this seems to echo her father's failed Peggy Sue Got Married from a decade earlier, with slightly different nostalgic roots, but with a similar feeling of detachment and shiny surface feel. And in both cases with a determination to have slightly silly fun.Of course, if there was a hint of reality here the fun would be too macabre for even bad taste. And that's where the movie works. It creates a zone of humor, of insight into an era (the 1970s) that must have been the first generation X after the meaningful 60s. The acting is spot on, both among the kids, including the wry sly Dunst and several of the boys, all terrifically awkward except for suave Josh Hartnett, and among the two main adults, the parents played by Kathleen Turner and a perfect James Woods. The stereotypes are played just hard enough to seem false, which is fine for this kind of movie, but the religious zealousness of the mother might strike some people as just too much. I have to say though, I knew a girl whose mother did exactly that and worse to her, and she wasn't a religious nut at all. Records of rock music in the 1970s were often labelled as such bad influences they had to be destroyed.Let go your expectations and give this a look for what it is, which is pretty unique and filled with odd richness and disturbing and intentional irrelevance. Rather too often brilliant to brush off.

The nostalgic voice-over removes the emotional devastation these events would normally demand, but even the filming, with its artificial construction and even occasional liberties (showing time passing or seeing through a dress to some writing on a girl's panties) make everything a faraway experience. We are only to watch, with wry appreciation, not get sucked in and ruined.You could easily critique this film hard, and point out its inability to talk about family dysfunction, or to explore high school angst and social structure, or even to get into the head of one of the five girls (Kirsten Dunst, most likely, since she has the largest role). But Coppola isn't interested in true depth. She's making a glossy, affected entertainment, a clever and surprising one, a surprisingly original one. The feel to a lot of this seems to echo her father's failed Peggy Sue Got Married from a decade earlier, with slightly different nostalgic roots, but with a similar feeling of detachment and shiny surface feel. And in both cases with a determination to have slightly silly fun.Of course, if there was a hint of reality here the fun would be too macabre for even bad taste. And that's where the movie works. It creates a zone of humor, of insight into an era (the 1970s) that must have been the first generation X after the meaningful 60s. The acting is spot on, both among the kids, including the wry sly Dunst and several of the boys, all terrifically awkward except for suave Josh Hartnett, and among the two main adults, the parents played by Kathleen Turner and a perfect James Woods. The stereotypes are played just hard enough to seem false, which is fine for this kind of movie, but the religious zealousness of the mother might strike some people as just too much. I have to say though, I knew a girl whose mother did exactly that and worse to her, and she wasn't a religious nut at all. Records of rock music in the 1970s were often labelled as such bad influences they had to be destroyed.Let go your expectations and give this a look for what it is, which is pretty unique and filled with odd richness and disturbing and intentional irrelevance. Rather too often brilliant to brush off.

How could Sofia Coppola be such a good director unless by some kind of genetics, or osmosis? I mean, she has as many bad films as her father, but she has three good ones (one of them the brilliant Lost in Translation) This one, The Virgin Suicides is based on a book by Jeffrey Eugenides, who has a detailed and somewhat superficial style that depends more on a sequence of events than on depth of character. And that carries over to this movie. It may not be a brilliant affair in the end, but it's inventive, it has a unique glow to it (both from the camera and from the pacing, the odd aura of the movies plot), and it's quirky, unafraid to takes some important little chances.The basis for everything is an absurd situation if you look at it straight--a tightly buttoned up family with five gorgeous girls in high school that all the boys are interested in.

Now all we like is big guns, visual effects with dopey story lines.So it is nice to know that I can still appreciate what filmmakers achieved back in the 30's. I mean sure, some of the effects may seem a little goofy but it is a terrific achievement for what they achieved back then. A lot of Kong's close ups look really realistic and are also frightening with his eerie glances and stares.The story is still the same as the original. Anne is asked by Carl Denham to accompany him to a mysterious island to make a film. Anne, thinking this is her big chance to make it big as an actress, joins along only to have the crew encounter a lost tribe, and a giant gorilla - Kong.While I think the remake did a lot more in terms of character development as well as the relationship with Anne and Kong, this film is all about the disaster aspects and the epic journey rather than the love relationships Peter Jackon's focused on. And why shouldn't it be? It works as a disaster film, a monster film and just a great time to spend an hour and a half. There are some really fun scenes, such as when Kong fights the T Rex. I was amazed at the sea monster that attacked the crew because at times it looked really real.I have to admire what films in the old times could do so while I have some minor issues, it is mainly because I am not entirely used to the period back then depicted in 30's films. But it certainly is growing on me and this doesn't really impact on my liking of the film at all. Yeah sure it's not as developed as the remake, nor do you get to particularly warm up to the characters or get to know them as well, but hey - this version is all about Kong! And Kong surely makes his presence made in a major way because he is the main star and the filmmakers sure made sure of it!

However this incredibly flat and superficial interpretation of Joan of Arc's life is completely emancipatory and forgetful at the very best. His biggest downfall was to choose the story of such a prominent figure in history which required so much more work than just a super-imposed stylistic approach from a director who, in his success, could afford to throw in key ingredients to Cookie cut himself another successful blockbuster... There was so much material that could have been explored from what we know of the life and death of Joan la Pucelle, as well as the period in which this story takes place, and the characters that may have influenced her as well as the many she did influence along the way... the list goes on! I hope another director will be up for the challenge in the future, because this story has real potential for an all out classic movie.Ways in which this can be achieved 1- get a better lead actress, no offense to Mila but this role is WAY out of her league! she should stick to what she knows... 2- get a better script writer - one who can focus on what he really wants to write (because this one goes in all directions) and write it with more maturity!! 3- get a director who can explore the story with more depth and understanding, because I don't think Mr Besson really understood the essence of the Character... putting it plainly, even if Joan was a lunatic, she saved France and led an army to victory... would an army follow a screaming adolescent\/psychotic child?
