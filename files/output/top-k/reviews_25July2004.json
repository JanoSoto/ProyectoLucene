Anyways I was so glad I bought it! I even bought the soundtrack, it's just so good!  it's amazing how Quentin Tarantino has a natural skill to tell a story that, if someone else would have told it, it would be dead boring or just stupid..  I noticed that in both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, all the dialogues are absolutely necessaries!  You won't see stupid phrases like in horror movies when the killer is approaching and they say ruuuun! d'oh! of course u have to run, there's no need to say it!!-  here, if you take away one single dialogue, the whole thing falls apart.So the casting is perfect, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc... they were all great, the careers of all these actors turned to a different direction after this movie, for good of course, for all of them (especially Travolta who was dead for Hollywood and thanks to this movie he's still around).  Also Harvey Keitel, even his character didn't have a lot of screentime, he did great, he's my favorite.

I borrowed the DVD from a friend and watched it late one Saturday night and found it entertaining.  There was a cool visual feel that sucked me in right away and the script and direction actually did a very good job at creating an eerie alien world.  It reminded me of the world that Riddley Scott created in the first Aliens.  You don't know very much about the world, but you know enough to let your imagination fill in the oh so creepy AND curious details.  Its rare these days that a movie actually assumes you have some imagination and even rarer that it tries to engage it!  Case in point, some characters don't speak English. Instead of giving them bad accents or putting up subtitles, the director intentionally keeps you in the dark.  You don't really need to know that `ensign green #1' says to `ensign green #2', `I am scared.'  `Yes, me too.'&#133; Instead, the director relies on the actors to *emote* that, and again, your mind fills in the details-far more effective.I am not really a big fan of Diesel, and knew nothing about the supporting cast.  But they could actually act!  Even the minor characters played their `ensign green' roles well.  You know that all the characters will not make it and many will die in a morally `appropriate manner' and I get annoyed at films that try to kid us about this little fact.  The film generally does a good job not trying to play this silly game.  Overall the film is more horror than Sci-Fi but it did a good job of creating tension and is worth a rental.  If you can, watch it on DVD as there is a good visual texture to it that.

It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting.

I always feel that the best movies are ones that I can most relate to. The reason why I don't even have a slight urge to see any of the Lord of the Rings films is because what is there to relate to in those stories? How am I supposed to connect with characters who are saving the world from monsters? However, I can relate to the characters and situations in Edward Burns's films. I feel like I'm part of their lives. And most importantly, they talk like REAL people! Burns has a knack for sharp, yet realistic dialogue. The movie was shot on an extremely, and I mean extremely, low budget. I learned a lot from Burns's DVD commentary and he gives a lot of confidence to aspiring student filmmakers like myself. Most of the locations are either in someone's house, in the park or on the sidewalks. There ya go! No permits, no shooting within private property--yet is it sacrificing the integrity of the film? Not one bit. The film stock itself isn't the best of quality, but that goes to show audiences that a movie doesn't have to be visually spectacular to be good. Good script and good actors--that's what you need.End of story! Burns could've shot the whole movie on an old video camera, and that wouldn't have made the finished product any less effective. Now, onto what didn't work about this film. Low-budget doesn't exactly translate to low quality, but there's usually at least a few sacrifices to be made. For example, some of the acting in The Brothers McMullen is wooden. What surprised me was that Jack Mulcahy is the only actor in the cast with previous experience, and he's the worst of the bunch! He delivers his lines with hardly any emotion and rarely changes his facial expression. Maxine Bahns, who basically was hired because she was Burns's girlfriend at the time, isn't a great actress and proves that she's not much more than a pretty face. Mike McGlone gives the best performance, as he seems the most natural and comfortable with his role. People tend to criticize Edward Burns as an actor, and he's no Robert DeNiro, but at the same time he's good at playing an extension of himself. Some actors, or performers I should say, are good at playing one type of role and there's nothing wrong with that. The Brothers McMullen is not a brilliant film, but it's very good for its budget and serves as a fine escape from all these corny special effects extravaganzas.

Kennedy and James Coburn), one of the best comedy actors ever (Walter Matthau), and the city of Paris. Nothing could possibly go wrong, don't you think? Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert, an American girl married to a swiss guy called Charles Lambert (at least that's what she thinks)... She's spending her holidays in some ski resort with her best girlfriend Sylvie and the son of hers. Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, so she gets back to Paris. Once there she found out that her husband's been killed. From this moment on she gets involved in the funniest spy plot ever.Watching Charade you'll have an smile on your face from the beginning till the very end. And you'll burst out laughing in many moments of the movie. Stanley Donen gets out of every sequence very skillfully and, as he did before in Seven Brides or Singin' In The Rain, he probes he's an outstanding filmmaker. There're two names that come into my mind every time I watch this movie Alfred Hitchcock and Blake Edwards. In Charade, Stanley Donen merged suspense and romantic-comedy in the best possible way. Actor's selection is just perfect, the chemical between Hepburn and Grant is simply unbeatable. One more perfect couple to add to Hollywood's Couple's Hall Of Fame side by side with Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn-Cary Grant (him once again!), Lauren Bacall-Humphrey Bogart... It's not easy to find two actors so compatible. What to say about George Kennedy or James Coburn? Best known for their roles in action movies, they do their best as CIA agents.

Pi had all of the components of Requiem that I had appreciated, minus the gritty and disturbing plot. Pi sucked me in from the beginning. The movie did not revolve around the plot, but rather the plot was just one of the many components of the film (along with the cinematography, music, etc.) While some people may say that the plot didn't make sense or was stupid, I disagree.

I haven't seen too many of his films, and he's just an average director to me.  But I have to say that he impressed me with Platoon.  By not holding anything back and basing the film on his own experiences in Vietnam, he has made one of the best and most realistic war-movies I've ever seen, and in my opinion, the best and most important film about the Vietnam-war. We follow a young man named Chris Taylor (played by Charlie Sheen) through the time he serves in the war.  Patriotic, he wants to live up to his father (who served in the World War II) and his grandfather (who served in the World War I), but he soon realizes that the war is not a place for him to be.  As time passes by, he gets deeper into the war and a conflict breaks out between the two lieutenants and veterans of Taylor's platoon Barnes (played by Tom Berenger) and Elias (played by Willem Dafoe).  The conflict splits the troop in two.  One part is supporting Elias and the other part supports Barnes.  This is when Taylor realizes that this war is about more than just fighting against the enemy.As mentioned, Oliver Stone holds nothing back when he portrays the Vietnam-war.  This is the truth about the meaningless hell that young men experienced, when they were thrown into this war that they never had a chance of winning.  There's one particular scene in the film, where the platoon invades a local town and some of the soldiers starts killing and hurting innocent people and animals.  This is one of the most dismaying scenes I've ever seen on film.  It was at this point that the soldiers had to decide what they really felt about the war and what they were doing there.  This is a good example of Stone's great directing in this film, that makes everything look very realistic and authentic.  I could complain about the battle scenes though, since all the war-films that has been squeezed out of Hollywood lately has more realistic battle-scenes.  But it's still a fact that Platoon is a way better movie than all the war-films that has come out after Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking masterpiece Saving Private Ryan in 1998.But the film would've never been authentic if it didn't have convincing actors, and that's something this film has.  Charlie Sheen does a good role as the young and soft Chris Taylor who becomes a skilful veteran by time.  But the best and most memorable performances in the film is delivered by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. Berenger steals the spotlight in his role as the rough and reckless Lt. Barnes, who becomes a kind of bad guy as the film goes on.  Berenger is not only convincing when he delivers the dialog, but he acts with body-language (especially his eyes) in a great way.  We will probably never see Berenger as good as he is in this film again.  Willem Dafoe is a great actor.  He plays Lt. Elias who is a more calm and rational man who gives the soldiers respectful treatment.  After spending 3 years in the war he starts taking some serious decisions about the war.  We also get to see some good performances by Keith David, John C. McGinley and Reggie Johnson.Platoon is one of those films that leaves the viewer with no doubt that 'War Is Hell!!'.  But it still does not manage to avoid a few clichés, even though it's things that I, personally, consider as war-film-clichés after watching many American war-films.  Among all the films I've seen about the war in Vietnam, this is the one I rank the highest.  And in the war-genre, I think Spielberg's earlier mentioned Saving Private Ryan (1998) is the only one that tops this great film by Oliver Stone.
