He then went on to write and direct Say Anything and Jerry Maguire.  That young man was Cameron Crowe and now he offers the fictionalized story of his beginnings in his new film `Almost Famous.'  In this story William Miller (perfectly realized by Patrick Fugit) grows up with an over protective mother who doesn't allow him to eat meat, listen to rock and roll or celebrate Christmas.  Strangely she is not a religious nut but rather a college professor who wants her child to be extraordinary.  So Miller sits in his room between his pictures of Jimmi Hendrix and Abraham Lincoln and listens to his cache of illicit rock albums, racy stuff like Simon and Garfunkle, Bob Dylan, and Cream.  Miller's writing gets noticed by an editor at Rolling Stone who doesn't know Miller is only 15.  Miller is soon on the road covering an up and coming rock band called Stillwater whose member's look like The Eagles and sound like Bad Company.  Miller is there for their big break and so are we. So there is the set up.  A lesser director would have handed us a film about how the repressed boy goes out in the real world, has some sex, does a few drugs, and through the power of rock n' roll becomes a complete person.  The protective mother would have been the villain, the worldly band members the heroes and the music would have made a difference.  Crowe, however, offers much more. This isn't really an expose of the rock lifestyle (I am sure the people were much rougher and the drug use and sex more raw) but it is not a dreamy nostalgia trip either.  This is a film about a boy's first taste of the real world and how truth guides him through.  On the road Miller is immediately surrounded by temptation but he is more interested in writing his article.  He tries not to get close to the band.  He has been cautioned by his mentor Lester Bangs (a fantastic Phillip Seymour Hoffman) an independent publisher to remain objective and not be used by the band. Miller does his best but he falls for the Penny Lane a 16 year-old groupie in love with the bands enigmatic by design guitarist.   Who would not fall for Lane as played by Kate Hudson?  She is all beauty and naivete shot in soft light.  Miller does his best to understand the band and the fans as they travel from one minor venue to another.  Stillwater is not a great band.  In many ways they just ape other acts. They reminded me a lot of Spinal Tap in their calculated attempts to become stars.  They are in rock for sex, drugs, and the freedom from the real world. They call this life the circus and they never want to go home.  They ride around in a bus, play loud music and sleep with girls who just got their driver's licenses.  Stillwater's groupies are embodied by actors who look the age they are playing (Anna Paquin, Fairzu Balk, and Kate Hudson) and this makes the actions of the band  appear all the more pathetic.  The girls pretend to be 18 and sport aliases like Aphrodisia and Saphire but they are only fooling themselves.   Crowe shows the disdain with which the band treats these girls and the damage it causes.As the film progresses we also get to know Miller's mother (played wonderfully by Oscar winner Frances McDormand).  She is not a one-dimensional movie parent.  She hovers and nags but there is a lot of truth in her words and they along with the words of Lester Bangs hold the center of this film.  All together this is great movie.  The performances are dead on especially those by Fugit, Hudson, and McDormand.  The dialog is crisp and funny and the period details are excellent. No one does movie romance better than Crowe (rent `Say Anything' again) and here he captures perfectly the aching a young man feels when he loves someone out of reach.  The movie is a little too long and the wrap up scene on board the plane does not ring true to rest of the film.  Overall, however, Crowe satisfies as he dissects rock the way he did professional sports in Jerry Maguire.  In the end it is just men playing guitars or throwing a ball.  What is really important is how the stars and their handlers live in the real world.  Crowe again celebrates virtues like commitment, truth, and love.   Of course that dose not mean there is no value in the game or in rock.  On the contrary there is real joy when you look past the trappings and focus on the thrill of playing the music or catching the ball.  Crowe does not feed us as much of a Hollywood ending as I expected and you may be surprised where Miller ends up.

Sandra Bullock is funny, refreshing, and tragic by turns, as a nobody caught in the middle of a major conspiracy to take over the Internet, and thereby, our very lives.Like many good films, The Net lets us see things from various points of view at once. When Angela is trying to explain her predicament to her court-appointed lawyer, we can see her paranoia as both understandable from her point of view and as the typical defensive craziness that her public defender might see.Jeremy Northam is perfect as the bad guy who can't seem to decide whether he wants to prolong the sexual tension of the chase or just kill her and get it over with.As one other reviewer here has noted, this film is very Hitchcockian. It reminded me of Strangers on a Train the carousel scene seems to be a direct reference to Train, and the whole theme of Angela meeting a stranger who then takes over her life is very similar. The film is very skillfully edited for suspense. For example, the scene on the boat when Angela discovers the gun she is shown just discovering it right before Devlin comes up to the deck, but by the time he gets there, she's quite prepared for his arrival, although you think she's a goner. This sort of editing is masterful and really adds to the suspense.The scene where she confronts Devlin on the boat is my favorite I just love how she says So.... who are you...Jack? -- she gives the word Jack just the right staccato emphasis. Devlin's response is classic, and gives away his badness perfectly; and then the camera focusing on only half his face at a time (eyes\/mouth) is perfect, also. This recalls the camera's focus on Angela's mouth when she's typing to the chat room before. The implication is that we are just mouths on the Internet (typing words) and eyes in real life (sexual attraction), and we have to connect the two somehow.I also liked the use of names Champion for Angela's only friend, Devlin for the devilishly evil Jack, Angela (often shortened to Angel) to denote Angela's essential innocence.Angela's mother having Alzheimer's reinforces Angela being cut off from people -- the person she's closest to doesn't even remember her name. I always get teary during the scene where she's trying to get her mom to identify her to the cop (although Angela calling her may be putting her mom in danger, it's a very human thing for her to do).Over the course of the movie, we see Angela changing she's starting to value her friends and family more, and realizing that she's been cut off from people. Ironically, Devlin is one of the instruments of her growing understanding, when he tells her that we're really very similar, you and I. She's shocked into realizing that she *is* tied to her family (such as it is) with a bond of love (even her defense of her absentee father to Champion brings us some insight into her feeling for her family). This attachment to people is something neither Devlin nor the imposter Angela can understand (for example, the imposter Angela looks around at the computer convention and says Let's get outta here, all these people are making me nervous). Annie Lennox's cover of Whiter Shade of Pale is used in the film, most appropriately. Angela is a vestal virgin in many ways, who must go through some pretty psychedelic experiences to find herself.An important aspect of this film is obviously its portrayal of a brief moment in history when only a few organizations and hackers were aware of the vast potential of the Internet. Because this film was made in 1995, it conveys the feeling of newness of all the technology. This makes Angela's isolation from others both easier to understand (weren't all hackers at that time isolated from those who had no idea what the Internet was?) and more frightening will we all soon succumb to the Net's seductive pull? The computer aspects of the film were actually quite impressive if not totally realistic for the technology of the time, at least the film has aged well. For the time it was made, the film's understanding of the role the Internet would play in our lives was almost prophetic. The main point about the use of the technology in the film, however, is that it does *not* override the human story.Overall, I recommend this film as highly entertaining and suspenseful, with the theme of the dangerous implications, for both the individual and society, of our new computer technology.

The implication is that we are just mouths on the Internet (typing words) and eyes in real life (sexual attraction), and we have to connect the two somehow.I also liked the use of names Champion for Angela's only friend, Devlin for the devilishly evil Jack, Angela (often shortened to Angel) to denote Angela's essential innocence.Angela's mother having Alzheimer's reinforces Angela being cut off from people -- the person she's closest to doesn't even remember her name. I always get teary during the scene where she's trying to get her mom to identify her to the cop (although Angela calling her may be putting her mom in danger, it's a very human thing for her to do).Over the course of the movie, we see Angela changing she's starting to value her friends and family more, and realizing that she's been cut off from people. Ironically, Devlin is one of the instruments of her growing understanding, when he tells her that we're really very similar, you and I. She's shocked into realizing that she *is* tied to her family (such as it is) with a bond of love (even her defense of her absentee father to Champion brings us some insight into her feeling for her family). This attachment to people is something neither Devlin nor the imposter Angela can understand (for example, the imposter Angela looks around at the computer convention and says Let's get outta here, all these people are making me nervous). Annie Lennox's cover of Whiter Shade of Pale is used in the film, most appropriately. Angela is a vestal virgin in many ways, who must go through some pretty psychedelic experiences to find herself.An important aspect of this film is obviously its portrayal of a brief moment in history when only a few organizations and hackers were aware of the vast potential of the Internet. Because this film was made in 1995, it conveys the feeling of newness of all the technology. This makes Angela's isolation from others both easier to understand (weren't all hackers at that time isolated from those who had no idea what the Internet was?) and more frightening will we all soon succumb to the Net's seductive pull? The computer aspects of the film were actually quite impressive if not totally realistic for the technology of the time, at least the film has aged well. For the time it was made, the film's understanding of the role the Internet would play in our lives was almost prophetic. The main point about the use of the technology in the film, however, is that it does *not* override the human story.Overall, I recommend this film as highly entertaining and suspenseful, with the theme of the dangerous implications, for both the individual and society, of our new computer technology.

As a period piece, this is outstanding.  As a comedy\/drama, it has its moments but is too scattered to have much impact.  The story follows the lives of Nate Kurtzman (Joe Mantegna), and his two sons, Van (Adrian Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster) over the period of one year.  Nate's subplot showed his life as a small-time racketeer.  Van develops a crush on a wealthy gentile girl at a party, and spends much of the film pining after her.  When he finally gets to know her better he finds that she is much different than he had imagined.  Ben develops a crush on a black girl in his class and embarks on a friendship with her that flies in the face of the taboos of the times. The entire film revolved around a single theme, i.e. how hard it was to grow up Jewish in the 1950's.  Much of the material was amusing, some disturbing and some charming, but Levinson was so intent on relieving (or reliving) his angst that he kept wandering from the main storylines.  If he had focused the story more on the relationship between Ben and Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), it would have been a much stronger film.As a period piece on the &#145;50's, this is outstanding.  The costumes and props were perfect and the entire film had a genuine 50's feeling to it.  Levinson captured not only the images, but also the attitudes.The ensemble cast was very solid.  Joe Montegna is always terrific, especially when he is playing a crook.  He is extremely believable in those roles and though he has tried to break out of the type, he keeps coming back because he does it so well.  Ben Foster gave a wonderful performance played with a great deal of wit and sensitivity.  He and Rebekah Johnson had excellent chemistry and made the forbidden relationship enchanting.This film had potential, but Levinson' mission to expose injustice kept distracting him from the storyline and dissipated its overall effect.  I rated it 6\/10.  Add a point if you are Jewish and another if you are nostalgic about the 1950's.  Not bad, but it could have been much better.

It is also arguably the most audacious film in Hollywood's (mainstream) history, audacious because it takes the kinds of risks that can so easily fall flat on their face, and right until the final image, as Sturges becomes increasingly ambitious and multi-layered, you wonder how long he can keep it up without getting ridiculous.  It never does, but the film is so full of contradictions, tensions, suppressions, clanging lurches in tone - 'Travels' is ostensibly a comedy, and one of Hollywood's best, but the last twenty minutes are truly painful to watch, harrowing and not at all funny.The overriding source of tension, of course,  is the film itself, the plot, and the emotions that are supposed to be elicited.  It is very difficult, and frequently impossible to gauge the tone of any one scene.  Sometimes this is straightforward, as when information is deliberately withheld from the audience, it is asked to make a judgement, and then shown to be wrong, as in the scenes where the studio moguls claim a background of deprivation (which is historically plausible).  This kind of comedy is familiar enough. But what about the later montage of Sullivan and the Girl experiencing the 'reality' of poverty - are these scenes supposed to be genuine representation of poverty?  Are they part of a wider satire on pious films like 'Grapes of Wrath', which dubiously aestheticise poverty - there are a lot of Expressionistic flourishes in this sequence?  Are they a kind of abstract purgatory through which Sullivan finds spiritual understanding? There is a big difference between the representation of poverty in this sequence and the one where Sullivan is attacked and sent to prison.  But is one more 'authentic' than the other - the second one bravely rejects the view of 'noble' poverty, shows how it dehumanises people, turns them instinctual and brutal; but it also provides a neat moral, which suggests that if you do somebody wrong, you will be (horribly) punished for it.  This realism, therefore, is as contrived as the first.  Is this Sturges' point, that the good intentions of realism are always tainted by ideological assumptions, patronising good-will, or motives of elevation.  This sense of artifice, of a film comprised of varying self-reflexive modes rather than a plausible narrative, runs through 'Travels', with characters talking about the film they're in as a plot - in direst danger, Sullivan acknowledges the need for a helluva twist which duly arrives, filmed in silent slapstick with barely concealed Sturges contempt (and did his friends seem terribly put out by his death?).This would seem to uphold 'Travels'' ostensible theme, its celebration of comedy as a sugar with which to sweeten the harshness of reality.  This is a very cynical view of comedy, and a highly manipulative, conservative one - distract an unhappy populace from the injustice of their lives.  The best comedies - from 'Sherlock Jr' and 'Modern Times' to 'Playtime' and 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie' have always been about real life, encouraging their viewers to think harder about the society they live in, much more effectively than so-called naturalism.  'Travels' is no exception.  It might be a celebration of comedy, but this is comedy a million miles from 'Ants in your Pants'.  What other 40s film still manages to show the brutality of poverty, of the prison system, of race relations, the fate of young women in sexually voracious Hollywood (the Girl's ease with her body in the swimming pool scene speaks volumes), however we choose to read them?  When Sullivan's determination at the end to continue making populist comedies is endorsed by the ringing laughter of the world's meek and suffering, the disjunction is grotesque.  This is a man, on an airplane, completely removed from reality, surrounded by wealthy toadies.  Those happy laughs could so easily be contemptuous guffaws, because what Sullivan wants to do, and Sturges hasn't, is hide the inequalities of capitalism, the system on which Hollywood thrives, and the flaws in which they would be only too happy to cover up with inanity.  But to even suggest this is to fall into the 'Capra' trap mocked at the beginning.This difficulty is what makes 'Travels' such a stunningly modern film - its shifts from sophisticated verbal wit to elaborate slapstick to blatant Carry On-like innuendo (the matronly sister dusting  the bedpost after seeing a sweating, shirtless Sullivan work) to tragedy to hallucination and dream to satire foreshadows Melville and the New Wave, while the privileged rich man who cannot escape Hollywood would transmute into the guests who can't leave the house, or can't get dinner in later Bunuel films; or the film that begins with an end.  The opening sequence takes off 'Citizen Kane'.  The deadpan genderplay is quietly gobsmacking, and Veronica Lake as a (gorgeous) tramp would be alluded to by Jeanne Moreau in 'Jules et JIm'.  But the joys are all Sturges', as he democratises comedy (see again that swimming pool sequence);  I love in particular those glorious supporting actors my favourite being the immortal Eric Blore and Robert Greig as Sullivan's servants.

When I saw this movie, I did not know anything about it and I didn't expect much from it, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story involves a young boy who discovers a crash landed (?) robotic giant in the woods near his home, where he lives with his single mother. Despite the predictable ending and the rather unoriginal story (Cool, my own Terminator!), The Iron Giant is a heartwarming tale of friendship and family that provides excellent entertainment for all ages. It is unlikely that the giant is able to learn so much about humans (emotions, soul, acceptance, life, etc), but that's beside the point. I mean, they never even hinted as to where the giant came from, who made him, or why he was endowed with such jaw-dropping artillery. Is he some sort of alien Bicentennial Man? Even though the giant's entire background is left a mystery, the film is still able to tell a wonderful story. Let's just hope they make a sequel in which the giant's home is portrayed more.The cast was also excellent. In particular I enjoyed Harry Connick Jr.'s performance as the endlessly tolerant Dean McCoppin, and most of all, ironically enough, Christopher McDonald as the government agent Kent Mansley. Christopher McDonald almost always plays a jerk of some sort in all of his movies (Happy Gilmore, Dirty Work, and SLC Punk, to name a few), and he was endlessly amusing in The Iron Giant (...no, Bob, big things happen in big places. And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them.). Great stuff.The Iron Giant is a movie for all tastes. I strongly believe that anyone who didn't like this movie did not give it a fair enough chance, because it was just so well done. It is one of those rare films (especially animated) that has an ending that virtually forces you to smile.

None of this is true. The theme of Cabaret Balkan is not violence. A great parallel can be made between Cabaret Balkan and A Clockwork Orange. The violence in both movies is not the theme - it's merely an extreme way of proving an important point.The oppressors and the oppressed. The small fish and the big fish.  The dogs and the sheep (rock fans might find interesting similarities between this movie and Pink Floyd's Animals). There seems to be certain hierarchy present in Cabaret Balkan. The passive majority is constantly oppressed by the violent minority, many of whom themselves are victims of bigger fish. The passive majority is always ready to turn a blind eye, to look the other way or, as a scene from the movie so visually illustrates, sit on a different side of the bus.Who should the war be blamed on? Is it the government's fault? Or is the fault of the people who elected the government? Should the criminals in power take the blame or the people who let them stay in power? A key scene of the movie which takes place in the bus seems to tell us the most about this issue. You finally stood up to me, says the young bully to the old man who refuses to play along and answer his insulting questions. In a way, the young bully on the bus is the only real hero of Cabaret Balkan. He is the only one with the guts to stand up for his rights - everyone else would much rather look the other way, ignore the situation and mind their own business.The original title of the movie - Powder Keg, draws its name from an old nickname the Balkan peninsula earned at the beginning of this century - a powder keg ready to explode, with multitudes of people constantly fighting wars, making up, then fighting again. After all, isn't that what all the characters in the movie do? The strange mentality of the Balkan people cannot be easily explained, so director Paskaljevic takes it into extremes and creates extremely surreal scenes, like the one in the boxing ring and the bar. Fight. Drink. Fight. Drink. War. Peace. War. Peace. What's it going to be? Doesn't matter, as long as we're all in good health.

The passive majority is always ready to turn a blind eye, to look the other way or, as a scene from the movie so visually illustrates, sit on a different side of the bus.Who should the war be blamed on? Is it the government's fault? Or is the fault of the people who elected the government? Should the criminals in power take the blame or the people who let them stay in power? A key scene of the movie which takes place in the bus seems to tell us the most about this issue. You finally stood up to me, says the young bully to the old man who refuses to play along and answer his insulting questions. In a way, the young bully on the bus is the only real hero of Cabaret Balkan. He is the only one with the guts to stand up for his rights - everyone else would much rather look the other way, ignore the situation and mind their own business.The original title of the movie - Powder Keg, draws its name from an old nickname the Balkan peninsula earned at the beginning of this century - a powder keg ready to explode, with multitudes of people constantly fighting wars, making up, then fighting again. After all, isn't that what all the characters in the movie do? The strange mentality of the Balkan people cannot be easily explained, so director Paskaljevic takes it into extremes and creates extremely surreal scenes, like the one in the boxing ring and the bar. Fight. Drink. Fight. Drink. War. Peace. War. Peace. What's it going to be? Doesn't matter, as long as we're all in good health.

None of this is true. The theme of Cabaret Balkan is not violence. A great parallel can be made between Cabaret Balkan and A Clockwork Orange. The violence in both movies is not the theme - it's merely an extreme way of proving an important point.The oppressors and the oppressed. The small fish and the big fish.

Get A-list actors, directors, and some decent, serious plot for a film, and you'll get those academy award nominations rolling in.  But great actors don't make a great film.  Story is always, and has always been, number one.I thought this film gives us a slick pacing in its storyline, which is good.  But it is emotionally flat throughout the picture.  The biggest problem is the theme itself.  I don't know about the others who thinks this film is a roller-coaster thriller, but almost everyone now knows that smoking is bad for the health.  I felt like I already knew half of the story before I actually walk in to the theatre.I am biased when I saw this movie, I admit.  My bias is that I kept thinking about we all already know of the movie's premise ... about the scumbucket tobacco industry.  We all know about the effect of tobacco on our lungs.  Still, I was hoping that the film would provide some plot-twists out of an ordinary story.  But noooo .... it has to be about a depressed scientist who spends his time just trying to get away from the bad guys, just because he is going to tell the world that tobacco kills. That's all there is to it.  True story?  Yawn.  Al Pacino also looks like he needs to drink some coffee and freshen up - he looked so tired and uninteresting here.  Heck, I never thought I would get tired of seeing Al Pacino, but for the first time I did.This movie, being a true story, showed a lot of promise, but unfortunately ended up being just too straight and simple for my tastes.  What is scary in real life doesn't mean that it's scary onscreen (and vice versa).  I blame it on the director.  Those who thinks that Wigand is psychologically tormented obviously hasn't seen a Hitchcock film!

The story has already been explained tenfold so I won't bore you with the details. But some of the stuff in this movie is simply plain brillant. Firstly, the opening scene is pretty scary stuff with the Killer's POV and all not Carpenter's invention but it was still a good idea to use for this scene. Then 15 years later Mr. Michael Myers is all grown up and he's stalking three teen-age girls for some unknown reason. In hot pursuit, is Sam Loomis played by the great Donald Pleasence. Pleasence is hands down the best actor in this film but we also get good performances by Jamie Lee Curtis as virginal babysitter Laurie Strode and Nick Castle as the psychopathic maniac. The rest of the cast is actually quite decent with little to no bad acting. This movie is loaded with sex and nudity but surprising kept it low with the gore. Nowadays, it's the opposite. In my opinion, Blood in some scenes could've added to the atmosphere, such as the kitchen scene.Besides being a movie with good acting, a fair story, and great visuals\/directing, it did have it's flaws. At times I found the dialogue between Laurie & CO. very BORING. Fans will say it was to develop the characters. Well there is a thin line between dialogue meant to develop the characters and dialogue meant to take up space. Halloween goes back and forth. And because of this, the film gets very slow between the 20 min-50 min mark. The first twenty minutes are a great set up and the last forty are pure brilliance, but the inbetween isn't anything special. Plus the movie's influence is heavily overrated. Halloween proved that slasher flicks were marketable, but did not invent them by any means. Not the best horror movie ever and it doesn't crack by top ten, but still a must-see for those with an serious interest in the genre.What's the Bogeyman?-Laurie Strode As a matter of fact...that was.-Sam Loomis ","genre":null},{"date":"14 September 2000","score":"","review":"  Halloween is one of the last in the classic seventies horror era before we went into the sequel-thon camp of the 80s and the toned down turmoil of the 90s...Now this movie is fairly entertaining.
