The gulf between serene image and brutal reality, between Elizabeth's powdered ascetisism and the cynical bloodletting, is all the more grotesque in its distasteful sublimation as religious metamorphosis - as Catholic England becomes Protestant, so Elizabeth replaces the Virgin Mary, like Madonna in 'Like a Virgin' re-chastening herself, in a paradoxically Catholic ritual of renunciation, mortification and abstinence - when she has her hair lopped off, like a young woman entering a nunnery, the fallen locks on her thighs suggest that it is more than hair she is losing.

There is a Foucauldian cynicism about the machinations of State here, where religious ideals are only so much murderous politicking (the scenes with the Pope and his envoy are frighteningly convincing), where a church is seen as a perfect setting for regicide.  Kapur impresses on us the monumentality of the world against which Elizabeth struggles, male power figured in forbidding stone buildings and huge, shadowy chambers, where human activity is obscured by the decor or veils, framed by crucifix crosses that have nothing to do with religious trauma.  The film opens with Catholics burning Protestant 'heretics' in front of a mob; and ends with a 'Godfather'-like massacring of Protestant Elizabeth's Catholic enemies, whose threat is not religious, but one of power. The most repeated visual motif in the film is an unmotivated long shot from deep above a building's rafters looking down on the dotted political players, a terrifying reminder of surveillance and omnipotence, an expression of power that doesn't depend on its human agents, that will always be there to circumscribe human endeavour.  Is it the perenially observing Walsingham, Elizabeth's darkly charismatic advisor-cum-secret-police-henchman, given one of the great entrances in modern cinema?

'Elizabeth' is not a recreation of Elizabethan England and its modes of cultural expression - the film would be more formalised, ritualised, set as a masque rather than just featuring some.  Kapur's modern techniques, his psychologising, his narrative pace, his restless camera, his (often over-egged) visual effects, all capture the instability of a period that tried to cover it up with pomp and ceremony. This does not mean that the historical colour - the music, the pantomimes, the boat rides, the dances aren't in themselves delightful; it's just that they're imbued with narrative and character value (19th and 20th century values) rather than symbolic ones.  This can be seen in the anachronistic use of Elgar and Mozart towards the end, the latter's Requiem especially, as Elizabeth becomes the Virgin Queen, in effect killing herself as a woman.

There were also a couple of underlying themes, such as the distribution of social classes overall and the ignorance of the upper classes, as well as the human suffering that comes as a result of arrogance, ego, and social status. A romantic conflict was a significant part of the story, dealing with the pain and guilt that someone may feel from seducing one person for manipulative purposes and actually being in love with a different person. The story is of a man named Ponceludon de Malavoy who needs to drain a mosquito and disease infested swamp, but he needs King Louis XVI's help to do it. He travels to Versailles, but finds that he needs to have the sharpest of all wits in order for the king to recognize his problem at all. He finds himself in a society driven almost exclusively by the measure of each person's wit (or `hew-mah,' as they heard it was called in English), and the seriousness of Ponceludon's plight was second to this point, if it is noticed at all.  It was more important to King Louis XVI to be entertained than it was to drain a swamp that was causing sickness and death even among children.  One scene in particular was very effective in demonstrating the ignorance of the upper class. There was a boy named Paul who was a deaf-mute, and seen as a `half-wit' by the upper class people. Obviously, in this society this is the last thing that anyone wants to be. He is exiled from the kingdom, sent to live with other &#145;half-wits,' only to return later with several other deaf-mutes after having learned to communicate using sign language. They are introduced to the upper class members, who are skeptical about the worth of the half-wits' lives. When they see that these kids are able to communicate, they are noticeably impressed. They even give them a standing applaud when one of them manages to make a `play on signs.'  They see that these kids are not only intelligent enough to communicate, but can even be witty using sign language, and this completely changes their view. They had always seen people like Paul as less important, simply because they are not able to speak or hear, which is clearly a symptom of classical ignorance.Ridicule is a period film, and it was very effective in illustrating the differences between elements of society today and of the society of 1793. Obviously, honesty is very highly valued today. A recent survey showed that honesty is the third thing that women truly desire in a relationship (preceded by affection at No.1 and conversation at No.2). The same survey showed sex to be Number one on men's importance list, and this completes one of the sharpest contrasts seen in Ridicule. Ponceludon de Malavoy, the man seeking to have his swamp drained, is engaging in a sexual relationship with Marquis de Bellegarde, an attractive older woman of much higher social status (!!). When he informs her of his lack of emotional feelings for her, she responds in a way that, in my opinion, is exactly the opposite of the way a woman today would respond, by literally telling him to lie to her. She tells him, `Learn to hide your insincerity so that I can yield without dishonor.' Aside from the fact that this shows that she would rather be bedded than loved, at least by Ponceludon, it also enhances the drama caused by his love for someone else, and his obvious feelings of guilt about sleeping with another woman. Ponceludon does not love her, but knows that she is capable of improving his chances of getting help from the king.Ponceludon, despite having sexual relations with Marquis de Bellegarde, the older upper class woman, is in love with a simpler, poorer woman named Mathilde. She develops very strong feelings for him as well, but she is engaged to a very old, very rich man. She is determined to remain engaged to him, even though he is currently married to another woman, so that he may finance her scuba diving interests. The fact that Ponceludon and Mathilde are both engaged in strikingly similar manipulative relationships makes their love for each other even more effective. There were dancing scenes later in the film where everyone wears masks and huge elaborate wigs, which demonstrated a dire need to be accepted. The fact that all of the wigs and masks worn in this scene were strikingly similar suggested that these people desired to be as much like everyone else as possible, and that individuality is discouraged. The men wore white powder on their faces, blush on their cheeks, and even distinct amounts of lipstick. Aside from being another way of illustrating conformity, it also poses a huge difference between then and now. In today's society, men who wear that much make-up are most often the ones who are actually trying NOT to fit in with the general population.One other thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that the exact words or topics spoken in the film are far less important than the way that they are said. Body language as well as things like costuming and make-up are far more important than the exact subjects that were spoken of. This was most effectively communicated to the audience by the fact that there were a few scenes where the French conversation was not subtitled. This forced the audience, particularly the English speaking audience, to focus more on the way the characters were speaking to each other rather than what exactly they were saying. This is very unusual, but is also noteworthy because it successfully furthers the meaning delivered by the film.

I'm just saying. They definitely succeed in giving `Enemy' a murky, dirty, even smelly look.It's a really good war film too. Not that it's the best one ever, but it has all the necessary elements of a great war film  Intricate, well-staged battle scenes; human drama; showing mankind both at its lowest and at its most noble.  The war movie brings together the elements of many genres to create a genre of its own.Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) enforced Stalin's policy of killing on sight any soldier retreating out of fear. Annaud's telling of this tale creates a fascinating paradox. Where does the courage to resist the Germans come from if the alternative is going on living in Stalin's society? Talk about choosing the lesser of two evils.The backbone of the story is how Hope alone may have stopped the advance of Nazi forces in Stalingrad at the end of 1943. A political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) believes the city will fall unless its soldiers are given some sign of hope. He decides they need a hero and finds one in Vassili Zaitsev, a sharp-shooter who may be the finest in all of Russia. No German high-ranking officer is safe with Zaitsev within range of him. Within days, he's a national hero (a true story) and is Germany's number one enemy. They send (or does he come of his own accord?) Major Koenig (Ed Harris), their own champion sniper, to find Zaitsev and kill him.Each man is aware of the other and try and guess the others' next move. Each side uses its champion to inspire its soldiers. The news of either man's death, especially by the other's bullet, could turn the tide of the battle unlike any other event. What a great idea for a film--and executed to near perfection to boot. The love story and other subplots that accompany the two champions' struggle serve their purpose--they give the characters their souls.In a perfect world, this film would have been made with Russian and German-speaking actors with subtitles for the benefit of us Westerners. I know I would have enjoyed it more and taken it much, much more seriously if they'd gone the other way with it. Annaud wasn't of like thinking with Ang Lee, who could easily have made `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in english.Then again why wasn't, say, `Schindler's List' told in its characters' native tongues? The reasons for both films being in english are identical and, valid. In a film in which many language are spoken, sometimes it helps to unify the communication by having everyone speak one language.  It's also a matter of knowing who your audience is going to be. Annaud knew he wanted this film to target a Western audience. As long as Russians aren't offended by it being in english, I have no problem with it. But like I said, I'd rather it were in Russian and German.`Enemy at the Gates' is a fascinating, exciting film. It's got everything you could want in a war film, but also goes a step beyond.

They've figured out a way to make big effects shots (Stalingrad being bombed by German planes) look cool without looking like they used a lot of CG. For all I know, they did use a lot. I'm just saying. They definitely succeed in giving `Enemy' a murky, dirty, even smelly look.It's a really good war film too. Not that it's the best one ever, but it has all the necessary elements of a great war film  Intricate, well-staged battle scenes; human drama; showing mankind both at its lowest and at its most noble.  The war movie brings together the elements of many genres to create a genre of its own.Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) enforced Stalin's policy of killing on sight any soldier retreating out of fear. Annaud's telling of this tale creates a fascinating paradox. Where does the courage to resist the Germans come from if the alternative is going on living in Stalin's society? Talk about choosing the lesser of two evils.The backbone of the story is how Hope alone may have stopped the advance of Nazi forces in Stalingrad at the end of 1943. A political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) believes the city will fall unless its soldiers are given some sign of hope. He decides they need a hero and finds one in Vassili Zaitsev, a sharp-shooter who may be the finest in all of Russia. No German high-ranking officer is safe with Zaitsev within range of him. Within days, he's a national hero (a true story) and is Germany's number one enemy. They send (or does he come of his own accord?) Major Koenig (Ed Harris), their own champion sniper, to find Zaitsev and kill him.Each man is aware of the other and try and guess the others' next move. Each side uses its champion to inspire its soldiers. The news of either man's death, especially by the other's bullet, could turn the tide of the battle unlike any other event. What a great idea for a film--and executed to near perfection to boot. The love story and other subplots that accompany the two champions' struggle serve their purpose--they give the characters their souls.In a perfect world, this film would have been made with Russian and German-speaking actors with subtitles for the benefit of us Westerners. I know I would have enjoyed it more and taken it much, much more seriously if they'd gone the other way with it. Annaud wasn't of like thinking with Ang Lee, who could easily have made `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in english.Then again why wasn't, say, `Schindler's List' told in its characters' native tongues? The reasons for both films being in english are identical and, valid. In a film in which many language are spoken, sometimes it helps to unify the communication by having everyone speak one language.  It's also a matter of knowing who your audience is going to be. Annaud knew he wanted this film to target a Western audience. As long as Russians aren't offended by it being in english, I have no problem with it. But like I said, I'd rather it were in Russian and German.`Enemy at the Gates' is a fascinating, exciting film. It's got everything you could want in a war film, but also goes a step beyond. The Battle of Stalingrad is a key moment not only in the history of Russia, but in the history of the world. Unfortunately, this may be the only education some people receive on the subject. So be it. It's certainly better than nothing.Grade B ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"2 April 2001","score":"126 out of 179 people found the following review useful","review":"  Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.

This is probably less distracting for the European audience.  I would prefer subtitles.  The letter-writing scene with spelled-out -- in English! -- vocabulary was particularly jarring. Likewise, interjection of modern slanguage (Whatever. take him out) and use of the term Krauts (Russians said Fritzes).

Difficult to put a finger on it, exactly, but obvious to one who has spoken with many veterans, and read hundreds of wartime journals and post-war memoirs (even translated to English).Then there's the romance.

Even so, the sniper duel as microcosm does give the film focus, not a bad thing.  There is doubt about the actual occurrance of the legendary hunt, but that's ok, too.  Soviet propaganda extolled the feats of many heroic role-models like Zaitsev.  (Another was Lilya Litvyak, a Jewish female ACE fighter-pilot.  Prominently featured in front-line newspapers, her fame attracted the Luftwaffe's attention.  Litvyak had her own legendary duel, defeating ACE Graf von Einsiedel in aerial combat.  Her lionizing by the Red Army press led to her demise she was ultimately shot down by eight Messerschmitts drawn to her distinctively painted Yak.  Since feats of Soviet heroes were always embellished by the propaganda-mill, the question of Zaitsev's duel's authenticity is moot.My biggest gripe with Enemy is the propagandic agenda.  Not Danilov's -- the filmmakers!  The producers go overboard to prove they are not in any way commie sympathizers.  There is way too much anti-communist baggage in this film!  Yes, the Stalinist regime was evil, and the ruthless NKVD and blocking troops, and true, the Soviet command unadverse to throwing poorly-trained, poorly-armed human waves as cannon-fodder at the enemy. But too much focus is placed on these cruelties of the Soviet system for the average western audience to empathize with the protagonists.  History buffs, Eastern Front enthusiasts and Russophiles will get past the anti-Red rhetoric.  But too many westerners will continue to misunderstand the fervor of the Soviet people to defend and die for their Motherland.  In Russia today, the Great Patriotic War is still everpresent, with monuments everywhere to the fallen millions.  It is traditional for newlyweds to visit them and donate their wedding flowers before departing on honeymoon.  In its zeal for political-correctness, the film does a disservice to the Soviet *people*, the true heroes of the Eastern Front.

About time credit is given the tenacity and sacrifices of the USSR for defeating Fascism.  Production is good sets, costumes, FX, soundtrack.  For the most part, combat carnage is presented with historical, visceral authenticity.  But characterizations hurt this character-driven film.British accents are distracting to the American audience which hears them as exotic (similarly if Russians had been played by Americans with Brooklyn or Dixie accents).  This is probably less distracting for the European audience.  I would prefer subtitles.  The letter-writing scene with spelled-out -- in English! -- vocabulary was particularly jarring. Likewise, interjection of modern slanguage (Whatever. take him out) and use of the term Krauts (Russians said Fritzes). But the problem lies less with language or accents, than with how the characters relate to eachother.  They don't interact in any way remotely Russian. They don't communicate like Russians.  Difficult to put a finger on it, exactly, but obvious to one who has spoken with many veterans, and read hundreds of wartime journals and post-war memoirs (even translated to English).Then there's the romance.  There actually was a relationship between Zaitsev and Chernova, his sniper protege and eventually lover.  She was not the shy intellectual, though, but a hardened Partisan obsessed with killing Germans. The fully-clothed sex scene in the tunnel\/bunker is realistic, if one discounts Weisz's over-emoted multiple orgasms.  The brevity and griminess are certainly realistic.  Reviewers complain about the surrounding soldiers slumbering through, but combatants were chronically sleep-deprived and fatigued, to the point where they could drop-off standing, despite the constant barrage of shelling.  Handled well, Enemy's romance might have succeeded.  Instead it brings to the film the most nauseatingly insipid dialogue since the blitherings of Jack and Rose in Titanic.  The love-triangle is plain boring.Sasha Enemy's adorable kid was actually a 15-year-old, German-speaking master-cobbler.  At least he is accurately portrayed as a double-agent and his fate true to life.I would have preferred enactment of the overall Battle street-to-street, house-to-house, constant advancement and retreat, desperate defenses of tenuous territory.

But thanks to some excellent performances and a very interesting and original story, The Hand That Rocks The Cradle definitely stands apart from the average thriller.  (spoilers) Clearly, Rebecca DeMornay gives the best performance in the film as Peyton, the newly widowed wife who takes it upon herself to manipulate her way into a family, having suffered tremendous losses herself. It seems that Peyton's husband, Victor Mott, is a gynecologist and has a bad habit of molesting his patients. Claire, played very well by Annabella Sciorra, suspects that she has been molested in a visit with Dr. Mott, although from the events that occurred during that visit, it is ridiculous that Claire had even the slightest doubt in her mind about it. Once Dr. Mott's scandalous behavior is reported on the news, having been reported by several different women, he shoots himself, and then to make matters worse, Peyton loses her own child, with whom she was pregnant at the time of her husband's suicide.Clearly, this is not your average bonehead thriller plot &#150; there is actually some substance to this one. Peyton's flailing maternal instincts as well as her rage directed toward Claire for being the first woman to report her husband lead her to seek a nanny position with Claire's family, with two motives. First, she obviously wants revenge for Claire opening the floodgates of women pressing charges against her husband, but she also plans to make Claire'e young daughter as well as her newborn baby replace her own baby, that she lost after her husband's suicide.  The thing that makes this premise work so well is that it is so BELIEVABLE. Sure, some of things that Peyton manages to pull off are pretty far-fetched (like the way she rigged the green house, somehow knowing that Marlene would be the next one to come over, having just discovered her secret), but if something happened to someone like what happened to Peyton, her whole life being basically destroyed, it's not hard to imagine that that person would want to do something like what Peyton set out to do. The difference, of course, is that in real life, things would not likely go as far as they did in this film.  Julianne Moore is perfectly cast in her role, and this is made most clear when she discovers Peyton's secret and her rough, intimidating side is put to good use. This role, by the way, probably played a significant role in winning her the part of Clarice Starling in Hannibal several years later, a role which she also fulfilled very nicely. Matt McCoy also makes a very believable husband, and Ernie Hudson, who is probably most remembered as one of the Ghostbusters, delivers a strangely adorable performance as Solomon, the mentally challenged man assigned by the Better Days Foundation to work on the Bartel's (Claire and Michael) yard. Not only does he win the audience's heart with his first spoken dialogue, but he also earns a significant place in the family.  All of this forms the foundation of the story for The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and not only is it notable because it opens up so many opportunities for the film, but virtually all of those opportunities are explored throughout the film. It is a terrible thing when there are countless things that could have been done in a film that just aren't realized or are ignored (see Hollow Man), and it's good to see that this wasn't the case in this movie. The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is an aptly titled suspense thriller that really delivers like very few films in its genre do, and is a must see not only for the involving story and excellent performances, but also for the skilled direction from Curtis Hanson.

He creates characters, embodies them with life, problems, and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable. This film has action, but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters, it is real. And as you would expect about one of mankind's most horrific wars, the violence is horrific.But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the Civil War, it is a masterpiece. Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the Blue and the Grey. Neither is about idealism, though, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It is about freedom, about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it. As you watch the characters, you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to preserve slavery? The fact is, I don't think they really are, and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the Civil War.The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"2 April 2001","score":"","review":" For those among us who remember when about half the movies that came out were in black and white, and nearly all of television, and who look back fondly on those days, Ed Wood is, if nothing else, a feast for the eyes. It is a gorgeously photographed film and I loved every second of it for the cinematography alone. Its subject, Ed Wood, was and to a large extent still is a marginal figure in film history. He was a man in love with the movies who wanted to be a great film-maker. Most of his career was spent, sadly, making low-budget pictures, and he apparently never had much talent to begin with. What he did have was enthusiasm, and the movie of his life is (charitably) about this great passion he had for films rather than about his talent. Ed had his problems, which included among other things, a fondness for dressing up in women's clothes. He spent his professional life, such as it was, on the lunatic fringe (literally) of Hollywood, and it is this marginal, if you will crepuscular world, that director Tim Burton lovingly recreates in his film. One of the things I like most about this movie is Burton's total immersion in this world of genuinely eccentric people. Now there's eccentric and eccentric. Purple hair and body-piercing are not, strictly speaking, eccentric, at least not anymore. These Ed Wood characters are eccentric from within. They don't need funny costumes, though most of them do tend to dress oddly, but they needn't have bothered. This bunch would be weird in three-piece suits.

Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories &#150; `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film &#150; `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack.

It shows that there is always something worth living for and that life goes on even though it may seem at times that there is nothing left to live for. (spoilers) This film was all one man's story of how he dealt with having a broken heart, and how he recovered. It is an autobiography by Mario, the main character, who tells the story himself, which is made clear in the first few minutes of the film. Mario returns to find Laura, his ex, getting the last of her things, and he begs her to come back to him but she is happy living with another man. The dancing scenes in the film seem to show a way that Mario tries to escape from his emotions, but it backfires because he sees Laura there dancing with the man that she left him for. Whenever he sees her, everything else that is going on in the movie stops abruptly. There is nothing but the music, the dancing, and Mario's mesmerized stare. He seems to be in a trance every time he sees her, and he even has murderous visions. His mind seems to be so choked with emotional turmoil that he cannot function when he is in her presence, he is absolutely captivated by her.When Mario finally meets another woman, it is a result of her dancing ability. In fact, the first thing that is spoken of her in the film is about her exceptional dancing skill. This is very effective because from this point on, she is seen as being superior to all of the other women, and she is focused on when she is in a large group, which makes Mario's romance with her more moving. She represents a new beginning for Mario, and she makes him forget about Laura, which is all he seems to want up to this point in the film. There was one very quick scene worth noting because it is an exact example of what the film is about. Mario is at a dancing school where there is a classroom of young students learning to tango, and he is speaking with an elderly man. The man tells him that his wife recently passed away, and his life no longer has any meaning, he has nothing left. As soon as he finishes saying this, he looks across the room and his face breaks into a wide grin as he points his granddaughter out to Mario, claiming her to be the `best in the class.' This is a perfect example of the meaning of this movie! The moment after this man tells Mario that his life is meaningless because his wife passed away, he lovingly boasts the dancing skill of his granddaughter. His life obviously still has meaning because, even though his wife is gone, he can still watch this girl grow as both a person as well as a dancer. I hope Mario noticed this man's glaring miscalculation of the importance of his own being. The surprisingly ironic ending of the film represented the fact that life goes on, and also that sometimes it is really necessary to end some relationships in order to be happy, even if it seems like the end of the world. Mario is very happy with this woman that he met, but in order for her to be with him, she had to break a man's heart just the same way as Laura had broken his. That man's heart was broken the very same way that Mario's was broken at the beginning of the film, which is very ironic because this man is in the exact same position that Mario was in after Laura left him earlier in the movie.The title of this film refers not to a particular style of dancing, but to the emotional tango that people can dance with each other. Even though dancing is abundant throughout the film, it's not actually ABOUT dancing. However, the dancing did tie everything in the film together.Another element that is particularly interesting is the way the camera is used. This is the first film I have ever seen that actually seemed to give the camera itself a bit of personality. In the second half of the film, the director did not seem to make the slightest effort to avoid filming the camera's reflection. There was even one scene where the camera was looking directly at itself in a mirror, which for some reason I find fascinating. I think that this was supposed to suggest that all of the dancing that went on in the film was all rehearsal for a play or some sort of live presentation, rather than people acting for the movie itself.

Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean, and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best (The Matrix) and worst (Baby Geniuses) movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so PG, and director and writer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.He manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. Spy Kid's is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic, putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation, which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.The basic set up for Spy Kids is this. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) were both spies working for different agencies, when a hit put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife, and soon father and mother.But the perfect family they dream about is far from.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"2 April 2001","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The story of the original Halloween takes advantage of the general public's stereotypical fear of mental patients. They are quite often seen as faceless `crazies,' which, more often than not, are assumed to be dangerous to other people. Halloween is one of the earlier slasher films, and it was a true role model for countless other mediocre films that would later try to reproduce the suspense that it created, but it has never been equaled. There was very little focus on special effects in Halloween (the film is pretty much void of them), instead, the emphasis was placed heavily on suspense.The threat of Michael Myers, the relentless killer in this film, is even more real because the movie starts off with Michael as an eight-year-old boy, and he murders his older sister with a carving knife. The fact that Michael does not speak a single word in the entire film, or ANY of the Halloween films for that matter, gives the feeling that he is not only relentless, but also completely uncaring, which is one of the ways that his monstrous and menacing character was created. Laurie Strode, the other main character, is a slightly introverted high school student who doesn't really get out much, and she turns out to be Michael Myers' sister. They have in common the fact that they are both antisocial (Laurie is slightly, and Michael is completely), and Michael has escaped the mental hospital and returned to Haddonfield, IL, his hometown, to kill Laurie, the same way he killed his other sister 15 years earlier.Dr. Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, demonstrates the other theme of Halloween, which deals with the equal relentlessness of the law. He is absolutely determined to bring Michael back to captivity, completely convinced that he will kill again despite having spent 15 years in a mental hospital, and not speaking a single word the entire time. Dr. Loomis is determined to go to any lengths possible to capture Michael Myers, and will not rest until he is captured.The mask that Michael wears in the film is very important to the atmosphere that surrounds him. It adds to the theme about faceless mental patients. The mask not only has a dull, expressionless look to it, but it is also completely colorless, and this makes it even scarier because it gives Michael a very uncaring and monotonous look without actually showing his real face. While it is unnerving to see a killer's face, the terror created by a faceless and emotionless and relentless killer is by far much more frightening. Also, there are several scenes in the beginning of the movie, before he has obtained his mask from a local store, that show Michael from the neck down, or with just his shoulder in the foreground, or one of his hands, etc. The point is that they do not show his face or even his head until he has his mask on.Another thing that added to the suspense of the movie was the sound. The sound played a huge role in Halloween, because there was almost no gore at all and virtually no special effects whatsoever. The music was relatively simple, yet provided a very suspenseful atmosphere. John Carpenter, the writer and director of Halloween, said about the sound, `There is a point in making a movie where you experience the final result. For me, it's when I see an interlock of the picture with the music. All of a sudden a new voice is added to the raw, naked-without-effects-or-music footage.' This is clearly achieved in this film, because not only is the theme music very effective in creating atmosphere, but it has also become one of the most famous musical scores in a film in cinematic history.There is a lot of foreshadowing in this film, such as the scene where Laurie is in a car with a friend, whose father happens to be the town sheriff. He tells the girls that someone broke into the hardware store, and he assumed it was kids because all they stole was a Halloween mask and a few knives. Another small point here that sets Halloween apart from other horror movies is that the person who makes a mistake of this magnitude is usually the first to get killed. This is where the dramatic suspense really starts because even though the characters on screen are totally oblivious, we as the audience know that it was Michael that broke into the store.When Dr. Loomis and a young nurse go to pick Michael up at the mental hospital to take him to a court hearing, they arrive to find the patients wandering around aimlessly in the pouring rain. It's nighttime, so basically all the viewer sees are several white hospital gowns moving around.

They are quite often seen as faceless `crazies,' which, more often than not, are assumed to be dangerous to other people. Halloween is one of the earlier slasher films, and it was a true role model for countless other mediocre films that would later try to reproduce the suspense that it created, but it has never been equaled. There was very little focus on special effects in Halloween (the film is pretty much void of them), instead, the emphasis was placed heavily on suspense.The threat of Michael Myers, the relentless killer in this film, is even more real because the movie starts off with Michael as an eight-year-old boy, and he murders his older sister with a carving knife. The fact that Michael does not speak a single word in the entire film, or ANY of the Halloween films for that matter, gives the feeling that he is not only relentless, but also completely uncaring, which is one of the ways that his monstrous and menacing character was created. Laurie Strode, the other main character, is a slightly introverted high school student who doesn't really get out much, and she turns out to be Michael Myers' sister. They have in common the fact that they are both antisocial (Laurie is slightly, and Michael is completely), and Michael has escaped the mental hospital and returned to Haddonfield, IL, his hometown, to kill Laurie, the same way he killed his other sister 15 years earlier.Dr. Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, demonstrates the other theme of Halloween, which deals with the equal relentlessness of the law. He is absolutely determined to bring Michael back to captivity, completely convinced that he will kill again despite having spent 15 years in a mental hospital, and not speaking a single word the entire time. Dr. Loomis is determined to go to any lengths possible to capture Michael Myers, and will not rest until he is captured.The mask that Michael wears in the film is very important to the atmosphere that surrounds him. It adds to the theme about faceless mental patients. The mask not only has a dull, expressionless look to it, but it is also completely colorless, and this makes it even scarier because it gives Michael a very uncaring and monotonous look without actually showing his real face. While it is unnerving to see a killer's face, the terror created by a faceless and emotionless and relentless killer is by far much more frightening. Also, there are several scenes in the beginning of the movie, before he has obtained his mask from a local store, that show Michael from the neck down, or with just his shoulder in the foreground, or one of his hands, etc. The point is that they do not show his face or even his head until he has his mask on.Another thing that added to the suspense of the movie was the sound. The sound played a huge role in Halloween, because there was almost no gore at all and virtually no special effects whatsoever. The music was relatively simple, yet provided a very suspenseful atmosphere. John Carpenter, the writer and director of Halloween, said about the sound, `There is a point in making a movie where you experience the final result. For me, it's when I see an interlock of the picture with the music. All of a sudden a new voice is added to the raw, naked-without-effects-or-music footage.' This is clearly achieved in this film, because not only is the theme music very effective in creating atmosphere, but it has also become one of the most famous musical scores in a film in cinematic history.There is a lot of foreshadowing in this film, such as the scene where Laurie is in a car with a friend, whose father happens to be the town sheriff. He tells the girls that someone broke into the hardware store, and he assumed it was kids because all they stole was a Halloween mask and a few knives. Another small point here that sets Halloween apart from other horror movies is that the person who makes a mistake of this magnitude is usually the first to get killed. This is where the dramatic suspense really starts because even though the characters on screen are totally oblivious, we as the audience know that it was Michael that broke into the store.When Dr. Loomis and a young nurse go to pick Michael up at the mental hospital to take him to a court hearing, they arrive to find the patients wandering around aimlessly in the pouring rain. It's nighttime, so basically all the viewer sees are several white hospital gowns moving around.

It dealt both with romantic relationships as well as friendships, and the importance of honesty in those relationships. Even more than that however, the film was about the depths that people will sink to when they feel cheated out of a romantic relationship, and the massive retaliation that may come to the person who benefited from that person's broken heart. Max Fischer, who was the subject that was deprived of a coveted partner, illustrates this idea with the noteworthy quote, `War does funny things to men.'Rushmore is the story of an extremely geeky high school kid who develops an unusually strong crush on a new teacher named Rosemary Cross at Rushmore Academy, the school that he attends. He begins to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve Ms. Cross's attention and to impress her despite their significant age difference, and after a while he begins to become preoccupied with these efforts. He wants to build a huge aquarium on school campus in her honor, and one of his sponsors is a rich businessman named Herman Blume. Unfortunately, Max's infatuation is not returned to him by Ms. Cross, who feels that they are obviously not right for each other. When she begins dating Blume after having denied Max's romantic advances, Max declares war on him.When Ms. Cross and Herman began dating, he had recently had a rough break-up, and is more than likely a little lovesick about it, and possibly feels like a victim. As a result, he seems to want to project his pain onto someone else, and Max is the one that this anger falls on. It seems as though his relationship with Ms. Cross is as much a way for him to lash out at someone else as it is a romantic endeavor. One way that this is shown is when Herman was walking through a playground where a few young kids are playing basketball. One of them shoots the ball for the basket, and for no other apparent reason than just because he was there, Herman blocks the kid's shot. This crudely symbolizes his efforts to block Max's efforts towards Ms. Cross, and also displays Herman's side of the war that love has provoked between himself and Max, who until now had no problem with one another. The other side of this war is Max's retaliation from having the object of his affection taken from him by another man. This is a major turning point in the film, where it switches from containing elements of a romantic comedy to much darker situations of anger and contempt between two people fighting over the same woman. Neither Max nor Herman does anything serious at first that could alter the other person's life; Herman runs over Max's bicycle with his car, Max delivers bees into Herman's room at one point, etc. However, Max does go as far as to tell Herman's wife that he is involved with this other woman, which may have been overstepping his bounds a little bit. Being younger, Max is not as wary of the consequences of an act like this, he just wants to do anything possible to hurt the person who hurt him.  This is an example of the funny things that war does to men.All of the characters in Rushmore do a lot of very effective acting with their faces and body language, and there are also a lot of scenes in which there is little to no dialogue. Max is always dressed very sharply, unless he is dressed up in costume for one of his plays. Also, for a fifteen-year-old boy, Max speaks with surprising maturity. Even though he is a terrible student, he is obviously talented, and seems to feel superior to a lot of the older people around him. One good example is, of course, Herman. It seems that Max feels that he is superior to Herman and this intensifies his anger when Ms. Cross denies his amorous advances and instead dates Herman.The play that Max directed which was shown near the end of the film seems to almost summarize the entire film. The play was about a military war which Max himself had a leading role in, and it represented the war between himself and Herman Blume. At the end of the play, after countless casualties (i.e. Herman's marriage, any chance Max may ever have had with Ms. Cross, etc), Max's character is faced with a woman from the opposing army, and they are pointing rifles at each other. They make a verbal truce with each other, almost romantically. Offstage, this girl seems to be the person that Max may be starting to have feelings for, showing that he has overcome his obsession with Ms. Cross. He has found someone within his reach and looks like he has finally found a way to be happy &#150; a good ending to a great film.
