It is definitely a very rich film that perfectly combines a comedy and a tragedy. For those that know little or nothing about Mozart, and also for those that can appreciate a great music, this is a highly recommended movie. The film not only gives relevant details about the greatness of Mozart, his music and his messy life; but also makes you feel like you are right there in the middle of one of his concerts. You can feel the music so deeply, and at the same time, you will be amazed by seeing him composing one symphony after another with minimum efforts.Antonio Salieri was a mediocre composer that always loved and admired the music of Mozart; however he fought himself to remain indifferent to it. Salieri hated Mozart with all his heart, but he recognized his inferiority as well as he recognized Mozart's brilliant talent for music. We can perceive through the movie how Mozart's success affected Salieri, who blamed God his entire life for not giving him the musical talent that was given to his rival. Long after Mozart's death, this old man in a wheelchair is still affected by jealousy and hatred, and being asked by a priest to confess his sins, he starts telling the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical talent. On the other hand, Mozart was leaving mouths open with his natural musical skills. His biggest passion was music. It was a real shame that Mozart also liked to drink, party and gamble excessively, often spending lots of money. He married a woman that did not handle their finances very well, but that in a certain way, cared for him. It was a very sad moment the tragic death of Mozart; but even from his deathbed he could not stop making music.Amadeus is a perfect combination of picture, acting and music. Opera is the dominant genre on the movie, and it is absolutely delightful. Customs are also majestic with all the dresses and hair styles. The architecture, as well as light and colors were perfectly used. Actors played their roles with magnificence. Tom Hulce did a wonderful job playing Mozart. I enjoyed even the simple detail of his annoying laugh. Two thumbs up also for F. Murray Abraham who performed Antonio Salieri and, in my opinion he was the best. His performance was excellent.The scene that I liked the most was the saddest one, when Mozart was dying on his deathbed and he could not quit making music. Salieri , his rival, stayed by him side on his finals hours. Mozart was giving him the musical dictation of his last work, the Requiem. Salieri himself could not keep up with Mozart, and once more was amazed by this little man's talent. I think the film was hilarious in his totality. It is entertaining from start to end. I would give Amadeus a rating of ten out of ten. Do not miss the opportunity to see a simply fantastic masterpiece.

From the technical aspects to the labyrinth plot, Strange Days never plays it safe. Forgive the cliché, but the film breaks all the rules.The time is the final days of 1999 (yes I know the time has long since passed, but this film was made more than a decade ago, and it hardly matters anyway). A new technology called SQUID has been invented, which allows a person to experience what someone else has already experienced. This happens on every level, not just visually, but emotionally and viscerally. However, this technology is illegal except for the FBI (there is a strong allegory linking SQUID to drug use). Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is a dealer in these experiences, but he and his friend Mace (Anglea Bassett) soon come across an experience that puts their lives, and the life of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis) in jeopardy.Strange Days is undeniably shooting for high goals, and sometimes (especially in the technical aspects) it reaches them. On the whole, however, it falls short.First and foremost, the performances by the two leads are rather flat. Fiennes and Bassett are strong actors, but they are both miscast. Both of them have moments of effectiveness (there is some chemistry between them), but on the whole, they seem off. This hampers our ability to sympathize with them, which distances us from the film. This isn't completely their fault, but neither should they be absolved of any fault either. The lesser characters are well-cast, however. Juliette Lewis steals her scenes as Faith, and Michael Wincott is suitably vicious as Philo, Faith's new boyfriend. Tom Sizemore plays the loose-cannon (as usual), Lenny's best friend Max.From a technical point-of-view, director Kathryn Bigelow displays as much ability as her ex-husband James Cameron. In other aspects, she falls short, by quite a bit. For some reason, Bigelow keeps the characters at an arm's distance, and it's hard to identify with them (the miscasting of the two leads doesn't help the situation). Additionally, parts of the film (particularly the beginning), seem padded.To her credit, there is a lot that she does right. She has a good sense of atmosphere (the setting is almost post-apocalyptic, although it is never explained why things are so tense in 1999 Los Angeles). Most importantly, however, is Bigelow's ability to inject some suspense into the proceedings. Even without the limitations that her work has, she accomplishes something that many directors try, and fail, to do.Do I recommend it? Honestly, I don't know. Forgive me for using someone else's words, but I think Roger Ebert put it best in his review of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. ...I can't recommend it, but not for one second would I discourage you from seeing it. I have something to add to that. If you liked Minority Report, you might like this film. If I had to choose, I'd pick Spielberg's film over Bigelow's, but they cover similar territory.

(Not only of this film, but also of the predecessor, Friday The 13th)Though I've never been a great fan of the Friday The 13th series I recently decided to watch the films again after several years. I never fully understood what made the Friday films so immensely popular among some of my fellow Horror fans, but I still admit that some of the films are very entertaining if one is in the right mood. This first sequel to the immensely popular (but, in my opinion, mediocre) original is the first film to introduce the iconic Jason Voorhees as the actual villain. And the fact that an iconic villain is introduced is actually the main reason to watch this film, which barely reaches mediocrity otherwise. The whole premise of this film, as well as the further sequels, contradicts the story of the original. Otherwise, the story could not have continued. In part one, the murderess Mrs. Voorhees was a mother gone insane after her son Jason's death. After she was (very visible) beheaded on screen in Part 1, she couldn't re-appear in the sequels, of course, which is why Jason 'resurrects' in the sequel. Gore-master Tom Savini, who was responsible for the special effects in the first part, refused to be part of the first sequel because he found the idea to be stupid. The villain who was resurrected for Part 2, however, turned out to become one of the most popular Horror villains ever.The plot of this first sequel is quite simple. After Mrs. Voorhees was beheaded in the end of part one, Jason begins by murdering the only survivor, Alice Hardy, who killed his mother. He then goes on a killing spree murdering annoying teens working at a holiday camp near the original Camp Crystal Lake... The second part may be just as influential as its predecessor, but, as far as I am concerned, it is only remotely entertaining, and not the least bit scary. The most interesting aspect of the first part were the killings, many of which were copied from the Italian genius Mario Bava's milestone Reazione A Catena aka. A Bay of Blood (1971), and the lakeside location, which was just as obviously inspired by the aforementioned classic (in my humble opinion, Bava was arguably THE greatest Horror director who ever lived). The same is (even more obviously) the case here. The killings in this sequel are a lot less explicit than in the first film, however. This may be both due to the lack of Tom Savini as the gore-guy, or to calm film censors after the first film was criticized for its violence- Especially the 'double impaling' sequence is very obviously inspired by A Bay of Blood, but even more obviously tamed down.Jason does not yet wear his trademark Hockey-Mask in this one yet (The third part was the first one for him to appear in that outfit), but wears a bag to cover his face. The teenagers at the camp are entirely annoying, which lessens the suspense, but increases the impatience to see them killed. Overall, Friday the 13th should arguably be seen at least once for its cult-status, but, personally, I really don't think this cult-status is justified. The few rewarding moments in the film include - Mrs. Voorhees' severed head in a refrigerator. - Mrs. Voorhees' severed head on a shrine built by Jason. - Foxy young Kirsten Baker going skinny-dipping - A guy in a wheelchair getting a machete hacked in his face.Otherwise, the film is only recommendable for its being somewhat of a classic. As far as I am concerned, this is a weak entry to a generally overrated series. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2009","score":"","review":" Warning SPOILERS!!!

Sure enough Notting Hill, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Roger Mitchell, delivers everything that the wish fulfilment plot synopsis suggests it will.

The comedy is razor sharp and the romance is excellently fleshed from start to finish, but in his need to add drama via media intrusion and a woe is me life of the actress, Curtis comes dangerously close to fluffing his, well, fluff piece.Still, it's a flaw that doesn't sink the film, because hey! We want feel-good and that's what we shall bloody well get! Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts take the lead roles of our mismatched (matched) coupling, and as it turns out it's a fine bit of casting.

Cringe comedy comes courtesy of Rhys Ifans (owning every scene he is in) and James Dreyfus adds extra light relief as William's assistant at the shop, Martin.There's no Wet Wet Wet theme tune to outstay its welcome, and Roberts says her cringer line with far more oomph than that of Andie MacDowell.

There is, however, much to say about this one, based on a play and directed in much the same way Hitchcock did Rope, also based on a play about a murder. Here, a man attempts to have his wife murdered, although it doesn't work out. So, he next tries to change stories to keep himself clean. But then there is a nosy detective... and his wife's lover keeps getting in the way...The play was confined to just one apartment room, and Hitchcock kept it mostly that way on screen, save for a few street shots and a party room. Doing this keeps our full attention on what is important; the setting of what will unfold here. Ray Milland does some of his best work here as the cool, sophisticated and unflappable husband Tony. Instead of flashing about as he did in The Lost Weekend, he keeps nearly all emotion bottled up and it is most effective when we think of him capable of murdering his wife. Speaking of her, Grace Kelly charms and wows in her first of three straight Hitchcock roles in a row. Of course, that is expected and Robert Cummings is also effective as the lover. One other role that comes to mind is that of British actor John Williams, perhaps better known as Audrey Hepburn's father in Sabrina. As the determined yet careful detective, he is not only sympathetic but fun to follow around as well.There is a lot to absorb here, and Hitchcock pulls no punches in giving it to us all. In fact, once the motives and clues start piling up, it can be difficult to know who is really the main suspect. If there is one flaw, it is that the final act goes a little long in the teeth and takes away from the marvelous buildup of the beginning. But, the attack scene is the best; effectively staged and quite a shock even after multiple viewings. It may not be one of Hitchcock's absolute best, but it works exactly as he intended it to and that makes it the kind of film that is important to understand the Master's masterful style.

Instead of flashing about as he did in The Lost Weekend, he keeps nearly all emotion bottled up and it is most effective when we think of him capable of murdering his wife. Speaking of her, Grace Kelly charms and wows in her first of three straight Hitchcock roles in a row. Of course, that is expected and Robert Cummings is also effective as the lover. One other role that comes to mind is that of British actor John Williams, perhaps better known as Audrey Hepburn's father in Sabrina. As the determined yet careful detective, he is not only sympathetic but fun to follow around as well.There is a lot to absorb here, and Hitchcock pulls no punches in giving it to us all. In fact, once the motives and clues start piling up, it can be difficult to know who is really the main suspect. If there is one flaw, it is that the final act goes a little long in the teeth and takes away from the marvelous buildup of the beginning.

In the book, there are two simultaneous plots going on, one dealing with the Nine Gates book and Boris Balkan's desire to obtain what one might call a working copy, and the other dealing with an autograph chapter apparently from the lost manuscript of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers. The protagonist of the book spends much of his time trying to figure out how the two plots are intertwined and, in fact, thinks he has it figured out at various times, but in the end we discover that the plots were indeed separate and unrelated all along. Though this is an ingenious and potentially powerful literary device, for me at least, it didn't work very well and left me quite disappointed with the ending (which is unusual for a Perez Reverte novel, the others that I've read had very strong endings, though this one is still worth the time as his writing is always gripping and thought-provoking). Polanski made the decision when he made this movie to eliminate the Dumas plot line and make the story entirely about the Nine Gates book. That involved considerable rewriting and changes of events and characters. So someone who is expecting a faithful rendition of the novel will be quite annoyed. However, I think Polanski made the right choice because the ending of the film is far stronger and more satisfying than the book. The only thing he could have done better would have been to make a film of Perez Reverte's The Nautical Chart or The Flanders Panel instead!

Alphaville resembles any city in the Soviet bloc except that it is run by an AI-equipped supercomputer. This unit&#x97;gently termed Alpha 60&#x97;evokes for me sci-fi classic 2001 A Space Odyssey. It can talk, communicate, and seemingly understand the thought processes of its subjects.In the first scene, women in a hotel lobby bore their eyes into Lemmy like robots. One escort who accompanies Lemmy to his room proceeds to disrobe and offer herself to him. He asks, Are you drugged? She replies, It's normal, sir. The collective hallucination of Alphaville citizens is a byproduct of Alpha 60's clenched fist approach to governing. He computes the actions and reactions of Alphaville's citizens. His voice&#x97;one of the better aspects of the film, if not a bit chilling at first&#x97;is that of Big Brother harsh, grating computer-speak intonation. The distortion in his voice mirrors the distorted world that Lemmy has suddenly found himself in. What is Alpha 60? We have occasional snippets of electric substations in the middle of nowhere. Through these 1.6 billion nerve centers that function as Alpha 60's brain, Alpha 60 issues directives and maintains control (without forgetting the anti-industrialist tendencies of Godard).The plot revolves around interactions between Natacha von Braun and Lemmy. Across the city, les grandes fetes (Grand Festivals) are happening. After meeting in the hotel, Lemmy, it seems, wants to have an affair with Natacha. After Natacha admits she doesn't have the concept of love (In love, what's that?), the two take a taxi. For the first time, we see a New Wave technique&#x97;man and woman have an existential conversation about love while driving through big, dark city. She is worse than frigid she doesn't have a concept of sex or intimacy. We learn that she was raised her whole life in this dystopia, though her father lived in a time before Alpha 60. This film is about imagination. Godard has dreamed up a totalitarian world in which characters lack imagination. A world devoid of actors or novelists.

Alpha 60 interrogates Lemmy, trying to understand his motives. What does Lemmy love? Gold and women. Throughout the terse, choppy dialogue, we see neon tubes that spell out e = mc^2. Science has become the religion in Alphaville.The film's strengths include the references of Soviet-era architecture and particular flavor of communism. One scene that is disgusting yet beautiful depicts an execution set in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Men are lined up against one wall, guilty for acting in an illogical fashion. One by one, they are called to stand at the edge of the diving board. They issue final, terse declarations before being shot by a firing squad. As the victims sink to the bottom of a pool, women dive in one after the other, swim to the corpse, and stab it with their knives. They then return to their diving boards and restart, all with blank faces.This film is designed to shock us and yet inspire us at the same time. We learn to resent the heavy handed control and absolute logic of Alpha 60, and we cheer for Natacha at the end when she breaks free of Alpha 60's control as all other beings malfunction, wander aimlessly, and claw at the wall.

Laurence Harvey plays an ambitious young man who leaves a squalid industrial town somewhere in England for a good job in a nicer city. He immediately makes friends in the office and joins an amateur theater group when he learns that a pretty rich girl (Heather Sears) is a member. He also meets an older French woman (Simone Signoret) who is also a member.He starts an affair with the older woman while he blatantly pursues the rich girl, much to the dismay of her parents. Her father is a coarse but self-made man; the mother is a snooty society woman. The girl has a sort of boyfriend who constantly uses his wealthy upbringing and schooling to put Harvey in his place. Even in post-World War II England, the class system is very evident. Harvey's attempts at being upwardly mobile are constantly shot down.The girl is sent to France in an attempt to get her away from Harvey, and he falls into a torrid affair with Signoret. But he cannot get the girl (and her money) out of his head. Months go by before he runs into the girl and renews his pursuit. Of course she gets pregnant and the family relents, rushing her into marriage, an act that has bitter and surprising consequences for all involved.Signoret won the best-actress Oscar (and just about every acting award that year) for her work here and she is magnificent. She is worldly and sad yet is not about to accept her fate. Harvey (Oscar nominated) gives his best performance as the blatant social climber.

Laurence Harvey plays an ambitious young man who leaves a squalid industrial town somewhere in England for a good job in a nicer city. He immediately makes friends in the office and joins an amateur theater group when he learns that a pretty rich girl (Heather Sears) is a member. He also meets an older French woman (Simone Signoret) who is also a member.He starts an affair with the older woman while he blatantly pursues the rich girl, much to the dismay of her parents. Her father is a coarse but self-made man; the mother is a snooty society woman. The girl has a sort of boyfriend who constantly uses his wealthy upbringing and schooling to put Harvey in his place. Even in post-World War II England, the class system is very evident. Harvey's attempts at being upwardly mobile are constantly shot down.The girl is sent to France in an attempt to get her away from Harvey, and he falls into a torrid affair with Signoret. But he cannot get the girl (and her money) out of his head. Months go by before he runs into the girl and renews his pursuit. Of course she gets pregnant and the family relents, rushing her into marriage, an act that has bitter and surprising consequences for all involved.Signoret won the best-actress Oscar (and just about every acting award that year) for her work here and she is magnificent. She is worldly and sad yet is not about to accept her fate. Harvey (Oscar nominated) gives his best performance as the blatant social climber.

Give him two and he's GodChow Yun Fat is Tequila, Hong Kong Police Sergeant. Tony Leung is undercover cop, Tony(..using the alias Alan), who has successfully infiltrated a triad organization. They join forces to take down a ruthless arms dealing mafioso, Johnny Wong(Anthony Wong)who has a large cache of weapons within a vault underneath Maples Hospital. If Tequila and Tony are not successful in stopping Wong, he'll slaughter the innocent lives of the entire hospital to save his own neck.If you want to see how to make a real action movie, see John Woo's early work in Hong Kong before vacating for America. HARD-BOILED has some astonishing action-set pieces which will have fans of ultra-violence salivating. Bodies are mangled and pulverized by bullets as well as major destruction of the buildings where shootouts occur. Even before you can settle into the movie, Woo hits it out of the ball park with the superb shootout in Wyndham teahouse where Tequila and his partner trade gunfire with arms smugglers where many innocent customers(..and the poor birds in their cages chirp-chirping away)are caught in the crossfire. As you'd expect, Tequila loses his partner(..has become quite a cliché, I admit)but his murder of the one responsible(..while covered in flour!)is quite satisfying. Then a little later we get the successful raid of Wong(..desiring complete control of the selling of illegal arms)over his older competitor, Mr Hoi(Kwan Hoi Sang)inside a large warehouse where guns are hidden in automobiles as a means to traffic them to locations. This is were Hoi's best assassin, Alan, betrays him joining forces with his rival. You see practically all of Hoi's men massacred by Wong before Tequila(..moving within the warehouse unannounced)intrudes upon their success by blasting away at them. Not only does Tequila contend with men on motorcycles and Alan(..who is so skilled as a shootist he knows how NOT to hit Tequila), but with Wong's main henchman, Mad Dog(Philip Kwok, quite a memorable, intimidating heavy). Again, many men die as sparks and explosions emanate with bodies blasted apart as Tequila, Tony, and Mad Dog masterfully evade ammunition aimed their way by flipping and sliding over vehicles and through windows.The final dazzling, mesmerizing set-piece(..which occurs over an hour!)is set within Maples Hospital as Tequila and Tony(..now fully aligned after Tequila's informant, Foxy, played by Wei Tung, is pummeled, shot and soon killed by Mad Dog)must duel with Wong's army of sadistic hoods who will shoot anybody that stands in the way of their success. By the end, the hospital resembles the skeletal remains of a building you'd see in Beirut. Woo establishes Wong as an absolute monster..he even machine guns cripples with crutches who are in his way! His men actually blow away patients and medical personnel trying to get out of the hospital..and soon opening fire on SWAT members attempting to evacuate infants out from an upper floor window! This film features some of the most amazing gun battles I have ever had a pleasure to witness. Exhiliarting ways Tequila and Tony are able to avoid the contact of bullets aimed in their direction. I've never seen such damage to the insides of buildings before this film. One entire sequence has Tequila and Tony moving floor to floor dropping their adversaries..it's so incredibly shot and magnificently presented in epic form. It doesn't get much better than this. Also, featuring Teresa Mo as Tequila's girlfriend, and Philip Chan as Superintendent Pang(..always at odds with Tequila for he stands to ruin such a difficult operation that has went well until he Tequila started interfering). John Woo himself(..who isn't a bad actor!)portrays a bartender and former cop, whose jazz joint Tequila plays his clarinet from time to time..wonderful jazz score adds the right mood to many melodramatic scenes. Everpresent in John Woo's work is injecting humanity into his films, not matter how blood-thirsty they are. Where Tequila must defend himself against baddies with one hand while cradling a baby is nothing short of amazing, particularly how he escapes an exploding building! This film only adds to the iconic status of Chow Yun Fat and Tony Leung, even before their greatest works for such directors as Ang Lee, Wong Kar Wai, and Zhang Yimou.

It is my favorite war film, and easily one of my favorite films of any genre.I really can add nothing to what has already been said about Scott's phenomenal performance. However, I believe some of the criticisms expressed by other reviewers are not quite being fair to this film. I do not at all believe this film is an example of gung-ho American supremacy at the expense of the British contribution to the war, as some have alleged. I suspect the major reason for this allegation stems from the portrayal of Montgomery as being pompous and dismissive of American capability. Patton himself (in the film) answers this critique nicely, by stating that both he and Montgomery are primadonnas, the only difference is that Monty wouldn't admit it. Further, in one scene where his subordinates were joking about the poor capabilities of both the Americans and the British, Rommel reminded them that Monty had pushed his army clear across the desert.But ultimately, remember this is a biopic and you are seeing the events of the war from Patton's perspective. Patton may have complained of the British not providing enough air cover, or of Monty trying to keep all the glory to himself, but that is countered by dialogue suggesting that Eisenhower knows Patton is not seeing the whole picture and is basically just Patton being Patton. In other words, what some see as Brit-bashing is really just a portrayal of Patton's historical assertions, rather than some sort of cinematic whitewashing with pro-American revisionism. It is really only natural that supremely confident, brilliant, but egotistical men like Monty and Patton would vie with one another in pursuit of a common cause, and let us be glad we had them both.
