Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau) is working the station when the hijacking starts and it's up to him to figure out their plans, which seems like they haven't a chance of escaping from their situation. The idea of four people actually hijacking a subway is certain far-fetched and a rather stupid idea but the screenplay is smart enough to have several characters in the film say the same thing. What makes this film so special are the performances by the cast as well as some of the best dialogue to come out of any movie in the 70s. Once the laws of pure movies were taken off filmmakers we got all sorts of new things. The 70s allowed nudity, sex, gore and violence but the one thing that often gets overlooked is the way profanity was used. I don't think there's a greater example of the power of profanity than this film here. It might sound stupid to highlight cuss words but they really do bring so many of these characters to life. The rawness of the four letter words really puts you right in the middle of the situation and I think it brings a certain reality to the events. The dialogue is often very tight and makes one feel as if they're listening to real people talk but even better is some of the dry humor thrown in. There some terrific bits about the Mayor wondering if they should pay the ransom or not and the debate scene is certainly one of many highlights. The drama in the film is quite high from start to finish as director Sargent knows how to stage a scene and build up the tension even when nothing is happening. The majority of the film takes place on a stopped train or inside an office but these scenes are so perfectly edited together that you get a real sense of danger. The performances are certainly a major plus with Matthau doing a very good job with his role. I'm sure most people will always remember the actor as a comedian and he was so masterful at it that it's easy to forget that he was also terrific at drama. I thought he was very convincing in the part and the way he could deliver the lines to the hostage takers made for some real excitement. Shaw, the leader of the group, is also superb in that certain, laid back way that only he could get away with. Balsam is also a major plus to the film as are supporting players like Jerry Stiller, Tony Roberts and Elizondo. At 104-minutes the film packs the right amount of drama mixed in with the action and comedy. There were quite a few heist films to come from these decade but it's easy to call this here one of the best.

There are even fewer films that I will watch over and over. St. Elmo's Fire is one of those movies. I seem to need to watch it at least once a year.The theme resonates with me deeply. As someone who fresh out of college was saying uh, OK, what now? I totally identify with Billy and the rest of the cast. What do you do with your life when you've spent literally all of it in school trying to get from one grade to the next? What do you do when you've finally finished the last level? How do you make the change from being young and innocent, as suggested by one of the soundtrack's songs, to adulthood?One of the odd things about this movie is that for all intents and purposes there is no real reason that anybody should like these characters. They are all deeply flawed, and it's entirely likely that, were you to know any of them in real life, you might consider them all douchebags or even vile people, certainly not people you'd hope to know. Kirby borders on the psychotic as he stalks Dale, his unrequited college crush. Billy is not only a major lech, but also a deadbeat dad, who tries to rape Jules and also nearly rapes Wendy and certainly humiliates her. Wendy, in turn, is a mousy introvert with almost no self-esteem, who does in the end give herself up to Billy, as much to validate herself as to give a gift to him. Kevin, thought gay by literally everyone else in the movie, is a total loser with an unhealthy obsession with his best friend's girl, whom he ends up sleeping with by preying on her vulnerability and drunkenness after breaking up with Alec. Alec not only cheats on his girlfriend; he cheats a LOT with random women working in department store dressing rooms. He's abusive and pretty much racks up an attempted murder with Kevin later on in the movie. Leslie's not a heck of a lot better, because she jumps straight into the sack with Alec's best friend, and she's basically a tease who gets a free ride in life based on who she's having sex with. And Jules...well, there's no kind way to say it Jules is a crack-head.At this point you may be wondering why do you like this movie so much again? Well, that's where the genius of the movie lies. Joel Schumacher gives us these awful, deeply flawed people, and by the end of the movie, he makes you not only like them, but root for them. You're thrilled when Kirby plants one on the girl he's stalked. You're happy to see Billy and Wendy finally do it, right before Billy has to go away. You cry a little for Jules when you find out her life is a total lie.This film is not quite The Breakfast Club. Don't get me wrong. But it's good stuff, and there's something in at least one character that everyone will be able to relate to.

What do you do with your life when you've spent literally all of it in school trying to get from one grade to the next? What do you do when you've finally finished the last level? How do you make the change from being young and innocent, as suggested by one of the soundtrack's songs, to adulthood?One of the odd things about this movie is that for all intents and purposes there is no real reason that anybody should like these characters. They are all deeply flawed, and it's entirely likely that, were you to know any of them in real life, you might consider them all douchebags or even vile people, certainly not people you'd hope to know. Kirby borders on the psychotic as he stalks Dale, his unrequited college crush. Billy is not only a major lech, but also a deadbeat dad, who tries to rape Jules and also nearly rapes Wendy and certainly humiliates her. Wendy, in turn, is a mousy introvert with almost no self-esteem, who does in the end give herself up to Billy, as much to validate herself as to give a gift to him. Kevin, thought gay by literally everyone else in the movie, is a total loser with an unhealthy obsession with his best friend's girl, whom he ends up sleeping with by preying on her vulnerability and drunkenness after breaking up with Alec. Alec not only cheats on his girlfriend; he cheats a LOT with random women working in department store dressing rooms. He's abusive and pretty much racks up an attempted murder with Kevin later on in the movie. Leslie's not a heck of a lot better, because she jumps straight into the sack with Alec's best friend, and she's basically a tease who gets a free ride in life based on who she's having sex with. And Jules...well, there's no kind way to say it Jules is a crack-head.At this point you may be wondering why do you like this movie so much again? Well, that's where the genius of the movie lies. Joel Schumacher gives us these awful, deeply flawed people, and by the end of the movie, he makes you not only like them, but root for them. You're thrilled when Kirby plants one on the girl he's stalked. You're happy to see Billy and Wendy finally do it, right before Billy has to go away. You cry a little for Jules when you find out her life is a total lie.This film is not quite The Breakfast Club. Don't get me wrong. But it's good stuff, and there's something in at least one character that everyone will be able to relate to.

This maybe the first silent film that I have ever sat all of the way through. I have not been avoiding them, but there are just so many movies to watch that I just have not gotten to any. The saddest thing about a movie as great and as influential as this is that as a modern movie goer it is hard not to be jaded when it comes to witnessing the brilliance of the original geniuses of film. There is a lot that modern filmmakers and viewers can learn from silent movies. It is hard to capture an audience for an extended period of time without boring them especially when the movie is predictable every step of the way. Watching City Lights was an extremely predictable experience, yet it did not take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I really enjoyed watching the story play out each step of the way and the movie is made with so much heart and care that it really comes through when watching. The movie starts with some great physical comedy while showcasing the good natured spirit of the Tramp. The sword gag really demonstrates some of the physicality that Chaplin brought to his role, as does the boxing scene, but having grown up with the Loony Toon cartoons and the physical comedians like Jim Carrey we have seen all of these types of gags. Seeing it play out on screen with real actors is still enjoyable to watch, but I am sure that the magic that others experienced watching it for the first time is lost on me. The heart of the film is not the physical comedy, but the relationship that the Tramp has with the flower girl. It is really a touching story that really has not lost any of its poignancy. A man willing to give up anything of his own to bring happiness to a stranger's life is not a original story, but watching the Tramp put everything he has into making the flower girl smile is heart breaking. While this is a moving tale it is amazing how Chaplin balances the comedy with the heart and how the comedy is a necessary consequence of the Tramp helping the flower girl with the means that he has. I love how Chaplin throws himself into the character and embodies the physical nature of the tramp. The walk is instantly recognizable and one can see how the great actors are able to disappear into roles by capturing this physicality with their performances. Cherrill does a wonderful job also and I swear that some of the actress from the black and white films actually glow. Cherrill absolutely glows throughout the whole film and she does have sweetness that matches the Tramps intentions. It also showcases how being physical in a role does not necessarily mean that their movements are loud and exaggerated. The ending will go down as one of the best endings of all time, but it did not hit me as hard as I thought going into the movie. I knew the basic premise of the movie and the ending was sweet as could be, but it did not resonate with me as much as it has with other film goers. I loved watching it the smile on Chaplin's face will sit with me for a while. I did love this film and it really has opened the door for me to want to see more silent films. It was a fascinating experience that I thoroughly enjoyed, but it did not feel fresh to me. I did not seem like I was discovering something special, but had finally watched something special that everyone else had already embraced. With a lot of these older films I almost feel as if it is my duty to watch the movie and that I am not doing it because I want to. I loved the movie and it will go done as a classic in my book, but it was not a special movie experience for me.

There's no question Grant went out on a shaky limb with his antics here; where else would you see a leading man risk his reputation by dressing up in a feathery negligee? And did I hear this right - his response to Aunt Elizabeth (May Robson) on why he had the nightgown on - Because I just went gay all of a sudden! Probably one of the earliest uses of the term to denote a sexual preference in film, not to enter the popular vernacular for at least another couple of decades.Katherine Hepburn is surprisingly funny and witty as Susan Vance, and dare I say it, actually attractive compared to her more mature roles opposite Spencer Tracy later in her career. I'm not sure if she might have been the best choice to play opposite Grant though; mentally I was picturing Rosalind Russell or Ann Sheridan in the role. But you have to admit, her comic timing kept up with Grant and may have passed him by a couple of times, so whatever director Hawks did to coach her through it worked splendidly.As for Baby, I was once again amazed how a picture of the era put one over on the viewing audience. It was common enough in jungle films featuring characters like Tarzan and Jungle Jim to challenge geographical integrity by regularly referencing animals to locations where they did not belong, such as tigers in Africa. At least here, the story line prefaced Baby's arrival with a letter from Susan's brother in Brazil, so when the 'leopard' later turned out to be a jaguar I wasn't surprised. Actually, it looked like both a leopard and a jaguar were used in the picture. The Baby wrestling with George, the intercostal clavicle stealing pooch, was a jaguar, identifiable by those spots within the larger dark circular rings on the body. A leopard's 'spots' don't share the same characteristics, so unless Baby did a quick wardrobe change, there had to be more than one.Notwithstanding the obvious physical humor and improbable situations, it's almost impossible to miss the obvious anatomical references played to the hilt with every mention of the word 'bone'. Not only was Grant's character misrepresented by the unfortunate name, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun while on the chase for the elusive brontosaurus piece - My bone. It's rare. It's precious. What did you do with it? How many takes do you think it took to get through those scenes? You know, there was something very predictable about the finale when Susan Vance climbed the ladder in the final scene. I was fully expecting that bronto skeleton to wind up in a pile on the museum floor, but not the way Cary Grant made the save with Hepburn swinging at the end of his arm. Could that have been the inspiration for Schwarzenneger and Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies?

A leopard's 'spots' don't share the same characteristics, so unless Baby did a quick wardrobe change, there had to be more than one.Notwithstanding the obvious physical humor and improbable situations, it's almost impossible to miss the obvious anatomical references played to the hilt with every mention of the word 'bone'. Not only was Grant's character misrepresented by the unfortunate name, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun while on the chase for the elusive brontosaurus piece - My bone. It's rare. It's precious. What did you do with it? How many takes do you think it took to get through those scenes? You know, there was something very predictable about the finale when Susan Vance climbed the ladder in the final scene.

That's pretty much the whole plot, unless you're actually going to include a meaningless subplot about finding the true father.It doesn't get any better from there. Shaq demonstrates his mad rapping skills by appearing at a night club where he becomes a selected guest.

Several years later the answer arrives in an alien (Jeff Bridges) who takes the form of a woman's dead husband. Soon the alien and woman (Karen Allen) are trying to get from Wisconsin to Arizona so that he can return to his planet and along the way get to understand human nature. It's funny that in 1982 Carpenter's THE THING was pretty much destroyed at the box office by Steven Spielberg's E.T. and then two years later it appeared the director was giving his own version of that film. I think there are a lot of similarities between the two films, although I think this one falls well short as the masterpiece status of the Spielberg film. The direction and performances are certainly what keep this film going even when the screenplay goes off track. Bridges rightfully picked up an Oscar-nomination for his performance of the alien. There had been hundreds of actors who played aliens by the time 1984 came around but I think Bridges managed to deliver something quite original and certainly very memorable. That incredible walk, that innocent nature to want to learn and the way Bridges makes the character just take in everything he's experiencing is something only a very talented actor could have done. The performance is original and certainly unlike anything we had seen before. Allen is also quite good here and she appears to always get overlooked and especially when it comes to this film. I thought the early scenes with her struggling with the alien and the memory of her dead husband were quite touching and the actress had no problems pulling this connection off. The two have a wonderful chemistry together and even when the screenplay gets pretty far-fetched in terms of their love story, the two are still so great that you want to believe what you're seeing. Charles Martin Smith adds nice support as does Richard Jaeckel. I think there are a few major problems with the film and one is the 115-minute running time, which gets to be a tad bit slow as the film moves on. I know a lot of people seem unhappy with the slow opening twenty-minutes but I actually enjoyed this part of the film as it perfectly set up the characters. I think the journey towards the end becomes way too predictable and the screenplay never sold me on the woman being able to fall in love with this alien. Again, the actors make it nice but at the same time the screenplay never sells it.

COLORS was a very popular movie in the day but it's not really a great film.

On one hand you're looking at a cop-buddy picture and then you have a film trying to show people the law of the streets. I'm sure many were seeing these type of gangs for the first time and director Hopper certainly tries to make one understand why they're in these gangs and why they're willing to lay down their blood for their cause. What doesn't work overly well are a couple side plots dealing with Penn and his relationship with a Mexican woman (Maria Conchita Alonso) with connections to the street. Another thing that doesn't work overly well are all sorts of other subplots dealing with lower entry gang members that never really add up to much. I think there are some moments where the film goes away from the two leads for too long, which certainly makes the film drag in spots.

I've read some reviews that say COLORS is nothing more than a blaxploitation flick for white people but I think this is a tad bit unfair.

I'm sure many were seeing these type of gangs for the first time and director Hopper certainly tries to make one understand why they're in these gangs and why they're willing to lay down their blood for their cause. What doesn't work overly well are a couple side plots dealing with Penn and his relationship with a Mexican woman (Maria Conchita Alonso) with connections to the street. Another thing that doesn't work overly well are all sorts of other subplots dealing with lower entry gang members that never really add up to much. I think there are some moments where the film goes away from the two leads for too long, which certainly makes the film drag in spots. What does work however are the performances by those two leads with both actors doing a great job and even better is the chemistry they have together. The old school Duvall and the new school Penn were the perfect selection for partners here because their acting styles are just so different that they end up mixing together so well. No actor can sell a veteran as great as Duvall and Penn was certainly starting to come into his own around this point in his career and that hot-tempered manor of his was nailed perfectly. The supporting players add some nice performances including Ron Delaney, Larry Sylvester, Don Cheadle and Marlon Wayans in a small role. I've read some reviews that say COLORS is nothing more than a blaxploitation flick for white people but I think this is a tad bit unfair. I think Hopper did a very good job at showing this gang life without glamorizing it and I also think the film does a good job at making the members humans and not just some sort of targets. Hopper certainly seemed to know the material quite well and his direction gets the job done but I think less could have been more.

The examples are too numerous to list but Jagged Edge can serve. In this case, Rebecca De Mornay is a lawyer at a high-end Chicago firm. She's hired by the narcissistic Don Johnson to defend him when he's accused of tossing his wealthy wife out a fourteen-story window.The odd thing -- almost the ONLY unpredictable feature of the movie -- is that she is wary of him from the beginning. She accepts the retainer, gets him out on bail, and defends him in court, with the assistance of the usual flawed investigator. Sometimes the assistant is a drunk -- Robert Loggia or Morgan Freeman -- and sometimes just well meaning but old and a little out of it. Here, it's Jack Warden, who played a similar role in Verdict, a much better film.This is one hoary suspense device after another. A hand may reach in from off screen at a particularly spooky moment and shock the heroine. It soon becomes clear that Don Johnson is a homicidal maniac and we get scene after scene of people alone at night in deserted urban spaces like empty offices, dark hotel corridors, and those horrible multi-level parking lots with lots of shadows and distant blue neon.I don't know how Sidney Lumet -- a fine director -- could wrap his mind around a story like this. I don't know how he could have coped with it except by dozing off in his director's chair. The plot seems to have been ground out by a computer. Any questions about it could have been answered by a Magic Eight Ball.The art director certainly knew what he wanted. The settings are all sterile and the walls festooned with tasteful paintings. There's never any doubt that we're in greenback territory, although most of the supporting players speak with Canadian accents. There is nothing shabby about the settings, nor should there be.Jack Warden is his reliable self. And Rebecca De Mornay, thoroughly glamorized, has rarely looked so attractive. I thought she was more appealing as the raggedy, freckled, rosy-cheeked stowaway in Runaway Train, but that's my perversion. She turns in a decent, textured performance too. The same can't be said for Don Johnson. Part of it must be the role as written, slimy and repulsive. But part is also Don Johnson, who has never convinced me that he's a good actor, though he's often cast as some masculine type who carries a cloud of pheromones around with him wherever he goes.This is strictly routine suspense, but if that's what you're looking for, the film delivers it.

In the film Lance Henriksen plays a country man whose young son is accidentally killed by some city folks when he runs out in front of their dirt bikes. The country man goes to a gypsy woman and soon they unleash the title character to seek revenge on those responsible for the kid's death. PUMPKINHEAD isn't a very good movie but at the same time there are some interesting moments and some nice direction by the newcomer. I think the best thing the film has going for it is the look of the actual monster, which seemed to have been mildly influenced by the creature in PREDATOR. I liked the fact that it appears like the thing was a throwback to the type of monsters you'd see in those drive-in flicks from the 1950s. The creature doesn't contain much gore but instead it makes its money on the terrific looking bone structure and a great looking face. Another plus is that the film really does allow its main character to build himself up. I was surprised to see how much attention was given to the grieving father after his son is killed. I thought Henriksen was very effective as the father and especially in the scenes where he's carrying around his dead son's body just looking for a way to get revenge. The other supporting actors are all decent in their parts but then again they're not really being asked to do Shakespeare. The film has a fairly dark tone as you won't fine any comedy or even hints at humor, which is another plus. I think the film really is a morality tale and asks whether seeking revenge is just as bad as the original act itself. These elements are hinted at but they're never explored too much. What really keeps the film from being a lot better is the fact that not much ever happens. There are six guilty people and three of them are bumped off in the matter of minutes and when the real guilty guy gets his it happens so face and in such a tame way that you somewhat feel cheated. The screenplay goes a tad bit overboard making this guy a complete bum and then when he finally meets Pumpkinhead they let him off rather easy. The horror elements don't start until late in the film and even when they are happening you can tell that the MPAA must have said no to certain shots.

Basically Dolores Claiborne (Kathy Bates) is the woman working in remote Maine as a maid for the rich, elderly and paralysed Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt), and she is caught after possibly pushing her down the stairs and ready to finish her off with a rolling pin. The old woman dies and she arrested for her suspected murder, and her daughter Selena St. George (Single White Female's Jennifer Jason Leigh), now a big-shot reporter, has returned from New York to support her. Dolores insists she did not kill Vera, but the entire town believe twenty year ago she murdered her husband Joe St. George (The Bourne Ultimatum's David Strathairn), so she has little sympathy, especially from Detective John Mackey (Christopher Plummer) who wants to put her away for life. Selena also believed the suspected murder of her father, and through flashbacks we see Dolores suffering abuse from the alcoholic Joe, as well as him stealing from Selena's family account, but worse was her suspicions that he molested his own daughter. There is an argument after the will from Vera claiming she left her a fortune is shown and Selena refuses to help her mother, and Dolores decides to finally reveal the truth. Through flashback we see Vera being mean giving Dolores too many housework and chores, but she softens when they bond through home troubles, and she decides enough is enough. The past reveals Young Selena (Ellen Muth) was sent away, and during a total solar eclipse Dolores gives Joe some whisky and she tells that she knows about his stealing and the molestation, and she makes him fall into the well to die at the bottom. In the end, after remembering a suppressed memory Selena confirms that she was indeed molested by her own father, and she confirms Dolores is innocent, Vera wanted to die, and the case is dropped. Also starring Eric Bogosian as Peter, John C. Reilly as Constable Frank Stamshaw, Bob Gunton as Mr. Pease and Roy Cooper as Magistrate.

Basically Dolores Claiborne (Kathy Bates) is the woman working in remote Maine as a maid for the rich, elderly and paralysed Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt), and she is caught after possibly pushing her down the stairs and ready to finish her off with a rolling pin. The old woman dies and she arrested for her suspected murder, and her daughter Selena St. George (Single White Female's Jennifer Jason Leigh), now a big-shot reporter, has returned from New York to support her. Dolores insists she did not kill Vera, but the entire town believe twenty year ago she murdered her husband Joe St. George (The Bourne Ultimatum's David Strathairn), so she has little sympathy, especially from Detective John Mackey (Christopher Plummer) who wants to put her away for life. Selena also believed the suspected murder of her father, and through flashbacks we see Dolores suffering abuse from the alcoholic Joe, as well as him stealing from Selena's family account, but worse was her suspicions that he molested his own daughter. There is an argument after the will from Vera claiming she left her a fortune is shown and Selena refuses to help her mother, and Dolores decides to finally reveal the truth. Through flashback we see Vera being mean giving Dolores too many housework and chores, but she softens when they bond through home troubles, and she decides enough is enough. The past reveals Young Selena (Ellen Muth) was sent away, and during a total solar eclipse Dolores gives Joe some whisky and she tells that she knows about his stealing and the molestation, and she makes him fall into the well to die at the bottom. In the end, after remembering a suppressed memory Selena confirms that she was indeed molested by her own father, and she confirms Dolores is innocent, Vera wanted to die, and the case is dropped. Also starring Eric Bogosian as Peter, John C. Reilly as Constable Frank Stamshaw, Bob Gunton as Mr. Pease and Roy Cooper as Magistrate.

Even though they are being set in a certain time period the story is one of all times and one of all places. It makes Hud just as good, effective and relevant to watch, as almost 50 years ago.It's actually a quite simple story, that remains deliberately so, in order to make the movie feel authentic and realistic. You could say this movie is like a random slice of life but not without any of the added drama. The drama however becomes never melodramatic and also never feels forced or artificial.It above all things remains a real character movie, in which Paul Newman plays the lead role. He's a rebellious playboy, that messes around with married women among many other things and doesn't seem to think or care about the consequences of whatever he is doing but that is just the surface of his character of course. There is far more beneath all of his layers and it wouldn't be a good drama if there wasn't and you wouldn't really start to care about him as a character that way. Same basically goes for all of the characters, who all go through transitions throughout the movie. Besides a drama and character study the movie can also be seen as a coming of age movie. It's all put together really well in this neath and tidy package, called Hud.It's a movie that got deliberately shot in black & white, to enhance the movie its style and atmosphere. It's more a movie that reminds you of the '40's period than the '60's period really, while it's actually being an 1963 movie in fact. It's black & white cinematography by James Wong Howe also won this movie an Oscar.But all style, story and directing aside, the movie still mostly remains a successful one thanks to its actors. Paul Newman was so excellent in this movie and a real shame he didn't won an Oscar that year. Actors that did win an Oscar though for their roles in this movie were Patricia Neal and Melvyn Douglas. I can especially agree on Melvyn Douglas win, who had been a leading man ever since the 1930's but won his first ever Oscar, after being nominated for the first time as well, for his role in this movie. I wasn't too fond of former child actor Brandon De Wilde's performance though.One fine timeless movie, that you can also watch over and over again.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2011","score":"","review":" These sort of movies are simply timeless.

Some of the actors are comedians in this theater group, so there are gags and one liners throughout. Others are dancers, so there's some dancing, though nothing too worked out. It's fascinating to see how Barbara Stanwyck is head and shoulders above the other actors in screen presence (if not in dancing--she's never been elegant, just sharp). The scene is limited to a few rooms in a dingy theater, and it's filmed with the camera usually just sitting there facing one way and the actors sitting or standing facing the other. It didn't help that the print Netflix has streaming is faded out so the shadows are merely grey. But director William Wellman is better than this film would let on--he's one of those working experts of ordinary cinema, cranking out lots of really good if rarely astonishing films over many decades.It's worth noting that the music is routine stuff, too, so if you are in it for the musical aspects you might beware. I just happened to finish a couple of hours ago the 1943 Stormy Weather which has incredible music (and an even weaker plot). Needless to say, this one is not about the music, per se.This whole scenario is based on the milieu of Gypsy Rose Lee, a famous burlesque dancer from the early 20th Century, and her apparently silly murder mystery The G-String Murders was the basis for this movie. But she wrote an autobiography in 1957 which led to a movie actually about her life, Gypsy. Ethel Merman of all people was the start of that (with Sondheim music). These are the more interesting tidbits here. I really think this movie is best avoided, especially with many other good musicals out there from the 1940s.
