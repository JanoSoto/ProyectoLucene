One of the president's men who read it, is afraid that if it ever got out, the president could be smeared. So, he advises the president to tell the director to drop it, which he does. But later the professor and the girl were out and he was drunk and when he refused to give her the keys she stepped out of the car. When he started it, it blew up. She then discovers that her place has been burglarized and what was taken were her computer and her disks. Obviously, her brief has someone agitated. She then turns to her boyfriend's friend at the FBI, he agrees to come meet her but before he does someone shoots him and takes his place.

Now if you ask me, this film is better than Die Hard 2, it's got more action, more thrills, and more excitement than ever before. But at the same time, I still have to say that the first film is the best on the franchise. But while the first one is the best, I would most likely say that this third installment is the second best. The movie retains the realism that the two previous movies contained, and not to mention that it maintains the strong writing, acting, and directing that made Die Hard and Die Hard 2 great.Bruce Willis is back again in his third turn as John McClane. This time, our reluctant hero finds himself being pitted against a terrorist in New York City, who is aiming to rob the Federal Reserve Building. Don't worry, McClane is still as vulnerable as he was in the first two movies, as he does take some damage in this movie. Normally, it's a joy to see the hero go after the bad guys, but when it's somebody like John McClane doing it, it becomes very interesting, since he is a reluctant hero who isn't crazy about the jobs that he's doing, and he's usually doing them at the cost of his personal life. Joining Willis is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus Carver, a store owner who finds himself involuntarily helping McClane in the battle against the terrorists. Jackson and Willis made a great team together, they share perfectly their tense and humorous moments throughout the movie, and all in all, have great chemistry.Jeremy Irons plays Simon Gruber, the main antagonist of the movie, and who is also the brother of Hans Gruber, the villain from the original film. Irons did a superb job as his role in the villain. He has usually been known to play the villain more than the hero, and this is proof that the villain role suits him perfectly. He challenges McClane and Carver to a series of games, games of Simon says. Not to mention that like the villains in the previous movies, Simon is a character who does not hesitate to follow up on whatever threats he gives, so don't worry if you believe that Simon is like his brother, as they have a lot in common with each other.In addition to everything mentioned above, the movie also contains some very clever plot devices, in the form of the aforementioned Simon Says games, some of which are amusing, when not threatening. Among them includes a scene where McClane and Carver are listening to Simon on the phone, the latter tells them that there is a bomb in a nearby trashcan which is set to go off. McClane and Carver clear everybody away, but nothing happens. Simon's response I didn't say Simon says. But don't let some of the humorous things fool you, Simon is quite ruthless, which is something that a Die Hard movies needs, a good villain, which is what all of the first three movies have.I also really liked where this movie took place. The first movie had all of the action take place in a skyscraper, the second movie just about all of the action take place in an airport. The third movie on the other hand, has all of the action take place in the entirety of New York City, and during the course of this movie, Simon Gruber is able to turn The Big Apple into The Big Rotten Apple, and it's up to John McClane to stop him. The bigger setting means that we have a wider range of action, which really helps make this one an enjoyable experience. And lastly, the action is all relevant to the plot, something that the two previous films also had.John McTiernan directed the first movie, which he did a fabulous job with, and although Renny Harlin did good work with directing Die Hard 2, I still believed that McTiernan's work was better. McTiernan returns to direct this movie, and he brings out the same kind of edge that he did with the first movie, although I still think that he did a better job with the original, but I still believe that his work on this installment was top notch. Good work Mr. McTiernan, with your directing, you have made another solid follow-up to a classic of the action movie genre.On a side note, there is a rather funny scene which is a shout-out to Die Hard 2, it features McClane riding water, yes, I just said that, but when you see the scene, it will make sense. All in all, if you enjoyed the first two Die Hard movies, then you should watch this third movie, as like I just mentioned, it's another solid entry in the Die Hard series. So if you haven't seen this third installment yet, then you should see it, as it's got everything in it that a Die Hard movie should have.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 February 2015","score":"","review":" John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building.Die Hard With A Vengeance is the third installment of The Die Hard series, and after enjoying the first two movies, I decided to give this one a watching, and I have to say, that I enjoyed it very much.

Frank Baum's world of Oz, I heard that while experimenting with the possibility of doing a live-action musical film featuring its characters in the late 1950s, this film was what he ultimately made instead. Upon seeing the clips from Babes in Toyland that they had included in it, as a long-time Disney fan I thought Hey, why have I never heard of this before. So, I quickly went out and bought the movie and within just minutes of sitting down to watch it, I saw exactly why I'd never heard of it before.Throughout the entire film, you get the feeling that the major concern of everyone involved in the production was how it looked because it appears that they spent more time on that than anything else, but there are even times where that isn't very good.It's springtime in Mother Goose Village and sweethearts Tom Piper and Mary Contrary (Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello) have named their wedding day. However, unbeknownst to Mary, she will inherit a fortune upon getting married (from whom we are never told) that the miserly Barnaby (Ray Bolger) wants for himself. So, he instructs his two bumbling henchmen (Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon) to kill Tom. However, the two decide that they want a little extra money, so after kidnapping him, they sell him to some gypsies that eventually return him to his beloved. However, all is not yet well as Mary's five children...wait no, they can't be her children, she's too young...brothers and sisters...wait no, she wouldn't be left to take care of them by herself... foster children...wait no, how does a 25-something-year-old woman get those...ah, forget it! Anyway, five children go wandering into The Forest of No Return and Tom and Mary go to try and retrieve them. However, some menacing-looking singing trees who work for a neighbouring toymaker, played by Ed Wynn (why?) send them off to his workshop where they agree to help him make toys because he has only one assistant (again, why?)So, as you can tell from that summary, there are some major plot holes, but that is not the film's only shortcoming. Many of the characters are so underdeveloped that as you watch, you find yourself very uninvested in what is happening to them. Mary only takes a stand once in the climax of the film. The rest of her screen time is spent either crying, being confused or singing dull romantic duets with her lover. Speaking of Tom, he does get a delightfully goofy number in which he re-enters the town dressed in gypsy drag, but other than that, we see nothing of his personality, other than the fact that he's suave and handsome. As for the kids, the fact that they are what they are is all we know about them.Barnaby is always fun to watch as he twirls his cape and tap dances his way through his scenes, but the problem is that by doing so, he does not present himself as much of a threat when he's supposed to be the main villain of the piece. His two henchmen get a giggle here and there, but not too often. The Toymaker should be really enjoyable, considering who plays him, but he comes across as extremely unlikeable, because he always insists on doing everything himself, making a huge mess in the process. Although, as previously stated there is a lot of creativity to be seen in this movie. The various storybook-like houses featured herein look really imaginative, as do the costumes and several of the effects look very convincing. However, there are exceptions to that statement, as there are times where the visual elements look like they could have been worked on a little more and other effects look really fake. For example there is a scene where one of the henchmen magically disappears underneath a puddle but the movements of the stop-motion toy soldiers used in the climax look extremely choppy. As for the music, Babes in Toyland's numbers range from extremely catchy (Castle In Spain, I Can't Do the Sum) to totally bland and\/or forgettable (Just a Toy, Toyland.) On a final note, the choreography looks as though it were lazily thought out, what with the dancers repeatedly jumping from left to right and vice versa.All that said, I feel profuse pity for this film as it had capable actors, great visuals, a previously wildly successful operetta to adapt itself from...all the ingredients that could have made it a masterpiece.

However, all is not yet well as Mary's five children...wait no, they can't be her children, she's too young...brothers and sisters...wait no, she wouldn't be left to take care of them by herself... foster children...wait no, how does a 25-something-year-old woman get those...ah, forget it! Anyway, five children go wandering into The Forest of No Return and Tom and Mary go to try and retrieve them. However, some menacing-looking singing trees who work for a neighbouring toymaker, played by Ed Wynn (why?) send them off to his workshop where they agree to help him make toys because he has only one assistant (again, why?)So, as you can tell from that summary, there are some major plot holes, but that is not the film's only shortcoming. Many of the characters are so underdeveloped that as you watch, you find yourself very uninvested in what is happening to them. Mary only takes a stand once in the climax of the film. The rest of her screen time is spent either crying, being confused or singing dull romantic duets with her lover. Speaking of Tom, he does get a delightfully goofy number in which he re-enters the town dressed in gypsy drag, but other than that, we see nothing of his personality, other than the fact that he's suave and handsome. As for the kids, the fact that they are what they are is all we know about them.Barnaby is always fun to watch as he twirls his cape and tap dances his way through his scenes, but the problem is that by doing so, he does not present himself as much of a threat when he's supposed to be the main villain of the piece. His two henchmen get a giggle here and there, but not too often. The Toymaker should be really enjoyable, considering who plays him, but he comes across as extremely unlikeable, because he always insists on doing everything himself, making a huge mess in the process. Although, as previously stated there is a lot of creativity to be seen in this movie. The various storybook-like houses featured herein look really imaginative, as do the costumes and several of the effects look very convincing. However, there are exceptions to that statement, as there are times where the visual elements look like they could have been worked on a little more and other effects look really fake. For example there is a scene where one of the henchmen magically disappears underneath a puddle but the movements of the stop-motion toy soldiers used in the climax look extremely choppy. As for the music, Babes in Toyland's numbers range from extremely catchy (Castle In Spain, I Can't Do the Sum) to totally bland and\/or forgettable (Just a Toy, Toyland.) On a final note, the choreography looks as though it were lazily thought out, what with the dancers repeatedly jumping from left to right and vice versa.All that said, I feel profuse pity for this film as it had capable actors, great visuals, a previously wildly successful operetta to adapt itself from...all the ingredients that could have made it a masterpiece. Sadly though, in the end my final verdict is watch only if you're a hardcore Disney fan like me.

It has a good plot, it is subtle, it gives nothing away until the end and everything it does is relevant to the story. I would recommend viewing the movie twice to really appreciate everything that it does, you will miss many things upon first viewing and watching it twice will really enhance the experience.It is set in the early 1900's and the house, costumes and style are very well presented; they do a good job of transporting the viewer to that time. The story is all based within a mansion where a woman and her two young children live with their three housekeepers. Her two children suffer from a photosensitive disorder and are not allowed to be in direct contact with sunlight, this means that the house is constantly in darkness, offering a much more eerie experience. The daughter claims that she can see ghosts around the house, this is ignored by the mother at the start but before long she is questioning the matter herself. Is the house haunted?My main gripe with many horror films is that things are revealed too early on, in ghost stories you will see the ghost before any real suspense has been able to build. In my opinion the scariest things in horror films are the things that you don't see, the things that only your imagination sees. This is where The Others excels.The Others consists of around 6-7 characters with the majority of it being dedicated to Nicole Kidman, who does a fantastic job with a really convincing performance. She is a very mysterious character who seems extremely paranoid about her children's health and wellbeing; she appears as a woman who is on the edge of sanity. The whole supporting cast are fantastic and not one of them lets the casting down.The Others is a film in which you cannot say much about without the fear of giving anything away, but I will say one thing, the ending is spectacular. So many horror movies struggle to get the ending right, The Others shows its fellow horror flicks how it should be done. Its certificate is only an age 12 but in my opinion it is much creepier than many age 18 films I have watched.

The police are after him. We see a few scenes of the police questioning people and hunting him down, but it's not the focus of the film.

We're watching someone who, knowing his demise could come at any moment, will make as much as he can of the time he has. Knowing that, nothing he does in this film is meaningless. Even the tiniest of things, such as him stopping to admire the humphry boggart poster, means so much more.Make no mistake, though, there's plenty else to admire about the film. The cinematography is fantastic. Using a hand-held camera and a wheelchair instead of a dolly for moving shots, we have a movie that rarely feels still. The camera is often intimately close, using only a few far away shots (often simply to establish distance between characters). The jump cuts this film is famous for are used stylistically. Even when indoors,it feels like things are in constant motion, ensuring that the film never feels slow, and even after all these years, the visual style of the film feels unique unto itself, even among the rest of Godard's filmography.Something also must be said of the dialogue.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"3 February 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The synopsis of Sydney Pollack's drag comedy TOOTSIE can be construed as follows a struggling thespian\/acting coach Michael Dorsey (Huffman) cross-dresses as a woman Dorothy Michaels to secure a role in a popular daytime soapie, and scoops up massive acclamation as a single, middle-aged role model who disseminate fresh air of women being independent and self-confident, which profoundly inspires her fellow actress Julie (Lange), whom Michael has a huge crush on. If one has yet watched the film, the synopsis might get on someone's nerves, how on earth a man at the end of his tether can so easily thrive in the same line of business as soon as he acts in the opposite sex? What is more, he even becomes some sort of the guiding light to the dismissive gender while sporting a hard-on under his dress, it could only be a straight guy's pipe-dream with a penchant for sexism and male chauvinism, the movie could have been a total train wreck under a lesser brain. Thankfully, TOOTSIE is never the case with Pollack on board and a scintillating script bristles with no-hyperbole but heartfelt dialogue and organic humor and romance, plus an all-star cast spearheaded the ever so androgynous Hoffman. Instead it becomes one of the best and the most successful comedies ever in US. A giant crowd-pleaser and a top-dog in the Oscar-game too (although only Lange won one out of its overall 10 nominations, even that golden statue is a bit iffy in hindsight, since it is more like a consolation prize for her breathtaking turn in a biopic of Frances Farmer FRANCES 1982, 7\/10 ). Michael's double personae is the refraction of his personality from different genders, as a man, he is an impulsive prick towards Sandy (Garr), the altruistic girl in his acting class who believes they click together, but in fact they only have a one-time shagging based on an inopportune occasion, Sandy is given the cold shoulder whenever Julie is available for him. However, as a woman, Dorothy, she not only has to keep an eye on her leery co-star, the old goat John Van Horn (Gaynes), as her attachment with Julie becomes stronger, she accidentally becomes the apple-of-the-eye of Julie's widower father Les (Durning), who is somehow convinced Dorothy should be Julie's new mom. You see, as a woman, Dorothy not only being objectified for her sex appeal (truth to be told, Hoffman's female outlook does look superior to his normal bearing), more reassuringly she is also courted as a true lady for a serious marriage, which creatively justifies the dual standards in the present man's world (although this film is made 33 years ago), it is a farce for sure, but it is a revealing one. Apart from the accomplishments of the make-up and costume sections, Hoffman's performance is terrific, the tricky part is his voice changeover since it is so dialog-ridden, Dorothy has an old-maidish front but inside she is quintessentially a feminist cannot tolerate women being bullied, belittled or indulging themselves in self-pity, that's why she is one-of-a-kind and so riveting to watch on screen. Hoffman's acting is wholesomely fluid, our laughter is being accordingly induced up until the premeditated big reveal - again the script rounds up a pragmatic scenario for Dorothy to perform the live act - it is a cliché, but indeed a perfectly engineered one.Lange is also letting out her impactful presence in a less demanding role, Julie is that kind of pretty girl with a degree of integrity, often curbed by her own indecisiveness, and needs a little extra push to find her self-worth, she is always on the rational side of the line, by contrast, Garr (also Oscar-nominated, but criminally lost to Lange in an unfair game), brings about an adorable and spontaneous adroitness as an excellent comedienne, her Sandy is the irrational type of gal often being exploited by men for her kindness and innocuousness, Garr pushes the limit in her well-timed fit of rage sprinkled with just-right-amount-of mockery, in a perfect world, Michael should have ended up with her. Bill Murray is knowingly not billed in the opening credit, but as Michael's roomie, he has a medium-sized role to balance out Hoffman's edginess with deadpan drollness and occasional wisecrack.

If one has yet watched the film, the synopsis might get on someone's nerves, how on earth a man at the end of his tether can so easily thrive in the same line of business as soon as he acts in the opposite sex? What is more, he even becomes some sort of the guiding light to the dismissive gender while sporting a hard-on under his dress, it could only be a straight guy's pipe-dream with a penchant for sexism and male chauvinism, the movie could have been a total train wreck under a lesser brain. Thankfully, TOOTSIE is never the case with Pollack on board and a scintillating script bristles with no-hyperbole but heartfelt dialogue and organic humor and romance, plus an all-star cast spearheaded the ever so androgynous Hoffman. Instead it becomes one of the best and the most successful comedies ever in US. A giant crowd-pleaser and a top-dog in the Oscar-game too (although only Lange won one out of its overall 10 nominations, even that golden statue is a bit iffy in hindsight, since it is more like a consolation prize for her breathtaking turn in a biopic of Frances Farmer FRANCES 1982, 7\/10 ). Michael's double personae is the refraction of his personality from different genders, as a man, he is an impulsive prick towards Sandy (Garr), the altruistic girl in his acting class who believes they click together, but in fact they only have a one-time shagging based on an inopportune occasion, Sandy is given the cold shoulder whenever Julie is available for him. However, as a woman, Dorothy, she not only has to keep an eye on her leery co-star, the old goat John Van Horn (Gaynes), as her attachment with Julie becomes stronger, she accidentally becomes the apple-of-the-eye of Julie's widower father Les (Durning), who is somehow convinced Dorothy should be Julie's new mom. You see, as a woman, Dorothy not only being objectified for her sex appeal (truth to be told, Hoffman's female outlook does look superior to his normal bearing), more reassuringly she is also courted as a true lady for a serious marriage, which creatively justifies the dual standards in the present man's world (although this film is made 33 years ago), it is a farce for sure, but it is a revealing one. Apart from the accomplishments of the make-up and costume sections, Hoffman's performance is terrific, the tricky part is his voice changeover since it is so dialog-ridden, Dorothy has an old-maidish front but inside she is quintessentially a feminist cannot tolerate women being bullied, belittled or indulging themselves in self-pity, that's why she is one-of-a-kind and so riveting to watch on screen. Hoffman's acting is wholesomely fluid, our laughter is being accordingly induced up until the premeditated big reveal - again the script rounds up a pragmatic scenario for Dorothy to perform the live act - it is a cliché, but indeed a perfectly engineered one.Lange is also letting out her impactful presence in a less demanding role, Julie is that kind of pretty girl with a degree of integrity, often curbed by her own indecisiveness, and needs a little extra push to find her self-worth, she is always on the rational side of the line, by contrast, Garr (also Oscar-nominated, but criminally lost to Lange in an unfair game), brings about an adorable and spontaneous adroitness as an excellent comedienne, her Sandy is the irrational type of gal often being exploited by men for her kindness and innocuousness, Garr pushes the limit in her well-timed fit of rage sprinkled with just-right-amount-of mockery, in a perfect world, Michael should have ended up with her. Bill Murray is knowingly not billed in the opening credit, but as Michael's roomie, he has a medium-sized role to balance out Hoffman's edginess with deadpan drollness and occasional wisecrack.

Both of which I never got to see until much later.From a technical standpoint there is nothing wrong with Pocahontas, as a matter of fact it's far more colorful, atmospheric, and grown-up than The Lion King, which came out a year before. But in the process it lost much of its younger audience and now only seems to appeal to adults. The story lets everything else down. It's so bland and generic when it could have had the moxie to go much further and be just a tad more complex. It certainly had the visual energy to back it up even it were to try and fail. Alan Menken's score is also horrible and totally inappropriate to the scenes he is supposedly enhancing. Songs come and go, some last only a few moments. If feels like instead of letting the visuals speak for themselves Disney decided that characters talking to each other (at the audience) as a means of delivering exposition was too obvious so instead this dialogue is sung. The songs are exposition. Rarely do they allow any visual storytelling to stand alone. John Smith's first encounter with Pocahontas at the waterfall being the best example of what the film could have been if only.Despite being historically-inaccurate (why is she not topless?) it really only details the first half of the Pocahontas story. The second (and more tragic) half is (sorta) detailed in the cash- grab sequel that nobody remembers.

I was haunted too, as William Peterson plays this character as he should be played, a figure staring into the abyss, and nearly destroyed by this. He seems fragile and anxious, yet with a firmness and resoluteness usually found in the best cops and detectives and investigators. What also brilliantly conveys this psychologically perturbed mind is the general 'look' of the film; the set design, the lighting, the cinematography. I'm particularly fixated with the idea of the exterior worlds being expressionistic and reflective of a character's psychology, and here that is present without being overbearing.There's a cold neon glare to much of the film, as in the scenes in the police department, a decay to the scenes of Dollarhyde, a sterile desolation to the environment of Lektor, but a warm melancholic blue to Will's family life, which I like to think reflects the general undercurrent of sorrow throughout the film. The film largely works because it allows us to understand Will Graham's mind-set enough to know that every step he takes in the investigation is a chipping against the rock of his fortitude, every time he commits himself psychology it threatens to derail him, and leave his family behind. This driving force keeps momentum, and is also sustained in the dynamic between him and both Crawford and Lektor (spelled with a K in this instance as if he is the product of some Nazi experiment or a perhaps just a Krautrock band). Crawford, played by Dennis Farina is suitably hardened and relatively unsympathetic, yet manages to get across the genuine concern of his character, and the protection that he knows is necessary to give to preserve Graham as it were. Continuing with my appreciation of the production design, I love the cacti that sit in darkened corners of Crawford's office, looking lifeless if not manufactured and a dismissive attempt at bringing some life into a cold environment. Even colder is the lair of Lektor, who resides in an almost dystopian looking building, with endless stairways that Graham can't seem to escape and walls of pure white. I've held off from mentioning Silence of the Lambs until this point, if only to let Manhunter stand on its own terms and has a minor protest against how heavily that overshadows this film. But Anthony Hopkin's interpretation is so solidified and absolute in the minds of some people that it is helpful to describe Cox in contrasts to him. Whereas Hopkins had more of an intellectual charm, a superiority that was in play with his savage and sadistic aspect, Cox is far more cold and detached. He has a presence that is indomitable and feels like it might asphyxiate you, but he feels further away. Of course the way the character is played is specific to the material, and in Silence, Lector needed a sort of intimacy to be able to communicate with Clarice, something that isn't present here with Will. He sits with his mouth always slightly agape, as if both the intellectual and physical menace is readying to spill forth. The conversation between these two is framed perfectly, with their faces each appearing to be caught between the bars of Lektor's cell. Whereas Demme used zooms to arrive intensely close to faces, particularly on Starling and Lector to indicate the overpowering and demanding weight of their relationship, here Mann lets the camera rest back somewhat, watching these two men caught in the sight of each other and the psychological chains binding them. Much of the melancholy of the film situates in the tragedy of Francis Dollarhyde, played with a perfect amount of physical imposure and as far as this character goes, emotional vulnerability, by Tom Noonan. Dollarhyde and Gumb both share a mystery to their character by not having their origins or motivations explained to simply justify the way they are, and although Gumb was a pitiful character trying to craft an identity, Dollarhyde in comparison feels like a character that we can both loathe and actively feel despair for, but both are impeccably played, so I'm not going to pick favourites. I will however admire both for their decisions to loudly play music that creates unsettling juxtaposition between their psychotic unstable states and the charm and melody of the song. Goodbye Horses wins for the unsettling serenity, but In-Gadda-Da-Vida has swells to an intense cacophony. Dollarhyde goes tentatively on a romantic journey that almost feels like it could be a part of another film, yet it plays with such miserable inevitability and a neon dampness that it works really well as a part of the whole narrative. The character is trying to fulfil some utterly distorted vision of change, of becoming something impossible, that when he falls in love, or the distant and regressed and ordinary part of him does, he rejects it. There is a beautiful moment when in bed with his infatuation, Joan Allen, he pulls his hand up to her face, resting it there, beginning to cry. There is such conflict between the two identities, battling for their own change, that is inner fire and destruction is tangible.The music, particularly the ending song, drifts into sentimental '80s triumph, and I got the impression that perhaps that was a commercial studio decision, and not Mann's, but the jarring effect is I suppose only in keeping with the odd, unhinged atmosphere. This is a product of its time, in the best sense, and to visualise this imagine an old, green-screen computer, with the glass of the monitor broken and blood seeping between the cracks. That is Manhunter.

Dollarhyde and Gumb both share a mystery to their character by not having their origins or motivations explained to simply justify the way they are, and although Gumb was a pitiful character trying to craft an identity, Dollarhyde in comparison feels like a character that we can both loathe and actively feel despair for, but both are impeccably played, so I'm not going to pick favourites. I will however admire both for their decisions to loudly play music that creates unsettling juxtaposition between their psychotic unstable states and the charm and melody of the song. Goodbye Horses wins for the unsettling serenity, but In-Gadda-Da-Vida has swells to an intense cacophony. Dollarhyde goes tentatively on a romantic journey that almost feels like it could be a part of another film, yet it plays with such miserable inevitability and a neon dampness that it works really well as a part of the whole narrative. The character is trying to fulfil some utterly distorted vision of change, of becoming something impossible, that when he falls in love, or the distant and regressed and ordinary part of him does, he rejects it. There is a beautiful moment when in bed with his infatuation, Joan Allen, he pulls his hand up to her face, resting it there, beginning to cry. There is such conflict between the two identities, battling for their own change, that is inner fire and destruction is tangible.The music, particularly the ending song, drifts into sentimental '80s triumph, and I got the impression that perhaps that was a commercial studio decision, and not Mann's, but the jarring effect is I suppose only in keeping with the odd, unhinged atmosphere. This is a product of its time, in the best sense, and to visualise this imagine an old, green-screen computer, with the glass of the monitor broken and blood seeping between the cracks. That is Manhunter. ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"3 February 2015","score":"","review":" They're the worst thoughts in the world Will Graham tenderly confides in his son, sharing with him the unique and seemingly impossible burden that he is carrying, to a boy who can't possibly grasp the full implications of it but is nonetheless haunted by his father's now tentative walk through life. I was haunted too, as William Peterson plays this character as he should be played, a figure staring into the abyss, and nearly destroyed by this. He seems fragile and anxious, yet with a firmness and resoluteness usually found in the best cops and detectives and investigators. What also brilliantly conveys this psychologically perturbed mind is the general 'look' of the film; the set design, the lighting, the cinematography. I'm particularly fixated with the idea of the exterior worlds being expressionistic and reflective of a character's psychology, and here that is present without being overbearing.There's a cold neon glare to much of the film, as in the scenes in the police department, a decay to the scenes of Dollarhyde, a sterile desolation to the environment of Lektor, but a warm melancholic blue to Will's family life, which I like to think reflects the general undercurrent of sorrow throughout the film. The film largely works because it allows us to understand Will Graham's mind-set enough to know that every step he takes in the investigation is a chipping against the rock of his fortitude, every time he commits himself psychology it threatens to derail him, and leave his family behind. This driving force keeps momentum, and is also sustained in the dynamic between him and both Crawford and Lektor (spelled with a K in this instance as if he is the product of some Nazi experiment or a perhaps just a Krautrock band). Crawford, played by Dennis Farina is suitably hardened and relatively unsympathetic, yet manages to get across the genuine concern of his character, and the protection that he knows is necessary to give to preserve Graham as it were. Continuing with my appreciation of the production design, I love the cacti that sit in darkened corners of Crawford's office, looking lifeless if not manufactured and a dismissive attempt at bringing some life into a cold environment. Even colder is the lair of Lektor, who resides in an almost dystopian looking building, with endless stairways that Graham can't seem to escape and walls of pure white. I've held off from mentioning Silence of the Lambs until this point, if only to let Manhunter stand on its own terms and has a minor protest against how heavily that overshadows this film. But Anthony Hopkin's interpretation is so solidified and absolute in the minds of some people that it is helpful to describe Cox in contrasts to him. Whereas Hopkins had more of an intellectual charm, a superiority that was in play with his savage and sadistic aspect, Cox is far more cold and detached. He has a presence that is indomitable and feels like it might asphyxiate you, but he feels further away. Of course the way the character is played is specific to the material, and in Silence, Lector needed a sort of intimacy to be able to communicate with Clarice, something that isn't present here with Will. He sits with his mouth always slightly agape, as if both the intellectual and physical menace is readying to spill forth. The conversation between these two is framed perfectly, with their faces each appearing to be caught between the bars of Lektor's cell. Whereas Demme used zooms to arrive intensely close to faces, particularly on Starling and Lector to indicate the overpowering and demanding weight of their relationship, here Mann lets the camera rest back somewhat, watching these two men caught in the sight of each other and the psychological chains binding them.

First of all, the acting was just terrible 80% of the time. This might be a combination of bad actors or bad script here and there, however, some of the lines were extremely cheesy and most of the lines\/audio sounded like the volume of the dialogue was pulled down at the end, so i.m.o you have to listen very carefully, or else you will not hear the last word a character says. Another thing that was really terrible to bear was the fact that about 90% of the soldiers there were not willing to fight, scared out of their pants and had a cry face on the whole time. When someone had to go scout or flank or basically do anything, there was always a long silence before someone would actually man up and volunteer. No one wanted to fight for their country, they all looked like a bunch of cry babies. Fair enough, it's war, but still, they knew what they were getting themselves into. Not one guy stood up and said something like alright men, let's show these Japanese what were made of! Instead, they all looked like they were about to cry. And it's not like they were heading for Normandy, they were basically fighting a few squads of Japanese soldiers that took a large part of the island. Also, the movie didn't really focus on a particular person or group, instead it focused on some individuals and the rest of the troops, giving very little back story of any character and it feels like there is no real point of conclusion. They could have just shot all the beautiful scenes and had text appearing that displayed the narrator's words. I get what they tried to achieve throughout the movie and the message they wanted to portray, however the rest of the movie has no point. there is no conclusion other than the message from the narrator. There is no character's story, no real storyline except the narrators words.In any case, besides that, there were also a couple of positive things. The photography and cinematography was excellent. Some of the best shots I have seen in any war movie. Again, they probably received an Oscar for best picture and if they didn't they should have, because the shots of the soldiers moving through the windy grasslands, or moving through the jungle were really good. One or two actors had maybe a few decent lines and the music was good.To conclude, this movie had a lot of potential.
