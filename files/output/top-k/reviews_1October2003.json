I watched this movie as a test study concerning the possible worth and watchability of the upcoming new release of Batman (Batman 5). Since Chris Nolan is listed as the director of this new undertaking, I thought I would check him out.I must say that I was delightfully surprised. This is a wonderful cat and mouse time is running out suspense with twists and turns you never expect.I found it unpredictable and edgy. Williams always struck me as the type who would do this genre quite well. I'm happy to see him spreading his wings beyond comedic\/character acting. This could be the beginning of a whole new career for him. Quite honestly, I hope so. I have felt for some time that his style of comedy had just about run its course. Way to go, Robin Williams! It must have taken great courage to try a movie like this, after all these years of comedy\/dramas. Hats off.I will not outline the plot here. Everyone else does that and I find it tedious after a while. But I will say that if you like a good suspense, a dark quirky cat and mouse, this is the movie for you. Excellent remake, as well. That is indeed a rarity.And in conclusion, I feel that if Chris Nolan devotes the same level of darkness and atmosphere to Batman 5 that he did to this movie, he just may save the series and kick-start a whole new run of (hopefully) good Batman movies.

Whilst this is true to the extent that Happy Gilmore has chronic anger management issues, it falls short of the usual character who has no grasp of the real world which so often has predominated in Sandler films. Instead, Happy is savvy enough to know when he's being mocked and more than Happy (no pun intended) to beat the crap out of anyone who does so.The story is entirely predictable. However, you don't mind this, as with such films, the fun and entertainment comes not from being uncertain what is going to happen next, but rather from the anticipation of what you know will happen in due course.All the cast give great comic performances, though I felt more use could have been made of Sandler's homeless caddy. For the most part he just stands around. Likewise, Ben Stiller's minor role of the evil nursing home attendant ended rather abruptly. I was expecting a showdown between Stiller and Sandler over the former's treatment of Sandler's grandmother, but it never happened. I suspect this was a cut-scene, as I can't imagine the two of them not seeing the great potential in such a confrontation.The only really negative thing I can say about this movie (and it is really a generic failing of Hollywood that I've noticed in several movies lately) is the reliance on audience knowledge of cameo characters in order to get laughs. Just who is Bob Barker? I have no idea and I suspect a lot of the non-American audience will have no idea either. To me the whole fight scene on the golf course between Sandler and Barker was nowhere near as funny as I imagine it would be if I had any inkling of who he (Barker) was.But overall the film delivers plenty of gentle humour and the occasional guffaw. Well worth a look, even if you've been turned off by Sandler's characters in the past. For me, Sandler has taken a turn (albeit a modest one) in the right direction with his characters here.

But after more than a year, I decided to go out and rent it again and give it a second 'welcome' hoping to see a decent reincarnation (no pun intended) of the classic Novel by Mary Shelly. I was a little disappointed after watching it. I have never read the original novel, but I simply did not like the pace and direction of the movie. Or to further specify, I didn't like the pace and direction of the story other than the Creation Sequences. They seemed very hasty and unpleasant, and many times kind of rushed in their shooting. I think Branagh should've taken a look at his Co-star's (Tom Hulce) other Barok film AMADEUS and learn a little from Milos Forman in the direction of such an era. I was disappointed with that. However, what I was not disappointed about were the creation sequences and especially the last creation sequence with Elizabeth. Some of the creepiest stuff i've seen, and very well done with the camera moving around Victor and Elizabeth, adding the well placed confusion to the scene. Bravo on that, but sadly thats about it. The performances were ok, DeNiro was cool, but I simply love Tom Hulce. good stuff from him again. And even John Cleese was very good, as i barely recognized him. I think Branagh should stick to acting, because thats what he's great at. Acting and directing at the same time may be a little bit too ambitious because both seem to lack when done together. i don't have a rating system, but i suggest to watch it atleast once, but dont expect an epic, or anything close to Bram Stoker's Dracula in Quality.

He blew it from the instant his character appeared on the screen. His acting here is horrid, and introducing him in full regalia and in the throes of battle did nothing whatsoever to hide the fact that he was agonizingly deplorable. The addition of ice skates in the boots of the super heroes was as lame as anything I grew up with in the 60's and 70's TV show. All in all this was a horribly disappointing movie, complete with standard Hollywood fare trying effects; cheesy dialog and absolutely no build up to the story line whatsoever. The characters were underdeveloped, and over dramatized. The scenes were shot as if a ten year old snuck away to the mall with daddy's video camera and shot them; the effects were the worst sort, and the dialog was reminiscent of a kindergarten stage production. Joel Schumacher should be forbidden to have anything at ALL to do with everything even remotely Batman related from this point on. Seriously, he has just about destroyed any chance of redeeming this wonderful series of movies. The heroes fly about on snowboards propelled by....what? Their gadgets, now totally hi-tech and possibly the lamest of all four movies thus far had me rolling my eyes before the first ten minutes of the movie were completed. In comparison to the 60's cars used throughout, it was highly out of place. A seriously lame anachronism. Mr. Freeze's dialog was obviously geared for the target audience of 9 year olds (not to insult any 9 year olds out there), and his character was so underdeveloped, I remember the audience asking throughout the theater, Who's that?Furthermore, his character never achieves the appropriate dominance required to be a convincing bad guy of this caliber. His character was a weak, flaccid excuse for a villain. No fault of Schwarzenegger's, I'm sure. Again, I blame the direction. His thug-some gang of hockey\/skater punks just made me laugh. Lame, lame, lame. Mr. Freeze left me feeling a bit...cold. Sorry, it's the movie's influence. Uma Thurman's performance was excellent as Poison Ivy, although her character was even less developed than was Mr. Freeze's. By the time they got around to trying to give you any history at all concerning the two villains, it was far too little and way too late. By that time, the audience just didn't CARE about their history. They had already lost the viewers' interest by failing miserably to properly introduce the characters. And by attempting to foist George Clooney upon us by shoving him into an action scene at the movie's open was a shoddy directional device not even worthy of a first year film student. Bane was played as infantile and was another factor which led to my loathing of this movie. Bane was a force to be reckoned with in the comic books. Whether you're a fan of that medium or not, this has to matter at least to some degree. His character was either written, directed, or portrayed (I really don't care which) to be about as bright and interesting as a rock. No, I take that back. I've seen some rocks which interested me greatly. His character was reminiscent to me, with his inane growling and total lack of intelligence, of the villains portrayed in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. That's NOT a good thing, people. The Eye Candy turned out to be more like Eye...Sores.The circus-like atmosphere throughout the movie was inappropriate as a Dark Knight setting. I could not believe how horrible was the direction of this flick. As a fan of the comic heroes and the first two installments of this series, this movie was a complete let down. The dialog throughout is trite and campy; they tried too hard to be witty and clever and failed horribly. Instead of hard and edgy, fresh and foreboding, George Clooney's Batman was soft, weak and ignorant. I hated him as Batman. Put him in Jurassic Park 4. Cast him as living bait for ANYTHING carnivorous. That would be the perfect role for him. Alicia Silverston as Batgirl was a horrible casting choice. Meg Ryan would have made a more convincing Batgirl. Seriously though, almost anyone would have been better cast in this role. Her assuming the role as Batgirl degrades the character to mere fluff, instead of the gritty, edgy presence that issues from Batgirl's character in the comic books.Meanwhile, back at Mr. Freeze's lair The ridiculous show tunes he forces his henchmen to sing for his amusement have even the henchmen casting confused looks at one another as if to say, This is not the movie we auditioned for...is it? I really don't have anything good to say about this movie. I wanted to when I sat down to write this, but as I watch it, I simply cannot find it in myself to do it. If Mr. Schumacher's goal was to recreate the campy drivel of the original TV series from the 60's & 70's, then he succeeded completely. Much to my dismay. With the announcement of Batman Begins due to be released in 2005, I refuse to even begin to get my hopes up until I see who will direct it. The late Michael Gough obviously won't be Alfred, either. He was about the only good thing this movie offered. As a true Schwarzenegger fan, I just don't have the heart to say anything more.

His character was a weak, flaccid excuse for a villain. No fault of Schwarzenegger's, I'm sure. Again, I blame the direction. His thug-some gang of hockey\/skater punks just made me laugh. Lame, lame, lame. Mr. Freeze left me feeling a bit...cold. Sorry, it's the movie's influence. Uma Thurman's performance was excellent as Poison Ivy, although her character was even less developed than was Mr. Freeze's. By the time they got around to trying to give you any history at all concerning the two villains, it was far too little and way too late. By that time, the audience just didn't CARE about their history. They had already lost the viewers' interest by failing miserably to properly introduce the characters. And by attempting to foist George Clooney upon us by shoving him into an action scene at the movie's open was a shoddy directional device not even worthy of a first year film student. Bane was played as infantile and was another factor which led to my loathing of this movie. Bane was a force to be reckoned with in the comic books. Whether you're a fan of that medium or not, this has to matter at least to some degree. His character was either written, directed, or portrayed (I really don't care which) to be about as bright and interesting as a rock. No, I take that back. I've seen some rocks which interested me greatly. His character was reminiscent to me, with his inane growling and total lack of intelligence, of the villains portrayed in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. That's NOT a good thing, people. The Eye Candy turned out to be more like Eye...Sores.The circus-like atmosphere throughout the movie was inappropriate as a Dark Knight setting. I could not believe how horrible was the direction of this flick. As a fan of the comic heroes and the first two installments of this series, this movie was a complete let down. The dialog throughout is trite and campy; they tried too hard to be witty and clever and failed horribly. Instead of hard and edgy, fresh and foreboding, George Clooney's Batman was soft, weak and ignorant. I hated him as Batman. Put him in Jurassic Park 4. Cast him as living bait for ANYTHING carnivorous. That would be the perfect role for him. Alicia Silverston as Batgirl was a horrible casting choice. Meg Ryan would have made a more convincing Batgirl. Seriously though, almost anyone would have been better cast in this role. Her assuming the role as Batgirl degrades the character to mere fluff, instead of the gritty, edgy presence that issues from Batgirl's character in the comic books.Meanwhile, back at Mr. Freeze's lair The ridiculous show tunes he forces his henchmen to sing for his amusement have even the henchmen casting confused looks at one another as if to say, This is not the movie we auditioned for...is it? I really don't have anything good to say about this movie. I wanted to when I sat down to write this, but as I watch it, I simply cannot find it in myself to do it. If Mr. Schumacher's goal was to recreate the campy drivel of the original TV series from the 60's & 70's, then he succeeded completely. Much to my dismay. With the announcement of Batman Begins due to be released in 2005, I refuse to even begin to get my hopes up until I see who will direct it. The late Michael Gough obviously won't be Alfred, either. He was about the only good thing this movie offered. As a true Schwarzenegger fan, I just don't have the heart to say anything more. Uma Thurman and Michael Gough were the only bright lights in this otherwise horrid installment of modern day Batman movies. It rates a 4.2\/10 from...the Fiend .

Despite this draw back, Holden pursues Alyssa until she finally agrees to give in and begins dating him, much to the dismay of Banky, who seriously dislikes Alyssa, and believes his friend's relationship with a lesbian to be doomed from the start. For a while Holden and Alyssa beat the odds as their dating turns into a commitment, one that Holden is more than happy to make. But when Holden discovers some skeletons in Alyssa's closet everything comes crashing down, leaving the two questioning what they mean to each other and if they really do accept whom one another really is.Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams star in Chasing Amy, Kevin Smith's third film about life in New Jersey. Affleck displays a lot of emotion as Holden, a man, who like most, continues to chase something he can't seem to have. Adams shows a lot of spunk in this film, going from wild lesbian, to emotional heterosexual. Such transitions in character would be hard for any actress to pull off. She should be proud of herself for acting so well after not acting at all in Dazed and Confused. The last member of the trio, Lee, is fantastic as the cynical Banky, a person who just can't seem to think of one positive thing to say. Lee has real on-screen charisma and can really be a big star one day if he diversifies his roles, or finds his niche. Although not a star of the film, I'm going to mention Jason Mewes who turns in another hilarious performance as the town hood and comic book hero Jay. Mewes' one-liners are almost always Smith film highlights. Now with the end of my last sentence ends almost every good word I have about this film.Chasing Amy creator Kevin Smith should be at home smacking his head against the wall for coming up with such an unoriginal, wannabe hip, piece of drivel that really seems to be more of a public service announcement from the gay community than it is a love story. He makes a love story with completely unappealing characters. Complex yes, appealing no. How can I give a film about love any validity when the characters don't display any real love? They may come to understand one another better, but I don't actually see any love. As far as Smith's writing goes, I can say that his dialogue does have some real moments, but for the most part he just seems to hide behind the fact that homosexuality is becoming hip in pop culture. Mind you his writing may be better than his delivery, I believe that his Silent Bob character should actually be silent. Smith does however accomplish something that not a lot of filmmakers in Hollywood can, he surprised me. He takes in what in my opinion is a stinker, and adds some extra stink by giving it one of the most absurd endings I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. I actually felt less intelligent after watching this film's ending. Producer Scott Mosier is just as guilty as Smith for this film-making travesty because he just sat back and let Smith take control, when half way through filming he should have told Smith that he had run out of ideas and that maybe someone else should finish the film, or they should just cut their losses and use the film as spare ribbons for Christmas and birthday gifts.After Mallrats I thought Kevin Smith was starting to grasp what elements are needed to make a film entertaining, apparently he proved me wrong.

He also decides to consider a future beyond his top five lists. Rob Gordon spends his days listening to the music he loves and running a record store he hates. His employees are a continuous irritation, and his customers are a continuous agitation. The only hobbies Rob has are comprising top five lists, and failing in relationships. So, when Rob's current girlfriend, Laura, leaves him because he hasn't matured since they met, Rob spirals into a midlife crisis. To learn more about himself, Rob comprises a list of his top five break-ups. He recounts the relationships, and then revisits his old flames to see what exactly it was that went wrong. While recounting the events, Rob discovers something totally unexpected, that life is more then just pop music and top five lists. The charismatic John Cusack stars in the big screen version of Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity. Cusack is his usual witty self, playing a thirty-something record store owner, Rob, whose head is stuck in the world of pop music. Denmark-born beauty Iben Hjejle is well cast as Cusack's smart and sexy girlfriend, Laura, who is fed up playing second fiddle to Rob's music and top five lists. Saving Silverman's Jack Black brings his comedic skills to the table as Rob's inattentive employee Barry. Black is a serious strong point for this film, using his humor to carry the film when it begins to drag. Tim Robbins is fantastic as the eccentric Ian Raymond, the neighbor who may or may not be the man comforting Laura after the break-up. Robbins should also be credited for elevating this film due to the fact that his character really is the most enjoyable to watch, although he really doesn't have much screen time. Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta Jones and Lili Taylor round out the list of top quality actors and actresses that are a nice reminder to everyone that Hollywood still has people that can actually act, and aren't just there to look good. Special attention should really be paid to the women in this film, as everyone of the ladies is intelligent, gorgeous and truly entertaining to watch; I don't think I have ever seen a film with such strong women characters in it that wasn't actually targeted towards a female audience. Stephen Frears does an admirable job of giving the film an authentic feel, but like so many other romantic comedies out there, this film really looses steam toward the end. Originality is also in question, as at times I really get the feeling I'm just watching a sequel to Reality Bites. Cusack, as well as Scott Rosenberg, Steve Pink and D.V DeVincentis, evidently enjoyed the material they were working with, as the script is brimming with realistic dialogue and viewpoints on life; it actually feels like I am listening to a discussion between friends when the guys are chatting it up in the record store. Specific attention should be paid to the &#145;top five' conversations, because everyone's answers are really interesting to listen to. Even with the realistic dialogue, however, the four writers still can't overcome monotony, and the characters are at times caught in some very uninteresting and dull conversations.  Everything on the table, this film is very bland at times, and could have been a bit more entertaining. Yet the acting is top notch and the movie does feature a soundtrack of great artists, including Elvis Costello, Elton John and Bob Dylan, just to name a few. My final thoughts on this film is that it is definitely entertaining and worth the watch, but saying it's at a level of High Fidelity would be giving it too much.Overall Rating 6.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  High Fidelity During a midlife crisis Rob Gordon decides to recount his top five relationship break-ups.

James Woods plays the consummate a**hole, a role he plays quite well - in fact, there are points in this movie when you just feel the urge to yell at the screen, most of it unprintable. Matthew McConaughey does quite a good job, and his character is right on the mark... supportive and disbelieving at the same time. Each of them plays their roles in a way that is entirely believable... yet at the same time you want to question the role (not the actor, but the character). Skerrit also does a good job, limited though it is. They are believable *as the characters*... which is exactly what a movie is supposed to do.The camera work and the F\/X are almost unbelievable... they are absolutely spectacular. While at one and the same time they portray the realities of life on Earth (the various satellite arrays, everyday rooms, council chambers), they also portray the wonders of the universe. One day we actually make it out there... only to find that Hollywood has beaten us to the point. Yet the Hollywood F\/X don't leave us lost in a realm of... F\/X; we can look at this (the star journeys, the systems, the arrays), and it looks real; or at least, real enough to be totally believable, which is the whole point of Hollywood.Yet as with any good movie, the special effects play second fiddle to the actors and the characters they play. You can have absolutely amazing  F\/X, and yet have a bland and boring movie (such as Star Trek The Motion Picture). Here, the special effects - as beautiful as they are - definitely play second fiddle to the actors and their characters.With all of this, we can't forget the man behind the camera... Robert Zemeckis. He's brought us such slapstick broadsides as Ghostbusters, but at the heart he is a filmmaker, a true director (not that Ghostbusters was false), and this movie shows it - he does an astonishing job, getting astounding performances out of his cast.The characters - based on the novel by scientist and philosopher Carl Sagan - are nothing less that miraculous... and oh-so-human. It's a very big round of applause to the various actors that you look at each of the characters and you can see where each one is coming from; whom they are supposed to be - that's what Hollywood is supposed to be like, and so rarely is. There are no fancy aliens in this; everybody is remarkable human. And very nicely done.A silly note during the very beginning of the movie, when the camera view pulls out from Earth and into space, it's highly amusing that the words of (former President) Richard Nixon mix and blend with the theme to the Twilight Zone...If you want to get into the metaphysical parts of the movie, it's solely about faith... faith in all its forms. It doesn't matter what you believe - this movie will probably represent your point of view. At the end, in front of the committee, we have one person asking Arroway (Foster) whether they should take everything on faith... which is especially ironic when you remember that one person (played by Jake Busey) has their own form of faith which destroys and kills... which faith do you believe? Or should we believe all of them? What is faith, other than an extreme belief in something which cannot be proven?In a final note - yes, this movie will make you think (if you have the brains to see outside your own narrow little world)... but in the end, it's the astonishing performances (mainly by Foster, but also by McConnaughey and Woods) that will pull you in.If you like anything other than hack-n-slash, then I'd highly recommend this movie to you... see it with an open mind, and perhaps it will make you *think*!If you've got even a little bit of openness in your mind, if you have ever asked Are we alone in the universe?, then this movie will be quite satisfying... because it doesn't answer any of those questions; instead, it shows you how people - real people - deal with them. Very, very good.It's a mark of this movie that after watching it on DVD, you don't really care about all of the extras... the interviews, the director's comments - you've just seen the movie, which speaks for itself in every line; why spoil it with something else? But even as I say that, the director's (and others) comments on the second track are nice - hearing what they thought about this and that is a very interesting extra. Still, the movie itself - and Foster's excellent performance - is the real reason for buying this DVD.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"1 October 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is one of those movies which work on so many levels... let's take the Hollywood level first.Jodie Foster does an *excellent* job as 'Ellie Arroway'... but she isn't alone in her excellence. James Woods plays the consummate a**hole, a role he plays quite well - in fact, there are points in this movie when you just feel the urge to yell at the screen, most of it unprintable. Matthew McConaughey does quite a good job, and his character is right on the mark... supportive and disbelieving at the same time. Each of them plays their roles in a way that is entirely believable... yet at the same time you want to question the role (not the actor, but the character). Skerrit also does a good job, limited though it is. They are believable *as the characters*... which is exactly what a movie is supposed to do.The camera work and the F\/X are almost unbelievable... they are absolutely spectacular. While at one and the same time they portray the realities of life on Earth (the various satellite arrays, everyday rooms, council chambers), they also portray the wonders of the universe. One day we actually make it out there... only to find that Hollywood has beaten us to the point. Yet the Hollywood F\/X don't leave us lost in a realm of... F\/X; we can look at this (the star journeys, the systems, the arrays), and it looks real; or at least, real enough to be totally believable, which is the whole point of Hollywood.Yet as with any good movie, the special effects play second fiddle to the actors and the characters they play. You can have absolutely amazing  F\/X, and yet have a bland and boring movie (such as Star Trek The Motion Picture). Here, the special effects - as beautiful as they are - definitely play second fiddle to the actors and their characters.With all of this, we can't forget the man behind the camera... Robert Zemeckis. He's brought us such slapstick broadsides as Ghostbusters, but at the heart he is a filmmaker, a true director (not that Ghostbusters was false), and this movie shows it - he does an astonishing job, getting astounding performances out of his cast.The characters - based on the novel by scientist and philosopher Carl Sagan - are nothing less that miraculous... and oh-so-human. It's a very big round of applause to the various actors that you look at each of the characters and you can see where each one is coming from; whom they are supposed to be - that's what Hollywood is supposed to be like, and so rarely is.

Let's summarize the movie at face value and go on with the critique later In the Line of Fire is a pretty routine thriller that entertains to a certain extent, but never really takes off like it should. Sure, it's recommendable, but compared to some other recent thrillers, and the potential this one had, it fails to deliver.It has to do, in part, with the Kennedy assassination, and a cat and mouse game that never really takes off like it should between an ex-assassin named Mitch (John Malkovich) and a Secret Service Agent, Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), a man who was guarding John F. Kennedy on the tragic day so long ago. Frank is not haunted by the past and determined to stop his new adversary as a way of revisiting his past.It is the re-election of 1992. The US President is parading around the nation delivering speeches and interviews. This is when Frank receives a disturbingly wicked call from Mitch, who threatens to kill the President. His motive? The US Government has screwed him over. He wants revenge.Mitch was a trained assassin whom the government tried to get rid of. Now he wants revenge and he is out to prove his point by killing the great nation's leader. Mitch insists that he and Frank are alike. Frank took the blame for the Kennedy assassination even though he was the one who recommended advanced security. There was an assassination attempt on Mitch even though he is an assassin. Perhaps Ironic Assassinators would have been a better title for this film. But then with a title like that it probably would have been a straight-to-video release with Kris Kristofferson or something. Anyhow, Frank denies that they have any connection. The phrase, We're not so different, you and I has never held a greater meaning.Mitch has a pretty neat technique--he can alter his appearences almost as well as Jamie Kennedy. He can be a street bum, an overweight businessman, or he can bear a striking resemblance to John Malkovich, so much so that he should win a Special Achievment Oscar for the category Best John Malkovich Lookalike. (And on another note, I'm starting to get tired of John Malkovich -- once he had a movie named after him I knew there would be no turning back.)Because of Mr. Malkovich's impressive facial alterations, Mr. Eastwood has a pretty hard time nailing him. Even when Mitch calls he has a super-cool device that diverts the tracking systems the police use to a random number. Correct me if I'm wrong This device cannot possibly be built?

Perhaps it is his giant skin bubbles she finds so attractive? I'm through talking about this. Clint Eastwood is often considered the thinking man's action hero. He's getting older now - he was 63 then and 73 now - but the films stay the same. This is Dirty Harry with a touch of irony. And it really all depends on if you like Clint, because this is his movie.

From the way it was seen in that it had my expectations so high that when I finally saw it today I was only slightly disappointed. I realize that Rossellini works in a different realism than like Vittorio DeSica. The viewer sees right away that DeSica works much better in getting the tragedy of the emotional levels of these people, while Rossellini gets the tragedy of the situation(s) at hand. At it's purest and best, Open City tells a solid story about simple people in harrowing times. At his core, Rossellini films Open City a lot like a documentary, with some shots here and there that you didn't see at the time - all of the locations were real from weeks after the war ended and created the appropriate atmosphere. And yet, despite the truth to the story (of a Priest being executed by the fascists), every now and then I found myself looking at Open City like it should have been better, that it hasn't held up against time like DeSica's films did. I was able to look past some of the faults, but not enough to make me think of this as a masterpiece like many critics and admirers say.Still, the main theme that goes with Open City, the loyalty of the common people, is not lost on a modern viewer such as me- the priest Don Pietro Pelligrini (Aldo Fabrizi), along with some children who are also resistance fighters, try and help those who are trying to rid Rome and Italy of the German presence. There is also Francesco, who has a couple of aliases, and wants to marry Pina (Anna Magnani, in the most heart-felt performance of the film) since she's pregnant. The events in the second and third acts of the film are worth watching, though the first act slowly introducing several supporting players takes its time showing us these are real people who've lived through the war and are sick of waiting for the end of it. I'm not too sure now if I can recommend Open City as THE definitive neo-realist film, because it was made before neo-realism had found its footing. It is an important film to see, I don't doubt that, and the last twenty minutes of the film contain some of the most memorable material in the neo-realism movement (these twenty minutes give Fabrizi time to prove his worth). Even as a regular war film I got what I wanted...Perhaps I need to see another one of Rossellini's works, like Paisan, The Miracle, or Germany Year Zero before, I know if his breakthrough was his best effort as a director and\/or to the genre he helped create.Author's note one aspect that hindered my enjoyment of watching Open City was that, despite seeing it on DVD, the print of the film was sub-par, and the subtitles that accompanied it only contained about 75% of what was spoken.

It is an important film to see, I don't doubt that, and the last twenty minutes of the film contain some of the most memorable material in the neo-realism movement (these twenty minutes give Fabrizi time to prove his worth). Even as a regular war film I got what I wanted...Perhaps I need to see another one of Rossellini's works, like Paisan, The Miracle, or Germany Year Zero before, I know if his breakthrough was his best effort as a director and\/or to the genre he helped create.Author's note one aspect that hindered my enjoyment of watching Open City was that, despite seeing it on DVD, the print of the film was sub-par, and the subtitles that accompanied it only contained about 75% of what was spoken. There was one line in particular towards the very end that I remembered from a clip shown in the documentary that was left out, which was a downer for such a powerful scene. Like the film or not, this needs Criterion collection treatment.

And this is where it had the potential to have the most impact. Jackson went a bit over-the-top with all the silly shots that regular camera moves couldn't have possibly achieved. There is no aesthetic in this. It is artifice. If you listen to the director's commentary track on the Ronin DVD, you will hear John Frankenheimer talk a lot about transitions.

In an attempt to protect her aging father who has been called upon to aid China's army in their war against the merciless Huns, Mulan assumes the identity of a young boy and takes her father's place amongst the Chinese soldiers. While being trained for war, Mulan must overcome physical and mental obstacles that would make even the largest men weak and exhausted, all the while concealing her identity in fear of ridicule and severe punishment. Mulan's only help comes in the form of a very tiny, wisecracking dragon named Mushu, who is just as much of a hindrance as he is a help. Training is short-lived as the Huns swiftly ravage through China, leaving Mulan, a group of soldiers that could turn on her at any moment, and her clumsy companion as the country's last wall of defense. A truly engaging film, Disney's Mulan features an expected perfect cast of voices, including ER's Ming Na Wen as the courageous title character, whose strength and spirit have the power to protect an entire nation. Ming Na's vocal transformation changes perfectly with her character, leading Mulan from naive, free spirited girl, to a battle-ready, headstrong young woman, with seemingly no effort at all, making her character very realistic and easy to root for. Comedic genius Eddie Murphy assumes the role of Mulan's dragon guardian Mushu. Murphy is a scene stealing machine in this film because every time he talks, the laughter he gets lasts so long you miss a good minute of the next character's dialogue. I also have to give Mr. Murphy full credit for keeping the laughs coming while not letting out a single cuss word. I'm sure it was torturous for him and I think he should know his effort was appreciated. One last actor to be mentioned is B.D. Wong, who appears vocally in this film as Captain Li Shang, a truly arrogant but effective soldier who serves in the army alongside Mulan. Wong did a commendable job letting his voice command just as much courage and arrogance as his character. Directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft are fully responsible for putting another golden feather in Disney's cap. Mulan is made in a way that parents and children can both be entertained and learn a lesson at the same time. It is a family film that is actually made for the family. The film has great animation, and features what could be Disney's most truly menacing villains, the Huns, which is of course is a valuable asset because it makes the heroes actually heroic by opposing them; a good distinction to have when making a movie where one of its major story elements is the conflict between good and bad. This may seem obvious, but a lot of people in Hollywood don't seem to be picking up on it. Producer Pam Coats knows what elements are necessary to make a family classic and she shared them all in making Mulan. For the most part everything in this film is exactly as it should be. The characters are well defined, the story is interesting, although, of course, not original work. As well the score is absolutely breathtaking and I really find some of the songs featured to be truly some of the best ever heard in a Disney film. The writing team, including Rita Hsiao and Christopher Sanders, give this film everything from sharp dialogue to intelligent story, and that is exactly what they were hired for. I hope more people will look to hire this team in future endeavors. Although not Disney's crowning achievement, this movie really is a fantastic slice of entertainment, and is certainly something that should be viewed by everyone. Woman and children will really enjoy this film so I will direct this final comment towards all my male readers out there if you're at the video store this evening, and your family asks if they can get something everyone can enjoy, instead of you checking out another action flick with Stallone in it, I say put your own viewing pleasures aside, leave Rambo on the shelves, and you may actually find the company of Mulan more rewarding.Overall Rating 8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2003","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Mulan During a time of war, a young girl's courage will be the savior of her father, her people and her entire country, all she has to do is make everyone believe she's a boy.

Ming Na's vocal transformation changes perfectly with her character, leading Mulan from naive, free spirited girl, to a battle-ready, headstrong young woman, with seemingly no effort at all, making her character very realistic and easy to root for. Comedic genius Eddie Murphy assumes the role of Mulan's dragon guardian Mushu. Murphy is a scene stealing machine in this film because every time he talks, the laughter he gets lasts so long you miss a good minute of the next character's dialogue. I also have to give Mr. Murphy full credit for keeping the laughs coming while not letting out a single cuss word. I'm sure it was torturous for him and I think he should know his effort was appreciated. One last actor to be mentioned is B.D. Wong, who appears vocally in this film as Captain Li Shang, a truly arrogant but effective soldier who serves in the army alongside Mulan. Wong did a commendable job letting his voice command just as much courage and arrogance as his character. Directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft are fully responsible for putting another golden feather in Disney's cap. Mulan is made in a way that parents and children can both be entertained and learn a lesson at the same time. It is a family film that is actually made for the family. The film has great animation, and features what could be Disney's most truly menacing villains, the Huns, which is of course is a valuable asset because it makes the heroes actually heroic by opposing them; a good distinction to have when making a movie where one of its major story elements is the conflict between good and bad. This may seem obvious, but a lot of people in Hollywood don't seem to be picking up on it. Producer Pam Coats knows what elements are necessary to make a family classic and she shared them all in making Mulan. For the most part everything in this film is exactly as it should be. The characters are well defined, the story is interesting, although, of course, not original work. As well the score is absolutely breathtaking and I really find some of the songs featured to be truly some of the best ever heard in a Disney film. The writing team, including Rita Hsiao and Christopher Sanders, give this film everything from sharp dialogue to intelligent story, and that is exactly what they were hired for. I hope more people will look to hire this team in future endeavors. Although not Disney's crowning achievement, this movie really is a fantastic slice of entertainment, and is certainly something that should be viewed by everyone. Woman and children will really enjoy this film so I will direct this final comment towards all my male readers out there if you're at the video store this evening, and your family asks if they can get something everyone can enjoy, instead of you checking out another action flick with Stallone in it, I say put your own viewing pleasures aside, leave Rambo on the shelves, and you may actually find the company of Mulan more rewarding.Overall Rating 8 out of 10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"1 October 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Can't believe I waited seven whole years to see this bloodfest.

Instead I got a messy horror show suitable for teenagers at a drive-in.Sometimes the violence is too violent, and to me, what happens to the hostage in the hotel is over the line.Secondly, the notion of somebody who has accepted Jesus then turning into a vampire is just plain wrong. If you've accepted Christ, then greater who is in you than who is in the world - period! Scripturally this movie is not correct, and SOMEBODY on that film crew should have noticed and corrected that.

So I think it's really a toss up, maybe Christine exeggerated a little here and there after mom's death or bitter about the will and plot a nice little cozy revenge. I wouldnt know who really would believe the book in a hundred percent state of mind of pure non fiction, you have to take everything you read with a little bit of grain and salt , especially biographies and memoirs such as this. But as I feel towards it I think Joan was a pretty ruthless creature towards her kids and gave them a lot of self discipline, including the coat hangar scene which was always so ridicolous to think about , but it might of happened, I believe in it, just not a hundred percent and I expect a few flaws lingering around maybe, but Joan Crawford in my book was another Hollywood actress of a tyrant!!!
