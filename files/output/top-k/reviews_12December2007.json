Instead this is a thriller based story that unfolds to reveal the nasty world on snuff films.The subject matter is somewhat interesting, but the characters are by far the most interesting part of this film. It does seem to be extremely well cast. You really do despise the Eddie Poole guy (well known for doing Sopranos), he is one nasty man. The dark locations and seedy settings are truly comparable to the writers other hit Se7en.I had no idea what the film was about, and assumed 8mm was some reference to a gun, but I was clearly wrong. Nicholas Cage has done some mediocre performances in the past and hence I was willing to watch this film. From the off set I was gripped; I must admit I enjoy dark films like Se7en, Sleepy Hollow and now 8mm. I cannot begin to describe how dark and seedy the film is and how horrid the locations are, but it really is done well.Nicholas Cage truly portrays his character well, being a middle-class non-descript (ordinary) private detective, but is lured into this dark and seedy world. His curiosity getting the better of him, and a sense of finding justice &#150; our hero is born (I cannot say more than that). Tom Welles really does seem out of his depth. Again, as previously said, the other characters are cast well and all seem to belong to this ghastly underworld.Joaquin Pheonix plays the ever-inquisitive sidekick very well and it was the first time I took notice of him. Again he fits into the role well.Other than cast and film settings the plot is nicely balanced too. It's not complex, so don't expect a murder mystery as such, but its far more complex than any action movie and is somewhat interesting, if not plain disturbing. It's not as far fetched as the likes of Hostel, nor is it as graphic. In fact the scenes of violence are kept to a minimum and hence the story and acting prove to be strong.So if you enjoy being thrilled by the darker side of films, then sit back, close the curtains and prepared to be disturbed. I would suggest decent sounds (be it surround-sound or Hi-Fi) are needed; there is the odd quiet then loud scary moment.

This theme crops up in much of his work, but its especially true of Blue Velvet. It sparked a great deal of controversy in 1986 for its graphic depictions of sadomasochism and voyeurism (things not often seen outside of porno theatres), but against the odds, it became a cult classic.Despite a somewhat disappointing conclusion and maddening plot holes, Blue Velvet is very deserving of its acclaim. Few films settle in with a grip of such compulsive fascination. And that's especially true of the first 40 minutes.The much remarked upon opening images are quite wonderful the way they set the scene. Glaringly aggressive closeups of white picket fences, beautiful tulips, a blinding blue sky and neatly trimmed lawns. The very epitome of suburban perfection.But these perfect images are in stark contrast to the sight of a man keeling over with a heart attack. The camera then does something extraordinary by burrowing into the lawn he was watering. It goes past the blades of grass, through the soil, and comes across an insect colony. Crawling over each other. Making as much racket as they like. A miniature microcosm of chaos.A very subtle message of the American Dream gone sour. Made all the more potent by Bobby Vinton's dreamy Blue Velvet on the soundtrack. The decay hiding beneath the order, waiting to emerge. Corruption that lurks just beneath the shiny surface.Blue Velvet is one of David Lynch's most excellently directed films, especially coming from someone whose work is usually incoherent and distorted. He uses a possible murder mystery as a framing device to get right inside the world of Lumberton, USA.Another reason why Blue Velvet is one of Lynch's most accomplished films is its apt cast. Kyle MacLachlan is Jeffrey Beaumont, the cleancut All-American Boy who gets in over his head. Laura Dern as Sandy Williams, the Girl Next Door who sets Jeffrey off on the nightmarishly deceptive road to the real Lumberton. Isabella Rossellini in a wonderfully gutsy performance as nightclub singer Dorothy, and Dennis Hopper pulling out all the stops as the crazed, egomaniacal Frank.When Jeffrey stumbles across a human ear in a field, it propels him into a journey through the darkest recesses of Lumberton. He sees a side of the town he never knew existed, or even imagined.The first 40 minutes are absolutely superb the way each piece of the plot slots into place. There's something wonderfully engrossing when Jeffrey discovers Dorothy's apartment, hides in her closet observing (ogling?) her, and than the entrance of Frank completely throws a spanner in the works. What we at first assumed was Dorothy the murder suspect. Only the film turns convention on its head, and it becomes Dorothy the victim.I don't want to reveal the plot's unfolding rhythms. Its storytelling speaks for itself. But one thing is sure. You will be shocked, amazed and uplifted at all of the right moments.There are two stories going on in Blue Velvet. The story of Jeffrey's shock and revulsion at the dark side of Lumberton. The second is his seduction by it. By becoming swept up in Dorothy's elegant allure, it brings Jeffrey face to face with the seedy underside of a world he thought he always knew. A world of drugs, violence, rape and S&M. It changes Jeffrey's world forever.David Lynch's films are frequently bizarre. But in the case of Blue Velvet, this aspect hovers around the narrative in a state of dreamy unease. With the inclusion of Frank's character, this bizarreness begins to punctuate it, taking on a wide variety of bizarre shapes and sizes. None more so than Dean Stockwell's camp queen drug dealer, who delivers an unsettling lip-synced rendition of In Dreams.Some scenes are deeply disturbing. Frank raping Dorothy. She begging for more. Jeffrey's joyride through the wild side of Lumberton. The way the sick and depraved neighbours with the virtuous is utterly shocking to behold.Although most people believe the finest performance is from Hopper, I felt that honour goes to Rossellini. The fact that she was willing to put herself through so much humiliation and anguish is truly remarkable. It served to make her plight that all the more horrifying.But Hopper is excellent too. Frank is a monster. Pure and simple. Hopper knew it, and played the part with zero inhibitions. Its a role that stands just on the cusp of powerful vs hammy. Sometimes Hopper doesn't always recognise the difference, but he intuits Frank perfectly. Its a career making performance.But despite Blue Velvet's reputation as a classic, I feel it falls a little short of that distinction. Yes its beautifully shot, impeccably choreographed and accompanied to a wonderful brooding score from Angelo Badalamenti. But the kidnapping and murder plot eventually feels intrusive and unnecessary. And Frank is a mystery. Aside from being a psychopath with the bizarre habit of inhaling gas through a mask, we learn little about him. If it weren't for Hopper's brilliant performance, he would fade from memory.Also the grand finale is not quite as grand as I hoped it would be. Even if its nicely philosophical. Early on Sandy narrates a story about robins putting things to rights. The closing shot of a robin with an insect in its beak seems to reaffirm the status quo. But its an ending of creepy ambiguity. Don't forget. Where there is one insect, there will always be another...and another.

Yes, I voted it as excellent in the hope that this comment wouldn't be down on the tenth page where all the no star reviews are stored. This film is the most nauseous mess I have ever seen. Migraine inducing visuals, absurd musical choices, actors chewing the scenery while singing hammed-up versions of The Sound of Music.Now, to be fair, I've never seen the film in its entirety, but I have tried to see it through three times to understand why some people love it ... and failed ... I can't make it to the end. The noisy, garish, tasteless assault defeats me every time. The only successful performance in the film is by Nicole Kidman's porcelain epidermis.
