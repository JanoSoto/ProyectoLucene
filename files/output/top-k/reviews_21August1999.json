I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty, Halloween H2O, and the confusingly popular and very annoying Dawson's Creek all look like masterpiece's of cinema and television compared to this dreadful attempt of a movie. It is truly so bad that one cannot help oneself from laughing out loud at certain times, when laughs were the exact opposite reaction the director was going for. At other times watching the movie evokes actual physical pain.The story revolves around Leigh Ann (Katie Holmes), who is the perfect, innocent student whose life ambition is to be a writer. Standing in her way of getting the scholarship she needs to attend college and pursue her dreams to the fullest is Mrs. Tingle (Helen Mirren), a almost Hitler like history teacher who, for some reason that is never truly explained, will do anything she can to ruin Leigh Ann's life. When the school loser Luke (Barry Watson), who is the love interest of both Leigh Ann and best friend Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan), steals the Tingle final exam and tries to get Leigh Ann in on it, the cat-like Mrs. Tingle is right there to spoil the plot and blame Leigh Ann for the crime. Venturing to Tingle's house after school to try and explain things, Luke, Jo Lynn and Leigh Ann turn trying to persuade the evil teacher to not accuse Leigh Ann of cheating into a full fledged hostage situation. The rest of the movie drones along at a painstaking pace, going down every predictable road in the book, and ending with a sickeningly obvious conclusion.Katie Holmes is the only saving grace in this film, and most of that is due to her painfully cute appearance. She plays the same character she has played in every role she has ever been given, the young, innocent, bright girl who has more morals than the Pope on Christmas. It would not have been a shock to see Dawson dash through the door of Tingle's house with an overly mature, long winded solution to the problem and then leave just as quickly. Helen Mirren makes the part of Mrs. Tingle very hard to relate to and is so over the top of her performance that you forget she is supposed to be just a history teacher and not some international terrorist being sought after in a Tom Clancy novel. Her ambivalance to the situation she is put in, the way she almost relishes being held captive by the three teens is so out of place that it borders on insulting.While Helen may have made Mrs. Tingle the most unrealistic character in the movie, the award for worst actress goes to, hands down, Marisa Coughlan. Her portrayal of the horny actress Jo Lynn is so bad I was hoping someone had brought a hungry, wet baby who already hated life just to take my mind off of her. Her scene where she imitates the wonderful film The Exorcist is so embarrassing that I had to look away from the screen until it was over. Even her beauty is not enough to overpower her terrible performance, and the fact that she is so bad seems to take away from her appearance. It is truly extraordinary, so bad that it almost becomes another entity in the movie, and leaves one wondering how, in a profession so many try and fail, how someone like that can squeak through the cracks. Oh, and one more note, Luke (Barry Watson) is the most inconsequential character I have ever seen in a movie and the fact that he is supposed to be the school loser is not helped by the fact that he speaks as if he were a literary student at Oxford.Overall, this movie is just terrible. It is so badly conceived, so badly acted, so badly directed, and so badly written that it offers no moments of levity at all. It is very rare to find a movie that possesses none of the qualities a good film has. Kevin Williamson proves, once again, that he is the most overrated writer on the planet and that his dialogue is the same for every character, for every situation. Note to Kevin; no high school students, and very few college students for that matter, talk as if they are Rhodes Scholars.

It's innovative, unique, interesting, and there are not any mindless explosions or big-breasted bimbos.  If you are reading this review, you must already know the main storyline, so I won't waste time with it.But for those of you out there that enjoy thought-provoking films, I definately recommend this one.  Unlike the remakes and sequels Hollywood has been churning out recently, this film not only has an original storyline, but is inventive in the manner in which the story is shown, mixing a small amount of animation with live action and video.  Even though the presence of animation is minimal (excluding the opening credits), that is one of the most important parts of the film, because even though you see it three different times, that is where the first change takes place (Lola getting scared, Lola being tripped, and Lola jumping over dog and boy).  And from there, the chaos theory takes hold and we see as the one small change expands and multiplies, sending our heroine down completely different paths each time.  Another interesting part of the film is that as Lola goes down different paths each time, so do the people she interacts with directly (her father, her boyfriend, the people she runs by on the street).  This film has been compared to Groundhog's Day, and the similarty of repetition is striking.  The subtler similarity is that Lola seems to learn from each run through the way Bill Murray does in his movie.  This is also one of the few films where music actually plays a large part of the film's tone, instead of just random noise as in so many other movies.One last note.

Hugh Grant's stereotyped roles seem to be getting a little tiresome by now, don't you think? I mean, sure his typical role as a stammering shy very polite and good-mannered Englishman, often placed in a Fish-out-of-water situation, usually America, do cause laughs and hilarity at first, but by now it simply isn't funny anymore!However, it must be said, despite Hugh Grant in his all-too-familiar role, the film has tried hard in trying to make us laugh, especially in other aspects. Unlike any other Grant film, this picture does actually take quite a serious and often grim situation and illustrates the funny side of it, most of the humour being quite intriguingly black. But then again, quite a lot of the film's gags are half-hearted parodies of the more serious Mafia pictures, such as Casino, Goodfellas, and (most prominently), The Godfather Trilogy, considering the fact that one the Trilogy's cast members plays a leading role in this film (James Caan, who without doubt gets the most credit in this movie).The film deals with witty Englishman Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) who lives in New York and has a comfortable occupation as an auctioneer for many art paintings. When he asks his girlfriend Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) to marry him, she surprisingly refuses, later claiming that he can't marry her because of her family. Soon Michael is introduced to the family, who turn out to be the leaders of a well-known Mafiosi crime mob, Gina's father (Caan) being one of the leaders. Soon Felgate (nicknamed Mickey Blue Eyes by the mob) gets reluctantly involved in the organised crime world, only to result in drastic consequences...Sure, it is a little silly in some places. And I suppose that the characters do lack a little originality, though if you are a Hugh Grant fan, I encourage you to go and see it. I'm just saying that this is not a film to be overrated.

Hugh Grant's stereotyped roles seem to be getting a little tiresome by now, don't you think? I mean, sure his typical role as a stammering shy very polite and good-mannered Englishman, often placed in a Fish-out-of-water situation, usually America, do cause laughs and hilarity at first, but by now it simply isn't funny anymore!However, it must be said, despite Hugh Grant in his all-too-familiar role, the film has tried hard in trying to make us laugh, especially in other aspects. Unlike any other Grant film, this picture does actually take quite a serious and often grim situation and illustrates the funny side of it, most of the humour being quite intriguingly black. But then again, quite a lot of the film's gags are half-hearted parodies of the more serious Mafia pictures, such as Casino, Goodfellas, and (most prominently), The Godfather Trilogy, considering the fact that one the Trilogy's cast members plays a leading role in this film (James Caan, who without doubt gets the most credit in this movie).The film deals with witty Englishman Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) who lives in New York and has a comfortable occupation as an auctioneer for many art paintings. When he asks his girlfriend Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) to marry him, she surprisingly refuses, later claiming that he can't marry her because of her family. Soon Michael is introduced to the family, who turn out to be the leaders of a well-known Mafiosi crime mob, Gina's father (Caan) being one of the leaders. Soon Felgate (nicknamed Mickey Blue Eyes by the mob) gets reluctantly involved in the organised crime world, only to result in drastic consequences...Sure, it is a little silly in some places.

He proved adept at this with the decent L.A. STORY in 1991, but here he takes it to a rampant, more delirious level.  It is reminiscent of his early humor from the 70's. Having written BOWFINGER, he also could not have come up with a better idea to cast Eddie Murphy as a head-case movie star.  Murphy is a comedic weapon in this picture which has a laugh in almost every scene either because of Murphy's antics or because of what Martin and company are doing to him.  A movie is being made starring Murphy's character Kit Ramsey, but he has no idea what the hell is going on.Martin paints the town once again with some familiar gags and rips, especially at the religious mind-set of many stars in Hollywood. MindHead is probably a stab at scientology, which so many of the actors and producers take part in out there.  Kit Ramsey reminded me of Martin Laurence in real life, sort of a manic personality.  Murphy no doubt takes liberty with the material and creates his first genuinely funny character since Axel Foley. It is good to see him pairing up with the likes of Martin and seeing the true comic genius that has always existed within Murphy.  BOWFINGER is a huge departure from his recent star vehicles, most of which disappoint.Steve Martin turns in an equally sensational slapstick performance as low-budget director Bowfinger with a hint of do or do not, there is no try.  You will be reminded of ED WOOD during many scenes because of this mad cracker of a director, who will stop at nothing to get his flimsy film made (even if it includes carrying a very unusable cell phone and shooting footage of security screens capturing the story he is trying to make). Director Frank Oz keeps the pace relentless and the chuckles plentiful as a new revelation halfway through extends Murphy's ability to make us laugh.It turns out there is a Kit Ramsey look-alike out there and Martin and the gang audition him to be an errand boy and to showcase his butt as a stand-in for Ramsey.  This character is even funnier than the original and the film's best scene has this awe-struck, goofy loser (also played by Murphy) running across a busy L.A. highway risking life and limb and braces. Heather Graham is an effective caricature of the dumb blondes who supposedly get off a bus every day in California and ask Where do I become a star?.  There is more to her than meets the eye and she seems to have a good idea of how to get what she wants.BOWFINGER is not exactly original.  We have seen this before in GET SHORTY and the aforementioned ED WOOD.  This film may be superior because the characters are so hilarious and the story spares us nothing that you cannot help but laugh.  It is an uproarious comedy with a sometimes tender side that brings Eddie Murphy back into cinema form and has the viewer stomping and spitting popcorn with BIG laughs.
