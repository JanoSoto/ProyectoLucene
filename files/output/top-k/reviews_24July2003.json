I went to see it in the theaters on the first night. I came out, not understanding what I just saw one bit but somehow, I knew that I really liked it. Coming out of the theater, I saw my counselor from day camp, who had just come out of the same showing. I asked him if he understood it and he said yes. I asked him if he'd explain it to me and he said that yes, he'd explain it to me the next time he saw me. I spent the rest of the weekend with this movie in my head, reliving scenes of the unspeakable horrors I had seen in my mind. It made sense to me after thinking about it for hours upon hours but only slightly. I got the gist of what was going on but I couldn't understand how the movie ended the way it did and how everything added up. Finally, when I saw my counselor in the neighborhood and he explained the movie to me, it was as if I had been slapped in the forehead by one of those TV evangelists who enjoy slapping people around and helping them find Jesus, praise God! I saw the light. Literally. All the little details in the movie finally meant something to me. I think I asked him to go over the details of the story like twelve times that summer at camp, just so I could relive it.I love this movie. It's sick, violent and it's got one of the most realistic sex scenes I've ever seen, unless you count in the little detail of all the blood streaming in from the ceiling. I don't know anybody who has that kind of sex... well, maybe a couple but I'm not telling. It's a dark noir movie with just enough religion in it to make it frightening. You see elevators going down shafts all loud, rattling their gates.... man, it's enough to give a prison bully nightmares. Mickey Rourke is the bomb as PI Harry Angel. This is easily his best performance and it's a shame that no one gives this guy any respect. I can understand why he doesn't get any respect but still, throw the guy some Snausages, ya know? Robert De Niro is excellent as his client and Lisa Bonet sheds the Cosby Show image along with all of her clothes pretty handily. I thought the underarm hair was a bit ill-style but to each their own. Alan Parker sets the mood perfectly from the very first frame of the film. I definitely think that if you haven't seen it, you should do so but watch it at night when you can enjoy the darkness of it.Anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough. Sex, violence, voodoo, maimings, guns going up places they shouldn't be, scary looking mofos, chicken throat slashings, blues and some sick plot twists get this flick a high ranking from yours truly. Also, I think this has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a movie. The saxophone by Courtney Pine is priceless. You go, Mickey!

It begins like a murder mystery, but it becomes obvious very quickly who the murderer is, and the plot becomes more concerned with his motive. And it is his motive which makes the movie so interesting. 'Crossfire' is a message movie but it is also a cracking good drama, and that's what I enjoyed about it. Plus the cast is dynamite - Roberts Preston, Mitchum and Ryan, and the beautiful Gloria Grahame ('In A Lonely Place'). Mitchum doesn't have a big a role as you might expect (the movie was released the same year as 'Out Of The Past' in which he gives a much more substantial performance), but he's always great to watch, and Robert Ryan ('The Wild Bunch') steals the movie as a very nasty piece of work. I find many 1940s romance and comedy movies to be too corny for my taste, but the crime movies are much more to my liking. They are usually grittier and more realistic, and 'Crossfire' is a great example of this. Highly recommended.

The message in this film, as enunciated by Vincent D'Onofrio's Orson Welles in a scene where Ed meets the great man, is that visions are worth fighting for, even if, as in Ed's case, they're rubbish.At the heart of the film is the friendship between Ed and fading horror icon Bela Lugosi. Despite the fact that so much of the film is laugh out loud funny, this core relationship is really quite moving. Martin Landau is quite superb as Lugosi, and some of his scenes will leave you close to tears - in particular when he goes cold turkey in rehab, and when he recites his 'atomic supermen' lines from Ed's film Bride of the Monster. The absurdity of the lines only seems to add to their poignancy. That's not to say that Landau doesn't have some screamingly funny lines - Let's shot this f****r!.

Ahh, such a good videogame collection. I got into Resident Evil about 3 or 4 years ago, when I played Resident Evil 2. Then Resident Evil 3. Last Christmas, I finally played Resident Evil. Easter, I played Resident Evil 0. I know, that's not them all, but those are what I have played. An absolutely great videogame collection.Why am I saying this when I'm supposed to be reviewing the film? Because I just want you to know that I love Resident Evil. The games that is. The following review may make you think I don't like Resident Evil. I only hate the film. I love the games. Shall I begin then?Now, I warn you here that there are Spoilers, but in case someone misses this lineSPOILER ALERTOkay, when we start, we get some labs and some idiots getting themselves killed inside a lab. This can almost make you think that we're about to get a good film. The scene is relatively well done but with the dash of stupidity in it here and there. Not bad this scene though.Sadly, once we get to the Mansion, this hope slowly dissipates. Now we get the overused Black Opps come in to do their thing. They want to go to the Labs and do some stuff that I can't really be bothered to remember because if you've seen it once and didn't like it, you won't want to see it again.Once they get there, they couldn't come up with any ideas about how to kill off the only good characters in a scene creuly ripped from Cube! And not only that there is a MAJOR goof up in that scene! There is space at either end that could be used to hide in so as to not get killed by a Laser! But they kill the character's off anyway.The rest of the film sees poorly crafted Zombies with what looks like bits of vegetable stuck to their heads and other poor effects. I wouldn't go into detail but I feel I want to.The Zombies we see look like malnourished staffworkers and don't even have the decent Resident Evil Zombie stumble. They don't even have flesh hanging off! I'm sorry if this is too vivid or soemthing, but I've got a Resident Evil Remake Poster and I see a Zombie with skin flaking. The fact that Romero didn't Greenlight it cost it. Greatly. Romero is, in my opinion, the god of Zombie Films, especially when teamed with Tom Savini's high quality special effects. Sadly, Anderson had neither.Anderson claims that they were to look like they were desiesed and that by putting make-up on the main areas of the body and to make them look like they inhaled tyhe virus and yadda yadda yadda. They aren't diseased anymore, moron! They're dead! They died! The chemical has kept them animated! They aren't diseased anmore, they're descesed!But back on the subject of effects, you must recall the sound effects of the Zombies in Resident Evil, the Games. The raspy moans, the sound of mutilated flesh merged with torn cloth being dragged along a corridor. Suddenly, we have a bunch of people wearing special effects rediculously (Wounds that look like they cut deep into the Flesh but completely clean around it doesn't look right) that make hissing, not groans, hissing!Now, I have to say something about the actual plot. Okay, not even a reference to a Character from ANY of the games in this film. There's barely a reference to Resident Evil. Racoon City is mentioned about TWICE in the entire film, despite this being the one of the places we see most of. Look at it this wayResident Evil Okay, this was set on the Outskirts in a Mansion that Anderson never heard of.Resident Evil 2 It starts on the streets of where? Why, Racon City. Where are you most of the game? The RPD Building, ofcourse.Resident Evil 3 You spend most of the game wandering and figthing on the very streets of Racoon in RE3 and you don't leave Racoon until the end.I don't know about Resident Evil Codename Veronica really, but I think it is set elsewhere so my point is not of use here.Suddenly, we have this Secret Lab under Racoon City that was never mentioned or visited in a game. Did Anderson even play Resident Evil 1 for longer then 5 Minutes?So this here is the Hive under some Mansion that suddenly exists in some Mountains. Don't know what the Mountains are called cos I played the game for 5 miutes. I'm sorry, what? Spencer Estate? What is that? Ar..klay...Moun..tains? Are they part of the Andes or something?And we also have someone who is about as close as we can get to everyone's favourite G-Virus Securing Guy, Hunk. Obviously, the guys who made this film had't played Hunk's Bonus Scenario, but heard a little about a Black Commando securing a Virus. Now, may I point out that these people obviously got killed by the first Licker in Resident Evil 2 and assumed it was a boss so stuck a Licker in and made it look awful in appearance but scare the characters. And I admit to this. Lickers are scary. But most of the time, people are smart enough to shoot them, removing the fear, unless they, for example, jump through a window the first time you've played Resident Evil 2. And how come we haven't even a mentioning of Wesker or Birkin, who not only did much work on the T-Virus but also (Brikin) worked on the G-Virus, yet no mention of the G-Virus or the T-Virus?Now, I'd like to have my say on the Special Effects? *cough*bunch-a-hacks*cough*. They stole from Cube to kill off probably the only good Character\/s in the film. But I won't dwell on that bit. I want to dwell on the pathetic creature effects. Creature effects are present? What the hell? Running up a wall to kill a Cerberus by kicking it in the head?Er..Plot Hole Designer Guy, you did a good job of explaining why this gal can run up walls and rip off the Matrix! Here's a bonus!And it kills the dog! Easy as that! How stupid can you get!?Now, she goes through 1 Clip and kills ALL those dogs? That's about 2 or less Bullets a Dog. Now, I don't recall EVER having the pleasure of only using 2 shots to kill a Cerberus. Ever. Another thing is that 1\/3 of the time, the Dogs looked like Dogs that had been covered in Tomato Skins, another 1\/3 of the time, they were horribly shiny turds of CGI that never once looked real and the final 1\/3 they were just heads on sticks (They're supposed to be growling. All they do is stay VERY still and stare which can only really mean heads on sticks). The Licker didn't even look realistic. It was too shiny. And too...non...Lickery. It barely looked or acted like a Licker. Licker's are smart, stealthy and dangerous. Remember in Resident Evil 2 when you're in the interogation room? One (Or two, I think) jumped through the window, scaring the hell out of you and showing they're smart enough to use the Camoflauge of the mirror to catch you off guard. Hmmm...Licker just hits at the window. Later it has its tongue stuck down? It's tongue is strong, I beleive, and acutally may have torn itself off insted of just getting stuck there. And it's Claws did what for it's escape? It didn't try attacking anyone, pulling the thing out or tear through its tongue. And what it did? Pulled and flailed a bit. Pathetic. Fullstop.The end of the film is even worse. Why would they want some moron who I don't even think has a name and I couldn't care for the Nemesis Project just because he got a nasty scratch on his arm when the Red Ape (It doesn't deserve the title of Licker. Lickers scared me. This thing looks more like a mobile piece of muscular jelly) cut it. I got cut loads of times in Resident Evil 2 by Lickers. I must have been scratched atleast 8 times by Lickers through the game but I'm not turning into Nemesis. And why wouldn't the other anonymous character (According to Behind-the-scenes her name is Alice. Not that I noticed. I don't recall her name being used in the entire film) just get the Vaccine into him? And Umbrella are better at getting subjects, they don't use failing, flailing actors.I hated this film. These people don't deserve to ever make a film together ever again. I absolutely refuse to watch this ever again. I would sooner boil my Head in a Deep Fat Fryer, stab myself in the Chest wth a Turkey Carver and then watch Coronation Street insted of phoning an Ambulance whlist my House was on fire then watch this film again! It is akin to NotLD 30th Aniversairy Special. It was utterly awful . And it had something it was based on that was simply excellence (I own the original NotLD, both in Black and White and Colour). I kid you not though, Resident Evil the film is THE worst film I have ever seen apart from Total Reality (And that sells on DVD for about £1.29. And it is shoved into Computer Games Sections at Game just to get rid of the damn thing!). I apologise to any fans of the films (NothLD 30th Anniversairy, Total Reality and Resident Evil) but that is how much I hated this film.If you were thinking about buying this film, take your money, save up, and buy either the Resident Evil Remake or Resident Evil 0 (It may leave a few Plot Holes but this is Good! VERY GOOD! I know, I've played it.) and if you don't have a Gamecube but love Resident Evil, buy one and never regret it. Resident Evil (The Film) deserves to be only found pushed to the bottom of Bargain Bins for 99p. And that should only be worth the Empty Box. The Film itself is worthless. This isn't Resident Evil. This is just a bunch of useless idiots trying to cash in on a well loved franchise by using Zombies and Models wearing pathetic clothing amongst bad actors and pathetic looking Zombies. Never, ever, ever watch this film if you have EVER played a Resident Evil Game or even seen a Zombie film and liked them. And the only really good film Anderson made was EVENT HORIZON. Atleast that was any good.0 out of 10. I'm even inclined to say 0 out of infinite!

The RPD Building, ofcourse.Resident Evil 3 You spend most of the game wandering and figthing on the very streets of Racoon in RE3 and you don't leave Racoon until the end.I don't know about Resident Evil Codename Veronica really, but I think it is set elsewhere so my point is not of use here.Suddenly, we have this Secret Lab under Racoon City that was never mentioned or visited in a game. Did Anderson even play Resident Evil 1 for longer then 5 Minutes?So this here is the Hive under some Mansion that suddenly exists in some Mountains. Don't know what the Mountains are called cos I played the game for 5 miutes. I'm sorry, what? Spencer Estate? What is that? Ar..klay...Moun..tains? Are they part of the Andes or something?And we also have someone who is about as close as we can get to everyone's favourite G-Virus Securing Guy, Hunk. Obviously, the guys who made this film had't played Hunk's Bonus Scenario, but heard a little about a Black Commando securing a Virus. Now, may I point out that these people obviously got killed by the first Licker in Resident Evil 2 and assumed it was a boss so stuck a Licker in and made it look awful in appearance but scare the characters. And I admit to this. Lickers are scary. But most of the time, people are smart enough to shoot them, removing the fear, unless they, for example, jump through a window the first time you've played Resident Evil 2. And how come we haven't even a mentioning of Wesker or Birkin, who not only did much work on the T-Virus but also (Brikin) worked on the G-Virus, yet no mention of the G-Virus or the T-Virus?Now, I'd like to have my say on the Special Effects? *cough*bunch-a-hacks*cough*. They stole from Cube to kill off probably the only good Character\/s in the film. But I won't dwell on that bit. I want to dwell on the pathetic creature effects. Creature effects are present? What the hell? Running up a wall to kill a Cerberus by kicking it in the head?Er..Plot Hole Designer Guy, you did a good job of explaining why this gal can run up walls and rip off the Matrix! Here's a bonus!And it kills the dog! Easy as that! How stupid can you get!?Now, she goes through 1 Clip and kills ALL those dogs? That's about 2 or less Bullets a Dog. Now, I don't recall EVER having the pleasure of only using 2 shots to kill a Cerberus. Ever. Another thing is that 1\/3 of the time, the Dogs looked like Dogs that had been covered in Tomato Skins, another 1\/3 of the time, they were horribly shiny turds of CGI that never once looked real and the final 1\/3 they were just heads on sticks (They're supposed to be growling. All they do is stay VERY still and stare which can only really mean heads on sticks). The Licker didn't even look realistic. It was too shiny. And too...non...Lickery. It barely looked or acted like a Licker. Licker's are smart, stealthy and dangerous. Remember in Resident Evil 2 when you're in the interogation room? One (Or two, I think) jumped through the window, scaring the hell out of you and showing they're smart enough to use the Camoflauge of the mirror to catch you off guard. Hmmm...Licker just hits at the window. Later it has its tongue stuck down? It's tongue is strong, I beleive, and acutally may have torn itself off insted of just getting stuck there. And it's Claws did what for it's escape? It didn't try attacking anyone, pulling the thing out or tear through its tongue. And what it did? Pulled and flailed a bit. Pathetic. Fullstop.The end of the film is even worse. Why would they want some moron who I don't even think has a name and I couldn't care for the Nemesis Project just because he got a nasty scratch on his arm when the Red Ape (It doesn't deserve the title of Licker. Lickers scared me. This thing looks more like a mobile piece of muscular jelly) cut it. I got cut loads of times in Resident Evil 2 by Lickers. I must have been scratched atleast 8 times by Lickers through the game but I'm not turning into Nemesis. And why wouldn't the other anonymous character (According to Behind-the-scenes her name is Alice. Not that I noticed. I don't recall her name being used in the entire film) just get the Vaccine into him? And Umbrella are better at getting subjects, they don't use failing, flailing actors.I hated this film. These people don't deserve to ever make a film together ever again. I absolutely refuse to watch this ever again. I would sooner boil my Head in a Deep Fat Fryer, stab myself in the Chest wth a Turkey Carver and then watch Coronation Street insted of phoning an Ambulance whlist my House was on fire then watch this film again! It is akin to NotLD 30th Aniversairy Special. It was utterly awful . And it had something it was based on that was simply excellence (I own the original NotLD, both in Black and White and Colour). I kid you not though, Resident Evil the film is THE worst film I have ever seen apart from Total Reality (And that sells on DVD for about £1.29. And it is shoved into Computer Games Sections at Game just to get rid of the damn thing!). I apologise to any fans of the films (NothLD 30th Anniversairy, Total Reality and Resident Evil) but that is how much I hated this film.If you were thinking about buying this film, take your money, save up, and buy either the Resident Evil Remake or Resident Evil 0 (It may leave a few Plot Holes but this is Good! VERY GOOD! I know, I've played it.) and if you don't have a Gamecube but love Resident Evil, buy one and never regret it. Resident Evil (The Film) deserves to be only found pushed to the bottom of Bargain Bins for 99p. And that should only be worth the Empty Box. The Film itself is worthless. This isn't Resident Evil. This is just a bunch of useless idiots trying to cash in on a well loved franchise by using Zombies and Models wearing pathetic clothing amongst bad actors and pathetic looking Zombies. Never, ever, ever watch this film if you have EVER played a Resident Evil Game or even seen a Zombie film and liked them. And the only really good film Anderson made was EVENT HORIZON. Atleast that was any good.0 out of 10. I'm even inclined to say 0 out of infinite!

I do think that Patrick Stewart and Freddie Jones would have done better to have switched roles, and Everert McGil is a little too stiff for Stilgar. But Kyle Maclachlen does just fine as Paul, Sian Phillips is also good as the Reverend Mother Ramallo, and even Sting shows the right blend of aloofness and barbarity for Feyd-Rautha. Failed masterpiece is how I would sum up this effort, and even so it does a better job in 2 1\/2 hours than John Harrison could do in six. Give it a try, but NOT until you've read the book!

I am astounded that it is considered by IMDb users to be among the top 250 films ever made, let alone the top 100.Edward Norton's performance was good, considering the material, and Edward Furlong is also a decent actor.  However, the other performances here were third rate and totally over the top.   Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney acted as though he were performing in a community theatre production of Shakespeare.  Totally unbelievable.Speaking of unbelievability, how about, for starters, the incredibly lame scene wherein the movie's title is used as a line of dialogue?  So stilted and corny I almost turned the movie off right then and there.  (After seeing the end, I wish I had, but hindsight is always 20\/20...)Let's move on then, to the absolutely asinine basketball game.  What the hell was this, West Side Story?  I expected at any moment that they were going to start singing and dancing, doing the splits in an effort to get each other off their turf. I mean, come ONNNNN.  Then, when the white boys won, the black guys said, Oh, gee whiz! and turned around and left, never to return?  PLEASE!  I didn't buy it for a second, and I can't believe anyone else did.On to my next grievance.  Norton's co-worker in the prison laundry was sent to prison for six years because he dropped a television on a cop's foot and it was considered assault.  He says he was caught because the store that he stole the TV from was right next to a donut shop filled with cops.  This movie supposedly tries to teach the viewer a lesson about how wrong it is to stereotype, but the whole thing is full of nothing BUT stereotypes.Most annoying in my opinion, however, was the score.  The music constantly drowned out the dialogue (which, considering the writing, was probably a blessing). I abhor films that insult my intelligence by continuously attempting to manipulate my emotions with music.  If you want me to be moved by your film, cut out the sappy music, and give me good directing, good performances, and a believable story.  Don't try making me feel moved by music that's ten times louder than the dialogue because you can't make a decent film.The ultimate insult in this film is the ending.  Absolutely beyond ridiculous.  Totally beyond moronic.  The kid that Edward Furlong blew cigarette smoke at is now going to shoot him in the face in the school bathroom?  Is he mentally retarded? Why not just shoot him in the middle of a police station, perhaps one full of white guys and black guys making angry faces at each other while fat cops sit around eating donuts?  At least a stealthy drive-by shooting would have been more realistic, if blowing smoke in someone's face is really an offense worthy of death.  Additionally, what was up with there being no paramedics in the bathroom when a child had just been shot? They are just going to leave him there with his head in the urinal??? PLEASE!!!!Overall, this is an awful, awful, AWFUL movie.  Predictable, trite, with the most offensively contrived ending I have seen in quite some time.  I knew what was going to happen, and was appalled when it did.  Not because it shocked me or made me think, but because I couldn't believe the filmmakers thought I was really stupid enough to buy it.What a piece of trash.  * out of *****.  Norton's acting couldn't come close to saving this steaming pile.

Usually, horror movies are never as scary as they are on first viewings. Okay, while this film isn't frightening enough to be considered a masterpiece of horror, the fact that it is effective at all, considering my familiarity with it, is really cool.Nicole Kidman's portrayal of a housewife raising two kids, at first, feels over-done; over-the-top. But during my last viewing, I began to realize that maybe writer\/director Alejandro Amenábar intentionally convinced Kidman to ham it up.You see, Kidman's character, named Grace, has been raising her two kids all alone, ever since her husband, who has been ghost for a long time, went off to war. Grace is sexually-deprived, over-whelmed by the kids, and claustrophobic (she never leaves the house).. and maybe some other unhealthy adjectives. If THE OTHERS makes a statement about anything, it is that a woman, or single parent, should not have to carry the burden of raising children alone.This is pretty similar to Jack Torrence's conflict in THE SHINING. Deprived of the finer things in life sex, alcohol, friends, an exit out of the house, etc... Jack ultimately went cabin crazy. You know the story. If not, you should see it, along with this film. They're, like, the brother and sister of each other, giving male and female perspectives on the experience of deprivation.Many of the film's most chilling moments are suggested. You hear sounds, and then you hear nothing.. and then the goosebumps arise. Then you get defensive, preparing yourself for the sudden entrance of a horrible being. Wickedly, the film toys with you. Sometimes you're shocked with images, and other times you're not. Without revealing anything, there's a scene involving a painting, hiding in the darkness. I swear, that image gets me every damn time that I watch this picture.Also worthy of note is Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's daughter, Anne. She's totally convincing as the older sibling who gets a kick out of frightening her younger brother. Fortunately, she even sends chills up our spines, with her suggestions of eerie things behind the curtain, or right beside you, breathing on you, waiting for the right moment to scare the living daylights out of you.
