It looks like a boring piece of s*** she said, and claimed that she would watch it if it had the kind of electricity she had experienced during her run, but that it had none of that. Now, LuPone is a Diva, there's no getting around that fact. As a result, the respect I have for isn't huge, but it's still there. So I'm glad that she still hasn't seen this movie because it undermines everything that makes the stage show such a hit.Visually, it is stunning. As soon as the music starts, however, and Antonio Banderas begins his mediocre version of Oh, What a Circus, you'll thank God that you didn't pay what you would to see it on stage. Madonna's lack of talent is highlighted miserably - every song was transposed for her to sing it more comfortably, and she still sounds weak. Her acting is awful as well. If anyone bothers to listen to the lyrics of the songs, they will realise that the intention of the show is not to make Eva Peron seem like a saint as is occasionally the assumption. Yet, this seems to be the central theme of Madonna's portrayal and as a result there is a contradiction between the acting and music, when in actuality they should be enhancing each other. This makes the film difficult to watch at the best of times.Antonio Banderas is also disappointing. He can carry a tune, certainly, but anyone who has heard David Essex sing the role, or even Michael Ball singing some of it in concert, will realise that carrying a tune does not mean carrying an audience's attention. Che is one of the greatest male parts Lloyd Webber has written, and is hardly done justice here. Speaking of not doing justice, I was also saddened by Jonathan Pryce. He is an amazing performer usually, so I don't know what wrong here. Watch Hey, Mr Producer! if you want to see Pryce doing great musical theatre.All in all, this is not a movie you want to watch if you love the stage show, or films in general. **\/*****, solely for the visuals.

Monkeybone is the perfect example for movie studios to re-examine standards for stamping their approval on films with no story, character development and extremely bad writing.Monkeybone revolves around the life of Stu Miley, a cartoonist who has created a comic strip featuring Monkeybone, who has become a nusence for Stu. With a beautiful girlfriend at his side and a successful comic strip becoming a national television show, fate steps in to take it away from him. Monkeybone escapes from the underworld where death holds court.With places like 'The Coma Bar,' I was laughing because it was ironic because I almost fell into a coma watching this movie. After Stu finds out Monkeybone escapes and takes over his body on earth, he pleads his case to Death herself, Goldberg, to take Monkeybone back to the underworld.Monkeybone lost all its credibility and right to be called a comedy because there are nothing but scenes slapped together to fill time. I lost respect for this film when it became clear the cast and crew were relying on stupid comedy for its success. The best example of this occurred with the appearance of comedian Chris Kattan as a recently dead gymnast whose body is taken over by Stu.My thoughts were how could the director cast someone like this; but then I remembered it was a stupid movie to begin with.I have always enjoyed watching Fraser because he has built a body of work. Fraser is a tremendous asset to Hollywood, but nobody would know it from his role in Monkeybone. With outstanding roles in Gods and Monsters, Blast From The Past and The Mummy, Fraser has proven he is one of the most gifted and talented young actors whose roles rival other actors such as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; furthermore, fans would not know it with his role in Monkeybone. I have always stated that every actor is entitled to have an off movie because there have been so many good actors in bad films and they have come back stronger than ever.Fonda is one of the most talented actresses I have had the pleasure to watch on screen because she adds so much to each film she takes part in. From beauty and charm to screen presence, Fonda has created a repetoire of talents to utilize in comedies or dramas; however, she fails to convince me that her performance was great.Monkeybone is an insult to fans, actors and directors alike because it is one of the worst movies ever made and should have been left on the cutting room floor. My advice to every movie fan is stay away from this movie and keep your money or spend it on a film worthwhile.

Just look at the list, Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Bernard Hill, Daniel Day Lewis, Liam Neeson, Laurence Oliver and even a young Neil Morrissey who puts in a good performance.  I have seen three versions of The Bounty, the one with Clark Gable, the one with Brando and this and this version directed by Roger Donaldson is by far my favourite because it is so much more darker than the others.   For one we have Anthony Hopkins as a caring but ruthless Captain Bligh who is hell bent on his ship sailing around Cape Town or something like that and the shipmen believe that doing it once was bad enough but doing it twice is suicide and that is where the film really kicks off but there are moments of tension between Bligh and Fletcher played by Mel Gibson and that's what makes this film all the more special than its predecessors.   If this film was made today with the same cast then it would not have had the same effect because it would have tried to win over it's audience with it's cast but the likes of Day Lewis, Liam Neeson and Mel Gibson were still unknowns in most countries and it was like an older version of the rat pack as they were the fresh faces coming up in the movies in 80's Hollywood especially for Gibson who just made action in the 80's apart from The Bounty and Gallipoli.   What makes this movie all the more better was it's haunting soundtrack by Vangelis.   Every scene in the film which contains a piece from the soundtrack is just spine tingling and the scene where Fletcher takes over the ship and the men are gathering together to mutiny is just fantastic.  It's not the best film ever but it feels like it when you watch it but then you take it in and you think of some of the scenes they could have included.  A few more scenes between Bligh and Fletcher wouldn't have gone a miss and a bit more on Laurence Oliver's character but what we did see of him was more than enough and I shouldn't complain.

There were many themes covered in this film, the one that stands out the most to me is the cry for individuality, freedom, and expression.  The movie takes place in a strict college prep school in the 1950's, where discipline and academics are brainwashed into every student.  From the stern headmaster to the scapegoating of John Keating (Robin Williams), this movie provided a great conflict.  Keating challenged his students to make their own choices, to be creative and expressive. Above all, he wanted his students to Carpe Diem, to seize the moment, because one day we will be dead.Each of Keating's feature students are developed well in this movie.  You see how each of them struggles to find their own individuality away from their strict parents and the strict guidelines of the school.I liked the part played by Josh Charles (Knox Overstreet).  Knox is madly infatuated with a cheerleader (Alexandra Powers) from a cross-town public high school, but struggles to find the courage to tell her his feelings. The girl is already dating a jerk football player (Colin Irving), which makes matters worse.  I feel alot of us have been in that situation before, and we feel we are trapped by this fate.  Knox is inspired by John Keating to express his feelings through poetry and a carpe diem approach.  The results are charming!This movie inspired me because I have always loved to write and was a true believer in following your own path, not to just follow the one paved out by the majority.  It doesn't mean you have to be odd or outrageous, but to just be yourself, plain and simple.I read the comments from Theo Robertson, and I must point out that not every student in this movie comes from a wealthy background, like Theo wants us to believe.  Robert Sean Leonard plays Neil Perry, the son of a working-class father (played by Curtwood Smith).  His father had to work hard to give his family a nice home and to give his son an opportunity to attend a rich-kid prep school. The conflict comes when Neil wants to become an actor, despite his father being absolutely against it, claiming it was silly and a waste of academic talent.  This conflict becomes the focus and climax of the movie.I don't want to ruin the ending, so if you've never seen Dead Poets Society, or haven't seen it in its entirety, please do!

His father had to work hard to give his family a nice home and to give his son an opportunity to attend a rich-kid prep school. The conflict comes when Neil wants to become an actor, despite his father being absolutely against it, claiming it was silly and a waste of academic talent.  This conflict becomes the focus and climax of the movie.I don't want to ruin the ending, so if you've never seen Dead Poets Society, or haven't seen it in its entirety, please do!  I have seen this film at least 20 times, and I will probably watch it another 20 times before I can no longer seize the day...

Gloria Swanson came on the show as a guest and praised Carol's performance.  And no wonder.  Swanson herself was only slightly less outlandish!  This movie may not have been considered a comedy, but Norma Desmond was certainly a funny character, when she wasn't being pathetic.  Carol played the character for laughs, of course, but it's easy to see why this, one of her favorites, was a great movie to spoof.  Max was a straight character here, but on Carol's show Harvey Korman lampooned the director-turned-servant to the washed-up has-been-star.  And this character was just calling out to be spoofed, now that I've seen him.  I don't really see what was that great about this movie, but Swanson was wonderful, even when she played the Desmond character straight. You have to feel sorry for a woman who was once a star and can't bear to live life without the limelight--Max even wrote fake fan letters.  Erich von Stroheim also came across very well, even though he wasn't funny. Cecil B. DeMille was a pretty good actor, even though he just played himself.  William Holden did a good job also.

It's like Dead Poets Society but with guns and it's set in the Civil War.   It's not everyday you'll see Matthew Broderick in a good film, well actually any film come to think of it, but in the 80's he was hot property after Ferris Buller's Day Off, War Games and Project X but Glory was by far his best performance of his career.  Let's remind ourselves though that it just wasn't Broderick who got praise out of this, there was also Morgan freeman, Denzel Washington who thanks to this got his first look at Oscar glory and Cary Elwes.  The music is soaring and the battle scene at the end is one of the most emotional and patriotic scenes I have ever seen and I'm not an American but I don't think it should matter because it makes you feel strong and sucks you into the battle as you are cheering on the soldiers to prove everyone wrong and take the fort.  The only complaint I can say about Glory is that it wasn't long enough.  It did everything to make it as compelling as any other war film but for it to be a real epic I could have done with it being longer but on the DVD there is this deleted scene where the troops are out on patrol one night and they see the enemy on the other side and Red decides to take a shot at one of the soldiers and when he does he gets him in one clean shot.  Red is really happy that he has finally killed an enemy soldier but it turns out to be another soldier in the same regiment.  The only thing telling them apart was he was a white soldier not a black one, but this scene is really important as it shows how Red becomes more emotional and attached the more he spends in the 54.  Throughout the film we see his macho performances and when they go into battle and Thomas saves his life he begins to change his act but the scene where he accidentally kills the soldier is very relevant to the story and should have stayed but the damage has been done, but it still makes Glory the best Civil War film I am yet to see.  I haven't seen Cold Mountain yet so it could beat it but so far Glory is the Bollocks.

The little movie critic that lives in my head was screaming bloody murder.Lilo is the worst child I have ever seen - she beats people up, (One of the most disturbing parts is when Stitch & Lilo shove a little girl off her tricycle and take off with it, leaving the little girl sobbing in the dirt. If you think that's funny, you have some serious mental problems.) She's annoying, she nails herself into rooms saying leave me to die (am I crazy, or is that not appropriate for a children's film?) She's annoyingly designed and voiced. You never, EVER feel ANY sympathy for her at all. I kept hoping this movie would have a happy ending in which Stitch would redeem himslef by doing the world a favour and rip Lilo in half like a phone book.Nani is the worst care giver ever, and the family situation was a horrible scenario. The worst bit was when she's locked out and they're insulting each other I'm going to kill you ect. and then later they act like the closest of friends. Absolutely appauling! This film also has THE most blatantly saccharine family values quote ever Family means no one is left behind - not so much cheesy, as a chain of cheese shops, which just may have been ignorable had the characters had any sort of believable familile bond. But they didn't, which brought the film down several more notches.Stitch is terrible, a destructive brat who (everytime we just about feel sympathy for him) blows up a house and starts off from square one. Annoyingly voiced and desgined (as pretty much everything is in this film) and with the huge plot hole (if he's adverse to water, why does he come into contact with it ALL THE TIME and live?) Well done, writers.The aliens ... don't get me started on how annoying they were. No sense of good comiedic timing or delivery (or writing for that matter). Add to this, an ending which was stupid, forced, and convientley didn't make sense but tied thngs up. I have never left the cinema so disspointed. More than that, I felty angry that Disney, who I have grown up with and cherish have made something this terrible and actually think it's good. Treasure planet was heaven after this!The moral this one left me with was Hey, it's okay to treat others like ... because Ohana means family. - Sorry, I won't buy that. I'd strongly suggest parents read some proffessional reviews on this movie, there's a reason this movie hasn't made much money in comparison to the Disneys of the past. Hunchback and even Pocahantas grossed over $100 million more than this one, and at least they were boring but inoffensive. I hope that says something. In conclusion, avoid this festering turd of a film, and if you have it and like it, watc it again having read this and see if you can deny what I've said.

Sadly, the choice on TV was not inspiring. As I wasn't a fan and had only a vague idea of who Andy Kaufman actually was, his biopic Man On The Moon was second choice to this - a traditional thriller from the director of Apollo 13. Mel Gibson plays a successful airline owner whose son is kidnapped - so far, so Charles Lindenburg. However, he has a novel approach to dealing with the ransom demand and it turns into a proverbial race-against-time (GOD, I hate that phrase) to find his son and bring the 'nappers to justice.OK so the plot sounds a little weak on paper (or monitor, of course). But it is actually much better than it sounds thanks to a solid effort from the cast. Though under-used, Rene Russo plays Gibson's wife very well - having perfected the role in the Lethal Weapon films - and Gary Sinise does his bad-guy-thing once again. The film feels charged with tension as Gibson and Sinise clash in their contest of wills. Because this isn't a straight-up action flick, Ransom is all-the-better for it and proves that thrillers can thrill without over-long gun battles and fist-fights on the top of trains. If this were in the hands of, say, Joel Schumacher then Bruce Willis would be the hero and he'd be fighting Gary Oldman and his army of henchmen at famous locations across New York. Something that we've all seen a hundred times before so thank you Mr Howard, for this welcome addition to the genre.However, the film does have a couple of gripes that I'd like to see addressed. Firstly, Gibson's character isn't as clean-cut as you'd expect and, dare I say it, is portrayed as something of an asshole. As such, I found myself siding with Sinise who almost appears to have moral reasons for kidnapping Gibson's son. In my opinion, Gibson's roles all share the same head-strong, authority-bucking instincts that audiences supposedly love. In this film, it doesn't work - in Gibson's shoes, I'm sure that I'd listen to everything the FBI told me to do and that does not include ignoring advice for telephone conversations and getting personally involved in the ransom drop-off. The ending, also, felt a bit predictable and lastly, there was too much gore. I'm not exactly talking Passion Of The Christ here but why did Sinise look like he'd been dragged over three feet of razor-wire when he'd only fell through a single pane of glass? For some reason, I kept thinking that Richie from Happy Days had directed this and it looked like he was paying homage to that old favourite, Quentin Tarantino.Ron Howard is clearly a director with talent and this is a cracking story, deserving of a modern update (it was originally made in the Fifties). He draws a fine performance from his cast and keeps the film exciting and taunt. Ransom, despite its flaws, is well worth checking out even if it is only to remember Gibson's good old days before he became an over-ambitious director with delusions of religious grandeur.

They need to see a shrink and to stay the hell as far away from me as possible. About 20 years ago I watched IAWL with a girl I was dating and she had no emotional response at all-- I dumped her immediately. It always makes me cry even after several dozen viewings. I don't wait until the end like apparently a lot of folks, I'm already into it in the scene where Mr. Gower hits George on his bad ear.
