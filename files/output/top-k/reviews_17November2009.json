Unmarried, Aysgarth excites the desires of every woman who crosses his path. When he and Lina meet again by chance, he becomes smitten. A wary Lina refuses his attentions until she overhears a conversation in which her parents speak of her dismissively, saying that she's just not the marrying type & that they will therefore have her on their hands forever. Afterwards, Lina pursues Johnny - in fact, she stalks him, tracking his movements by telephone and obsessively reading everything about him. The ill-matched couple are married in due course, but Johnny turns out to be a ne'er-do-well and a schemer. Ultimately, Lina convinces herself that her husband is a murderer and she is meant to be his next victim until a glass of milk triggers an open confrontation...Hitchcock's follow-up to REBECCA was a huge success back in November 1941 and remains one of his most popular today, but over the years has suffered a decline in its reputation, thanks largely to Hitchcock himself - for decades, he complained to anyone who would listen that RKO studio executives forced him to alter the conclusion. Yes, it is true - the ending of SUSPICION is NOT what Hitchcock CLAIMED he would have preferred, nor is the ending of the film the same as Francis Iles' 1932 source novel, Before the Fact. In both the novel and the unfilmed ending, Johnny Aysgarth is a cold, manipulative sociopath who does indeed kill his best friend and later his wife. Certainly, the ending proposed by Hitchcock - in which Lina allows herself to be poisoned but not before she asks Johnny to mail a letter for her, a letter which reveals her husband's crimes - would have worked. The fact of the matter is that such an ending was impossible to shoot in 1941, when suicide could not be portrayed on screen. A legend has grown up that Hitchcock was forced to alter the real ending after a disastrous test screening, but that particular conclusion was rightly rejected by audiences - in it, Johnny brings Lina the famous glass of milk, then realizes what she is thinking. Stunned by the knowledge that his wife believes him capable of killing her, he leaves her to join the RAF, where he fights bravely in the Battle of Britain and becomes a hero. This ridiculous ending wound up where it deserved to be - on the cutting-room floor! I might be in the minority here, but I love SUSPICION as it is and have no complaints about the ending, which as it stands is one of the most shocking reversals in movie history. Rather than providing us with a tale of a murder from the victim's point of view, the stunning surprise of the ending turns SUSPICION into a tale of erotic obsession and sexual madness. Early memos between Hitchcock and the RKO production staff demonstrate that Hitchcock wished to concentrate on the main female character's inner fantasy life early in the production's development, as several biographers have now confirmed through research in studio archives. In a way, SUSPICION may be the ultimate MacGuffin - the entire movie is a clever bit of misdirection whose abrupt ending completely changes all that has come before. Rather than focus on the problem, Is Cary Grant a killer?, a more appropriate question to ask oneself might be, Is Joan Fontaine completely insane? Despite Grant's top billing, this is Joan Fontaine's movie all the way, and she richly deserved her Best Actress Academy Award. SUSPICION is built around something very unusual in movies of this time - a woman's erotic, desiring gaze. It is Lina who initiates the relationship, staring so hard at Johnny when they meet that he becomes physically uncomfortable. It is Lina who pursues him, and it is Lina who - based only on slim evidence - convinces herself that her man is a killer. Unlike the source novel - which was about Johnny Aysgarth - SUSPICION places its female protagonist front and center. We experience the film entirely from Lina's viewpoint, and so of course we find ourselves believing that Cary Grant is a killer! and we are of course frustrated and puzzled to find out that it is all in Lina's mind at the end - because if Lina's perceptions were faulty, then so were ours! Bad vision and inaccurate perception are major themes in the film right from the start Lina's myopic gaze - she cannot truly SEE what is right in front of her - becomes a metaphor for her character's inability to leave her dream world and perceive her husband and his actions with accuracy. Instead, Lina prefers the fantasy she has constructed inside her warped mind. Underneath its lush, glossy surface (few Hitchcock films are as physically beautiful as this one), SUSPICION takes us on a dark and disturbing journey into the mind of a madwoman who succumbs to paranoia and fear. Ironically, the reaction of so many to this film - a response based entirely on what-might-have-been fantasy rather than an unbiased look at the film as it really is - merely confirms the power of Hitchcock's scenario! If you fall into this mental trap, you are behaving exactly like Joan Fontaine's character in the movie! When you change the way you look at this film and accept it for what it is, the real brilliance of the story and the ending becomes apparent - Lina MIGHT be correct after all, but of course we will never know!

Early memos between Hitchcock and the RKO production staff demonstrate that Hitchcock wished to concentrate on the main female character's inner fantasy life early in the production's development, as several biographers have now confirmed through research in studio archives. In a way, SUSPICION may be the ultimate MacGuffin - the entire movie is a clever bit of misdirection whose abrupt ending completely changes all that has come before. Rather than focus on the problem, Is Cary Grant a killer?, a more appropriate question to ask oneself might be, Is Joan Fontaine completely insane? Despite Grant's top billing, this is Joan Fontaine's movie all the way, and she richly deserved her Best Actress Academy Award. SUSPICION is built around something very unusual in movies of this time - a woman's erotic, desiring gaze. It is Lina who initiates the relationship, staring so hard at Johnny when they meet that he becomes physically uncomfortable. It is Lina who pursues him, and it is Lina who - based only on slim evidence - convinces herself that her man is a killer. Unlike the source novel - which was about Johnny Aysgarth - SUSPICION places its female protagonist front and center. We experience the film entirely from Lina's viewpoint, and so of course we find ourselves believing that Cary Grant is a killer! and we are of course frustrated and puzzled to find out that it is all in Lina's mind at the end - because if Lina's perceptions were faulty, then so were ours! Bad vision and inaccurate perception are major themes in the film right from the start Lina's myopic gaze - she cannot truly SEE what is right in front of her - becomes a metaphor for her character's inability to leave her dream world and perceive her husband and his actions with accuracy. Instead, Lina prefers the fantasy she has constructed inside her warped mind. Underneath its lush, glossy surface (few Hitchcock films are as physically beautiful as this one), SUSPICION takes us on a dark and disturbing journey into the mind of a madwoman who succumbs to paranoia and fear. Ironically, the reaction of so many to this film - a response based entirely on what-might-have-been fantasy rather than an unbiased look at the film as it really is - merely confirms the power of Hitchcock's scenario! If you fall into this mental trap, you are behaving exactly like Joan Fontaine's character in the movie! When you change the way you look at this film and accept it for what it is, the real brilliance of the story and the ending becomes apparent - Lina MIGHT be correct after all, but of course we will never know!

One thing for certain though, I adore Splash! It is a beautiful, charming and sweet romantic comedy that has quickly become a favourite of mine. For instance the whole film is beautifully shot, with lovely cinematography and stunning underwater sequences. Plus New York looks absolutely gorgeous here.The music is also delightful. The song in the end credits was so beautiful, I nearly cried. Maybe it was also to do with how it is sung; the vocals were sublime, and never spoiled the mood of the song. The script is funny and touching, more the latter than the former, but who cares? There are still some funny parts of the movie. The direction from Ron Howard was secure and focused throughout.There were so many charming scenes in Splash! The ending certainly was exactly that, and a bit of a tear jerker as well. Another charming scene that springs to mind was the ice skating scene. Not only how it was filmed, but also the music featured. A perfect choice of music for that particular scene, the Skaters Waltz. I also thought that the movie's length was perfect, and the pacing was just fine.And I can't write this review without mentioning the performances. Every single person did a superb job. Tom Hanks is charismatic and likable enough and was perfectly cast as Allan Bauer, a successful businessman who falls in love with a beautiful mermaid named Maddison. Speaking of Maddison, didn't Daryl Hannah look gorgeous here? She is a generally ignored actress, and she was positively charming. Eugene Levy plays a sort of bad guy, and he is funny as well as detestable. However, the film's humour comes from the late John Candy who is hilarious as Allan's brother.All in all, I adore this movie. Out of all the romantic comedies I have seen, this has to be the most charming and possibly irresistible. I have been vocal before about not trying to take IMDb ratings to heart, but 6.2 is too low for this movie. It does deserve a higher rating than that. While not the best movie ever made, it is certainly one of my all time favourite movies for a number of reasons. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"17 November 2009","score":"20 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" I will admit there have been some romantic comedies I have not liked, and others I have.

He is handsome and has seemingly everything ahead of him. Because of loneliness, he becomes sexually involved with Shelley Winters and she becomes pregnant. This is the ultimate monkey wrench in the works because the initially unattainable Elizabeth Taylor (my gosh she was beautiful) becomes his for the taking. Winters' character, however, wants her life to go on with his, and as far as any hope for future with the rich young woman, this would have put an abrupt end to it. The scene in the boat is gut wrenching. We get to see that he is not a murderer, but he has carefully set up everything and his planning is what does him in. All the actors are excellent. I wanted to push Shelley Winters out of the boat, but she had every right to feel the way she did. He was truly a cad and had, for all practical purposes, selfishly deserted her. I was so glad that the movie stayed true to the original novel. I thought maybe Hollywood would throw in an eleventh hour reprieve based on some evidence turning up. By the way, the symbol of catching his foot in the rope as he leaves the boat in the courtroom is priceless.

I think it is a decent film, but I admit I was disappointed. Torn Curtain is a good cold-war espionage thriller, however it doesn't rank in my favourite Hitchcock movies list(like North By Northwest, Psycho, Rebecca, Vertigo and Rear Window). I did prefer The Birds, Stage Fright and Spellbound over this.My main problem with Torn Curtain was the pace. It was a good length, but the pace was disappointingly sluggish. Another problem was the script. I will agree that there are flashes of interest and suspense, but on the whole the script came across as rather underdeveloped and turgid. There are some nice sets, but there are also some phony-looking ones, especially the hill on which the characters go up to to chat.Many have complained about John Addison's score. I can understand this, I found it nice but forgettable sadly. Bernard Hermann (whose score for Vertigo especially was full of suspense and induces goosebumps though my favourite score for any Hitchcock movie is Miklos Rosza's for Spellbound) would have been a much better choice as composer, the score in the film just wasn't suspenseful enough. I don't really blame Hitchcock for any of these problems. If anything I blame the studio. They should have let Hitchcock do what he wanted rather than forcing him to get the score changed and change his casting choices.I always found Hitchcock to be a great director. While reported to be uninterested and dissatisfied with the film, the direction wasn't too bad at all. There are some elements of Hitchcockian suspense. The plot was intriguing enough, a little confusing in places, but a very nice idea that starts off very promisingly. One of the recurring themes of Hitchcock's movies is the plight of the common man caught up in uncommon circumstances. It is this theme here, with the plot telling of a woman believing that her fiancé intends to defect to East Berlin in order to get funding for his pet project.The acting was a mixed bag. I had no problem with Paul Newman, seeing as he gave a very brooding and intense performance. I have loved Julie Andrews in films like Mary Poppins and Sound of Music, but I for one found her an odd casting choice. She wasn't bad, she was merely okay, but what did disappoint was the lack of chemistry between the two leads and the fact that Sarah Sherman isn't exactly the fully fleshed out character Hitchcock would have liked. Wolfgang Kieling is great as Gromek, the sinister villain of the piece though.It may look as though I hated Torn Curtain. I didn't, far from it. The cinematography was very nice, with dark colours and pretty looking scenes. It is one of the most beautiful looking late-Hitchcocks. The costumes are pretty to look at too. And while there are pacing problems throughout, there are some truly effective scenes. One that springs to mind is the film's highlight, the murder scene. It was shockingly graphic, and one of the most realistic and graphic murder scenes in any thriller. I was impressed with the ballet scene too. The choreography was impressive, and the music featured was Tchaikovsky's Francessca Da Rimini. Brilliant music, shame really you don't hear it in its entirety it is really something. There are some entertaining bits as well, notably Armstrong's conversation with Lindt.All in all, deeply flawed Hitchcock film, but it is at least watchable and it could have been much worse than it was. I was disappointed I admit that, but I would watch Torn Curtain again if given the choice.

It had been many years since I had first watched it, and now seeing it, it was so much more of an important film to me. There are several little tricks that work on such a great level in this film that the next time I watch it I will be excited about this wonderful film. Joe's narration, opening the film with the end of the film, the set design of Norma's house, the superb cinematography and most of all Gloria Swanson.

Coupled with Oliver Stone's Platoon, this is perhaps the single greatest cinematic take on the nature of war ever made.Based on a true story, Saving Private Ryan stars Tom Hanks as a World War II squad captain who is given the treacherous assignment to take seven other soldiers and go behind enemy lines in search of a missing paratrooper named Ryan whose brothers have been killed in action. And as noble as a mission as that sounds, the reaction from the soldiers is exactly what it would be in real life we'll obey our orders, but is one man worth risking the lives of eight? That's the spirit of Saving Private Ryan and that's the spirit of war itself. Gone are the days where war was portrayed as like some kind of an end-of-season tournament and when soldiers were portrayed as being like a rowdy and pretentious baseball team on their great skirmish. Instead of glamorizing violence and giving us all-American heroes, Saving Private Ryan depicts war as what it is a harrowing, traumatizing, unforgettably bad, soul-corrupting experience. The effect war and violence has on people is personified perfectly in a line given by Hanks about halfway through the film For every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel. The movie opens up with a twenty-minute battle sequence of which the likes have never been on the screen. We don't just see people being shot to death, we see explosions that send mutilated bodies flinging through the air, we see soldiers lying on the ground mortally wounded, spending their last breaths crying for their mothers and wanting to go home, and the Atlantic shoreline becomes red with blood. There is nothing glamorous or exciting about a scene like this. Rather, the reaction the audience gives is hung jaws, wide eyes, and a new appreciation for what our soldiers did in the call of duty and how lucky any of them were to live to see home again.Another strength of the movie is that it does not only depict war as being horrifying, but it also makes neither heroes out of its protagonists or personifications of evil out of the enemy. As I mentioned earlier, the soldiers led by Tom Hanks are not cheerful, joke-throwing boys. They are cynical, rundown, exhausted, and pessimistic who spend a great deal of their time not charging out into enemy fire and dying in the blaze of glory, but cowering behind rubble. And that's the exact same of the German soldiers portrayed in the film. After all, they were drafted into a war as well. If it were not for the war, these men killing each other may have otherwise been best friends. In a way, the movie is not about the mission to rescue Private Ryan who is neither seen nor heard until well into the movie's running time, but about the very experience of trying to survive just one day through a war.Saving Private Ryan is not only a technical triumph, but an intellectual one as well. Apart from showing us what war is really like and the effect it really has one people and nations, the movie creates three-dimensional human beings out of its characters, the story is very well-constructed, the dialogue by screenwriter Robert Rodat is first-class, and the acting, of course, top-notch. The combination of these elements gives us a representation of war that we can believe. Now when people think of war, they think of men lying on the ground dying and not grinning heroes dodging bullets as if life or death is merely a video game and they can try again if they fail the first time.This is one of Steven Spielberg's very best films. It ranks up with films such as Jaws, Schindler's List, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T. the Extra Terrestrial as some of the greatest and most important films ever made. Now Saving Private Ryan may be too gritty and vulgar for the tastes of some people, but I think it should be required viewing for anybody going into the service or even thinking of the like.

Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito.

I saw some of it in 2000, and I think I saw the rest in 2002, the year the less popular sequel, Men in Black II, was released. I think I was reasonably impressed with the original Men in Black at the time, and definitely was when I revisited it around Christmas in 2006. This was just a little less than a year after I had seen the sequel for the first time, which I didn't think much of, and knew I wasn't alone. I watched the original again last night, and have never thought of it as an amazing film, but can understand why it was such a big hit.The MIB (Men in Black) is a top secret U.S. agency that monitors and polices extraterrestrial activity on Earth and has nothing to do with the government. The planet's general population is unaware of alien life on Earth, and whenever someone outside the agency witnesses alien activity, an MIB agent erases their memory of it and replaces it! One of the top agents in this organization is Agent K. When an N.Y.P.D. officer named James Darrell Edwards III encounters a being he thinks is a human criminal but is actually extraterrestrial, Agent K is impressed by the way he handles it, and offers him to join the MIB. The catch is that in order to do so, the officer will have to give up his identity and all records of his existence! After thinking about it for a long time, he decides to take Agent K's offer. He joins the MIB and becomes Agent J! Together, K and J must track down a member of the Bug race, who has disguised himself with the body of a farmer he killed and is searching for The Galaxy, a small but very powerful energy source!Tommy Lee Jones comes in around the beginning, in the role of Agent K, and it doesn't take long for him to show his charisma. When Will Smith comes into the picture, in the role of Officer Edwards (eventually Agent J), he proves to be very charismatic as well. These co-stars make a memorable team, both playing cool guys. Men in Black is billed as a sci-fi action comedy, and it really does give us all three of those genres, with interesting extraterrestrial beings, some good fight and chase scenes (making for good suspense), and such comical moments as the outcome of an alien birth in a car and the new memories the farmer's wife is given. The car speeding upside down in a tunnel is both adrenaline-inducing and humorous, and it's not the only part like that. This movie also has great visuals, with the special effects, high-budget sets, and gadgets. Sure, there may be some fairly dull parts of MIB, but for the most part, it's a strong film of its genre, and very enjoyable for many of those who like modern action blockbusters.

I watched the original again last night, and have never thought of it as an amazing film, but can understand why it was such a big hit.The MIB (Men in Black) is a top secret U.S. agency that monitors and polices extraterrestrial activity on Earth and has nothing to do with the government. The planet's general population is unaware of alien life on Earth, and whenever someone outside the agency witnesses alien activity, an MIB agent erases their memory of it and replaces it! One of the top agents in this organization is Agent K. When an N.Y.P.D. officer named James Darrell Edwards III encounters a being he thinks is a human criminal but is actually extraterrestrial, Agent K is impressed by the way he handles it, and offers him to join the MIB. The catch is that in order to do so, the officer will have to give up his identity and all records of his existence! After thinking about it for a long time, he decides to take Agent K's offer. He joins the MIB and becomes Agent J! Together, K and J must track down a member of the Bug race, who has disguised himself with the body of a farmer he killed and is searching for The Galaxy, a small but very powerful energy source!Tommy Lee Jones comes in around the beginning, in the role of Agent K, and it doesn't take long for him to show his charisma. When Will Smith comes into the picture, in the role of Officer Edwards (eventually Agent J), he proves to be very charismatic as well. These co-stars make a memorable team, both playing cool guys. Men in Black is billed as a sci-fi action comedy, and it really does give us all three of those genres, with interesting extraterrestrial beings, some good fight and chase scenes (making for good suspense), and such comical moments as the outcome of an alien birth in a car and the new memories the farmer's wife is given. The car speeding upside down in a tunnel is both adrenaline-inducing and humorous, and it's not the only part like that. This movie also has great visuals, with the special effects, high-budget sets, and gadgets. Sure, there may be some fairly dull parts of MIB, but for the most part, it's a strong film of its genre, and very enjoyable for many of those who like modern action blockbusters.

I can see how the drama, and the various characters involved in it, might really draw someone in and move them.

This is gripping enough in the first scenes. This survival is played out through Bridges over the next fews days as he visits other survivors and sees the range of their inabilities to cope. Throughout, Bridges is asked to play with a calm that at first seems to be a blank slate for our growing into his complexity. His own complete acceptance and almost joy at having survived seems to have no down side, except having to run from television cameras or stand on rooftops screaming. Normal things, I suppose. This is how we are made to see his mind working through the horror he has repressed. But the blankness is a cover for an unresolved shock, and this doesn't unfold easily. Von Trier or Bergman or even Hitchcock might have made art out of this, but Weir can't pull it off. His earlier movies are gems of situation, of how groups of people behave within circumstances. Fearless is different in that it goes inward, trying to be about a person's mind. And yet, Weir still plays Bridges as if he were foremost a character among other characters. When we do go inward, it is mostly through his memories of the event, which are given predictable elements of fear and horror. (It's a plane crash, after all.) As for how Bridges copes, you will see either beatific gazes or screaming to himself.The basic idea is great movie material, but I didn't find the psychology convincing. The writing is stilted and worn out before it starts. The narrative is broken up with cheap flashbacks and with irrelevant and unconvincing scenes of tacky lawyers looking for money. Clichés.

The three pictures may have been directed by John Ford, but trilogy is a misleading term because it implies intention and authorship. In fact, the stories of the cavalry trilogy were all the work of popular Western writer James Warner Bellah, who wrote many of this kind, but She Wore a Yellow Ribbon especially bears the hallmarks of its screenwriter Frank Nugent.It was Nugent who really pioneered these stories of grizzled old men of the West stepping wearily aside for their younger comrades. John Ford directed most of them, and probably had a love and respect for Nugent's heroes, but he was by no means the originator of them. For comparison, check out the Nugent-scripted The Tall Men, directed by Raoul Walsh. She Wore a Yellow Ribbon shows the level of depth and self-reflection that the genre was acquiring in the hands of writers like Nugent. Unlike the previous year's Fort Apache, which is very much about the Indian wars and full of rousing battles and chases, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is not really much of an action picture. The Indian conflict is kept to the background, and does not follow a strong, cohesive storyline. If you like, it is a MacGuffin, the excuse for the real story arc of Captain Brittles wanting to retire with the taste of glory and the knowledge that the troop will continue in his tradition. In fact a lot of the criticisms of this picture seem to focus on the fact that the action scenes aren't very well thought through. This is a fair enough point &#x96; I don't think Nugent struck as good a balance here as he did in Fort Apache, and the ending in particular is something of an anti-climax.It was a bold move casting 41-year-old John Wayne as the grizzled old man in question. This sort of upward ageing didn't happen a great deal in classic Hollywood, or if it did it was usually for necessity in stories spanning generations such Cimarron or Citizen Kane. Although the Duke isn't made up to look as authentically old as could be achieved today, and his voice does not sound like an older man's, he does successfully act old in his stance and mannerisms. It certainly made more sense to cast him as a 60-year-old than as a Mongolian (see The Conqueror, 1956). Of Ford's co-stars, the standouts are George O'Brien, once a leading man in the silent era, and appropriately enough making his biggest impact here in moments of silence; and a young Ben Johnson, who looked every inch the dopey cowboy but could act and act well. As to the young romantics, I'm afraid to say Joanne Dru is simply huffy and snappy, while John Agar is just dull.She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is shot in glorious Technicolor, at a point where this became more and more the norm for the genre. Here it was probably done for no other reason than that this was the first time the independent Argosy Pictures could afford it. While John Ford's colour compositions were not particularly pleasing to the eye (pink and orange shirts on the Indians!), Oscar-winning cinematographer Winton C.

Ford was ideal for these pictures because he really gave a sense of danger to the untamed West. He actually does a better job of this here than in the more action-orientated Fort Apache. The little camp seems particularly empty and lacking in bustle. Its interiors are cramped and Ford emphasises this by never leaving much space between the camera, the actors and the back wall. Coupled with the quiet sound design, this gives the little outpost a real sense of eerie loneliness. On the open plain, the earlier shots are very light and blue skies are our backdrop. However as the situation literally darkens Ford changes his angles to bring more of the ground into the frame.

It is beautifully written and the performances are all top notch. A lot of people have said that this is a sad movie, but I would tend to disagree, instead insisting that it is more of a depressing one. I didn't dislike the story at all, but I wouldn't say it was one I really enjoyed either. The reason that I did not really enjoy it was not because it was bad, but just something that I did not really enjoy to watch. I get that that is pretty much the whole point of the film; you are not supposed to be having a ball seeing what is happening in this movie, so do not think that I am being negative when I say that it is not something that I enjoyed to watch. It certainly did not help that right before I put this movie in for the first time I heard about a real life brutal murder on the news. That made this movie a lot more difficult to watch.One big problem that I did have with this film was with the audio. During many scenes the characters spoke very softly, to the point that I had to turn the volume up to even begin to hear what was being said. That added with Sean Penn's accent made it so I had to re-watch some scenes to hear what was being said. I definitely recommend everyone to check this film out. It deserves a watch, but if you have just heard about a tragic, real life killing, I might hold off for a few days.

It is beautifully written and the performances are all top notch. A lot of people have said that this is a sad movie, but I would tend to disagree, instead insisting that it is more of a depressing one. I didn't dislike the story at all, but I wouldn't say it was one I really enjoyed either. The reason that I did not really enjoy it was not because it was bad, but just something that I did not really enjoy to watch. I get that that is pretty much the whole point of the film; you are not supposed to be having a ball seeing what is happening in this movie, so do not think that I am being negative when I say that it is not something that I enjoyed to watch. It certainly did not help that right before I put this movie in for the first time I heard about a real life brutal murder on the news. That made this movie a lot more difficult to watch.One big problem that I did have with this film was with the audio. During many scenes the characters spoke very softly, to the point that I had to turn the volume up to even begin to hear what was being said.

This is more of a Sci Fi Drama. Mission to mars has more in common with Apollo 13 than it does with Mars Attacks.The Story is solid First team that goes to Mars has unexplained problems and goes out of com. Second Team goes to save them and also has problems. There is no cheesy infighting, no lame plot twists, just good acting with a good team trying to survive. Impressive that there is 2 stories going on at the same time. Crew in orbit trying to fix the space ship and crew stranded on Mars trying to get back in to space. So many good actors in this movie and they all had excellent parts Don Cheadle, Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins. They even did a fantastic job of making sexy smart women (not easy to do in Scifi movies) Kim Delaney and Connie Nielsen. The filming was fantastic. This movie had more in space filming and space walking than just about any movie I have seen in a long time. The cinematography was outstanding. This is one of the best movies I own to watch on my big screen at home.Giving it 10 of 10 to try and get it to a better rating it deserves.
