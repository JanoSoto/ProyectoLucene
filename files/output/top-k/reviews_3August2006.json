Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead who, after a life changing stint in jail, tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) from taking the same path. The film is brilliantly directed by Tony Kaye, as he catches every emotion that Ed Norton conveys in his performance. Kaye captures the mood and emotion very well here. He makes a lot out of this film, and it remains one of my favorites. Ed Norton's performance is simply brilliant in every sense of the word. He captures the essence of evil, while at the same time providing a likable character. He plays the strong Vinyard to perfection. Ed Furlong's performance is excellent for what he's given. He's given the brooding and potentially one dimensional character, and turns it into a deep, confused, and potentially volatile young man that is easily influenced. American History X remains one of my favorite movies because it displays how racism can effect an entire family. I cannot stress how good and moving this film is, and this is possible because of Norton, Furlong, and Kaye. Beware this film if you're younger, though, because there is strong, strong racism, racial stimulated gore and violence, nudity and sex, and the worst of it all, a rape scene. Not for anyone under 17.

I've been shocked at some of the negative comments by other viewers. I was quite young when the movie came out, and didn't realize for years that Peter O'Toole wasn't the fifty year old he was playing, and Hepburn was exactly Eleanor's age at the time, so I fail to see the age mismatched some have mentioned. I'm fifty myself now, and I still find O'Toole perfectly plausible as a fifty year old in this movie. (Although, DAMN, he looked GOOD! What a gorgeous man!)As for the 'anachronistic dialog,' it was extremely intentional and would have been totally wrong without it. To our ears, the possibly more elegant speech of the period would have sounded unnatural; only by using modern language could these people sound to us as they would have sounded to each other - normal.The acting is brilliant - it would have been very hard to find any other actor who could share a screen with Hepburn without fading away to nothing, or an actress who could have done the same with O'Toole - only two of such power could stand up to one another. And this was absolutely right for these characters - as best we know, Henry and Eleanor were both that kind of person - brilliant, witty, strong-willed powerhouses. Then the supporting cast Hopkins, Castle, Terry, and Dalton. Granted, they weren't known at the time, so Harvey, the director, may not have realized right off the bat that he had the cast of a lifetime, but he surely must have realized it fast.Then there's the script. Like most of Oscar Wilde's plays, you could pick it up, open it to any page, and find at least half a dozen quotable lines. No, people aren't normally that witty in real life, but a) these were VERY bright people as historical fact, and b) it's a play\/movie! People don't speak in real life as they do in Oscar Wilde either, but it's enjoyable as hell to watch. Get over it!Some things I love about the movie are that it's made clear that no matter what Henry tells Alys, Eleanor, or himself for that matter, his real love and true equal is always Eleanor, just as he is hers. Also that, despite the at least a dozen apparent power shifts in the course of the movie, at the end, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed. And you can tell that with this bunch, nothing ever will change unless it's due to factors out of their control, like death.A matter of slight historical correction to other user comments Alys was legally betrothed to Richard; that's why she'd been raised by Eleanor. A historical correction to the script is that John, while thoroughly detestable personally, was not at all stupid, sniveling, or whining; his actual character was actually far closer to that of Geoffrey's in the script. Very little is actually known about the historical Geoffrey except that he was actually, if anything, more of a warrior than Richard, and of course, he died quite young, leaving behind two children, the son being the legal heir to Richard, and who died at the age of twelve or so, ostensibly of disease, possibly in reality of John. This wasn't considered that bad a thing, btw, as no one wanted a child as king, and John was the only one of the whole bunch who'd spent most of his life in England itself. The English nobles had seriously resented both Henry's (in his later years especially, as he tried to carve an inheritance for John out of Europe in general, France in particular) and Richard's neglect (Richard had barely set foot in England in his entire life, and was utterly indifferent to it except as a source of revenue). Also, of course, there's no historical evidence for an affair between Henry and Alys EXCEPT that I've read at least one source suggesting that Richard used this as an excuse to not go through with the marriage itself. And there's CERTAINLY no historical suggestion that Richard and Philip had an affair, although it seems highly likely that Richard was gay insofar as he was sexual at all. Bastards of royalty were a dime a dozen in those days, but NONE are attributed to Richard, nor a whiff or rumor of any affairs he ever had. Both Henry and John, on the other hand, would chase anything wearing a dress, and this was considered perfectly normal and even admirable in a bad boy sort of way. However, John took it too far, resorting to rape and starvation of wives of political enemies, and this was one of numerous driving forces for the imposition of Magna Carta on him by his rebelling nobles. Ironically, by contemporary standards, at a national level John was a far better king than Richard (Henry at his best was better, but was too often not at his best, being too bent on conquest to bother to rule effectively what he already had). However, John was nonetheless personally a rather nasty man (to put it mildly), once again proving that the best men don't necessarily make the best rulers. His personal character and actions, more than his policies, drove his own nobles into nearly successful rebellion, resulting in Magna Carta, one of the great steps in English history.Sorry for boring you silly with the history commentary - it's a period I've always found particularly interesting. You can wake up now; I'm finished.Anyway, great movie in every sense - script, acting, score, cinematography, editing; it just doesn't get better than this.

He wants to go straight--given a slightly liberal definition of that term. He's gotta get out. And he almost does. He sells his illegal business to win back his family, but most importantly, his wife and son. But he still has things to deal with, such as Vincent, Sonny's bastard son, and Joey Zasa, the rival clan leader who purchased Mike's territory. Mike also has to deal with a corrupt priest turns to him for help. He will donate a large sum of money to the Catholic Church, and in return, he will own the majority of the 'International Immobilarie', a company whose shares lie in the protection of the Catholic Church. But this is a setup.This was the least-well received of the Godfather films, and I can guess why. The fans did not have their Michael Corleone. Yeah, they had a guy named Al Pacino playing someone named Michael Corleone, but it was not the same Michael from the first two films. This Michael was straightened out. He did not resort to revenge. He did not do to his enemies what the fans wanted him to do. He was the Marlon Brando of the third movie, only not quite as memorable.Another reason I know this movie was bashed was for its acting--particularly from Sofia Coppola (other than that, the movie was fine in terms of performances). I did not like her acting, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. It didn't distract me from the story. I noticed the flaws in her performance at first, but then got used to it. I sympathized with her when people bashed. I realized that this was her first real role in a film. You can't expect Oscar-material out of a first-time actress. I felt even more sympathy towards her when I turned on the audio commentary by Francis Ford Coppola. I'm sure even if the bashers heard what he had to say...well, Coppola does evoke sympathy for his daughter.Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the technical side of the movie. Gordon Willis' dark cinematography fits in for the dark mood of the film. His yellowish hue so present in the previous films has faded, gone now into a sort of nineteen seventies vibe. And I will stand by the fact that you can have a lot of static camera, and still evoke emotion.Nino Rota, sadly, had passed on by the time this film was underway. But not all hope was lost, for Carmine Coppola had worked on the previous two pictures behind the scenes in the music department, and now stepped up to the enormous task of scoring the movie. While he did not come up with the iconic themes, he did some wonderful orchestrations that I still love to listen to.Francis Coppola's direction is in the same vein as Part I and II, which is not a bad thing. There is a fair amount of violence, but there is also some great acting. Pacino shines, as always. Talia Shire also deserves some recognition for the role she plays--quite different to that of the first two. Sadly though, the absence of Robert Duvall also hurt the movie. But the real star here is the obvious Andy Garcia--the bastard son of Sonny Corleone, Vincent. His Oscar nod for this was well deserved.Without giving that much away, I will say that this had one of the most emotional climaxes I've seen in any movie in the past few years. So, overall, this is a great conclusion to one of the best film franchises in cinematic history.

I'm sure even if the bashers heard what he had to say...well, Coppola does evoke sympathy for his daughter.Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the technical side of the movie. Gordon Willis' dark cinematography fits in for the dark mood of the film. His yellowish hue so present in the previous films has faded, gone now into a sort of nineteen seventies vibe. And I will stand by the fact that you can have a lot of static camera, and still evoke emotion.Nino Rota, sadly, had passed on by the time this film was underway. But not all hope was lost, for Carmine Coppola had worked on the previous two pictures behind the scenes in the music department, and now stepped up to the enormous task of scoring the movie. While he did not come up with the iconic themes, he did some wonderful orchestrations that I still love to listen to.Francis Coppola's direction is in the same vein as Part I and II, which is not a bad thing. There is a fair amount of violence, but there is also some great acting. Pacino shines, as always. Talia Shire also deserves some recognition for the role she plays--quite different to that of the first two. Sadly though, the absence of Robert Duvall also hurt the movie. But the real star here is the obvious Andy Garcia--the bastard son of Sonny Corleone, Vincent. His Oscar nod for this was well deserved.Without giving that much away, I will say that this had one of the most emotional climaxes I've seen in any movie in the past few years.

He wants to go straight--given a slightly liberal definition of that term. He's gotta get out. And he almost does. He sells his illegal business to win back his family, but most importantly, his wife and son. But he still has things to deal with, such as Vincent, Sonny's bastard son, and Joey Zasa, the rival clan leader who purchased Mike's territory. Mike also has to deal with a corrupt priest turns to him for help. He will donate a large sum of money to the Catholic Church, and in return, he will own the majority of the 'International Immobilarie', a company whose shares lie in the protection of the Catholic Church. But this is a setup.This was the least-well received of the Godfather films, and I can guess why. The fans did not have their Michael Corleone. Yeah, they had a guy named Al Pacino playing someone named Michael Corleone, but it was not the same Michael from the first two films. This Michael was straightened out. He did not resort to revenge. He did not do to his enemies what the fans wanted him to do. He was the Marlon Brando of the third movie, only not quite as memorable.Another reason I know this movie was bashed was for its acting--particularly from Sofia Coppola (other than that, the movie was fine in terms of performances). I did not like her acting, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. It didn't distract me from the story. I noticed the flaws in her performance at first, but then got used to it.

And if they get through alive, they earn their right for freedom.There's nothing quite like showbiz! The Running Man is what you can call a relic of the very cheesy and kitsch action films of the 80s and despite that, I thought its charming appeal still holds up very well today and it keeps running on, until empty. The screenplay is taken off Stephen King's novel, and is very loosely tied too it. One thing that shows up heavily is that of its High-Tec social commentary on the manipulative state of the TV culture. Perfect it ain't in portraying this, but it's attention to the media's fake propaganda and fixation it creates in stirring up violence has a certain style and truth about it more so now. While, there's a nice slice of satire. The comic-style action scenes don't disappoint with its arsenal of razzle-dazzle, thunderous and pulse pounding stunts that goes down well with its fun gladiator concept and Schwarzenegger's ability to fit right at home with the action side of things. Now when it came to the dialogue, don't be expecting to hear wise words coming out of their mouths. It gets purely risible treatment with many fashionable one-liners you associate with an Schwarzenegger flick (well, they do make the film more fun in the way he delivers them). He's on fire here, with pun overload! The ragged story which doesn't scrap too much off the top goes over-the-top with many holes and contrived possibilities. It does set up an interesting bunch of characters (definitely the stalkers), but it just doesn't go into any sort of detail and development to give the film more credit. The performances are glum, especially from the supporting cast. Richard Dawson gives a sneeringly, cheerful performance as the TV host Damon Killian. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ben Richards knocks down fine performance that doesn't ask too much on the lyrical side. Maria Conchita Alonso who plays opposite of Schwarzenegger is reasonably stiff. The rest Yaphet Kotto, Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown and Dweezil Zappa get up to very little in their parts. Surrounding the film is a free falling, noisy soundtrack that provides a funky boost. The production designs do look very cheap, but gladly enough it's a quick moving joint (maybe too so) where anything goes in this no-brain of a game.It's Showtime, alright!

Very few movies I have seen manage to dig so deep into my heart as this one has, and I am a critical, skeptical, analytical kind of guy---I am about the furthest thing there is from a sappy, ready-to-cry-at-any-time moviegoer!Set in Los Angeles, the story of the movie is that Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is sent to prison after a double murder that is motivated by racial hatred. During his three year stay, he undergoes changes and realizes the error of his ways, only to find out that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path that Derek once was. After getting out on parole, Derek is determined to make sure that Danny does not wind up making the same mistakes as him.Although the movie jumps back and forth from the present (shot in color) to the past (shot in black and white), it is not confusing in the least.This movie grinds and twists your emotions like very few other movies can, because it pulls absolutely no punches as it exposes you to some of the darkest facets of human beings. You'll gasp, you'll cringe and you may even cry as the movie demonstrates to you how warped and vicious human beings can become when they are consumed by anger and hatred---and ultimately, the destruction and horrible endings that that anger and hatred leads to if we cling to them long enough. One last thing---the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Every actor did an astounding job with their character, but I have to mention how off the scales Edward Norton's acting was in this movie. I mean, he has NEVER failed to impress me, but wow... to see him go from a man who is so filled with such high octane rage and hatred, to a man who is consumed by remorse and sorrow as he at last realizes his mistakes, to a much more soft-spoken, reasonable man who is filled with compassion and concern for his younger brother, and at last to a man who is torn apart by agony and grief as he fully realizes what his mistakes have truly cost him... and to play all of it flawlessly... well, I just can't say enough how good of a performance he gave. To see the true consequences of one man's hate, and at the same time, seeing that one man's hate tear apart his family---it's something that is not easily forgotten. This movie teaches why, as Edward Furlong's character puts it, hate is baggage.

After getting out on parole, Derek is determined to make sure that Danny does not wind up making the same mistakes as him.Although the movie jumps back and forth from the present (shot in color) to the past (shot in black and white), it is not confusing in the least.This movie grinds and twists your emotions like very few other movies can, because it pulls absolutely no punches as it exposes you to some of the darkest facets of human beings. You'll gasp, you'll cringe and you may even cry as the movie demonstrates to you how warped and vicious human beings can become when they are consumed by anger and hatred---and ultimately, the destruction and horrible endings that that anger and hatred leads to if we cling to them long enough. One last thing---the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Every actor did an astounding job with their character, but I have to mention how off the scales Edward Norton's acting was in this movie. I mean, he has NEVER failed to impress me, but wow... to see him go from a man who is so filled with such high octane rage and hatred, to a man who is consumed by remorse and sorrow as he at last realizes his mistakes, to a much more soft-spoken, reasonable man who is filled with compassion and concern for his younger brother, and at last to a man who is torn apart by agony and grief as he fully realizes what his mistakes have truly cost him... and to play all of it flawlessly... well, I just can't say enough how good of a performance he gave. To see the true consequences of one man's hate, and at the same time, seeing that one man's hate tear apart his family---it's something that is not easily forgotten. This movie teaches why, as Edward Furlong's character puts it, hate is baggage.

It might have not sparked up as much fascination when it was first released as Snow White and Dumbo did (apparently this and Fantasia did poorly on first release), but over time it's definitely got its place in the pantheon of truly wonderful works by the company. It tells a story that even babies can grasp- something that isn't really real that wants to be so for his creator. In fact, this is probably one of the most palatable stories for kids, about the dire straits of not just trying to fit in, but being a kid and still having to learn responsibilities, truth and courage. Of course, few kids will ever see their friends turn into donkeys or get thrown into the belly of a whale. But it's such out-of-this-world things that make the film so fantastic and terrifying in equal measure. It might lack the overall surreal whammy of Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland, yet in a small group of leaving a lasting impact Pinocchio has its unique bits.It's got about all that someone could ask for with an animated film, for kids and adults alike. It's got plenty of colorful side characters, both sweet and clumsy and goofy and smart (all taking up the animals like Figaro, the Goldfish, and especially the iconic Jiminy Cricket), as well as ignorant, villainous and evil (Lampwick, Stromboli and Honest John among others). All of these characters are so rich in their simple characterizations that the combination of the old vocal talents- meant more for direct style and appearance instead of star power like in todays animation- and the distinct look of each character, make them all compelling to one degree or another. Just thinking about the scenes with Stromboli, for example, make me think that there had to be someone that imposing and larger-than-life in appearance acting it out as opposed to just the drawing being that. Only the Blue Fairy is the bland type, drawn in the Snow White style. But then the rest of the picture- particularly for Pinocchio and Gepetto- is up for grabs with whatever can be done with them.So much emotion actually comes out of scenes. And it alternates very well, much as in fairy tales and other fantastical fiction. Pinocchio performs I've got no strings in one scene, which is one of the typical highlights, and then the next scene such sweetness gets contrasted with the defeat imposed by the evil Stromboli. What leaves the biggest impression, however, is Fantasy island, where all the boys who don't want to go to school go to, and soon enough (from Cricket's own words), become donkeys. I would probably rank that transformation scene of Lampwick's, by the way, as one of the top 5 scenes in any animated effort ever produced; it starts off kind of amusing, the way Pinocchio tries to put down the cigar, and then becomes like a child's true nightmare as we see his full-on transformation. It's an example of using abstractions that always work best in fairy tales, and somehow has become lost among the constant barrage of juvenile CGI films as of late. Seeing work like this again reminds one of the completeness given in well-rounded (if 2-dinemnsional) stories.It's got action, music, pomp and circumstance, countless chances at very goofy gags and silly puns, and somehow it all works just as well- if not better in a way- as an adult as when I was a kid. Is it cheesy at times and maybe here and there hitting points home a little hard? Sure. But I never had any dis-liking to the characters, never really felt that I was being cheated with motivations or in some kind of truth in the un-reality of it all. Not to sound cheesy myself, but it is a timeless kind of picture, with a story that when told well can strike a chord with just about anyone willing for the experience.

In this case, being perfect includes marrying a successful self-made man, since she is NOT a snob about old money despite her background, and her first marriage, to Dex (Cary Grant), a man of her own class, was in her view so unsuccessful. But the man she has chosen is one who neither knows nor understands her - views her as a trophy to be won and displayed to others, and a goddess to be worshiped in private. He is also stuffy, pompous, self-righteous, and dull - it would appear that Tracey is unconsciously doing penance for her privilege and the failure of her first marriage.It takes the forced introduction of the poet\/tabloid writer Mike (Jimmy Stuart) and his photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey) into the household (Dex, another employee of the tabloid, agrees to introduce them because the editor otherwise threatens to expose the scandals of Tracey's philandering father, and because it somewhat amuses him as well) to force Tracey to come to terms with what she herself is and what she wants and needs in herself and in her mate. Mike, involved at a fairly tepid level with Liz, comes in with an almost visible chip on his shoulder, resenting the old money that, in his view, makes life so easy for people like Tracey and her family, while he toils away writing trash to support his true calling as a poet. He discovers, to his shock, that the Lords are, despite their wealth and some serious eccentricities, real people and that Tracey is not just the product of money and privilege - there's a beautiful and substantial girl there who utterly intrigues him, even if she is a bit spoiled and occasionally arrogant. His sort-of girlfriend Liz watches this with dignity and humor, realizing that there's nothing she can do except wait it out and hope for the best - she loves Mike (and understands him), but she can't compete with Tracey's sheer glamor and she knows it.On the night before the wedding, Mike and Tracey both get drunk, and alone by the pool they take a swim and talk. Mike ends up confessing his feelings for her, making her realize that the pedestal she sits on for her fiancé is not the place she wants to be - she WANTS to be a flesh and blood woman, not a perfect statue or goddess. She's hammered enough that she is very turned on by Mike's confession and the general romance of the situation, and perfectly willing to be swept off her feet and into his bed, but Mike, although drunk and thoroughly infatuated, is a gent and simply carries her to her own bed to sleep it off. Dex observes some of this, and is able to fill in the blanks correctly, fully aware that while he loves her, Tracey is not perfect.The fiancé is not. He immediately assumes the worst, and that is more than enough for him - he wants his perfect statue, his goddess, and he resents the possibility that Tracey might in fact be human. Tracey, awake the next morning with a hell of a hangover and unsure of the events of the previous night, also fears that she gave in to impulse, yet resents it when her fiancé shows up and reproaches her, especially since by then, she has been assured that she did not in fact do the deed. Even though she doubted herself, she resents the idea that he immediately assumes the worst and realizes that she doesn't want to be the object of any man's adoration; she wants to be the object of his LOVE. So the fiancé is out of the picture.But we're still left with a wedding just a few minutes away, and two possible bridegrooms (or none at all). Tracey has a choice - Mike, a man who recognizes her humanity, but in a different way still worships her, or Dex, the man who all along has known her for what she is - flawed and human, yet beautiful, smart, talented, lovable, warm, and giving, and he has also straightened out his own problems with booze. She makes the right choice.This is a trivially simplistic plot? Not in my book!Apparently Hepburn wanted Gable and Tracy to play the Grant and Stuart roles. Despite my respect for her intelligence and insight, I think it is fortunate that she wasn't able to get them. Gable was a good actor, but never managed the apparently effortless high-society sophistication of Grant (odd, given that Grant was born and raised lower middle-class Archie Leach, and never went to school beyond the age of 14!), and while Tracy was a brilliant actor, I wonder if he could have managed the innocence and lack of experience that underlay the sarcasm and bitterness in Stuart's character, and that made it so possible for him to become infatuated with Tracey as he did. Tracy's characters always seemed to be rather worldly wise or street smart, while in this role, Mike thinks he's wise, but really isn't. Liz, his girlfriend, is the one who understands the world (and accepts it). She is the female equivalent of Dex here; the observer waiting to pick up the pieces, making sardonic comments along the way.This movie is cleverly and entertainingly written, and delightfully well acted by all involved. It's hard to imagine anyone finding it dull or beneath them, but apparently some folks can find anything beneath them. Their loss. If you haven't seen this movie, do.

He immediately assumes the worst, and that is more than enough for him - he wants his perfect statue, his goddess, and he resents the possibility that Tracey might in fact be human. Tracey, awake the next morning with a hell of a hangover and unsure of the events of the previous night, also fears that she gave in to impulse, yet resents it when her fiancé shows up and reproaches her, especially since by then, she has been assured that she did not in fact do the deed. Even though she doubted herself, she resents the idea that he immediately assumes the worst and realizes that she doesn't want to be the object of any man's adoration; she wants to be the object of his LOVE. So the fiancé is out of the picture.But we're still left with a wedding just a few minutes away, and two possible bridegrooms (or none at all). Tracey has a choice - Mike, a man who recognizes her humanity, but in a different way still worships her, or Dex, the man who all along has known her for what she is - flawed and human, yet beautiful, smart, talented, lovable, warm, and giving, and he has also straightened out his own problems with booze. She makes the right choice.This is a trivially simplistic plot? Not in my book!Apparently Hepburn wanted Gable and Tracy to play the Grant and Stuart roles. Despite my respect for her intelligence and insight, I think it is fortunate that she wasn't able to get them. Gable was a good actor, but never managed the apparently effortless high-society sophistication of Grant (odd, given that Grant was born and raised lower middle-class Archie Leach, and never went to school beyond the age of 14!), and while Tracy was a brilliant actor, I wonder if he could have managed the innocence and lack of experience that underlay the sarcasm and bitterness in Stuart's character, and that made it so possible for him to become infatuated with Tracey as he did. Tracy's characters always seemed to be rather worldly wise or street smart, while in this role, Mike thinks he's wise, but really isn't. Liz, his girlfriend, is the one who understands the world (and accepts it). She is the female equivalent of Dex here; the observer waiting to pick up the pieces, making sardonic comments along the way.This movie is cleverly and entertainingly written, and delightfully well acted by all involved. It's hard to imagine anyone finding it dull or beneath them, but apparently some folks can find anything beneath them. Their loss. If you haven't seen this movie, do. If you haven't seen it in a while, watch it again. You won't be sorry. Its mores and assumptions are a bit dated, but the humor, wit, and heart are not.

It delineates very well what it was like to live within an occupied state with foreign rules and prohibitions. Among them, the way some people do (or do not) ally themselves to the foreign presence and support it for their own profit as well as quickly give it up when that's no longer profitable. And a little of what it was like in the transition to greater freedom.Another narrative deals with the life and times of a bachelor professional musician, a cellist, who long ago had to decide between having a family OR being a serious professional musician. He chose the latter route. Since that did not require him to be celibate, he developed excellent seductive skills which were perhaps near the level of his musicianship. His caring for Kolja changes him.The third major narrative to develop is the experience of Kolja, the eponymous subject of the film. He is the child of a single mother, Russian, who is determined to emigrate across the Iron Curtain. As a Russian she cannot. BUT, if she marries a Czech, she can. Due to a realistic but complex series of events, Kolja cannot accompany her.The film deals with trying to accomplish that and its aftermaths and consequences.I thought Kolja did a good job of showing SOME of the pain that a child -- separated from biological father, biological mother, biological grandmother, etc. -- would feel and what reactions would occur. But I'm a retired PhD psychologist who worked with scores of children in circumstances somewhat analogous to Kolja's. MY experience is that children placed in Kolja's place would almost always have far more destructive, harder to handle, reactions than Kolja did in the movie. I think it's understandable that Kolja was presented as NOT having those so intensely.

It would be easy to use that formula for any love story. But this is no ordinary love story. It's tragic, it's surprising, and above all, it feels so real. It's not a story this cynical teenage film buff will forget anytime soon, if ever.Joe Clay (the Great Jack Lemmon) is a public relations man who doesn't really like his job; we see his boredom and frustration in the very first frame of the film, when he's trying at the last minute to round up some call girls for a party. We also see how he deals with this by shouting to the bartender, Hit me again! multiple times. He soon meets Kirsten Arneson (the incredible and incredibly underrated Lee Remick) and they detest each other, but after a dinner and a walk around Fisherman's Warf where they bare their souls, they soon fall in love, get married and have a beautiful baby girl. Everything seems perfect. But when Joe's job puts added pressure on him, he feels the only way to relieve himself is to get drunk. In one sad and memorable scene, he comes home late and, because she cannot drink due to breast feeding, degrades Kirsten for not being fun anymore. The pain of the things Joe says stings both of them, and us as well, and before long Kirsten is taking up the bottle herself. Years later Joe really looks at himself and has a moment of clarity; They *have* to sober up, for both of them and we the viewers know it can only get worse unless someone does something. But when they both fall off the wagon multiple times, and it becomes clear that love will not conquer all, Joe is faced with the nightmarish decision to choose between sobriety and his love for Kirsten. While I was watching this film, I kept on comparing it to other addiction films like Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream and The Lost Weekend. While they are all great in their own right, they can't really compare because the core of Days of Wine and Roses is the love story that quickly turns into a love triangle between Joe, Kirsten and booze. It's the love story and the full realization of the characters that makes Days so heartbreaking. Another thing is that we know that Joe and Kirsten are both good people; After Joe accidentally mistakes Kirsten for a call girl, he is the one who brings a peace offering and tries to make ammends, and it is evident to the viewer that during their sobriety, they have a powerful love for their young daughter, which makes their drunken turns all the more powerful. Blake Edward's direction is spot-on; This was his first big drama after being recognized for his comedic work, but he works wonders and gets brilliant--albeit unsurprisingly brilliant--performances out of Lee and Jack. Edwards also has the magical touch of reeling the viewer in, thinking this will be a breezy romantic comedy, then slowly revealing the destruction of two lost souls through the bottle. The luscious black and white cinematography was a great choice to make in a time when color was dazzling the audiences, for it works as a symbol for the darkness and bleak world of alcoholism. Henry Mancini's music is minimalistic and affecting; in the old days of cinema, it was easy to overuse the strings for a dramatic scene, but the score was perfect and not once overdone. The chemistry between Jack and Lee was genius; I couldn't believe they weren't a married couple in real life. Great performances can get you far, but a love story loses half its power unless its two stars makes the love believable, and these two really did. And the audience can clearly see that the two are in love, drunk or sober, good times or bad. This makes the last scene all the more heartbreaking. And I can't praise the two lead actors enough. Jack Lemmon, like Edwards, was known more for his comedic work. Some have complained that he was too over-the-top in his performance, most notably the infamous greenhouse scene, but an actor deserves to be known and praised for his overall work, and in the long run, Jack deserved an Oscar for this role. Every move he makes he makes believable and gets deep into the head of an alcoholic. He makes Joe a sympathetic character, and he really makes you care for him. Jack once said when he was doing Glengarry Glen Ross that You don't have to like a character, but it's an actor's job to make you care about him. I don't think there's a person on this site who didn't care about Joe Clay. This is Jack's role of a lifetime. And I'm ashamed to say I had never heard of Lee Remick before this film, but now she's one of my favorite actresses. She was a very sharp actress and the camera loved her. Whether she was a smiling young secretary or a lonely drunk, you bought the transformation and every moment in between. She had a killing smile but she could break your heart with just a look of her eyes. When the alcohol reveals a vulnerability and a need to be loved she only thinks she can hide, Lee is there, making the performance believable and utterly heartbreaking. When the last scene comes around and Joe and Kirsten are faced with a life-changing decision, the two actors are so good and so into their roles you can easily forget that they're both acting. The love is still there, but it's changed so much. The last shot, like the whole film, will leave you breathless. One of the greatest films I've ever seen.

This could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's The Thing is one of very few films to fit this criterion.I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based (Who Goes There) before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988\/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change always a mistake to usually a mistake! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm *in* the final scene again ...Until seeing The Thing, I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing The Thing, I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.If you haven't seen The Thing, and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!

John Carpenter's The Thing is one of very few films to fit this criterion.I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based (Who Goes There) before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988\/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change always a mistake to usually a mistake! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm *in* the final scene again ...Until seeing The Thing, I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing The Thing, I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.If you haven't seen The Thing, and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!

It seems to me that His Girl Friday is a lot better executed as a whole and in its parts than Bringing Up Baby. I understand that this one is the film people bring up when talking about Howard Hawks's screwball comedies, and rightfully so. But when you stand this up next to His Girl Friday, it doesn't read as well, simply because from the very beginning of His Girl Friday we know who the characters are and what their motives will be as the story progresses, but at the beginning of Bringing Up Baby the characters are muddled and confusing. In His Girl Friday, the actions of the main characters are hilarious and the motives behind those actions are complicated and human, and we understand that. Here the actions are also funny, but the motives are simpler. His Girl Friday is more realistic and human, and in my opinion that makes it the better movie.Even so, there is a lot in this movie to love. That's one of the movie's charms- the way that the characters develop from simple caricatures into people we can't help but loving. That must have been one of Hawks's gifts- providing us with characters that are just strange at the start and slowly develop into real people. Sure, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are as funny as can be, as expected, and the supporting cast is great. Some of the slapstick gags are a little stale, but there are enough priceless bits to make up for the not-so-priceless ones, especially near the end.I suppose I'll end up in IMDb hell for saying His Girl Friday is better than this movie, but I can't help it. It's intriguing to me that Bringing Up Baby is only 10 above His Girl Friday on the Top 250. Maybe I'll appreciate Bringing Up Baby more after a second viewing, but for now, I have to say that it's good, but it didn't live up to my expectations.

You do not know how amazing this movie is. Even if you're not a fan of ABBA, you should watch this movie. It teaches you about life. It teaches you the lesson of what you really want may not make you happy in the long run. It teaches you about friendships. And it teaches you about being yourself and not being ashamed. Let me talk about the last two for a little bit. I will not give away as much of the plot as I can.Near the beginning, Muriel's life sucks. I'm not going to lie. She was a loner who, when felt depressed, locked herself in her room listening to ABBA songs. And then she meets Rhonda, suddenly her world comes alive. One instance that I love is right after Rhonda has therapy for her leg tumor and doesn't feel the need to be alive. Muriel says this in response to it Rhonda's feeling useless (paraphrased) When I was back home in Porpoise Spit, I used to sit in my room and listen to ABBA records. Sometimes I would be in there all day, just to make my life seem any good. But since I have met you, I have not listened to one ABBA record. That's because now, my life is just as good as an ABBA song. My life is like Dancing Queen! This quote clearly shows how much her life had changed when she met a true friend.In one scene just after Muriel meets Rhonda, they enter a karaoke contest, singing Waterloo by ABBA. They have costumes, choreography, the works. When you watch Muriel perform, she is very small in her actions from being embarrassed. But in about half of the song, you see her to visibly relax and become more confident about being on stage. This clearly shows that she suddenly realized it was OK to be herself. Elisabeth Vincentelli, who wrote a book review of the classic album ABBA Gold, ties this scene with the success of the group itself at the end of the book It epitomizes a transition from desperately uncool to popular, but it also affirms loudly and clearly that it's okay to be a dork, a geek, a freak, a queer-you don't have to abide to commonly accepted definitions of hipness to be happy. There are worse ways to define a classic album. Very well put! This should be a movie to apply to one's life who feels the same way as Muriel once did.This may have made it sound like a sappy movie, which it is, but it also has lots of comedy. There are some great quotes, like Rhonda's response to her tumor So, how'd I get it? It's not from having too much sex, is it? Another reason to go rent or buy the movie!
