Fresh off Saving Private Ryan Tom Hanks plays Joe Fox a bookstore owner looking to take over every bookstore in sight in order to make his the only one in town. He butts heads with Meg Ryan who portrays Kathleen Kelly, a small bookstore owner, called The Shop Around The Corner. As rivals in the book business they are natural enemies, but what they don't know is they are carrying on an e-mail correspondence.One of the many great surprises for me about this film was the performance of Jean Stapleton as Birdie who adds with her witty humor and jokes. As Meg Ryan's love interest, Greg Kinnear stars as Frank Navaski, a newspaper columnist, has the sense of humor that takes this film to a new plateau.Since this movie is so good I don't want to give away many details but I can say when this movie hits its groove it gets better and better and by the time the movie is over people will not want to leave their seats. This is a smartly made and brilliantly directed film by Nora Ephron who worked with Hanks and Ryan in Sleepless In Seattle. It seems as if Tom Hanks took over the role of director in the last thirty minutes of the movie; he does a wonderful job at doing this.The best part of the whole entire movie comes in the final scene and the dialogue between the actors involved with that scene; with that scene the whole movie is tied together. This is a tremendously well-done and brilliantly put together film and definitely worth everyone's while to sit and relax for 120 min.

Stylistically, it's use of dark and light shades is exceptional for a colour picture, and the scene in which Tom Hanks guns down Paul Newman and his henchmen is masterfully choreographed. Newman's acting is pitch-perfect, and made me realise what a truly great actor he is, and credit must also go to Tom Hanks, whose understated performance outshines all of his other work. This film dares to be different in that it's message is one of hope, love and redemption, emotional themes which lovers of more recent gangster (dare I say neo-noir?) pictures are sadly not used to.

I can't really fathom why that would be, but maybe there's a whole other aspect of this that I missed.In 2013, the United States has been destroyed for about 15 years, and only the very basic technology is available. Something like the Civil War, but with machine guns. After escaping an army and pretending to be a postman, Kevin Costner sets out to rebuild America.The only bad thing I can say about this film is that some of the actors were really poor. Two or three of the minor roles had very hammy actors that ruined the scenes, but overall the acting was quite well done.The plot is wonderful. Certain plot holes exist if you pay attention (I noticed for example that everyone knows the president is in Minneapolis, although the only time Costner said this was in private to the enemy) but the overall premise of rebuilding through the use of communication is somewhat realistic and a very intriguing idea if nothing else.The woman playing Abby was great, maybe even greater than she was in Rushmore (though that film reigns supreme). The kid playing Ford Lincoln Mercury was a bit over the top, but it seemed to fit his character well. And Will Patton? A dazzling display of pure evil. As he himself says, great men make great men -- his evilness only serves to make Costner a greater hero.The music was very odd (Come and Get Your Love?) and needed more Tom Petty. Petty himself needed a bigger role, and did great with the part that was given to him.Some people will complain the film is too long (178 minutes). While I agree the film seemed long at first, once I became engrossed in the film, I would have been willing to watch another two hours of this world. You really don't want to say goodbye to Abby, the Postman or even to General Bethlehem. They are powerful and charismatic characters.Could this film be even better than Waterworld? I am undecided, but it is certainly in the running as the best Kevin Costner film ever made.

The film has a major star cast, including Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore and William H. Macy, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.Magnolia is a movie with 6 stories running parallel in a day. As expected, all the stories have some commonality. It is not the normal climax where all the stories converge, but something different and thoughtful. Throughout the movie, the pace is consistent. More of realism and high cinematic class is evident in each and every frame of the movie.Since there are 6 stories, the movie runs for more than 3 hours which may raise eye brows for the normal Hollywood Movie seekers, but believe me it's worth it. The movie takes itself the viewers in and they will be eagerly waiting where it all will summate. The climax will initially disappoint most of the people but I would suggest the viewer to research on the ending and you will realize the blend of realistic and cinematic elegance and excellence.Magnolia is an emotional drama which talks about lot of issues running in the society and with individuals. Be it domestic disturbance or adultery, it deals everything with sheer brutalism and hits you in the head. The quiz whiz kid whose emotions are shattered and unrecognized, the wife who seeks redemption for her adultery, a daughter puzzled with her distorted past, every character addresses a different set of situations still correlating and criticizing itself to the basic conscience and values.I would say Tom Cruise's best performance throughout his career will not be matched to the eclectic display of acting in this movie. Julianne Moore is as good as Tom. There are lot other performances which will remain in your heart but how could I not tell the character of the police officer. One of the most principle oriented and shy characters that will be placed in your heart forever.Editing needs to appreciated in a great deal for its technical excellence. Handling 6 stories and collaging it in a beautiful and elegant way would not have been a cake walk. All the technical aspects of the movie stands apart, take it the music or the dialogues, Magnolia rips of the society's ill fated discrepancies towards everyone's life.Of all, Magnolia will be an entertainer, practical and provide you redemption, if you have the patience to research about it to enlighten yourself.

If you have a problem with rape and innocent killing, you will have a problem with this movie.Other than that everything is fantastic. The battles are very well done. The battles have explosions, screaming, machine-gun fire and everything you expect form a battle scene. When they aren't at battle, the film shows you how rough the military is. People are breaking down, there is a lot of racism and soldiers fighting each other.While this is a great movie, it is disturbing, and I had a hard time watching a few moments of it, but if you can bare with it,you can't afford to miss this one.7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"4 September 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Taps is a film which contained strong performances and a rich plot. This is an excellent film that paved the way for several great stars as it launched very successful movie careers for three of its stars. There is nothing more one can ask for when all of the elements are there.Taps spawned the careers of Tom Cruise, Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn. I saw the potential these three actors had five years before they became fame famous because I forgot they were rookie actors. If only more films can have the caliber of talent Taps had as these stars delivered top notch performances it would a great day for me.Another part of the film I enjoyed was the plot because it is relevant in present times. I was very impressed with the writer's ability to come up with a unique storyline.Taps is a film to be treasured because the messages it sends are so rich. From the dialogue between George C. Scott and Timothy Hutton to the courageous stand the cadets front to prevent their academy to close, it is clear to me Taps will remain lodged in minds for years to come.I knew Taps would be a special film from the very beginning; however, it turned out to be much more than that. It gave three young actors a springboard to three awesome careers.
