As both a horror and a science fiction movie, it set an all new standard. While Star Wars really gets the credit for taking science fiction to the next level, let's be honest - it's a kid's movie and it feels like a kid's movie. The special effects were...hell, are...great. But it's still sterile. It's Saturday afternoon matinee. It's laser beams and guys in rubber suits. Alien took science fiction and made it feel like science fact. Everything about the movie screamed real...and that upset a lot of people.1. The premise - this wasn't space jockeys or princesses or even astronauts exploring space. This was space as resource - humans taking advantage of other planets for mining ore. Boring, dirty, and a nice reality check for science fiction.2. The crew - one-dimmensional and unlikeable? You bet. No stereotypes here at all - no dashing captains, no tough guys, no blonde beauties. These were working class folks - blue collar truckers. Everything about the dialogue and behavior rings completely true. They don't really give a s*** about each other, they panic...they just want to go home, get some decent food, and collect their shares.3. The creature - holy s***, are you kidding me? Does anyone remember how much this movie freaked people out? People could not...and still can't...deal with it. It was just the most horrific thing anyone had ever seen. It took shocking to a whole new place. Everything about it was just so disgustingly real - from the grime and goop to the slime and blood - no one had ever seen anything like. It was your worst nightmare...only worse. The thing didn't attach itself to his arm or his back or his neck - the bulbous, spider-like, slimy, disgusting thing attached itself to HIS FACE. And then, after LAYING AN EGG INSIDE HIM, the new creature came EXPLODING OUT OF HIS CHEST. Take a step back for a minute. Time and other movies have dulled the experience a bit...but can you imagine seeing this for the first time when the only horror and sci-fi you'd ever seen was 2001 and Psycho? And it all rang true, like the Discover channel's version of When Aliens Attack...the kind of disgustingly messy and painful reproduction that only nature could come up with.4. The robot - C3-PO...puh-lease. This movie is messy and disgusting, just like real life. No wires and circuit boxes. You want an android that looks and acts human, then you're going to have to think out of the box. An android like that is gonna be messy and gross inside...it's gonna be filled with liquid and fuel and god knows what else. When this android flips it's wig, his head ain't gonna disconnect for Chewbacca to screw it back on. You're gonna need a flamethrower to clean the mess up. Again, reality creeps its way into science fiction in a way no one had ever even thought of before.5. The pace - sorry, no laser fights. This movie, like the best horror movies (the Shining and Halloween), builds slowly. It's about atmosphere...and this films has it in spades. You know something bad is going to happen, but you don't know what. Instead, you just watch the gorgeous sets and backdrops as the tension builds. And when it's time for dinner, the timer goes off and all hell breaks lose...in a way you never imagined.6. The dialogue - Hey man, the food ain't that bad, Parker jokes as Kane begins choking. That sums up the dialogue - real. The characters may have been unlikable, but they were real. Almost too real. There are parts of the film, as the characters mumble and talk over one another, that almost have a documentary feel to it.Nearly 25 years later, this is one of the most brilliant, groundbreaking, and genuinely horrific and beautiful films ever made.

Our hero, Cesar, figures out that he is in a fantasy world. He freaks out. He runs outside the building, where two security guards confront him. Gunfire ensues. Lots of blood, a couple of bodies. Consider the heightened drama here If Cesar is wrong, then this is about as bad as it gets. If he is right, then nothing has happened. Amenabar gives us a moment to consider the implications, then resolves the situation.Sorry, but that kind of climactic scene beats the hell out of some elevator doors opening and a guy saying, Yoo hoo! Over here!This was a problem throughout Sky that doesn't exist in Abre Los Ojos scenes that should have been dramatic but weren't. Does that make Abre Los Ojos a fantastic movie? Personally, I still prefer his later movie, Nadie Conoce a Nadie (Nobody Knows Anybody), which I found more suspenseful. However, if your wife keeps nagging you to see Vanilla Sky, try to talk her into Abre Los Ojos instead. It's the same basic plot with better actors and a better script.

Being one of the thousands of singletons still searching for Miss Right, it is a feeling that can make you feel left out even if there is more to do in the town, which I do make a point of taking advantage of.SEA OF LOVE (1989), directed by Harold Becker and starring Al Pacino, Ellen Barkin and John Goodman, is a movie which at first glance looks like 'DIRTY HARRY meets FATAL ATTRACTION', but is done with refreshing humour and a genuine joy of acting at the heart. It is also a neat little cautionary tale for people like myself.New York Detective Frank Keller (Pacino) is fifty and looking forward to the remaining years of his life with little optimism. His partner is dating his ex-wife and the years seem to be drifting away. Things don't seem to be looking up when his current investigation brings a perverted series of murders in which the victims are male, laying face down on the bed with a bullet in the back of the head, with the classic song SEA OF LOVE playing on a turntable. Pacino then meets a fellow detective from a different precinct who has made a similar discovery and the two decide to pool resources to track the killer. They then learn that the victims all put singles ads in the personals of a local paper and decide to use the same thing to try and trap the offender....SEA OF LOVE also ushered in a new intelligence and philosophical approach to the crime thriller, which paid dividends when it was released in the autumn of 1989. Pacino is terrific and seems to embrace this part with the wit and enthusiasm of a teenager. John Goodman is also excellent and provides a suitable balance of performance to offset Pacino's evident star quality, which marked a return to form after the debacle of REVOLUTION four years earlier.

I rarely read reviews or synopses of movies before viewing.  So, I expected to see classic Hong Kong shoot 'em up gangsta film.  Instead, I was intrigued and stunned by this incredible movie.The characters are the focus as they each tell their stories.  Literally, the title Fallen Angels gives you an idea of their plight.  The film doesn't glorify the criminal lifestyle and shows aspects like isolation and loneliness.  It's funny how the killer even tries to imagine how happy he'd be trying to live a normal life working a 9 to 5.  Unfortunately, life's placed him in his predicament and must deal with the ramifications of it.  Add to it his agent (played by knockout Michelle Reis) who is really enigmatic in this one.  Her scene at the jukebox is one that displays the pain, agony, and confusion that she is going through.  Plus, that song is like joy and torture for her at the same time!Then, there is He.  A man of few words who's story may be one of the most moving.  Who could've thought a video could be so powerful and sentimental?  This may be one of the most strangest, complex, yet fascinating characters I've ever onscreen.  His silent nature, line of work (which is the oddest form of coercion I've ever seen!), and his struggles are really played well by Takeshi Kaneshiro, especially his scenes with his dad.Wong Kar Wai's direction really makes the film.

From the brilliant choice to shoot in black and white cinematography (thus giving a gritty, darker feel to the entire story, and refraining from sugarcoating the absolutely hellish experience that trench warfare must have been), to the effective use of zoom-ins, to the short, poignant dialogues, and to the generally minimalistic approach to the anti-war message of the screenplay--it all mixes together incredibly. Kubrick could have spent hours of celluloid on the finer illogical points of military court martial trials as well as on the horrors of battle. Instead he wrapped the total package in some 87 minutes, credits included.Though there were several memorable scenes (the battle in question itself, the kangaroo court, the priest's trite comments while administering last rites to those sentenced to execution, the conversation between Col. Dax and the commanding General), the shot that sticks in my mind occurs soon after the lovely German acquisition has very reluctantly and almost inaudibly began to sing The Faithful Soldier.  Kubrick cuts back to the previously heckling, boisterous crowd of French soldiers.  On their faces the spirit of superficial revelry fades away to a much stronger force--that of human understanding and compassion--and the appreciation of innocence and beauty. The things good and true for which these men thrust their lives on the line to defend.  Such evocative images are what make the many sins committed by the modern motion picture industry tolerable--perhaps even forgiveable.

I confess I tuned out and was ready to write this one off when things got too weird after the accident, but I turned back later and actually enjoyed the wrap-up. If only they could have done the beginning and the end and skipped the middle... Russell is almost always a treat, here in a very underplayed role. I can understand people disliking this movie, and I'm not even sure how I am with the package as a whole, but I was still thinking about it days later.
