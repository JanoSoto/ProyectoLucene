This movie grasps the pointlessness and meaninglessness of their lives at the turn of the 90's. It is not that they have no direction, but rather they are seeking an identity that is not forced upon them by their parents.I guess the main theme of this movie is the nature of one's identity, and the reality of freedom of speech. Both of these come together to help us understand the struggle that teenagers face today. Happy Harry Hardon, through a pirate radio station, is the voice of the teenagers in this town, and has enlightened them and given them a direction to go. Through his radio station, he simply speaks his mind and tries to relate to all in this town, whether they be a jock or a nerd. It is not the typical struggle between the teenagers here, but rather a united front as they struggle against their parent's rule.What we see here are not people who want to be fiercely independent but rather they want a voice. In years past, there was no such thing as a teenager. You were a child and then you were an adult, and the time in life between 12 and 18 was a time when you became an adult. Now, with the marketing ploy invented in the fifties, we have a group of people who feel grown up yet treated like children. They have their own problems, not just fitting in with each other, but fitting into a society that treats them like children, while they believe that they are no longer are children.The life of a teenager was not always as bad as it is these days. This movie does address the idea of youth suicide where one character kills himself simply because he has been isolated. Harry feels responsible because he was the last person to talk to him, and this was the beginning of what can be seen as his epiphany. The entire movie is him not only coming to terms with who he is, but more so what he has become. He is torn between closing down his pirate radio station and getting out while he still can, or continuing and leading the teenagers of the town in a united front against the oppression that the community puts on them.At one stage he attacks guidance councillors, and in fact is constantly slagging guidance councillors. Now, I actually agree with him to a point because I remember my guidance councillor from my school, and it was simply somebody who seemed to force people to do things that she wanted us to do. The thing that he is attacking here is the adults' habit of mapping out their children's lives. This is more so the case with the councillors because they will pick a job for the students and then force them to do it. In some cases, at that age, we really do not know what we want to do. We are being bombarded by images everywhere, being told what to think and do and not being allowed to think or act for ourselves. They claim that it is for our own protection because we don't understand, but sometimes it is good for people to grow through having their fingers burnt.I think this movie is important as it not only tries to open our eyes to the state that teenagers, and youths, are in, but also it tries to tell us that we have things to say, and as human beings, we have a right to have a voice. That is the essence of the end of the movie. The state is trying to shut out our voice, but we want to continue to speak because we have issues that we want to discuss. It is not that Harry was shut down at the end, but rather because before he was taken away, his message went out to all of the youth in America, and as he was taken away, he was taken as a martyr whose message touched the hearts and minds of all the youth around the nation who went off and followed him. It is not that we find out what happened to him, but rather than in the end the message got out. He went down a martyr, but martyrs live on and leave a legacy behind them.

What haunted, horrifying thriller of doom have I decided to review? What film full of thrills, chills and spills shall I share my perspective on. Well, how about the vastly underrated third entry in the Halloween series. This film is Michael Myers free this time around and although the William Shatner masked murderer is absent, this film strays in it's own direction and comes off as something entirely new, original and above all, entertaining. Originally, John Carpenter (director of the first Halloween) and crew were going to make the Halloween series an anthology series, similar to Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits before it. Had the film succeeded, the next film would have been a supernatural thriller about ghosts. But people were angry that Michael Myers was absent, and the anthology idea was flushed down the crapper as the series returned to it's roots for Halloween 4. But as the series brought back Michael Myers for a string of slasher sequels, remakes reinterpretations, requels, seboots, whatever, Halloween 3 remains the most distinguishing of the horror series, the black sheep or Looney Tunes character at Disneyland. But does that mean it's bad? Not in my book. Don't get me wrong, the film's not perfect (nothing is). There are some elements that don't add up and there are a lot of loose ends not tied up by the film's conclusion. But the bottom line is that this is a pure, solid Halloween flick. I don't mean Halloween as in the Halloween series, but as an all around Halloween chiller, perfect for the haunted holiday season. I watch this film every year, embracing the dark, the twisted, the ghastly and the all around cheesiness this film has to offer. In recent years, I've come to realize how unlike any horror film Halloween 3 is. This is a creative movie filled with grand 80s effects, twisted imagery, grotesque and fowl scenes of murder and killer masks! It doesn't get any more original than that! And the Silver Shamrock commercial....need I say more. It just would't seem like Halloween to me without listening to that ridiculously catchy song and seeing Don Post's stellar pumpkin, witch and skull masks looming on the television screen. Don Post is also known for molding the famous Tor Johnson mask and the Captain Kirk mask that was used for Michael Myers in the first Halloween film. Is Halloween 3 my favorite of the series? Probably not, if I had to be perfectly honest. Halloween and Halloween 2 (which I will always consider to be one movie because they take place on the same night) will always be the standout pieces of the collection, with the Thorn Trilogy and the Laurie Strode saga coming in very close. But Halloween 3 will always be a special experience for me, a horror film unlike anything I've ever seen on All Hallows Eve. Sure it has it's share of problems, but it's still entertaining, terrifying and full of that Halloween goodness I long for every October. If the film were not called Halloween 3, I think people would enjoy it more. It's the standout piece in an all around horrifying film series.

I'm pretty sure that this was an artistic decision by the director, and I applaud this idea. Sometimes throughout the film there are theses pans that I ever so enjoy, I'am in filmmaker right now and I do find the use of the camera quite refreshing. In case you don't what a pan is; it's not a cooking utensil, but it's a shot where the camera strolls along viewing a person, object, or scenery.Now I'll say that this has some fine good performances I must say, From John Hurt as the Elephant man, even to the despicable carnie owner. John Hurt doe such an amazing job at delivering his lines, for instance when he saw that Anthony Hopkins had children, he said it with such joy and I felt it, i felt his interest in what others find meaningless. I have to say this may be one of my most favorite performances ever, just in general, It's that good. Anthony Hopkins does well, but admittedly here does at times feel like a nonentity, at times you may forget that he was in the film.The security guard; at least that's what I thought he was, was so disgusting. I hated him so much, there's no human traits that I can find in him, he does some of the most horrible things to John Merrick (the Elephant man), teases him, shows him off to other people who tease and abuse him. Since this is based off a real person, I wonder if this really happened, and if it did I feel really bad right now. Finally the Carnie owner, at thought he wasn't going to be that big of a character, but the writing is so good that he's brought back in just the right time. When I see this person later in the film, I pity him. Using Merrick as a means to make a living; not a great one in fact, beating him and treating him like an animal. There's no redeeming qualities about this person, I don't care what state your in, you might as well be dead if your going to treat anyone like that.Final thoughts, This is really great for being so sad, and I don't think it's really in your face about it either. It does have very happy moments, and they do those very well. The sad and heart wrenching moments hit there mark, and the performances are good; great in fact.

When I see this person later in the film, I pity him. Using Merrick as a means to make a living; not a great one in fact, beating him and treating him like an animal. There's no redeeming qualities about this person, I don't care what state your in, you might as well be dead if your going to treat anyone like that.Final thoughts, This is really great for being so sad, and I don't think it's really in your face about it either. It does have very happy moments, and they do those very well. The sad and heart wrenching moments hit there mark, and the performances are good; great in fact. So this is definitely a new favorite for me now.

The movie is a courtroom drama, and the style is quite tight and true to form, and as such, based on the legal aspects of the movie, quite well done.The archbishop of Chicago is murdered and the prime suspect is found, covered in blood and cowering in a rail yard. All of the evidence points to him, but his lawyer, a high flying defence attorney, believes that he is innocent. The truth does come out in the movie, and it makes for quite a twist.At the beginning of the movie, our main character describes what it means to be a lawyer. This is something that I was told right from the beginning of law school. Being a lawyer means that you no longer differentiate right from wrong, you work mainly on what your client wants. In the case of criminal law - that is to keep your client out of gaol or even defeat the charges. It does not matter whether your client is guilty or not, you simply are being paid to defeat the charges. Meanwhile the prosecution is completely the opposite, it is irrelevant whether the accused is innocent or not, it is to make the charges stick.The main element in this movie is that it explores what happens when the lawyer forgets this. As I said before, he comes to believe that the suspect did not do it, and as such he becomes attached to him. There is a lot of interesting twists in the case, and a lot of things that we don't know, which are slowly revealed in the end. What we do know is that he has become attached to his client because of the cute, innocent look about him. Whether this is good or bad, does not matter, because in the end it doesn't matter.As I said before, this movie takes its theme seriously, and it tackles the issues realistically. Generally I don't like court room drama's, and when I first saw this, I really didn't like it, but after a second time, I realised that there was a gem behind this movie that I totally ignored at first.

A modern equivalent would be Robin Williams at his stand-up prime. The Brothers do indeed deliver the laughs, they do indeed contain the necessary energy to motivate and drive a production---but if there isn't cooler heads providing some structure to the movie then you are in for a chaotic hour.Enter Duck Soup.Duck Soup is a whirlwind of jokes, satire, and little cherished moments that have stood the test of time and has cemented as a comedic classic amongst the contemporary film critics (because the reviews back in the 30s were a bit stagnant). However, there is absolutely no moment in which you see any progress towards a rising action, a climax, or a conclusion. Surely there is some humor to enjoy but the act gets a little tiring even with a shorter running time. You can assume that there is a writer and director all you want, but every viewer knows that the Marx Brothers had a firm grip on where the movie was going.Marx Brothers would have been the greatest sketch comedy show in the history of mankind if they had their peak during television as opposed to peaking in stage and early post-silent film. Sadly, we'll never know. But their shtick is prime television material, but somewhat tougher to chew when translated into a lengthy motion picture. Can you imagine Saturday Night Live being 90 minutes? Chappelle Show being 90 minutes? Even Adult Swim programs being 90 minutes? It wouldn't work, even if the smaller pieces are funny and do entertain. This is arguably why Saturday Night Live movies (Outside of Blues Brothers and Wayne's World) never ever work.The greatest comedies of all-time have their best moments interwoven with the plot. Even Caddyshack, a comedy that loosely connects to the main plot, still feels a little...organized. Duck Soup is like bringing a paintball gun that launches 900 pellets a second---surely most will hit but the rest will go flying everywhere. Jokes are all over this movie to a point you have to duck and cover. But unlike their better works like Night at the Opera, the Marx Brothers never give you a chance to recover, to breathe, to be brought back to earth. It is a good comedy, Groucho Marx once again uses his rapid-fire delivery and flawless comedic timing, but the entire ordeal can be quite nerve-wrecking to witness.

Perfect, considering he was head over heels in love with Grace Kelly during the filming. His character displays no hint of this torrid affair. Cummings is perfect also as the lover who is a detective novel writer who after a time figures out that Milland planned the whole thing.

Obviously a brilliant concept from the guy who dreamt up Vincent (1982), The Nightmare Before Christmas' idea of blending a kid's two favourite holidays has attracted and sustained a fierce cult following. The basic idea is that holidays are places, and when Jack Skellington, king of Halloweentown, stumbles into Christmas Town, he feels a need to take it over. See, he's tired of Halloween, what anyone would feel if they were living the same holiday everyday. If he spent time in our universe and discovered we celebrate Christmas three months straight, he'd no doubt grow weary of it, too.In spite of being a Tim Burton fan, Nightmare Before Christmas wasn't regular viewing for me- I watched it once when it came out, and I may have been a bit young for it. Some things, like talk of Santa Claus being chopped up, are kind of freaky for a kid who, you know, still believes in Santa Claus. But as well, watching it now for the first time in years, the movie is lacking in a few areas- namely, the songs. One guy I went to university with complained This Is Halloween was the only great song in the movie, the rest was like nails on a chalkboard to him. Actually I'd say Sally's Song is great, too- a memorable, hauntingly sad tune I've been humming to myself for years. Beyond that, some songs are just forgettable- I just watched it, and I can't even remember what it sounded like when Jack decided to take over Christmas. What does Making Christmas sound like apart from the chorus? Other songs have elements of quality in them but drag on too long (What's This?). So yeah, for some kids, and adults, it would be a drag to see this movie. I love villains, but Oogie Boogie was also very underwhelming (Let's make him a gambler! Why not?). The mad scientist was a lot more interesting.Still, there's little denying the merit in the creativity, or the strange yet beautiful look of the stop motion animation.

However in the 1998 film, He Got Game, father and son bonding is pushed to the extreme when Denzel Washington and youthful NBA player, Ray Allen take to the big screen to portray a different side of the cliché relationship. Directed, written, and produced by the legendary Spike Lee, who I have always been a fan of and I can't name too many blemishes on Denzel Washington's filmography either. I first went into the film with great expectations and still was amazed by the content of the movie! The only spark of skepticism I had was the fact that Ray Allen had a lead role. Spike Lee didn't have to cast an NBA player for Jesus' character. Any young actor could have took the role but he gave it to someone who never acted before. Having a basketball player as the main character was a risk but Ray Allen came through and delivered a great performance. Usually, athletes who try their hand at acting make their fans lose a bit of respect for them &#x97; see Michael Jordan in Space Jam and Shaq in anything. He Got Game is a great film for many reasons but mainly because of the acting displays, intense plot, and the transformation of the main characters. The movie follows number one high school basketball prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth (Allen) struggling with the decision on where he will continue his basketball career after graduating and the media that a decision like that attracts along with the strains placed on family and romantic ties. Meanwhile, in the Attica Correctional Facility, Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) is spending time in prison for murdering his wife; Jesus' mother. With everyone wanting to get Jesus to come to their respective college or professional team, the governor offers Jake Shuttlesworth less time on his sentencing if he can convince his son to play basketball for his alma mater. Jake is let go on house arrest and given a week to make this happen which really doesn't seem like enough time since his son hates the sight of him. Throughout the film, the time period switches from the present day where Jesus is making his decision to the past where he used to get physically challenged by his father on the basketball court before his mother's passing. This addition really lifts the movie and gives it more emotion. What I really love is that the film really digs into the controversies of collegiate recruiting all while maintaining its main plot points and theme. During the recruiting process, lots of students are persuaded by cars, money, and other gifts and Spike Lee wasn't hesitant to bring light to those discrepancies throughout the movie. Jesus and his younger sister live in their own apartment where Jesus pays the rent but nothing is ever mentioned of him having a job. Also, in the beginning, Jesus' girlfriend tries to get him to meet a friend of her family who is an agent but Jesus aggressively declines and tells her you know that sh!t is illegal. Including this in the film was genius because it makes the movie more real by showing something ugly about basketball and not just the glamorous lifestyle and flashy dunks. Being a basketball fan, my opinion of the film may be a little bias but I loved every minute of it. It's a rather long film, clocking in at 136 minutes but it goes by so fast, it will leave viewers wanting more! With great acting from Washington and Allen, a well-polished story line, and a vintage soundtrack, this movie is one of my favorites. I don't only suggest this movie for fans who would be able to point out former NBA players' cameos and classic '90's sneakers worn throughout the film. I think anyone who loves a great, dramatic movie with intense scenes and amazing acting would enjoy He Got Game.

But beyond the cunning wit of the dialog, you have a story of a group of lowlifes, thugs, gangsters, hit men, and gypsies all trying to get the same thing, whether they know it or not. Although, its more like two completely separate stories are being played out simultaneously, but end up converging into one in the end. I won't get into how or why, you'll just have to watch it. My only quarrel with the film is, if you've seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll notice a lot of similarities between the two movies. In fact they're almost exactly the same in terms of general plot techniques. Even used some of the same actors filling similar roles. While this isn't enough to discredit this film, I actually think Snatch is far superior, it makes me wonder what Guy Ritchie was thinking.

A story about Ariel the Little Mermaid, who yearns to be part of the human world and who fell in love with human Prince Eric in the process. She makes a deal with Ursula the Sea Witch and traded her voice for legs so she could rise to the surface of the waters. What follows is a romantic story in how Ariel tries to win Eric's heart without her voice and an exciting race against time to ensure Ariel remains human, otherwise, returning back to the ocean and into the evil Ursula's custody.Ron Clements and John Musker did an outstanding job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention at the start of the film with a musical sequence on the Prince's ship, and then a spectacular entry under the sea when we are introduced to the mermaids, helped by a powerful music score. The solid plot quickly identifies the story's main issue, Ariel, who is tired of being treated like a child by her father King Triton. The issue is then expanded as Ariel struggles to win Eric's heart when she goes to the human world while, at the same time, not knowing that Ursula has devious plans of her own to control the sea. All these plot elements and twists make this a very exciting Disney movie from start to finish.The characters are very lovable and memorable, especially Flounder, Sebastian (my favorite) and Scuttles. They added humor and spirit in the movie as they help Ariel with her issues. The music score and songs are some of cinema's best work - Alan Menken and Howard Ashman did a marvelous job. Under the Sea is a very lively and dynamic Calyso-type song and Part of your World is a moving and commanding song; Jodi Benson had the perfect voice for Ariel - very soothing and serene. And, the artwork and graphics are some of the best I have seen in an animated film.Overall, one of the best movies from Disney and remains a timeless fairytale for all ages.Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"25 October 2013","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of the greater full length animated feature films that was made after Walt Disney.
