He finally got me with one Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man. I had never heard about it, but he told me that Mickey Rourke was in it; I got excited because I loved Mickey in 9 1\/2 Weeks and was hoping for the same kind of performance in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man. Now the funny thing is that I made my boyfriend watch 9 1\/2 Weeks with the smooth operator Mickey and I watched Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man scary motorcycle Mickey. But onto the movie and wither it was good or not. Now actually, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man wasn't at all a bad movie, it's better than most I would say. It's actually a cool action movie and has a decent story despite it's unusual title.Harley Davidson and Marlboro are buddies way back, together they ride their motorcycles on a care free life. But when they go back to the bar that they love so much, they find out that a bank is about to replace it unless the owner, Jimmy, comes up with two and a half million dollars to cover the cost. Harley and Marlboro decide to rob the very bank that is taking the bar away with some of their friends, they think they got away with it when they do, but it turns out that the truck they stole that they thought had the money has drugs instead. So they make a deal with the evil guy from the bank and get the money for the drugs; they just did one thing wrong, they trust the evil super duper bad guy too well.Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man is good cheesy fun that was kinda fun to watch, sometimes you need the typical and predictable action movie that just has the great exciting scenes to make you at least be entertained. Both Mickey and Jon seemed to have a lot of fun together and I would say clicked very well. I loved how Marlboro was trying to teach Harley how to shoot his gun, and well, it comes in handy at the end to actually make for some dark comedy jokes, but I'm not going to tell you what happens. I think I would recommend Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man for those who just want entertainment, it's a fun action movie.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 September 2007","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Recently my boyfriend has been trying to stump me with movies, since I've seen so many, he wanted to know there was at least one movie that I'd never seen but he did.

All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre.The introduction of the first game is quite exciting, showing us all the cinematic importance of the game with a man stepping into a corridor, being attacked by something unknown and the name RESIDENTE EVIL appearing in the screen in red blood. Then, the game opening shows how everything started. Of course the actors were a lot like amateurs but it was innovative and frightening for a game those disturbing scenes till the game finally starts into a hall in an anywhere mansion. The main characters of the game were Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers. This brief description of the game is just to make clear how the movie starts as a completely mess.I think that, to say something about this movie, we have to say if from 2 different point of views as a game player and as a non game player.As a game player I couldn't understand why they have changed all the original plot of the game. None of the original characters was there and all the interesting facts of the game have been totally ignored. All of the original game characters had different and well defined personalities and each one of them have its importance during the game story, something that do not happen in the movie for the fact that Alice is the main character and everything surrounds her. The cinematic importance of the game has been completely forgotten in the movie and all the frightening atmosphere of the game was totally lost. For a first impression, I liked the fact of Milla Jovovich as the main character just for the fact that she's not a box office name but she's an action star and a name needed for the movie's success, but she is an awful actress. Her face is always the same from the beginning to the end in each movie she's cast, with no exception. But what I keep asking myself is Why Alice as the main character? Why all that stuffs about a girl suffering from amnesia, The Red Queen and The Hive, when we already had an interesting plot from the original game?.The game plot involve a group of special agents that are lost into somewhere full of all kind of monsters that, in fact, are zombies from a genetic experience accident by a part of the Umbrella Co. that's hidden under a mansion for its illegal studies content. This is also an interesting plot for an action movie because it's simple, original, understandable and full of action (that's what action movies is all about). And why did they had to make something so complex in the worst way? But the worst thing is that they did something so strangely complex that's almost impossible to insert the original characters during the movie or in its sequels. So, as a game player this is an awful adaptation.As a non game player I could find the movie quite funny. The movie starts well giving a detailed explanation about the happenings over the Umbrella Co. until the virus takes control of everything. The zombies are interesting because jumps over your eyes that all zombies are people not dressed well with dirty make up. That thing about Milla recovering from an amnesia all, discovering her fighting techniques under pressure situations are so def that is hugely laughable. It's laughable because it's a common situation in the history of action movies and very few of them made it quite well as The Bourne Trilogy. It's also laughable because it's not in a movie called Resident Evil that that situation would be taken seriously from the writers and the audience. Milla Jovovich, as said before, is one of the worst famous actress of history and I can't understand why people like her so much as she isn't an actress because she's never acting. She's always looking with the same way, she's always with her mouth half-open when she's amazed, frighten, happy, sad... and she's always shaking her jaw when she has something quite important to say as you'll die! I liked some scenes that I don't remember by now because they were too short. Lot of people hated the final scene, claiming that it was a scene for a predictable sequel, but I liked it a lot and I think that it's the kind of impressive scene I was waiting for during entire movie and it's the first time when you can finally realize the complete chaos and destruction that Umbrella Corporation caused and how it should be if something like that happened in real life. So, as a non game player I had an enjoyable time watching that movie but it could be a lot better.That's sad. The movie suffers from improvement failures over the potentials of the game, and the game (and also the fans) suffers under this awful adaptation.

However let me be self-perception, not that substantive to give all the elements of the movie the words they deserve, to have the time to talk about my great OBSESSION; the most seditious, magical and childish (Cherie).. My yummiest female star of all times (Marilyn Monroe).Despite what is always said about her weakness as an actress (which is often true), this movie proves how talented in comedy she was, and how her performance had progressed over the years even if they were a few years. (Monroe) wanted to be a star and OH BOY she inherently was, she did it to the extent that she still is big one till now, but she wanted also to be a good actress and she fulfilled part of that dream but unfortunately all the dreams ended at 5 August 1962 in her Brentwood home !In (Bus Stop - 1956) she makes her role so cutely effective by her real sense of innocence with that childish sprite, and all of this (for sure !) through her genius inherent sexiness.. WAW.The first title of the movie was (The Wrong Kind of Girl) but believe me she was the right ideally to make this movie THAT eternal. As for me I didn't like her singing in here though I liked watching her in singing ! Simply because HER outstanding movements which were a real Old Black Magic! So I hate the end also for being too easy and very theatrical. But on the other hand I've liked so many things of that movie mostly come from the side of Marilyn  her scene when she was talking about her own dreams as miserable but ambitious, optimistic and happy about that she actually had aspirations.. happy about her being dreaming !, I liked also her being alarmed with this sexually raved boy's chase and his madness over her so at the scene when he put the rope around her before she gets into the bus like he caught her as a hunter I just laugh a lot (this crazy kid did what we all wanted to do for a long time !).Some moments were so humorous when you had the chance to see (Marilyn) and Marilyn only in such events  her running at the competition's stadium, (Bo) cuts her dress's tail accidentally (that was one hell of a sexy event as well as a HOT shot !) and what a performance she did after by saying beautifully angry I hate you and I despise you! Now give me back my tail, a journal's photographer requests Marilyn for taking a photo then we discovered that he wanted a photo for her butt ! Undoubtedly one of the greatest (comic situations, scenes, butts !), (Don Murray) reading the constitution to (Marilyn) when she was sleeping naked under sheets (or trying to sleep) she was so soft, tender, funny and SEXY.. historical SEXY !, and who can forget her scene in the bus when she was forced to change her costume and had to tell a warning to a young boy looks at her; this little scene was too sexy as for me when i've watched the movie for the first time (I was at the age of that boy by the way !). I loved also one of the main posters (with Murray encompasses Marilyn lewdly) it's so naughty and compared to (The Out Law)'s one of the great fuss 10 years earlier.. It's not only more bolder but also bold to the utmost degree noticing the 1950s measures, and as for me it's one of the boldest ever !By the enjoyment's measure as a whole movie starring M.M it isn't up to the level of (Some Like it Hot), or (The Seven Year Itch) from the same screenplay writer. But HEY.. This is a good movie after all which I had so much fun out of watching it with too many memories. So because of this delectable memorable (Cherie), and those previous moments it's a classic for Marilyn's lovers and maybe for the romantic comedy's fans.

The opening sequences of this movie lasts for about 13 minutes. It seems like its one big long take but there are some hidden cuts in it. Most people that are really into movies will notice some of the cuts. De Palma uses some good editing tricks and crafty cinematography. It also makes the opening the highlight of the movie. Of course you can wonder if its really wise and good for a movie to have its best moment in the beginning. Everything that comes after it just doesn't match up to it and it might very well be the reason why this movie disappointed many people.I really like it how the same events are told throughout the movie from different viewpoints. It sheds now light on the truth and helps to unveil the story and plot. That's some great film-making! It also makes the movie a very original one in its sort.Yes, the movie gets at points hard to follow, mainly because it isn't always credible what's happening on the screen. Nevertheless, I remember the first time I saw the movie that the twists in it surprised me and the story was a great mysterious one.Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise are really strong actors in this movie. It takes some skill to handle all those long scene's without messing up and staying consistent. Especially Gary Sinise is great but I think that Nicolas Cage is also under-appreciated in his role. You are supposed to sort of dislike him, I mean he really isn't a clean cop, and that's what I like about the character and Cage's his performance.I also enjoyed the musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto. It's totally overblown and out of proportion but it suits the movie and its style really well. Same of course goes for the cinematography.It's basically a very stylish and originally made movie, like you would expect from Brian De Palma. It's obviously not his most expensive movie because most of the movie is set at one location and it also isn't the longest movie around. It makes this an enjoyable 'small' De Palma movie that's also perfectly watchable for the general public. The movie is made in the sort of style they also used to make '40's movies in. I especially like the use of shadows in this movie. De Palma is, as far is I know of, the only director who can successfully implement '40's movie-making style into modern film-making. It's a good looking movie with a style that captures you and sort of makes you forgive the inconsistencies and flaws in the story. However if you also look beyond this style you'll notice that the story and its thriller elements are all quite standards and nothing really really. Just the way it all is dressed is new! So yes, it's a case of style over substance, like often is the case with De Palma movies.

I was shown this movie a couple years later, in my first high school English class. I can't remember exactly what I thought at the time (I guess I thought it was so-so), but I have seen it twice since then, and can't say it reached its full potential, but overall, it's still a reasonable adaptation.Ponyboy Curtis and Johnny Cade are two teenagers who are members of the greaser gang. Their rivals are the socs. One night, Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in a vacant lot. When they wake up, it is still dark, and they are clueless as to what time it is. Ponyboy goes home, where his eldest brother, Darry (who has looked after his two younger brothers, Ponyboy and Sodapop, since their parents' tragic death), has been worrying about his absence. Darry ends up hitting Ponyboy, and although he then says he didn't mean it, Ponyboy runs away. Pony wakes up Johnny, who is still in the lot, and they go to the park. Unfortunately, they are attacked by a group of Socs, who nearly drown Ponyboy, but Johnny comes to the rescue by killing one of them, and causing the others to run off! To try and avoid arrest, the two leave town, after getting directions from fellow greaser Dallas Dally Winston, who tells them to go to an abandoned church in Windrixville. What does the future hold for these two?! One problem with this movie is that some scenes seem a bit rushed, such as the scene where Darry hits Ponyboy and he runs away. Also, the acting isn't that great, at least not from C. Thomas Howell (who plays Ponyboy) and Ralph Macchio (who plays Johnny). Mainly for those two reasons, some parts of the film are not as gripping as they should be. Fortunately, this adaptation of The Outsiders also has its merits. It's a faithful adaptation (it probably helped that S.E. Hinton was a consultant), despite not including certain parts of the book, which some would be disappointed by. It also includes at least some of the tension and poignancy from the book, and gets more gripping towards the end.Overall, Francis Ford Coppola and Kathleen Rowell did a good job bringing S.E.

For those who have been blown away by the book, I wouldn't expect this movie to be all you could possibly hope for, or else you could easily end up sorely disappointed.

The entire movie was scored before even a single frame was shot, and Sergio Leone liked it so much that he had portions played for the actors while rehearsing to get them to 'flow' with the music. One could go so far as to say that a good part of the picture was filmed to the score! It took me a long time to get around to this film, but it was certainly worth the wait. Any movie that opens with Jack Elam and Woody Strode has got to get your attention, but when their characters didn't survive the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be something special. Actually, having seen Elam in countless movies and TV Western episodes, I can safely say that this is the best performance I've ever seen him in. His sparring with the fly to the omnipresent creak of the windmill was an inspired piece of work, and if you didn't know anything about the story going in, you would think that these players would have a major role in the story to come. And then Bronson appears! And then Henry Fonda appears. Curiously, his character's name was Frank. It didn't take until the end of the movie to make the connection to Frank James, brother of outlaw Jesse, and the character Fonda portrayed in two much earlier movies - 1939's Jesse James, and the sequel, 1940's The Return of Frank James. It made me wonder if Sergio Leone's original script named the character Frank, or if it was a result of getting Fonda for the part. It's no secret that Leone had been after Fonda to appear in one of his Westerns for a few years, with Fonda declining because every script he ever read was in Leone's fractured English. Fonda eventually relied on friend Eli Wallach's (Tuco\/The Ugly in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) advice, who said he would have the time of his life.More than most, this is a Western that in turn, defines and is defined by the music. Even Bronson's character is called Harmonica, and his tunes are played to haunting effect. They mask a much deadlier nature to the quiet stranger - He not only plays, he can shoot too.It took me a bit into the story to figure out it was Jason Robards under the beard of Cheyenne. I think it was interesting the way his character was written, leaving it ambiguous whether he was a lawman or an outlaw. The bigger surprise though had to do with a female character in the lead role, capably performed by Claudia Cardinale. She manages to arc through a wide range of characterizations throughout the story as situations call for, holding her own well against each of the male principals.This is certainly a film I'll have to watch a few more times for some of the points noted above. In particular, the single scene I could watch over and over, one that is inextricably linked with it's musical score, is Fonda's death scene set to the strain of Morricone's dying harmonica. Not only creative, but as effective as any finale in a Western I can think of.As a final thought, I was considering how Sergio Leone could have used the title The Good, The Bad and The Ugly for this movie if it hadn't already been taken by another one of his legendary classics. But then again, Robards wasn't that ugly.

It's no secret that Leone had been after Fonda to appear in one of his Westerns for a few years, with Fonda declining because every script he ever read was in Leone's fractured English. Fonda eventually relied on friend Eli Wallach's (Tuco\/The Ugly in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) advice, who said he would have the time of his life.More than most, this is a Western that in turn, defines and is defined by the music. Even Bronson's character is called Harmonica, and his tunes are played to haunting effect. They mask a much deadlier nature to the quiet stranger - He not only plays, he can shoot too.It took me a bit into the story to figure out it was Jason Robards under the beard of Cheyenne. I think it was interesting the way his character was written, leaving it ambiguous whether he was a lawman or an outlaw. The bigger surprise though had to do with a female character in the lead role, capably performed by Claudia Cardinale. She manages to arc through a wide range of characterizations throughout the story as situations call for, holding her own well against each of the male principals.This is certainly a film I'll have to watch a few more times for some of the points noted above. In particular, the single scene I could watch over and over, one that is inextricably linked with it's musical score, is Fonda's death scene set to the strain of Morricone's dying harmonica. Not only creative, but as effective as any finale in a Western I can think of.As a final thought, I was considering how Sergio Leone could have used the title The Good, The Bad and The Ugly for this movie if it hadn't already been taken by another one of his legendary classics. But then again, Robards wasn't that ugly. ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"23 September 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When composer Ennio Morricone first got the script for Once Upon A Time In The West, he was so impressed with the story that he began writing the music for it immediately. The entire movie was scored before even a single frame was shot, and Sergio Leone liked it so much that he had portions played for the actors while rehearsing to get them to 'flow' with the music. One could go so far as to say that a good part of the picture was filmed to the score! It took me a long time to get around to this film, but it was certainly worth the wait. Any movie that opens with Jack Elam and Woody Strode has got to get your attention, but when their characters didn't survive the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be something special. Actually, having seen Elam in countless movies and TV Western episodes, I can safely say that this is the best performance I've ever seen him in. His sparring with the fly to the omnipresent creak of the windmill was an inspired piece of work, and if you didn't know anything about the story going in, you would think that these players would have a major role in the story to come. And then Bronson appears! And then Henry Fonda appears. Curiously, his character's name was Frank. It didn't take until the end of the movie to make the connection to Frank James, brother of outlaw Jesse, and the character Fonda portrayed in two much earlier movies - 1939's Jesse James, and the sequel, 1940's The Return of Frank James.

What a great film this was- there was good acting, a good script, unexpected moments of hilarity- and best of all this film stayed close to the book. Many of the characters' lines in the movie are directly from the book. If you are a fan of S.E. Hinton and her writings, you won't be disappointed by it. In my mind, Tex was even better than The Outsiders, at least in terms of the movies. Matt Dillon is superb as Texas McCormick, a quiet, somewhat immature teenager living in Oklahoma, the usual setting for Hinton's books. There are few moments in the film (don't worry, I won't give them away) that were extremely funny. However, not only is the humor entertaining in the movie, but the drama is well done too. Tex faces changes at home, with his friends Johnny and Jamie, and at school, and the result makes for a captivating story line. The selection for the supporting cast is right on in almost every case- Jim Metzler plays Tex's brother Mason, who has to tend for his younger brother while also looking ahead to college and his own future. Emilio Estevez is Tex's spunky friend Johnny and Meg Tilly is Johnny's independent-minded sister Jamie, the object of Tex's affections. Even the filming and quality of the movie is not bad, considering that it was made two decades ago. The music is usually fitting in each scene, and the script came off sounding realistic and genuine. All in all, this is a movie well worth checking out. I think the only thing wrong with this movie is the rating it received; there's probably enough swearing in this movie to have earned it a PG-13 rating. Highly recommended.

The first 20 minutes are the most intense and graphic depictions of war I have seen. The D-day beach assaults will never be recreated so elegantly ever again. The noise, carnage, and chaos overwhelms and deeply disturbs the viewer. Unlike anything I have ever seen.So far through the film you have been following Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) and his company on the beaches of Normandy. After the intense battle the US Army counts its dead. Three brothers were killed on that same day in Normandy. The 4th and youngest brother is James Francis Ryan(Matt Damon), and he is not reported dead but his whereabouts are unknown. Private Ryan is a paratrooper who jumped behind enemy lines as a paratrooper the night before the landings. He is the last of the sons that his mother still has. The army wants him found and brought back home to safety. Captain Miller is now given this task to find Private Ryan and bring him to safety.Captain Miller now travels across battle torn French country side to find Private Ryan. But he does not travel alone. He travels with seven of his own hand picked men from his company. On their journey they face hard struggles. The mission becomes deadly and now the question is why risk the lives of eight men to save the life of one? The men do finally find Private Ryan but Ryan does not want to abandon his fellow comrades who he has been fighting and holding out with. So now Captain Miller and his men stay with Ryan and the troops he has been fighting with in this bombed out town waiting to hold out until relief arrives. The Germans are advancing on the town with many more troops and with tanks. Captain Miller and the rest of the men are vastly outnumbered but are going to try to hold on. What develops is one of the most graphic and disturbing final stands I have ever seen in a war movie.Spielber masterfully directed the battle sequences. The battle scenes attacked your senses. The special effects were mind boggling to say the least. The scenes were so realistic and brutally graphic. So much blood and carnage that truly disturbs the viewer. War is shown as what it is. Nasty!!!!!!!!! The acting was very good all around except from I think Matt Damon. But Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze me as he turns out one great performance. The film also stars Tom Sizemoore and Edward Burns as part of the rescue mission. Throughout the film there are many great cameos from actors like Paul Giamatti and even Ted Danson. Overall the acting was very good.The dialog was for the most part realistic but at some parts not as much. Captain Miller's character seemed to know to much about all the other operations that were happening in France. And some of the lines, although not many, were a little cliché.I felt the film to be a little biased towards the Americans which I hate to see in movies. Spielberg seemed to convey the Germans as evil jerks. German soldiers were just like the American soldiers. There is a difference between the German Army and the Nazi SS. So I was ashamed to see the German soldiers representing evil. War should represent evil, not German soldiers. Both sides are committing unforgiving violence. Not just the Germans.Saving Privazte Ryan is a very good film. Everyone should at least experience it once, especially if you are a WW2 buff. Very educational!

Its very well made, and since its a reference to things past, its even more powerful now than 30 years ago. That's three times longer than the distance from when it was made to the period to which it refers.When I saw it, I wondered why it worked so well, and I believe it had something to do with the way the episodes are linked. Sure, they're linked by cars, but deeper than that they are linked by the shared world they inhabit served up through the car radios. All the stories are built on this spine; all the references to ideals are ideals that come through the radio.Here's what I subsequently learned one of the writers used explicitly what I am calling folding to give the thing power. Just as we are expected to let the film seep into our world and tie together episodes we carry &#151; and just as this film is intended to supply small stories as target stories for life... so is the radio show within the story. Its designed that way, so as we see the radio show influence, even create parts of the world for who we see, the movie automatically inherits that role, more deeply for us.Its why we had to have that episode about the blond in the T-bird, unapproachable, and finally left behind by the smart guy who &#151; in order for the folding to work &#151; becomes the writer-in-LA, who presumably pens what we have seen.Its a simple example of the technique. Oh, there are complex elaborations, like the business about Wolfman Jack not being real but in tape.Powerful, still powerful.The writers wanted to include the women in the report on futures at the end, so here goes.Carol tried serial marriage, laconic suicide, and lazy adventure. She's a substance abuser, and has been since two years after we see her. She still has the gearshift knob and appeared with it in a porn video in 1984. When clean, she is a highly sought speaker on lucid feminism, and has three bestsellers.Debbie attached herself to four successful artists, each of whom left her on their success.

De Palma has a real flair for visuals, and this always shone through despite the fact that the vast majority of his older films were merely Hitchcock rip offs. Sometimes, however, I wonder what I see in this director; as while he's certainly made some excellent stuff, he's also made crap like Mission to Mars, The Bonfire of the Vanities and Snake Eyes. Snakes Eyes certainly had the potential to be an excellent little thriller; it's claustrophobic and the plot could have lead into an excellent mystery, but De Palma seems more interested in overhead tracking shots than actually telling a story. The plot focuses on an assassination at a boxing match. Corrupt copper Ricky Santoro has been invited to watch the action by his army friend, Commander Kevin Dunne, but soon finds himself in the middle of a murder mystery when the Secretary of Defence is taken out by an unseen assailant. After beginning an investigation, Santoro soon finds that the truth is buried deeper than he thought...Nicholas Cage has made a handful of good films, this isn't one of them, and it's not one of his better performances either. Cage overacts to such a ridiculous extent that it soon becomes painful to watch, and the fact that the plot takes many equally ridiculous turns doesn't really help much either. It's unbelievable just how many problems there is with this plot - there's actually more plot holes than plot points! De Palma doesn't seem to care about whether or not what's happening actually makes sense, just so long as it means he can move on to the next part of the film, and this soon gets tiresome. The way that De Palma uses metaphor is obviously meant to be intelligent (e.g. the bloody dollar bill on the floor, the whole 'snake eyes' thing), but it seems that nobody explained to him that this sort of thing only works if it's subtle! I had actually had more fun pointing out all the things that are wrong with this film than watching it, and that's never going to happen when watching a GOOD film. Overall, Snake Eyes is completely ridiculous, lacking in tension and interest and too stylish for its own good. I had fun laughing at it, but it's certainly not recommended.

His twisted sister Catherine, whose ultimate fantasy is to do it with her brother. (Cruel Intentions anyone ??) Then we have the innocent yet stupid Janey Briggs, a girl whom almost everyone considers to be un-date-able. Her sex maniac brother Mitch and his two friends Bruce and Ox. Jake's witty linguistic friends, Austin, the mighty Reggie Ray and the insanely funny Black guy Malik.(This is so much like Varsity Blues) Then there's Jake's ex girl friend Priscilla and her weird boy friend Les. (American Beauty). Plus there's a multitude of other small characters who make this movie more colorful and hysterically funny.The plot is pretty simple, considering that the central plot is almost a rip off from the movie Can't Hardly Wait.

I love the cooking but hate the restaurants. French is one of the great languages of the world, but I find the French attitude to it xenophobic. Yet there is one thing that always stirs my passion. I admire them for it. I wish we had an ounce of it in Britain.The best known examples of course are the film protests in 1968 &#150; a time when everyone was protesting about everything. But they helped, indirectly, to restore the international prestige of French cinema. When Baise-Moi was banned shortly after release in 2000, there were spontaneous street protests. Now this is a bit different &#150; the film's artistic merits or lack of them are still a matter of debate. But I take my hats off to the French. I would love to see the British protest in the name of cinematic freedom. (The ban was eventually lifted after separate protests signed by Parisian intellectuals.)As you will already have guessed, the issues around this film are complicated. And they get worse. There is a tendency to react emotively to any highly charged sexual issues. This tendency can maybe blind us somewhat when it comes to analysing more important ones.This is a film made by women, about women living on the fringes of society. I was once importunate enough to argue with acclaimed filmmaker Gaspar Noé (after a public screening of Irreversible) that his film didn't address the issue of rape as well as Baise Moi. I still believe that, although Irreversible is a landmark film for other reasons entirely. Most films about rape follow male-orientated story lines. They often emphasise the purely physical, violence-aspect (as in Irreversible) or have a strong woman seeking and finding redress (as in The Accused). The reality is that most rape victims are traumatised mentally and emotionally. Physical hurt as a result of violence is no less an issue, but a separate one. Although The Accused looks at some of the metal trauma, it ultimately plays out as a success story. Few rape victims take on such a masculinised determination to succeed against the odds. Odds which are still stacked against the victim.What I liked about Baise-Moi is that it eschews the woman-survivor scenario for a more realistic picture of lasting psychological damage. Films that show the real horror of rape may discourage it more than ones that show women 'getting over it.' One of the victims of rape in Baise-Moi actually 'lets' her assailants get on with it, commenting to her friend afterwards that at least they didn't wind up dead. The rape (and the violence) of Baise-Moi convinced me that she probably hedged her bets wisely. Her lack of struggle didn't, in my mind, make her any the less a victim. And neither did the unpleasant fact that she was a part-time prostitute make her any more 'deserving.' This is something that it is not easy to live with. As a society, we have moved past the point where a girl in a short skirt acting flirtatiously (The Accused) is 'asking for it' or 'deserving of rape.' But where is our cut-off point? The marginals in society are often seen as dispensable. No-one wants to acknowledge them &#150; least of all mainstream filmmakers. Yet they can be just as much victims.Another thing I like about Baise-Moi is that the two girls that form a bond and go on a road trip are fully developed as characters. Like most young women, they enjoy having a good time and going after boys. But they have been mentally scarred. One of them has been brutally gang-raped and the other has watched her only friend being killed. They are not 'good girls gone bad'. They are fairly 'bad' already. But they are still victims. Beneath their bravado their mental deterioration is apparent. In Black Snake Moan, the horrific effects of a redneck woman's history of sexual abuse and rape are given some time through Christina Ricci's great acting, but the plot is driven by male characters towards a stupid and not very believable conclusion. In Baise-Moi, it is the trauma that the women went through that drives the plot. (Sadly one of the main actresses, Karen Bach committed suicide in 2005.) The film is arguably weakened by a change of style. The initial scenes are very realistic, including the horrific rape. But then the main protagonists go on a killing spree reminiscent of Natural Born Killers on trash aesthetic. Perhaps this is appropriate &#150; they live in la-la land as long as they can. But it will confuse some viewers.To reclaim women's rights over their true sexuality, to seize it back from the male gaze. It's always men who have a problem with a woman's sex that's their problem, not ours. A noble aim by the filmmakers. But will feminists baulk when they realise that one of the directors and two of the stars have previously worked in hard-core pornography? There's no logical reason why sex scenes should only be in porn, says Trinh Thi. Indeed, Hollywood agrees. I am sure there are convincing psychological arguments, but realistic sex still upsets many audiences (personally I have more of a problem with overly-realistic violence).This analysis has outstayed its welcome. I have laboured the good points of the film and rated it accordingly. On a technical level, the idea of using only natural lighting also works well. But apart from its stand against censorship and the way it deals with rape, the film is lacking in many respects. It was made on a very small budget and it shows. The acting is acceptable but not much is demanded from actors in terms of interiorisation and so on. There's a good soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film may probably be to argue over the issues it raises.

Now this is a bit different &#150; the film's artistic merits or lack of them are still a matter of debate. But I take my hats off to the French. I would love to see the British protest in the name of cinematic freedom. (The ban was eventually lifted after separate protests signed by Parisian intellectuals.)As you will already have guessed, the issues around this film are complicated. And they get worse. There is a tendency to react emotively to any highly charged sexual issues. This tendency can maybe blind us somewhat when it comes to analysing more important ones.This is a film made by women, about women living on the fringes of society. I was once importunate enough to argue with acclaimed filmmaker Gaspar Noé (after a public screening of Irreversible) that his film didn't address the issue of rape as well as Baise Moi. I still believe that, although Irreversible is a landmark film for other reasons entirely. Most films about rape follow male-orientated story lines. They often emphasise the purely physical, violence-aspect (as in Irreversible) or have a strong woman seeking and finding redress (as in The Accused). The reality is that most rape victims are traumatised mentally and emotionally. Physical hurt as a result of violence is no less an issue, but a separate one. Although The Accused looks at some of the metal trauma, it ultimately plays out as a success story. Few rape victims take on such a masculinised determination to succeed against the odds. Odds which are still stacked against the victim.What I liked about Baise-Moi is that it eschews the woman-survivor scenario for a more realistic picture of lasting psychological damage. Films that show the real horror of rape may discourage it more than ones that show women 'getting over it.' One of the victims of rape in Baise-Moi actually 'lets' her assailants get on with it, commenting to her friend afterwards that at least they didn't wind up dead. The rape (and the violence) of Baise-Moi convinced me that she probably hedged her bets wisely. Her lack of struggle didn't, in my mind, make her any the less a victim. And neither did the unpleasant fact that she was a part-time prostitute make her any more 'deserving.' This is something that it is not easy to live with. As a society, we have moved past the point where a girl in a short skirt acting flirtatiously (The Accused) is 'asking for it' or 'deserving of rape.' But where is our cut-off point? The marginals in society are often seen as dispensable. No-one wants to acknowledge them &#150; least of all mainstream filmmakers. Yet they can be just as much victims.Another thing I like about Baise-Moi is that the two girls that form a bond and go on a road trip are fully developed as characters. Like most young women, they enjoy having a good time and going after boys. But they have been mentally scarred. One of them has been brutally gang-raped and the other has watched her only friend being killed. They are not 'good girls gone bad'. They are fairly 'bad' already. But they are still victims. Beneath their bravado their mental deterioration is apparent. In Black Snake Moan, the horrific effects of a redneck woman's history of sexual abuse and rape are given some time through Christina Ricci's great acting, but the plot is driven by male characters towards a stupid and not very believable conclusion. In Baise-Moi, it is the trauma that the women went through that drives the plot. (Sadly one of the main actresses, Karen Bach committed suicide in 2005.) The film is arguably weakened by a change of style. The initial scenes are very realistic, including the horrific rape. But then the main protagonists go on a killing spree reminiscent of Natural Born Killers on trash aesthetic. Perhaps this is appropriate &#150; they live in la-la land as long as they can. But it will confuse some viewers.To reclaim women's rights over their true sexuality, to seize it back from the male gaze. It's always men who have a problem with a woman's sex that's their problem, not ours. A noble aim by the filmmakers. But will feminists baulk when they realise that one of the directors and two of the stars have previously worked in hard-core pornography? There's no logical reason why sex scenes should only be in porn, says Trinh Thi. Indeed, Hollywood agrees. I am sure there are convincing psychological arguments, but realistic sex still upsets many audiences (personally I have more of a problem with overly-realistic violence).This analysis has outstayed its welcome. I have laboured the good points of the film and rated it accordingly. On a technical level, the idea of using only natural lighting also works well. But apart from its stand against censorship and the way it deals with rape, the film is lacking in many respects. It was made on a very small budget and it shows. The acting is acceptable but not much is demanded from actors in terms of interiorisation and so on. There's a good soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film may probably be to argue over the issues it raises.

But Judge Dredd took it too high. The plot is for films like Total Recall, yet the film is definitely marked for sci-fi buffs 10 and below.

The film is rated R, yet you can't stop kids from actually going to these kind of things. And obviously, adults will just laugh at it.
