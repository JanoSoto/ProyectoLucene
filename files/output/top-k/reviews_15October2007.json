[{"date":"15 October 2007","score":"","review":" With outstanding performances, lush settings and costumes, as well as a well-crafted story, this film does exactly what is needed for a biography to succeed&#151;and it sticks to a specific period of a legend's life, without trying to tell eighty years in two hours. Hers is a tale that many know, at least a trifle bit, about. From our introduction, writer Michael Hirst tells us exactly what is necessary to gage all our principal players. Elizabeth is a Protestant, thus a heretic to those in power. Her being an illegitimate heir, daughter of Ann Boleyn, those with aspirations to the crown, the Duke of Norfolk at the forefront, look to do all they can in order to remove her. Elizabeth is at first a child in love, given an opportunity to rule yet without the strength needed to make decisions based on her own sound judgment rather than those around her. While she is a woman, and even those who call themselves friends and allies can't shake that fact, in order to rule, she must be sure her mind is ruling and not her heart. Thus, we are shown the rise of a woman, whom no one thought able to survive a day on the job, who would soon vault her nation to be the wealthiest and most powerful in the world.Shekhar Kapur is blessed with a script from Hirst that gets everything right. We are taken through the journey of betrayals with little doubt or vagueness. All crossovers of allegiances, all attempts at deception in order to use her as a pawn for more power, and each action that slowly shows her what it means to be human and how even the most trusted of her peers can be bought and sold, are portrayed to the point. Everything in the world was stacked against the Queen whether it politics, religion, or love. While the script is devoid of excess, it is the direction that flourishes with style and radiance. From the castle interiors to the period dress, the film is precise in its recreation of the time. The words are perfect and the plot fast paced and exciting, but without the artistry to deliver it as such, no one would be talking about the end result nearly as much as they do. A good story may be enough for me, but it is the spectacle that allows it to succeed across the board.Besides the visuals, the main driving force at play is the career-defining performance from Cate Blanchett. It is this role that will always be synonymous with her name. To be able to show off the smile of a young woman attempting to keep her life together while it is swept away in the storm of responsibility for a nation is an amazing feat. Her virtue and faith in her own beliefs showed early on during her subjection to treason charges and almost execution at the hands of her half-sister, but they only fully show themselves at the end when she has finally excepted her duty above any earthly gains she might have otherwise. Only by secluding herself from the temptations of the flesh, or the heart of a woman, as some characters here would say, can she be strong enough to survive and protect her ward of England. The power that exudes from her being during the final chapter is immense. Some may say she became cold-hearted, but if you watch her performance carefully, you'll see that it is her love and that alone which enables her to do the things she does. Only love and faith could allow her to acquiesce to the deeds she knows must occur for her land to be safe from harm. I can't wait to see this strength of character throughout an entire film, as I can only imagine Elizabeth The Golden Age will see her reign with that power prominently thrust forward.One can't stop with just Blanchett when speaking of the acting on display here. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely brilliant portraying the one man truly working on the Queen's side. It is his role as Sir Francis Walsingham that reminds Elizabeth of who she is. He speaks of what Princes must do to succeed and what dark deeds are necessary for the good of the whole. He treats the Queen as an intelligent being and not a woman in a man's job. Without his dedication and willingness to do the dirty work in order to propel her reputation as one to not take lightly, her reign would have been very short lived. Stoic throughout, besides a few gentle moments where the appearance of a smile can be seen, Rush is the epitome of a man taking his career seriously and the well being of those in his duty to protect ahead of any other.The rest of the cast is a who's who of European greats. Christopher Eccleston is spot-on as the villainous Norfolk just doing what he believes is best for his nation; Joseph Fiennes is good as Lord Robert, however at times seems a bit too theatric; Richard Attenborough brings a nice turn as the Queen's closest adviser, wrestling with his belief in her at the expense of his thoughts that she is just a woman; and then we have the numerous cameos from the likes of Emily Mortimer, Kelly MacDonald, Daniel Craig, James Frain (also starring in the Tudors), and a gem of comedy to lighten the mood from Vincent Cassel. It is these small roles that show the true strength of the film. By reining in the scope of a story about Elizabeth to that crucial time of her ascension to power, it allows for the filmmakers to make sure every detail is perfect. Credit to Hirst and Kapur for getting it all right.

'The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover' is part black comedy, part crime thriller, part horror, part film-noir. It is about about four twisted characters and a series of events that play out over an entire week. The owner of a French restaurant, Albert Spica(the thief), occupies it daily in order to stuff his face and beat on the innocent bystanders that surround him and cannot touch him. The owner of the restaurant(the cook) constantly watches in awe as Albert Spica humiliates everyone and talks and talks and talks, yet says nothing. The thief's wife, Georgina(his wife), is beaten, raped, and humiliated every day by the thief. She falls in love with another man at another table, Michael(her lover), and begins to have a rather passionate affair with him. What results is one of the most outrageous and bizarre films I've ever seen. Peter Greenaway has created a film that is unlike anything that has ever been made before. It is a film that is so disgusting and dark and tasteless, and yet so beautiful and intelligent and fresh that it must be seen to be believed. All of the performances are unforgettable, especially Helen Mirren as the wife, in a heart wrenching performance. Michael Gambon is absolutely terrifying as the thief. People can discuss the political implications that the film implies all they want. I really don't care about that stuff though. Even if that's what the film is about, it isn't why I love it. I love it because it challenges me and a way a challenging film should. The attention to detail in the set-pieces depict the one pertaining to the outrageous and decadent nature of our time and the times in which we live where the thief consumes everything and is wasteful. As a result, there is a genuine sense of true horror throughout the film. The graphic violence and sex only add the the dark nature of the depiction of a world, long destroyed by the greedy punks that have overrun the world. The punks in this film are much older than the ones that are usually depicted, and we the post-apocalyptic world outside for many brief glimpses in which there is a lot of fog, smoke, grime, and filth. We really get a sense that the world that is depicted in this film was once truly beautiful and open to possibility, and the fact that it is a world that is long gone makes the film far more tragic than we would usually expect, especially one with such grand texture and such a dark sense of humor.This is the kind of film that reminds me that people in the film industry can still make intelligent, smart, and brilliant films without having to pile on the excess. The film works because it is not only effective, but it is also original storytelling. The film's use of it's set design only amplifies the way it is presents and gives the film even more meaning with it's vibrant colors and the way that each set piece in the entire film represents a different color of the rainbow. The music by Michael Nyman is simply one of the most chilling and unforgettable scores I've heard in a film. It only enhances the beauty of the film though. While the film is certainly not for everyone, especially children(although it won't be easy for them to view it given it's NC-17 rating), this film is for the kind of adult audience who likes to think and not just be shown something that will waste their time. The content is really tame compared the garbage that is allowed to be played on public television these days anyway. For people who want to be challenged and shown a film that will make them think about the world in a different way than they normally do, It's a must see. This is one of my personal favorite films.

People can discuss the political implications that the film implies all they want. I really don't care about that stuff though. Even if that's what the film is about, it isn't why I love it. I love it because it challenges me and a way a challenging film should. The attention to detail in the set-pieces depict the one pertaining to the outrageous and decadent nature of our time and the times in which we live where the thief consumes everything and is wasteful. As a result, there is a genuine sense of true horror throughout the film. The graphic violence and sex only add the the dark nature of the depiction of a world, long destroyed by the greedy punks that have overrun the world. The punks in this film are much older than the ones that are usually depicted, and we the post-apocalyptic world outside for many brief glimpses in which there is a lot of fog, smoke, grime, and filth. We really get a sense that the world that is depicted in this film was once truly beautiful and open to possibility, and the fact that it is a world that is long gone makes the film far more tragic than we would usually expect, especially one with such grand texture and such a dark sense of humor.This is the kind of film that reminds me that people in the film industry can still make intelligent, smart, and brilliant films without having to pile on the excess. The film works because it is not only effective, but it is also original storytelling. The film's use of it's set design only amplifies the way it is presents and gives the film even more meaning with it's vibrant colors and the way that each set piece in the entire film represents a different color of the rainbow. The music by Michael Nyman is simply one of the most chilling and unforgettable scores I've heard in a film. It only enhances the beauty of the film though. While the film is certainly not for everyone, especially children(although it won't be easy for them to view it given it's NC-17 rating), this film is for the kind of adult audience who likes to think and not just be shown something that will waste their time. The content is really tame compared the garbage that is allowed to be played on public television these days anyway. For people who want to be challenged and shown a film that will make them think about the world in a different way than they normally do, It's a must see. This is one of my personal favorite films.

The Lady Vanishes follows much of the same themes as Hitchcock's past and present films including mistaken identity, deception, and romance. The movie opens with travelers on a trans-European train stopping for the night due to bad weather, hosted by a local hotel. Among the train passengers are Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends but is now returning home to be married, and Miss Froy (May Witty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess. When the train resumes its journey, Iris and Miss Froy become acquainted, while the remaining passengers in the compartment appear not to understand a word of English. It is here, that Iris lapses into unconsciousness (the result of an earlier encounter with a falling flowerpot meant for Miss Froy) and when she reawakens, the governess has vanished. However, Iris is certain that something more sinister is going on, and ends up teaming up with old acquaintance, Gilbert, (Redgrave) to find her before the train reaches its destination. ( The whole relationship with Giblert is quite hilarious, because from a certain scene at the beginning of the film, these two would be the least two people you would think of that would team up together) The central premise itself in itself is fanstastic the unaccountably missing, Miss Froy, who seems to have vanished on the very same train where everyone denies she ever existed. This is the conundrum that our two lovebirds are trying to unravel, and why the other passengers are claiming that Miss Froy never existed. Of course, some of the passengers are denying seeing Miss Froy for their own reasons (the hilariously singleminded cricket fans Caldicott and Charters (played by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford), while some of the others may just be in on it. One of my the most hilarious scenes from the film is a whole sequence where Gilbert and Iris are like fighting with one of the passengers, Signor Doppo (Philip Leaver), a magician and Iris is basically just like bouncing around while Gilbert and Doppo are battling it out.  Don't stand hoping around there like a refere, cooperate, Gilbert says. Iris ends up like kicking Gilbert in the butt. However, my favorite scene from the film is the whole posioning sequnce in which the villain of the piece, Dr. Hartz of Prague (Paul Lukas) spikes both Gilbert and Iris's drinks and 1) admits his involement  Hmm. You see I am in this conspiracy, as you call it. 2) admits that his patient is ineed Miss Fray. ( Miss Fray is in fact a British spy assigned to deliver some vital information, the famous Hitchcock MacGuffin) And of course, this being 1938, there is a little bit of a shot at the pacifists as well, as one of the main passengers, a big shot named Todhunter tries to ' negotiate' his way out of the situation and ends up being shot to death like the little bitch he was. Come on, sit down, take it easy. What's the trouble? If you must know, something fell on my head. When, infancy? Can I help? Only by going away. No, no, no, no. My father always taught me, never desert a lady in trouble. He even carried that as far as marrying Mother.  It's a conspiracy that's all it can be. All these people on the train say they haven't seen Miss Fray, but they have. In the first place, a little old lady disappears. Everyone that saw her probably insists that she was never there at all. Right? Right. We know that she was. Therefore, they did see her. Therefore, they are delebrately lying. Why? Did you notice anything about that nun? No. I don't think she's a nun at all.

A young Kansas farm girl dreams of a place where she can go with her dog rid of all problems and daily worries. She ends up finding her euphoria but runs into a bushel of trouble in doing so. The Wizard of Oz is a cinema marvel packed with action, special effects, and even flying monkeys. Once the film hit the television The Wizard of Oz became a cultural phenomenon, due to its immense amount of special effects, in which the whole family will enjoy and is a must see movie.The movie starts in a black and white color in a small, Kansas farming community. The film is shot in a production large studio. The backgrounds are very detailed but you can decipher they are not real. Dorothy lives a simple life with her tiny dog Toto who has a knack for getting into trouble with the neighbors. One day Toto stirs up trouble with one of the neighbors and Dorothy decides to run away because she thinks the mean neighbor will hurt her precious dog. Dorothy encounters a professor who is a fake fortune teller. Dorothy ends up telling him she ran away and he convinces her her aunt is sick and dying and she must return home at once. There is a terrible cyclone on the way home. Dorothy's house is picked up by the storm and carried off into the sky. This is the first major special effect featured in this film. The house appears to be spinning around inside of the cyclone. Dorothy is looking out at the window at all of the objects being thrown around by the cyclone including her mean neighbor.Dorothy's house lands in the wonderful land of Oz. Oz if full of vibrant color and still being filmed in an elaborate production studio with immense detail and many props to enhance the atmosphere. Dorothy's house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. An interesting special effect appears at this point in the movie. A good witch, named Glenda, appears to be in a tiny bubble which is getting larger and larger as she approaches Dorothy. Glenda tells Dorothy she killed the Witch of the East. Suddenly in a puff of red billowing smoke the Wicked Witch of the West appears. She threatens Dorothy and then disappears with another poof of thick red smoke. Dorothy then begins her journey on the yellow brick road to the Emerald city to talk to the Wizard of Oz. After being thanked by the munchkins, tiny people who inhabit Munchkinland she is on her way.Along the yellow brick road Dorothy and Toto encounter many new friends as well as her newfound enemies. She first meets a scarecrow with no brain. The scarecrow appears to be stuffed with straw and his face looks like cloth. Next, she meets a tin man with no heart. The tin man is stuck in place and cannot move unless he is oiled thoroughly. The tin man's face seems to be meshed perfectly to his rusted tin can body. Finally, she meets a cowardly lion who has no courage. The lion has a large tail which you can tell is being held up to a thin string. These four characters embark through a plagued forest filled with angry monster apple trees whom come to life when they are disturbed. They also encounter a deadly poppy field which is a trap set by the Witch of the West. Once they get to the Emerald city they talk to the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard appears to be a huge silhouette head against the backdrop of a wall with billowing fire and smoke. There are also flickering lights to enhance the spookiness of the wizard. This is all actually done by a man who is behind a curtain, which is found out later in the movie.The group of characters has to reach the Witch's castle high atop a steep pathway. The Witch looks into her crystal ball and sees them coming and sends her blue, flying monkeys to get Dorothy and Toto. The monkeys carry them off to the castle into the night sky. Dorothy ends up killing the Witch by melting her with water. The Witch appears to melt into thin air with a cloud of smoke coming off of her as her black gown crumples to the ground. Glenda appears again after another meeting with the Wizard and tells Dorothy she can go back home because all she has to do is find her heart's desire.

It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light. Now you're getting nasty. Quite simply one of the greatest screen adventures of all time and easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The story introduces archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), who is hired by the U.S. government to go on a quest for the mystical lost Ark of the Covenant. Accompanied by his old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and ex-flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), he must retrieve the ark before the Nazis and his adversary, French archaeologist Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) acquire it first. The first thing that strikes me about this movie is the performance of Harrison Ford, as Indiana Jones. There is a real dark edge to the character of Indiana Jones. For example, Raiders really hits on some of the emotional complexities of the character. I think the darkest aspect pursued in Raiders, is Indiana Jones relationship with Rene Belloq. (Paul Freeman) While, Indy used his strength, brawn and wit to defeat the bad guys, Belloq was much more cunning. I also view Belloq as the most believable villain in the series, and as Belloq himself notes, to Indy ?I am but a shadowy reflection of you.? He could see and cut right through Indy. I absolutely adore that entire scene with Indy meeting Belloq in a crowded bar. All around great stuff. Karen Allen is also another reason, why Raiders is the best of the entire series. Her character is well developed, and perfectly played. I love her whole interactions with Ford, they had perfect chemistry together. I think my favorite scene between them is when Marion thinks the whip coiled on Indy's hip is a snake, and she attacks it with her torch- burning Indy, who replies. ?Ouch! Jesus!? Lastly, of all the gals throughout the series, Marion to me has the most charm. Be it striking that dude on the head with a frying pan, or challenging Belloq to a drinking contest in that dress!

I think my favorite scene between them is when Marion thinks the whip coiled on Indy's hip is a snake, and she attacks it with her torch- burning Indy, who replies. ?Ouch! Jesus!? Lastly, of all the gals throughout the series, Marion to me has the most charm. Be it striking that dude on the head with a frying pan, or challenging Belloq to a drinking contest in that dress! I love that scene where Indy shoots down that one Arab guy with the sword, as well.

Somerset Maugham. The movie finds British soldier and novelist Edgar Brodie (John Gielgud) returning home from WW1 to find that a government agency has faked a report of his death. Indeed, they have changed his name to Richard Ashenden. Why? He must now travel to Switzerland and track down and eliminate a ruthless German agent.'Ashenden' is then teamed with two professional agents, an amoral deadly assassin known as The General (Peter Lorre) and Elsa Carrington, (Madeleine Carroll) a beautiful blonde who will pose as his wife and cover for his new identity. The plot strikes several of Hitchcock's famous themes, including, mistaken identity and murder. But, most of all the film is a winding tale of deception. Nothing is what it appears on the surface; and people tell lies constantly. Everyone, it seems, is either impersonating someone else or mistaken for someone else.For one, Elsa and Ashenden soon begin to question the morality of the very own mission they have been ordered to undertake. In espionage, killing often takes place at close quarters and sometimes innocent lives are lost, or at least ruined, in the course of a day's work.  We're not hunting a fox. We're hunting a man, Ashenden says at one point. The reason being is that they end up killing the wrong man. This scene is very striking, with the owner's dog reacting to what we as an audience knows is going to happen... the dog ends up making this terrifying howl.One problem with the film is the 'integrity' of Madeleine Carroll's character, Elsa Carrington. Had the British government known how wishy washy she was, would she have ever been given such an important mission? Come to think of it, how did she even become a spy? Her basic premise is that she doesn't want anyone's death on her conscience, the German Agents or any soldiers. So why'd you get involved? Robert Young plays a so-called American playboy named 'Robert Marvin' who develops quite the liking to Elsa. However, as I wrote earlier. Deception. Deception. Just as Elsa and Ashenden aren't who they say they are so goes Mr. Marvin. Who it turns out.... is actually the German Agent. Yes, the same very agent, they've been hunting from the beginning. ( It is nice to note as well that is what Mr. Marvin who tiped off our agents to the man who they believed wrongly was the German Agent! Beautiful Misinformation. Love it!) John Gielgud is a little stiff in the main role and I for one just think that Madeleine Carroll is way too young for him to be even 'posing' as his wife. Peter Lorre is just a freaking maniac here, he is everywhere- overacting and proud of it.Kindly tell me who you are, what your name is, and why your passing yourself off as my wife?  Yes, me friend of everyman with beautiful wife. Beautiful accident, very very sad, but could not be helped. Poor Poor Gentleman!  I was there all right. Half a mile away-at the other end of a telescope. Yet, it's quite true. Just one of those long range assassinations. That doesn't make it any better does it? I think your beginning to find that out too? Aren't you?

Despite rumours that the final godfather-film is a blemish on an otherwise magnificent tale of organized crime, it is in fact one of the most beautiful films ever made and a story that's just as riveting as any of its predecessors. It once again deals with familiar themes such as corruption, misuse of power, love, respect, remorse and of course the most inevitable of all &#133; death! The endless amount of critique and insults that this film received must have something to do with the many years dividing part II and part III. In those many years the face of American cinema has changed radically. Back in the '70s method-actors like Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were the true kings of the movie industry, but after a couple of years special effects started playing a bigger role in cinema and fantasy figures such as Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, aliens, terminators, gremlins and horror icon Freddy Krueger all became immensely popular and just as important.Amazing is that The godfather part III didn't change one bit amidst this massive update of modern cinema. Surely it takes place a few dozen years later, but it seems as though time has stood still. Even so there are some significant changes to be had. The biggest change of all is how Michael Corleone has transformed from a strong and confident leader to a weak and aging Don desperately trying to deal with his tragic past. At the same time he wants to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld. Method-actor Al Pacino does exceptionally well at acting out emotions with his voice in this final instalment. The last time I watched this film, I actually cried on two different occasions. That's how powerful and genuine his acting really is. The first moment that got to me was the confession of Al Pacino to a priest. Having never shown repent for any of his sins, he suddenly realizes the vast magnitude of his wrong-doings and ultimately breaks down in tears. Even more compelling is the ending of the godfather-trilogy.But Al Pacino isn't the only great actor in this film. Andy Garcia plays his role of a lifetime as Vincent Mancini &#150; the ferocious son of Michael's oldest brother Sonny and unfortunately for anyone involved he shares his father's hot temper. Especially small-time enforcer Joey Zasa seems to enrage him beyond all reason. This character is played by actor Joe Mantegna and he does a very good job. Mantegna would still get the chance to play an actual mob boss but only as the voice of Fat Tony in the highly successful television series The Simpsons.The one person who was attacked the most for her performance was Sofia Coppola; daughter of director Francis Ford. She evidently plays the part of the daughter of Michael Corleone. I have to agree that Sofia is much better behind the camera than in front of it, but to say that her acting was terrible is an overstatement. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are still around playing their eminent characters, but not everybody returns for this third film. Robert Duvall got a little too greedy on his part and that's why his character consigliere Tom Hagen does not return. This is a real pity, but the film has found a very clever way to work around it &#133; so this change is more than satisfactory; I think. Bridget Fonda is also present as a reporter but her role is of no real consequence. Suffice to say, The godfather part III has a fabulous cast.In short Sequels simply don't get any better than this! This masterpiece is just as grand as part I and part II ... everything falls into place - from its wonderful actors to the delightful cinematography - The godfather part III truly is ... the perfect end to the perfect trilogy!!

Surely it takes place a few dozen years later, but it seems as though time has stood still. Even so there are some significant changes to be had. The biggest change of all is how Michael Corleone has transformed from a strong and confident leader to a weak and aging Don desperately trying to deal with his tragic past. At the same time he wants to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld. Method-actor Al Pacino does exceptionally well at acting out emotions with his voice in this final instalment. The last time I watched this film, I actually cried on two different occasions. That's how powerful and genuine his acting really is. The first moment that got to me was the confession of Al Pacino to a priest. Having never shown repent for any of his sins, he suddenly realizes the vast magnitude of his wrong-doings and ultimately breaks down in tears. Even more compelling is the ending of the godfather-trilogy.But Al Pacino isn't the only great actor in this film. Andy Garcia plays his role of a lifetime as Vincent Mancini &#150; the ferocious son of Michael's oldest brother Sonny and unfortunately for anyone involved he shares his father's hot temper. Especially small-time enforcer Joey Zasa seems to enrage him beyond all reason. This character is played by actor Joe Mantegna and he does a very good job. Mantegna would still get the chance to play an actual mob boss but only as the voice of Fat Tony in the highly successful television series The Simpsons.The one person who was attacked the most for her performance was Sofia Coppola; daughter of director Francis Ford. She evidently plays the part of the daughter of Michael Corleone. I have to agree that Sofia is much better behind the camera than in front of it, but to say that her acting was terrible is an overstatement. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are still around playing their eminent characters, but not everybody returns for this third film. Robert Duvall got a little too greedy on his part and that's why his character consigliere Tom Hagen does not return. This is a real pity, but the film has found a very clever way to work around it &#133; so this change is more than satisfactory; I think. Bridget Fonda is also present as a reporter but her role is of no real consequence. Suffice to say, The godfather part III has a fabulous cast.In short Sequels simply don't get any better than this!

Despite rumours that the final godfather-film is a blemish on an otherwise magnificent tale of organized crime, it is in fact one of the most beautiful films ever made and a story that's just as riveting as any of its predecessors. It once again deals with familiar themes such as corruption, misuse of power, love, respect, remorse and of course the most inevitable of all &#133; death! The endless amount of critique and insults that this film received must have something to do with the many years dividing part II and part III.

This is perhaps Hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme, and not his most successful or memorable.

Only they aren't active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the ending resonates.At least you get some enjoyable views of London in the early 1930s, and a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food.

Involved in the plot are a band of German and British spies who use a movie theatre and a pet shop as a ' front' to cover their activities. The owner of the theatre, Mr. Verloc ( Oscar Homolka), is involved in the plot, but his young wife ( Sylvia Sidney) and her younger brother Stevie ( Desmond Tester) are ignorant of it. Soon feeling that something is up and under pressure from his co-conspirators, Verloc sends Stevie to deliver something for him, only the young boy doesn't know he's delivering a time-bomb.There are many standout scenes in this film. The first scene that comes to my mind, is in the beginning of the film where London has just gone to total darkness. Several quick views of the power plants eventually lead us to the workmen who discover sand in the works.  Sabotage! cries one.  Who did it? The audience is given the answer immediately, as the face of Verloc, crisscrossed with the shadows, emerges to fill the screen. Classic Hitchcock! The second scene which stands out to me, is the entire sequence involving Stevie and his errand. In these scenes, Stevie is completely at the mercy of others, time, and the saboteurs plot. For example, the suspense Hitchcock builds on the bus with the conductor, who ironically warns Stevie,  Don't set fire to me or the other passengers. The last is the entire sequence in which Mrs. Verloc finds out what has just happened. This includes the Disney cartoon  Who killed Cock Robin? and later the scene where Verloc confesses to his wife his part in the sabotage ( he does this against the background of the model boat which she and her brother had made) and the later final dinner scene, where not a word is spoken. This last part is so carefully arranged and so personal between the two, they are right in each others faces, silent.Sabotage is really quite simply, a film rich in complexities of its moral ambiguities. Hitchcock examines really our thin veneer of security the potential we have to sabotage our own lives and the lives of others. For example, the buying and selling of one?s own soul, using the disguise or ?cover? of a cinema or as a greengrocer. In the end, our own detective hero of the film faces his own moral dilemma, for his own recognition of his duty has begun to crumble.

After spending years watching and ploughing through the history of silent films, 'Dracula' now comes on like a mind boggling ground breaking wonder! How it must have terrified audiences in 1931!Of course, we know the minuses it doesn't follow the book, there's too much off stage action, Tod Browning's 'direction' is weak, the male lead is feeble, the acting is too stagy (especially by Van Helsing), and there's not enough Lugosi, etc. But consider the pluses they get better with every viewing! Even after 76 years! The first sound version of a 'grotesque and horrible theme' (=the undead drinking blood to survive); the pioneering way of presenting it-- laying the groundwork for countless versions to follow (including the vast, bleak, decrepit castle); the eerie, creepy, atmospheric use of silence (the lack of music was not unusual for films of 1931); the scary, creepy editing; the amusing Charles K. They're all cry-zy Martin; the amazing work of Dwight Frye (including his floor crawl towards the maid), who would have stolen the film if it hadn't been for Bela's imposing presence; and most of all, the manner, movements, voice, dialog and delivery of Bela Lugosi himself. Whew!The Universal Legacy collection's David Skal informs us that the depression caused Carl Laemmle to scrap plans to film the book in favor of the popular play. In the book (published in 1897), Jonathan Harker is the solicitor dispatched to Castle Dracula, where he becomes trapped by Dracula, whom he sees turn into a lizard, and whom he also tries to kill before Dracula leaves Transylvania disguised as Harker; Renfield is already a patient in the sanitarium; and Lucy is beheaded in her tomb by Van Helsing and her lover, after her many nightly kills as the Woman in White (this latter part being mentioned in the film). Too bad we didn't get any of it in the film!In fact, while the fate of Lucy as a vampire is left out of the Lugosi version, it is present in the Spanish language one (included in the Universal Legacy Collection), in its more exciting climax. Speaking of that version, produced at the same time and on the same sets with the same costumes, and mostly the same script, it comes off as a wonderful, more detailed, variation of the English version, with additional scenes, dialog, and a really great Renfield. A fuller version visually and story wise, but... no voice of Lugosi.I haven't seen all of Lugosi's films but my favorites are clearly, 'Dracula'(1931); 'White Zombie'(1932); Lugosi amazing as Ygor in 'Son of Frankenstein'(1939); as the romantic hero and star of the serial 'The Return of Chandu' (1934); and his speeches (Pull the String!) in Ed Wood's 'Citizen Kane''Glen or Glenda' (1953).As Skal points out, in no future Dracula movies did 'The Count' try to imitate Bela Lugosi, but as viewers we would always hear his voice, see his mannerisms, and measure the current actor against Bela's being conspicuous by his absence. So finally, watching this film takes you back to a genteel, drawing room world, where the gruesome theme is treated with skeptical normalcy and decency (not the horrific silliness and unbelievability so prevalent in modern horror films). When Renfield opens the door of Dracula's castle and introduces us to the world of evil we now know all too familiarly in our own time on and off screen, it's a ground breaking moment in the history of cinema. For all the pluses in it, this film just gets better and better!

A fuller version visually and story wise, but... no voice of Lugosi.I haven't seen all of Lugosi's films but my favorites are clearly, 'Dracula'(1931); 'White Zombie'(1932); Lugosi amazing as Ygor in 'Son of Frankenstein'(1939); as the romantic hero and star of the serial 'The Return of Chandu' (1934); and his speeches (Pull the String!) in Ed Wood's 'Citizen Kane''Glen or Glenda' (1953).As Skal points out, in no future Dracula movies did 'The Count' try to imitate Bela Lugosi, but as viewers we would always hear his voice, see his mannerisms, and measure the current actor against Bela's being conspicuous by his absence. So finally, watching this film takes you back to a genteel, drawing room world, where the gruesome theme is treated with skeptical normalcy and decency (not the horrific silliness and unbelievability so prevalent in modern horror films). When Renfield opens the door of Dracula's castle and introduces us to the world of evil we now know all too familiarly in our own time on and off screen, it's a ground breaking moment in the history of cinema. For all the pluses in it, this film just gets better and better!

There's a scene where Isabelle Adjani's Lucy meets the vampire for the very first time, and the way Herzog introduces him to her was as if Dracula's shadow opened the door! I was so mesmerized by Kinski's performance(..and, especially how Herzog shoots him appearing from the dark..and the way Herzog lights his shadows against walls is just magnificent!), when he wasn't on screen I was chomping at the bit to see him. Such as the scenes in Dracula's Transylvania castle in the Carpathian Mountains. The agony behind each breath he takes. The way he snatched Harker's arm, sucking the blood from an accidental cut. The way he stares at Harker with this aching of melancholy..particularly when he speaks of the missing love not in his life. Listen to how Kinski delivers the words regarding death and the loneliness..it's spoken with such pain and agony. Then the later scenes where he approaches Harker like a predatory animal about to pounce(..especially the bed side scene, shortly after the stunning shot from Herzog displaying Dracula appearing from this darkened hall). Look how Herzog captures the absolute beauty of Adjani..has anyone ever photographed her quite like this? The guy that plays Renfield..where did Herzog dig this fellow up at?! The street sequences as the plague has ended almost an entire civilization with pigs and lambs walking around as rats join together in massive armies in corners and traveling in packs. The scenes where Bruno Ganz, as Harker, looks more and more like Dracula. One change in this than other versions is that Lucy is the one who motivates the destruction of Dracula, not Van Helsing. He's the kind that scoffs at the superstitions in favor of looking at the difficult situation(..regarding Dracula, and Lucy's suggestion to destroy him)scientifically. Lucy does what she has to do as in finding the killer responsible for the death and desolation taking place as the aristocracy celebrate their last suppers in the streets with rats awaiting their passing so they can partake in meal-time. I could go on and on because this is not just a film, but an experience.

In the New York port of Hoboken, a corrupt, racketeering union enjoys limited power. Day in, day out, would-be workers gather on the dockside in the early morning, hoping to acquire a day pass to earn a few bucks. The union bosses rule the rooast their word is law, and anyone foolish enough to challenge them is risking his death. This being young longshoreman Joey Doyle, who's preparing to testify before the Waterfront Crime Commision the union men use Terry Malloy( Brando) to lure Doyle into a trap that costs him his life. Terry, a former prize-fighter could have been a contender, but now he toils for boss Johnny Friendly ( Lee J. Cobb) on the gang-ridden waterfront. Terry, is not a bad guy, but he's certainly not too bright either.It is only through, the dead man's sister, Edie Doyle ( Eva Marie Saint), and the tough local priest, Father Barry ( Karl Malden) that he begins to see how low he has fallen and to the conscience he never knew he had.The real sensation of this film is Marlon Brando. As Malloy, Brando simply shows the underlying complexity of a simple man, torn apart by conflicting feelings and powerful external forces. It is a performance for the ages. There are two scenes in particular that have entered into my movie mythology. The first one, is, in the back seat of a taxi, and it is a scene in which Terry finally comes to the realization that his brother Charley ( Rod Steiger) has sabatoged his chances in not only boxing, but in life as well. This is the scene made famous by this famous speech by Brando. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. Both brothers have realized that something important has just occurred; and when Charley ends up pulling out a gun to persuade his brother to keep his mouth shut before the Commission, you realize it is just a simply act of pure desperation on Charley's part. Almost tenderly, Terry brushes the gun aside, and Charley's fate is sealed. It is a scene that shows the loss of brotherly love and the depth of both Brando & Steiger's acting.The other scene is at the end of the film. A movie-goer would probably know it as the famous stagge scene. Where Malloy after being badly beaten by Johnny Friendly and his goons, goes back to work.  Put me on my feet! Brilliant! Not to mention the display of physical acting Brando does prior to the walk and the during the walk itself.Some other fantastic scenes include the scene where the workers start pelting Father Barry ( Karl Malden) after Dugan has been killed. Father Berry has long wanted to see these men wake up and cast off their servile and aparthetic attitues. He simply points to the dead body and says, Boys, this is my church! Pure Awesomeness.Eva Marie Saint is also sensational here. Beautiful, and angelic.... No wonder Malloy is so disarmed by her!!! What guy wouldn't be? That scene where Malloy confesses to her. Man!  Look see this arm? Two inches longer than the other. Thats from years of working and sweating... and lifting and swinging a hook. Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag. I says to myself.... 'That's for Edie, so she can be a teacher or something decent.'  You give it to Joey, to Dugan, to Charley, who was one of your own! You think your God Almighty. But you know what you are? You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinking mug! And I'm glad what I done to you! You know this city's full of hawks? That's a fact. They hang around on the top of the big hotels.

There are two scenes in particular that have entered into my movie mythology. The first one, is, in the back seat of a taxi, and it is a scene in which Terry finally comes to the realization that his brother Charley ( Rod Steiger) has sabatoged his chances in not only boxing, but in life as well. This is the scene made famous by this famous speech by Brando. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. Both brothers have realized that something important has just occurred; and when Charley ends up pulling out a gun to persuade his brother to keep his mouth shut before the Commission, you realize it is just a simply act of pure desperation on Charley's part. Almost tenderly, Terry brushes the gun aside, and Charley's fate is sealed. It is a scene that shows the loss of brotherly love and the depth of both Brando & Steiger's acting.The other scene is at the end of the film. A movie-goer would probably know it as the famous stagge scene. Where Malloy after being badly beaten by Johnny Friendly and his goons, goes back to work.  Put me on my feet! Brilliant! Not to mention the display of physical acting Brando does prior to the walk and the during the walk itself.Some other fantastic scenes include the scene where the workers start pelting Father Barry ( Karl Malden) after Dugan has been killed. Father Berry has long wanted to see these men wake up and cast off their servile and aparthetic attitues. He simply points to the dead body and says, Boys, this is my church! Pure Awesomeness.Eva Marie Saint is also sensational here. Beautiful, and angelic.... No wonder Malloy is so disarmed by her!!! What guy wouldn't be? That scene where Malloy confesses to her. Man!  Look see this arm? Two inches longer than the other. Thats from years of working and sweating... and lifting and swinging a hook. Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag. I says to myself.... 'That's for Edie, so she can be a teacher or something decent.'  You give it to Joey, to Dugan, to Charley, who was one of your own! You think your God Almighty. But you know what you are? You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinking mug! And I'm glad what I done to you! You know this city's full of hawks? That's a fact. They hang around on the top of the big hotels. And they spot a pigeon in the park. Right down on him.

In the New York port of Hoboken, a corrupt, racketeering union enjoys limited power. Day in, day out, would-be workers gather on the dockside in the early morning, hoping to acquire a day pass to earn a few bucks. The union bosses rule the rooast their word is law, and anyone foolish enough to challenge them is risking his death. This being young longshoreman Joey Doyle, who's preparing to testify before the Waterfront Crime Commision the union men use Terry Malloy( Brando) to lure Doyle into a trap that costs him his life. Terry, a former prize-fighter could have been a contender, but now he toils for boss Johnny Friendly ( Lee J. Cobb) on the gang-ridden waterfront. Terry, is not a bad guy, but he's certainly not too bright either.It is only through, the dead man's sister, Edie Doyle ( Eva Marie Saint), and the tough local priest, Father Barry ( Karl Malden) that he begins to see how low he has fallen and to the conscience he never knew he had.The real sensation of this film is Marlon Brando.

One djinn (the Wishmaster) is trapped in a gem and imprisoned inside a statue. Many, many years later in America the statue breaks... and the djinn once again tries to continue his evil ways.The basic idea of this film is really cool a genie grants wishes and the wishes go very, very badly. This works well, especially in one scene where a man wishes he had money and then his mother gets killed (allowing him to inherit her life insurance). But I also felt too many liberties were taken with the wishes many of the things that counted as wishes were simply comments about desires, some of them vague and many sarcastic. This seems like a plot hole if ever there was one.That concern aside, the effects and deaths were cool... and the film as a whole was very enjoyable. I have not yet seen Wishmaster 2 but would be interested into doing so.What makes this film really stand out is the impressive list of horror names associated with it, starting with director Robert Kurtzman (the K in the KNB special effects company) and writer Peter Atkins (who I believe was the man behind some of the Hellraiser films. The actors? Kane Hodder, Robert Englund and Tony Todd should be names familiar to any horror fan. What about Ted Raimi or Dan Hicks (both from Evil Dead) and Angus Scrimm or Reggie Bannister (both from Phantasm)? They're here, too. Even Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) and Walter Phelan show up.Who really stands out is Andrew Divoff, who plays The Djinn and his human counterpart Nathaniel Demerest. I know Divoff from Lost (as Bakunin) but prior to the show, I think he probably had his best-known roles in the Wishmaster series, which I have neglected to watch until now. He is amazing -- both suave and a solid actor, but vicious when he needs to be. Not unlike the character of Bakunin, only far more handsome in this role.Wishmaster is something of a horror classic, if for no other reason than the people who appear in it. It's not a great film. It's a decent film. I'd like to give it some extra credit because Robert Kurtzman signed my copy of the movie, but I won't be a fanboy like that. Let's just put it like this Wishmaster is nothing great like In the Mouth of Madness but it's much better than other movies about mythological creatures, like Leprechaun.
