The film starts on Earth. It's supposed to be in the future, but how far in uncertain. What is certain is that the homes and dress look like the 1970s--not a Hollywood or European film view of the 1970s or the future--just the 1970s. At this point, the audience is confused, because although you don't know the year, the entire context for the film is missing--things just ARE and the film moves as if the audience somehow knows what is occurring and what has occurred.What slowly becomes apparent is that there is an Earth space station in orbit over some planet. Additionally, some mystery surrounds the base and bizarre reports of things happening on the supposedly barren surface alarm some and don't seem to matter to the protagonist in the film, Kris Kelvin. He then goes to Solyaris to investigate but seems to have little emotion or motivation.Once there, he soon realizes that the two remaining people on the station and himself are subject to bizarre contacts from the planet below. Instead of contacting them by radio or telepathically, a unique person from one's past appears to each of the three--though the only one you really see in more than glimpses is Kelvin's deceased wife, Hari. Now you know and the rest of the audience knows that this can't be Hari. Even if she were alive, she'd be back on Earth but somehow Kelvin is so captivated by her that he refuses to believe she isn't real. While she MAY be real, it is certain she ain't Hari! Despite Kelvin's desire to just lie around and enjoy reminiscing and sleeping with Hari, the other two scientists somehow think this is a bad plan, so one of them comes up with an incomprehensible plan to use Kelvin's EEG pattern to stop the transmissions from the planet. How, exactly, he came up with this plan is really vague, but at the end of the film, the apparitions on the space station stop and Kelvin decides to go back to Earth. But, in an excellent twist, you are left wondering exactly WHAT happened.Despite my liking the ending very much, the basic premise and some of the lovely cinematography, the end product was a very mixed bag. The film was meant to be an artsy film and often spent WAAAAYYYY too long on scenes that should have been shortened in order to keep the audience awake. Now I do like longer movies and a 3 or 4 hour film isn't daunting to me, but this film should have had at least 1\/2 hour taken out of it. Too many scenes show close-ups of weeds moving in the water, cars driving for 5 minutes along a highway in Japan (pointlessly, I might add) and people staring off into space. Now some of these excesses didn't surprise me (heck, I've see the Russian version of WAR AND PEACE twice--and it runs more than 6 1\/2 hours in the American version), but that still didn't excuse the overly long shots. Had this not been an art film, critics most likely would have torn apart the film for this reason. I truly think that had it been only a 2 hour movie, it would have been better and I would have scored it at least an 8.This one is like watching a film marathon. A pretty good film marathon, but a marathon nonetheless.

It's packed with action and suspense and even a bit of character development. (Eg., the pro-Nazi Junge who insists on being clean shaven and dapper eventually becomes integrated into the crew and turns into a bearded slob too.) It's soporific because it's so LOOOONG. Three and a half hours of being cooped up in a sardine can with a couple of dozen sweating smart fellers.It's based on a journal kept by Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, which is also long, chiefly because it contains more expository material. Ever wonder how, when the KaEl shouts Dive!, they make the boat dive? Read the book. You'll be able to take out a U-boat for a solo sail.The film has the usual incidents of submarine life, some of them clichés by now. The popping bolts, the Tiefenmesser inching below 200 meters, the depth charges, the sea water squiring in, the men gasping for air until the boat finally surfaces and the hatch thrown open. But, and this is a big but, that's not all it has. All the incidents shown are real, and there are others thrown in that turn the story choppy, the way real life is usually disjointed. And, plot aside, I can't think of another film that has so effectively captured what life aboard a World War II submarine was like. OUR submarine crews are always so tidy, so beardless, so freshly uniformed. These guys are so ragged and greasy that you can almost smell them. Hams, giant wursts, loaves of French bread, and crates of fruit are stuffed into unused corners or swing from overhead beams. There is only one toilet for some 45 men so it's always busy. (There's another head but it's jammed full of food.) The grandiloquently named Officer's Mess is about the size of your closet. When the meat turns green with mold, the men joke about mold being nothing more than another kind of vegetable, rather like lettuce.The performances are fine, and a few are outstanding. Jurgen Prochnow as the Captain exudes authority and sometimes an understated irony. He has a perfect face for the role -- not particularly handsome, stern, and with sensitive blue eyes. And when the boat is in immediate danger he doesn't look angry, like Cary Grant. He looks scared to death just like everyone else.The film deals with the crew of a German U-boat but that makes no difference. The men are instantly recognizable in every way. And the movie was not the big hit in Germany that it was internationally because Germans do not like movies about the Nazi era that shine a humanistic light on members of the Armed Forces of the period.It's a finely crafted film.

Then I watched it on TV and nodded out again half-way through. Tonight I fell asleep twice while watching it. Not that it's in any way dull. It's packed with action and suspense and even a bit of character development. (Eg., the pro-Nazi Junge who insists on being clean shaven and dapper eventually becomes integrated into the crew and turns into a bearded slob too.) It's soporific because it's so LOOOONG. Three and a half hours of being cooped up in a sardine can with a couple of dozen sweating smart fellers.It's based on a journal kept by Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, which is also long, chiefly because it contains more expository material. Ever wonder how, when the KaEl shouts Dive!, they make the boat dive? Read the book. You'll be able to take out a U-boat for a solo sail.The film has the usual incidents of submarine life, some of them clichés by now. The popping bolts, the Tiefenmesser inching below 200 meters, the depth charges, the sea water squiring in, the men gasping for air until the boat finally surfaces and the hatch thrown open. But, and this is a big but, that's not all it has. All the incidents shown are real, and there are others thrown in that turn the story choppy, the way real life is usually disjointed. And, plot aside, I can't think of another film that has so effectively captured what life aboard a World War II submarine was like. OUR submarine crews are always so tidy, so beardless, so freshly uniformed. These guys are so ragged and greasy that you can almost smell them. Hams, giant wursts, loaves of French bread, and crates of fruit are stuffed into unused corners or swing from overhead beams. There is only one toilet for some 45 men so it's always busy. (There's another head but it's jammed full of food.) The grandiloquently named Officer's Mess is about the size of your closet. When the meat turns green with mold, the men joke about mold being nothing more than another kind of vegetable, rather like lettuce.The performances are fine, and a few are outstanding. Jurgen Prochnow as the Captain exudes authority and sometimes an understated irony. He has a perfect face for the role -- not particularly handsome, stern, and with sensitive blue eyes. And when the boat is in immediate danger he doesn't look angry, like Cary Grant. He looks scared to death just like everyone else.The film deals with the crew of a German U-boat but that makes no difference. The men are instantly recognizable in every way. And the movie was not the big hit in Germany that it was internationally because Germans do not like movies about the Nazi era that shine a humanistic light on members of the Armed Forces of the period.It's a finely crafted film.

And he displays his tremendous talent in playing the role of Emmett Ray, jazz guitarist, a genius at his craft, rather a disastrous dope in all other aspects of his life.Then there's Samantha Morton who is brilliant in her portrayal of sweet, adorable Hattie, a cute mute young woman whose simple needs and wants, along with her lack of narcissism and inability to spew out mind numbing volumes of bulls+t banter obscure her deep strength and savvy intelligence. Those that value pure, sweet, unassuming kindness will find her irresistibly lovable.Emmett only really knows one thing, how to play guitar like no one else in the world, with the exception of the one person he idolizes to the point of hysteria Django Reinhardt. He's obliviously inept at just about everything else in his life, especially his feelings, to the point where he doesn't know real, rare, wonderful love when it's right next to him. Sean is able to make Emmett so very likable, even in his worst of behavior. He excels at what he does best, bringing real human depth and qualities to his craft that exceptionally few actors are or have been capable of doing.This film is much like the character of Hattie, deceptive in its initial appearance and of a substantially better quality than you may first think. It seems like a light, cute little story largely due to its entertaining presentation and lack of dramatic pretense but there is significant texture and reality to this work of art. Emmett is perhaps the greatest guitar player in America and has so many of the essential ingredients for huge success drive, ambition, presentation, wardrobe, personality, yet he tends to sabotage himself frequently and never gets the lucky break needed to put him at the top. True he could probably do rather well if he didn't p+ss away such volumes of cash but he never gets the type of success that the best supposedly deserve and is so wrought with money it won't disappear in the most extravagant lifestyles.Emmett also makes the tragically universal mistake of believing bullsh+t, both his and society's. He thinks the money and possessions and trophy girlfriends are what happiness are all about. His one saving grace is his love and respect for his craft but can this alone keep him from making a disaster of his life? He discovers all too painfully that the beautiful woman with the sophisticated, witty repartee, whom all the other men drool over, has an extremely high price tag of impenetrable, cold blooded narcissism. And though Emmett acts for the most part like a shallow dope, trying to hide and deny that besides being a genius he is a painfully sensitive man in desperate need of sweet, nurturing love, he still makes way too many foolhardy decisions. He is blind to the fact that the women who use sweetness merely as a tool of manipulation are the last thing he, or anyone else with a shred of decency, need or deserve.This is a great film and story and you can also enjoy a very pretty picture of life in the 1940's while you watch it.Apparently there was an obscure jazz guitarist named Emmett Ray but even if there wasn't, this is not really a fictionalized account. Certainly not in the sense of capturing the essence of character, love and genius. As he has done so marvelously before and since, Woody Allen masterfully captures an immensely watchable slice of life that most of us will only have an opportunity to witness with this fine offering. For the film itself as well as the two stellar leads this is will go into my relatively short list of wonderful, favorite films.

I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired, and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it, given that he found some similarities in plot, but I must say, any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.There are so many things I like about Children of Heaven, and basically, the children Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) and Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) who play the siblings, will definitely tug at your heartstrings with their innocence. The story goes that Ali happened to lose his sister's shoes during an errand run, and coming from a poor family, that spells disaster. Not wanting to be punished for it, given that both understand the predicament they're in, and not wanting to trouble their parents with yet another expenditure, they devise an ingenious, somewhat mad hat plan, to share their shoes - Zahra goes to school in Ali's, before running back to exchange them so that Ali could attend his classes. And this leads to many comical moments and accidental scenes that will surely make you go awww, culminating in an exhilarating foot race which will put you on the edge of your seat.But the skill here that Majid Majidi possess, is not to sledgehammer these emotions down your throat. Children of Heaven doesn't need to, but has in itself this magic that comes forth through its simple yet meaningful story, and through the strength of both children's acting. I was pretty amazed that both Amir and Bahare have this very charming and natural charisma in fleshing out their characters, their banter being excellent, and at times, without a need for words. Truly, they are the stars of this film, and their abilities will put some established big name actors to shame too. Majid Majidi has created characters that endear, but yet not out- of-reach fictional, as they are easily identifiable given that hey, these are the kind of sibling love, or blood being thicker than water, that almost everyone would have experience, or heard about.Being my first Majid Majidi movie, I'm definitely piqued to want to watch a whole lot more of his films. The movie has superb production values, and like any other foreign movie, opened my eyes to the cultural and physical landscapes of countries that I've yet to visit. What I liked about it also is its showcase of the family, how both Ali and Zahra show this strength in maturity with their helping around the house, and being sensible, well-liked kids. It justifies the number of awards that it has won in festivals everywhere, and if you haven't watch this, please do. It's definitely highly recommended stuff!

It's not a story. It's an anthology of scenes, but in chronological order, I guess. I speculated that it was perhaps directed with Raging Bull's brooding style in mind, but the fundamental element of a troubled portrait like Raging Bull is the consistency of the gradual psychological self-destruction of its portrayed character. Mommie Dearest tells the story of a woman who adopts a girl, loves her, abuses her, treats her well, abuses her again, treats her well, has an affair, treats her well, hates her, loves her, etc. There is nothing shown to be driving Joan Crawford to be this way. It's a psychological drama without the psychology.The story is given no background. Only scenes of face value that don't elude to anything underneath. This backfires so badly upon the story that we're given the very incorrect feeling that Crawford led a very insulated life with her daughter, son, nanny, and occasional husband. If Christina Crawford's book is written anything like this, the ambiguity of it that has been commented on to no end---is it fact or fiction---is very clear It's fiction. The least the story could do would be to show Joan Crawford doing what she did Having lavish balls at her mansion constantly, scores of affairs, making several movies and having several arguments. These additions would not be gratuitous because having them would fill in her character's blanks perhaps. It would give us more to go on. Are we to believe her character only acts like this because she grew up poor? That could easily be part of it if she did in fact torture her daughter, but there is no possible way that could be the punctuation of her doings.The film's lack of vibe doesn't only come from the story's incomplete condition. It also comes from what I could easily consider to be literally the most stilted and unnatural acting I've ever seen. Faye Dunaway is passionate, temperamental, overdriven wild animal by the numbers. She is not terrible like nearly every male member of the cast, but a truly effective performance, once again like in Raging Bull, or any other docudrama, would be one that does not simply rely on enacting the documented losses of temper or any other external facet of the character but understands the internal intentions, whether they be intellectualized or simply felt. Aside from her, the cast is full of actors who seem scripted with every nuance of their performances. They are bad. Bad. For instance, one scene involves a fight between Crawford and the first of her lovers that the film cites, and as Dunaway recalls her lines and juxtaposes them with almost rhythmic gesticulation with no feeling, her lover delivers lines with the worst, most clearly scripted and transparently directed inflection. You see, when I write a review here, and I'm talking about the actors, I shouldn't even have to say words like inflection, gesticulation, recalling her lines, etc. A good performance from an actor uses those things the way a writer uses the. The film's high point is the infamous wire-hanger scene. It truly is scary. But as the film continues, it seem to forget about this scene, just as it forgets about every scene that precedes another.

That could easily be part of it if she did in fact torture her daughter, but there is no possible way that could be the punctuation of her doings.The film's lack of vibe doesn't only come from the story's incomplete condition. It also comes from what I could easily consider to be literally the most stilted and unnatural acting I've ever seen. Faye Dunaway is passionate, temperamental, overdriven wild animal by the numbers. She is not terrible like nearly every male member of the cast, but a truly effective performance, once again like in Raging Bull, or any other docudrama, would be one that does not simply rely on enacting the documented losses of temper or any other external facet of the character but understands the internal intentions, whether they be intellectualized or simply felt. Aside from her, the cast is full of actors who seem scripted with every nuance of their performances. They are bad. Bad. For instance, one scene involves a fight between Crawford and the first of her lovers that the film cites, and as Dunaway recalls her lines and juxtaposes them with almost rhythmic gesticulation with no feeling, her lover delivers lines with the worst, most clearly scripted and transparently directed inflection. You see, when I write a review here, and I'm talking about the actors, I shouldn't even have to say words like inflection, gesticulation, recalling her lines, etc. A good performance from an actor uses those things the way a writer uses the. The film's high point is the infamous wire-hanger scene. It truly is scary. But as the film continues, it seem to forget about this scene, just as it forgets about every scene that precedes another. When the film reaches its dramatic closing line, fades out, and rolls the credits with quietly dramatic music, we're wondering what hit us.

The film follows a British professor, Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee, of The Wicker Man), an archaeologist who has just made a finding of a frozen prehistoric creature in the depths of Manchuria. Alexander decides on transporting his archaeological finding via the trans-Siberian Express, expecting no problems. But things go bad before the train has even left the station, when a civilian drops dead in front of the crate holding the beast. And things aboard the train turn into a nightmare when the strange creature comes back to life, and begins terrorizing and murdering the passengers all aboard. But can the creature be stopped before killing off everyone? It's up to Professor Alexander to stop the murderous, unknown beast.While the story to this film may sound silly, Horror Express is an amusing and enjoyable little B-movie, despite the fact that it is a bit campy. In fact, it's very campy, it's the kind of movie that you can't really take seriously, but just go along for the ride. And if you can do that, what a fun (train) ride it is! Among the few horror films that take place aboard a moving train (which really is an excellent setting for a horror flick, I might add), this surely ranks up there with the 1980 slasher flick Terror Train, but they are both very different movies. Horror Express bears a unique premise (especially so considering the time it was made), and the brain-draining creature is a great villain for the story. It's an intriguing idea and the writing is pretty solid as well, with fairly believable dialog (if you can get past Lee's British accent and a few corny moments).The atmosphere in this film is very heavy and claustrophobic, which is why I think the train-setting is so great. It's effective and it achieves a sense of claustrophobia, because our characters really have nowhere to run to when trying to escape the creature. Hysteria is also a common element to the movie, and it gets heavy when the creature begins its take-over of the train passengers. There are quite a few very scary scenes, and those white-out, blood dripping eyes are something that I'll never forget. That white, bloody-eyed imagery is enough to give anyone the chills, I had to note that magnificent little element to the film. Our creature itself, which is alien and ape-like at the same time, is actually pretty frightening. Acting-wise, we have solid performances from Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, along with the supporting cast who all does pretty well. The ending is great too, and you can't forget that memorable music.Overall, Horror Express is a low-budget and entertaining midnight movie that will please fans of this type of film. It boasts a unique idea and there are a good handful of some creepy moments. Not to mention the presence of Lee and Cushing. It's no the kind of film you can take seriously, but it is an immensely fun little piece of horror cinema that most will find very entertaining. It's a retro, B-grade seventies horror movie that should be viewed by horror fans, because chances are that most of them will find it an enjoyable little ride. 7\/10, pushing an eight.

The Gov cannot find peace, even in his own household, where his wife and large number of offspring are all very astute of the back room political world that Daddy inhabits.But it is through the kids that 'Hap' learns of the Hero, Youth Leader, one Jefferson Smith(Jimmy Stewart). Smith is honest,hard working, knowledgeable, and a super student of American History. He is also very 'wet behind the ears.' When it comes to pragmatic dealing with real world problems, he has the outlook of a boy.An accidental tangling with Boss Taylor's Boondoggle, an unnecessary damn for the same river canyon that Smith would establish a 'NMational Boys' Camp', Smith is branded as being 'trouble'. Against his better judgment and wishes, Senator Paine has his own daughter, Susan(Astrid Allwin), get Smith away from the Senate and any knowledge of the grafting intent of its one section.Smith is told about the reason for his absence from the Senate and how and why it was orchestrated by Paine and his daughter. Emraged, he starts asking a lot of questions about the Dam project and about Taylor and his control of the Machine.They frame Smith and, well then the big showdown comes into play. The trumped up charges, the move to expel Smith seem too much, but another meeting with his Secretary, Saunders(Jean Arthur)sets him on the track for the battle in the Senate Chambers.The pivotal occurrences seem to all revolve on Claude Rains' Sen. Paine Character. His character (small 'c') is a highly complex blend of all that is good and bad in mankind. Joe Paine had once been an eager beaver of an innocent, much like his youthful Protégé, Smith. But along the line, Paine started excessively 'playing ball' and 'doing business' with special interests. His role was reduced to that of Whore. And the one scene that seems to break Senator Paine is a short and quiet for Mr. Claude Rains' character. At a sort of 'victory' party given by Taylor celebrating the successful frame job of Smith, Taylor is seen teasing some party girls (obviously some 'Bimbos')about which one would get some little trinkets or money, Paine looks on angry and tormented. The scene strongly reminding him of what he has made of his own daughter.The film's credits list only the 2 names of Jean Arthur and James Stewart as Stars above the title, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON. In a sense, just about any of the 10-15 or so players turned in 'starring' performances. Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell, Eugene Palette,Bulah Bondi,Ruth Donnelly,H.B.Warner,Piere Watkin, en ad infinitum, all gave top supporting, even career performances! We have to pay a special tribute to Harry Carey's portrayal of the Vice President(the President of the Senate). His VP is stern, business like,capable and experienced. Yet he is also a kindly and decent man. He remains impartial while the most serious charges are put on the seemingly guilty Smith. And besides, he looked so much like my Paternal Grandfather & namesake, John T. Ryan, who passed on in 1944, 2 years before my birth.Once again the masterful Mr. Frank Capra has taken this assembled group of favored actors and mixed them in with a fine, decent and believable story giving us what has to be a real, true slice of Americana.

I'm completely fine with that, because it was very entertaining. Woo never lets us down in that aspect. It just fails, and very badly I might add, to get its point across. Nobody really cares about the characters in this movie. It's impossible to. Joe Enders was a stock character, more or less, or at least morphed into one when he went back to war. The entire squadron was very stereotypical the bigot, the target of the hate who saves the bigot's bacon, the guy who thinks about his family too much, the oddball (Greek guy), and the main character's companion who is the only one he really bonds well with (Slater). Other than that, I would like to point out a few comical parts in this movie that completely ruin its dramatic effect. First and foremost, every explosion in the movie looks like a napalm bomb went off, even the grenades. The Japanese characters were bumbling morons who had no IQ or weapons capability. The marines used no tactics, and just charged or sprayed. In an alternate ending, Walker, Texas Ranger could have walked out and massacred all of the enemies on the island.
