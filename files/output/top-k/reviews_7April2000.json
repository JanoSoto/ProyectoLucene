Further, Osment should have gotten the Academy Award for being able to handle such awkward lines and still convince the audience that he was a real child.Third, did that ending suck or what?  I'm surprised that more people didn't see the plot twist coming, since it was thoroughly obvious from the behavior of Willis by the middle of the movie (i.e.  Why wasn't he having conversations with anyone except Osment?).  Actually, I didn't even know there was going to be a plot twist of any sort going into the movie, having not paid much attention to buzz and talk about the movie.  Further, the flashback and flashback montage revealing 'what really happened' could have been cut entirely, unless the director thought the audience was so stupid that it wouldn't get the previous five minutes and the blood on Willis.

It had an impact that was so strong that it's never left me--I've seen it many times since, and with each viewing the film seems to reveal new artistic richness and spiritual depth.William Wyler's direction is breathtaking.  One of the most moving scenes occurs early on in the film, when Homer, the young disabled Navy veteran, arrives at his family home and stands for a moment on the front lawn.  For that one second there is an exquisite stillness that communicates a depth of emotion that can't be expressed physically.  Then, just as the tension becomes almost unbearable, Homer's little sister Louella comes to the front door and runs out to greet him.  In a similar way, the scene where Al Stephenson comes home to his wife and children is so finely directed you can almost feel that you're in the apartment with them--that it's your husband or father come home to you from the war--and you're experiencing the sheer elation of their physical nearness.This aspect of the film--its portrayal of the joys and hardships of post-war readjustment and the veterans' experience--is what makes it so enlightening, honest and powerful.  As a young woman, I have never experienced wartime or had my father, brothers or friends go off to fight. The film moves swiftly but seamlessly from the initial joy of homecoming and reunion to the problems, anxieties and humiliations that the three veterans encounter as they attempt to build a new life for themselves and their families.I found it interesting how the film tries to give a picture of the different socio-economic backgrounds of the three men, and show the emergence of an affluent, market-driven economy.  While this in itself is not bad, different episodes in the film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity and justice.  Al's dealings with the young veteran Mr Novak, who comes to him for a service loan to buy a farm, and his later (slightly tipsy) speech to a business gathering show this.  Al declares at the end of his speech that when the bank lends money to poor veterans it will be a financial gamble but we'll be gambling on the future of this country.The film's interweaving of the characters and their struggles never falters and is deeply satisfying.  Even as Al and Milly, Homer and Wilma gradually move towards a happy resolution of their difficulties this positive strand of the film is counter-balanced by the focus on Fred, the courageous Air Force captain who, in the eyes of the commercial world is unqualified, suitable only for a job at a soda fountain, and in the eyes of his war bride, Marie, is only wonderful when he's dressed up in his officer's uniform.  Fred's situation seems only to deteriorate and at one point in the film, after he farewells his elderly father to leave town and look for work, the father finds the citations for Fred's medals and sits down to read them. As he reads the words describing Fred's bravery and dedication to duty while he was terribly wounded in his aircraft, Pat Derry's voice nearly breaks with pride and love for his son.  The film beautifully juxtaposes Fred's unselfish conduct and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice with the cold indifference of a country in peacetime that does not want him and seemingly has no place for him.The actors are uniformly impressive and really make their characters come alive.  Dana Andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell, as Homer and Wilma.  Personally, I loved Homer and Wilma's story the best among those of all the characters,and the resolution is a simple, sensitively shot scene that lifts the whole film to a new point of happiness, gratitude and release.  Both Cathy O'Donnell and Teresa Wright are lovely, gifted actresses with a slightly understated style, that is perfectly suited to the film's restrained but powerful tenor.  This is demonstrated especially well in the tense scene where Wilma tries to talk to Homer in the shed, and in the scene where Peggy confides her heartache to her parents.One feature that adds significantly to the film's quality is Hugo Friedhofer's score.  The music is remarkably fresh and undated, has a strong, classic sound, and is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental (a flaw often found in other 1940s film scores).The producer, Samuel Goldwyn, reportedly said of this film I don't care if it doesn't make a nickel...I just want every man, woman and child in America to see it.  Although I'm not American (I am Australian) I found this film, with its universal human themes and its portrayal of post-war readjustment, speaks to anyone who shares in this heritage of WWII.

You don't go in looking for great acting, intelligent dialogue or moving sub-plots.  You do, however, expect this- some great special effects- a high body count - the occasional suspensful scene- and a couple of quirky, expendable characters that keep you amused for a while until they get killed.Lake Placid had NONE of these things.Let's start with the effects &#150; or, more accurately, the &#145;effect' &#150; since there really wasn't much to look at other than the alligator.  The alligator was okay; he was big, he was nasty, and he moved a touch better than the giant monsters did back in the fifties.  The problem was, he really didn't DO anything.  Other than a few snappy scenes involving a helicopter and a bear, the alligator spent most of the film lazing about the lake and failing to kill anyone.  In the mass slaughter department, he just wasn't up to it. As for a high body count, more people die in an average episode of ER than were killed in this film.  Whereas you normally sit through a horror film saying &#150; `Oh no, I can't BELIEVE they killed off that character - I was just starting to like him', this film provokes the opposite reaction.  You hate ALL the characters and virtually none of them die.  Suspense was also sadly lacking in this film.  There wasn't a single moment where I felt scared, worried, concerned or even a little bit &#145;edgy'.   The only possible exception was the 80 minute mark, where I began to worry that the film was going to run for two hours.  Thankfully, it finished two minutes later.Finally, I come to the &#145;characters' &#150; a term I use loosely and only because convention dictates it.  I have NEVER hated a cast as much as I hated this one.  If I had have been there with them, I would have gladly lopped off their heads and fed them to the alligator, just to spare the audience from any further dialogue.  Bill Pulman is his usual unbearable self, playing yet another `hi, my name's Mr Average' type character.   Bridget Fonda (playing &#145;city chick roughs it in the country' &#150; gee, there's a new one) stinks up the place from beginning to end and absolutely BEGS to get eaten.  The PATHETIC romantic subplot between these two characters is as implausible as it is unbearable.  Betty White, said by some reviewers on this site to have &#145;stolen the show' quote unquote (which, I might add, would have been one of the easiest thefts in the history of cinema) was nothing short of EMBARASSING.  Sure, if you're thirteen years old you might find one of the Golden Girls swearing her head off hilarious, but for the rest of us, it was just lame. Brendan Gleeson's &#145;Sheriff Hank Keough' was abysmally unfunny and his friendship with &#145;kooky nut' Walt Lawson was nothing short of painful.

One is a burned-out bulgarian man who can only say Keyser Soze, the other is a cripple named Verbal Kint (played masterly by Kevin Spacey). It is a little difficult interviewing the bulgaraian as he is near death so it is up to Dave Kujan, a Customs interrogator to interview this cripple.

What Kint does is tomanipulate the other suspects in the group, heist-men Michael McManus (Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Keaton. Kevin Spacey becomes soon the real hero of the film managing the difficult but not uncommon trick of really being the leading role when technically being a supporting actor.

My only other complaint is regarding the mummy's bride.  When her character is introduced we see a powerful, strong and potent woman capable of anything for her passion.  However, she seems lacking after her several thousand year slumber in comparison to her lover.  She seems almost desperate, whereas I expected her to be of a more determined demeanor.Otherwise the film is a superior story about the ancient horror monster, the mummy.  I was very pleased to see a film that had such magnificent effects that actually had a well rounded story.  Too often the effects, when of such quality, are the body of the film and the story is sacrificed.  Not so in this film.

I found Judas annoying too but without him Jesus's Death would not have been as great.  I read one review where a person critized Lucas for using state of the art technology. He wanted him to use the same technology as he did in ep.4,5,6. Lucas is a person who likes to stay five years ahead of the Special Effects industry not fifteen years behind. The academy can take their oscars and shove them directly up there American Beauty a**es. Because the best movie of 1999 and probably the decade is The Phantom Menence. As I hear all the criticism it makes me relate to a line spoken by Darth Sidous, I find your lack of faith disturbing.

This time he goes to New York City to help his co-creator Ben Jahrvi (Fisher Stevens) making toys-tiny robots that look just like Five. And he has named himself Johnny Five! Can you imagine what will happen when Johnny realizes that he's in a big city (No one has told that to him...he was put in a box to be transferred from Montana to where Ben is located...because they know how curious and crazy for input he is) and then goes out exploring just about everywhere?Johnny talks a lot more like a human than he used to, but people still treat him like a ridiculous-looking machine, they don't know he is alive, and they are not willing to believe it. As Johnny Five helps Ben and his partner Fred Ritter (Michael McKean), we can see Johnny is very intelligent, cheerful, full of life and loves to help. And then, Oscar Baldwin (Jack Weston), a man who's about to steal some really valuable jewelry, notices Johnny's being naive, enthusiastic about helping people and his abilities. He and two other thieves proceed to cheat and use Johnny Five. But Johnny will go chasing them soon after he's aware of what has happened. The movie is dramatic, breath-taking, dynamic and heart-warming.Interestingly, the endings of the original and of the sequel are quite opposite in some way, but they are both happy ones. Tim Blaney, as the voice of Johnny Five, successfully brought the character to life. Michael McKean as Fred, a smart, a little bit greedy salesman, who basically is not a bad guy. He played so beautifully that he made Fred become a very charming guy!I want to thank the creators, the entire cast and the crew for this extraordinary work. Also, the soundtrack is great. Johnny Five is so charismatic, When you watch this film you will fall in love with this remarkable life form immediately!

Like Hitchcock's Rope and Dial M For Murder (among others), this is a murder story where the audience doesn't want the murderer to be caught. But, whereas in those Hitchcock films the viewer simply wants to see how the murderers' succeed in their complex plans, in Mr. Ripley there is also genuine sympathy for the main character, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon). The murders he commits are done in an awkward way, and there is no pleasure in watching these scenes build up (as in M) nor in seeing how the trails are covered (as in Rope). The sympathetic nature of Tom Ripley brings him closer to Norman Bates in Hitchcock's Psycho. Like Bates, Ripley does not murder for fun or profit, but because he is forced to. Only the first killing, the murder of Ripley's best friend Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) is a crime of passion, and because of Greenleaf's behaviour the deed seems almost justified. The difference between Ripley and Bates is that, regardless of his motives, Ripley (unlike Bates) is still conscious of his actions. Surprisingly enough, this does not lessen our sympathy for Ripley. On the contrary we accept Ripley's crimes because we understand why he commits them. I guess we all would choose the evil we can relate to over the one we can't, and that's why we're less afraid of the unconfident Tom Ripley than the schizophrenic Norman Bates.One of the main reasons why The Talented Mr. Ripley succeeds in portraying a likable murderer is Matt Damon. He looks just like the everyman Tom Ripley is, and his acting hits the right notes throughout the film. His nyanced performance perfectly displays the mannerisms of a man with low self-esteem and fragile personality. So good is Damon, that we have no problems in understanding why the poor and average-looking Ripley both loves and envies the rich and beautiful Dickie Greenleaf, played by the angel-like Jude Law. In my books Matt Damon was the best male lead of 1999, no matter what the The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says.
