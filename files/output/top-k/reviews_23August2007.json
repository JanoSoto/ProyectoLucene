Get it at Amazon.)One of the Message Boards threads at IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie only because of him. Obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally. The brilliant, and I mean brilliant, performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by audiences, but by the Academy and by most of the critics.I think I know why. First, the plot--or actually just the setup--is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia--Rose, Ginny, and Caroline. And I guess Larry (Jason Robards) works for Lear. The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the Bard. The problem is, in Smiley and Moorhouse's story, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities. His only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it.The second problem--and this is one I cannot personally attest to, not having read Smiley's novel--is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. Still, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen. The vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist. Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley's novel.A third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse's alone. She began her directing career with the very well done Aussie film Proof (1991) starring Russell Crowe. She follow it up with How to Make an American Quilt (1995) which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. However it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick. In a sense A Thousand Acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad daddy. He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them. He ran the household with an iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear. And then he goes to Rose, who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership, and hooks up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, the way they often appear in romance novels. I think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story.Having said all this, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was biased against men, but in this story it needed to be. I think Moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty. And the acting by Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational. They seemed to feed off of one another in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving. In particular Pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent-up anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance. And the skill with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny's character as she went from a ninny, as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else. He needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back. And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good.I predict that this film, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on DVD. My question is, whatever happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has yet to director her fourth feature film. When she does I hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well. I think, actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film, but didn't pay enough attention to the others. In addition to the unnuanced father, Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished, leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did. And the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins. They needed to be engaged and involved.

Highly recommended for its unique indie flavor. More please!

After a bad landing on the planet, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in until it is too late.So, like every classic, I always watch them so late so there's no surprise here. I was really looking forward to the film, since it was being called a horror or sci-fi classic from people to people. But the problem with that is that the ending and some memorable scenes tend to go out in public for people who haven't seen the movie, like me.So the first 20 minutes passed. Nothing special there. I honestly thought the action would start right away because I've seen AVP before this movie so I expected things people wouldn't expect because the film was made 1979 and I've seen it in 2007. I knew the ending and I kinda knew a bit of the middle so that probably lowered my rating for this movie.One other reason why I might not give this movie a perfect rating is the clichés. Of course, if I've seen this movie in 1979, it wouldn't be called clichés but to let you know, so many movies pulled off the same clichés so I can't help myself but roll my eyes when characters do stupid things to get themselves killed.On a better note, I love this movie for its intensity, thrills, and suspense. Actually, there is one pop up scene, probably the only pop up scene, that made me yell out loud. That's how suspenseful the movie is. The death scenes are well made since you wouldn't know how they would die (but you would certainly know who would die).Sigourney Weaver's performance as the heroine was, I suppose, heroing and tough. The special effects were decent, as for the Alien design. I have to admit, though, the last 15 minutes of the movie was annoying because of the light flashing constantly on the screen, to heighten tension, of course.I wouldn't say this is the greatest movie ever. If I'd seen this in 1979, my opinion might be different, but no, this is 2007. I would say this film is a great sci-fi thriller which keeps the suspense and tension throughout. Other from that, there's nothing else to say about this movie.

The reason is that drama (the bedrock of all western art) depends on characterization and the playing out of these in various situations. But the lead character in this film, Lawrence, is an enigma, and remains so throughout the film. In a sense, he is very flat. However, in that he is an enigmatic figure we must change our view of him. That is, we must see him as being without definitive attributes one way or another. He twists in the wind, his true nature forever hidden. It is not good for dramatic purposes but for Lawrence it MUST be so, otherwise there would be no reason to make this film in the first place. We can never KNOW Lawrence -- we can only observe him from a distance, and stand, as apparently so many others have, in awe and wonder. Then we have the cast. My goodness. What an extraordinary collection of talent. The film is chock full of fabulous moments where the greatest actors speak wonderful lines. For example, some of my favorites Guiness And I...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba... The line was set up beautifully and filmed such as to make it climactic moment. Very beautiful.

As far as I know, there are no lyrics in it. It sounds a bit electric. I tried to find it on Google but that won't work. The song is not included on the soundtrack. Somehow it sounded really familiar to me. I can not upload the video part because I saw the movie on television. Please let me know if you have the answer! I really like this song so some help would be great. (I didn't really like the movie, I did like the music. For me, the movie was a bit too long and whining almost.

Steve Buscemi as Rockhound - a great actor and some of his one liners are excellent. Peter Stormare as the Cosmonaut is damn funny, and many of the actors all add something. Bruce Willis hits a chord with me as a Father, as I was in poor health and possibly leaving my only daughter. Willis had me laughing at the beginning when he tried to shoot Ben Affleck and then I was in tears as he said goodbye to his daughter. Is it 2001 A Space Odyssey, no it is not (but then I think that is highly over-rated) and am I a pretentious critic? No - I will watch a film on its merits and judge it for that. If they had tried to portray this film as a deep and meaningful comment on the human races attitude to our planet, then yes it failed miserably.

I don't even plan a cruise on a huge liner, much-less on a yacht. During unexpected situations, oceans and seas (even lakes) don't give you any place to run. Yet, I AM attracted to sea-stories - younger people should take a look at Lifeboat, with Tallulah Bankhead. Because the whole film is shot in the lifeboat, character-development is its plot.Dead Calm develops its characters - except for Billy Zane (Hughie Warriner) very quickly. I liked that it didn't take-up half the picture before the story began. Terry Haryes (screenwriter) quickly defines how a fragilely weepy woman becomes a fighter, when it is necessary. There isn't a handbook that lists just what to do, and such desperate situations quickly confuse almost anyone on action to take.Director Phillips Noyce (never heard of him) certainly produced a carefully thought-out plot. I found fault with none of it, except I agree John Ingram (Sam Neil) set-out for The Orpheum just a tad hastily, leaving his wife with a nutty-acting guy - I'd have thrown him back and sailed out of there. But, we need silly action to give the story more frightening scenes. Although John's actions on The Orpheum were thrilling and seemed to be what an experienced sailor would do, I'd have gotten right back in my dinghy and left that ship. I also wondered what happened to the lifeboat seen trailing the ship. after he gets it to sailing. Why build a raft ? Again, after a harrowing attempt to get off the ship would cause almost anyone not to think rationally.Nicole Kidman (Rae Ingram) played her role skillfully. The cinematography was gorgeous and grotesque. Although Neil was stellar in his role, Zane stole the picture. Bravo! I liked every scene in Dead Calm - I own the DVD and watch it often - even liked the tacked-on ending that so many thought was unnecessary. I recommend it to any audience - I get so caught-up in the story, I don't try to make any reasonable explanations for its few weaknesses. It's a 10-er....
