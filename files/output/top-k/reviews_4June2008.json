It does a great job of keeping everything suspenseful (even for those who know the story), but still not taking everything too seriously. And although I always like a dramatic and gory ending, I was so in love with Philip Lombard that I was extremely happy when he and Vera did not die. Also, I don't know how, in a 1940's movie, it would have been possible to kill everyone off without being corny or melodramatic. This was the first movie I had ever seen Barry Fitzgerald in, and he got my attention immediately with his role as the fatherly but nevertheless mysterious judge. Every other actor in the movie was excellent as well. The only problems I had are that the character of Anthony Marston was altered and turned into a ludicrous Russian prince (which confused me the first time I watched it), and the humor in the movie did not amuse me at all (but then, it was made in 1945). I'm waiting for someone to make some really intense modern version of And Then There Were None, but for now the best substitute I can recommend is this one suspenseful but fun.

The characters are beyond unsympathetic and venture into the realm of embarrassing. Harper is a pathetic and hopeless individual if she made it as far in life as her storyline says she did without the skills she seems to lack. Worse, the life lessons she is supposedly learning clearly aren't sinking in if,after realizing her love interest is nothing but a lecherous, perverted, no talent, broke, lying loser who preys on naive, helpless girls when he exposes his intentions in LA at his former 'collector' friends' house, she happily goes along for the ride with only a little tantrum. Absurd. The collection of similarly abused women at the finale is just gross (Class of '85! Good gawwwwwwwd). This film is such a poorly executed self indulgence that it doesn't even live up to irony. Just plain awful. I can't even say that its worth watching for a laugh, because there's nothing funny about. Characters don't develop in any substantiated way. One second people are one thing, the next moment another, for no reason. We are led to believe that harper becomes successful. How?

Suddenly she just appears, wearing a mournful-yet-put-together looking black dress instead of her usual MC hammer style washed out jeans (in the late 90's? San Fran? really?) and tee shirt. Jesus. Where'd that come from? A hopeless attempt at a heartfelt art movie that subverts its own intentions with its meaningless artifice and sloppy, contrived, indulgent imagery.

Why shouldn't they, after all, when they both suspect that their respective spouses are having an affair? But this, for Wong Kar Wai, is far too easy for the audience to expect. We want these two characters, Chow (Tony Leung) and Chan (Maggie Cheung) to be together not simply as friends, or even playing their 'game' of acting out like they're married, but fully invested in each other's ever growing affection and companionship. That they want to, desire to be together, and cannot- or, in fact, will not- is part of the challenge. And it's quietly, subtly thrilling.It's always something special to see a filmmaker challenge the expectations of an audience saturated with the usual, and In the Mood for Love is certainly unusual in the respect of how it treats its characters which is with a frankness, naturalism that seems at first to be not out of any old 50s or 60s melodrama. It's because these two people, who live so close to one another and grow a bond as they do, that one thinks that they are bound to be made for each other. Whether they are or are not isn't the point, however, but how little by little the same things that go on for them, the routine of day to day life, gets splintered. The perception of their realities are broken down until all they have left is each other, and out of fear, apprehension, all the common fears of adultery, they don't go where they know their respective spouses have. It's almost more appealing to see their restraint, the passion buried right under the surface.But the director doesn't make this a detached experience. On the contrary, despite his ditching of the constant hand-held and strange lighting of the 90s, things move at a pace that is, simply, meditative on romance, the little details that can come up with repetition, the slow-motion, the violin music. Just a simple pan done across a dinner between Chow and Chan is extraordinary for what precisely is shown. Objects seem elegant, like Chan's dresses, which she wears just to go out for an errand, or even some things that at this point should be a cliché in movies the look of cigarette smoke, and scenes with rain. He and Christopher Doyle bring one into, as it goes, another feeling within scenes that add drama, sorrow, and, of course, love, where otherwise it would be just mundane and kind of strange. Towards the end (i.e. Cambodia) it gets strange anyway, but for a while it's sublime.And lest not forget stars Leung and Cheung, both regulars of WKW's films, who inhabit these characters as opposed to playing specific parts; they're people sort of stuck where they are in life, one at a printing press the other a secretary, and they both have possible dreams for themselves (mostlty for Chow as a serial novelist). Together, they start acting out the roles of each others spouses, sort of filling in the spaces left behind, and the actors convey the sense of slight hope within this hopeless relationship that few I could imagine ever pulling off period, much less in this setting.It's all a combination of factors, between the subtle experimentation with the direction, the realistic edge of the actors, the music, the clothes, the direct lighting, all of it comes together better than in any other film I've seen from this HK romantic wildman. This might not mean it's for everyone, however; it's the kind of film one gets tuned into, like some far-off radio station that's clear as day, but uncommon in a lot of ways, too.

Fill-in-the-blanks melodrama moves along fluidly, yet intrinsically keeps tripping itself up. Director Jonathan Demme wants the overstuffed tale to unfold slowly, but by explaining so little about the central characters he risks alienating viewers. Within the first ten minutes, Demme employs a technical effect which looks (and plays) cheap, followed by an outpouring of sorrowful family anger which gets the first act off on the wrong foot. The narrative is, in fact, so fuzzy that we're not sure who Oprah Winfrey's character is, how she makes her living, or what her relationship is with her daughter (who appears disturbed). When the stranger Beloved is readily welcomed by Winfrey into the home, talking in a staccato sing-song, we're not told why. Demme seems to think the mood music and the haunted\/loving expression on Winfrey's face will tell us what we need to know, but this backfires (the film is practically intent on shutting out logic, replacing it with soul-bearing emotion). Perhaps in an attempt to retain Morrison's prose, the screenwriters don't allow these people to have normal conversations (it's all steeped in the hypothetical). Beloved has an interesting pictorial look, although the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is too clear and pristine (as was The Color Purple, for example), and the tidy yards and weathered rooms look too Hollywood. Demme darts about avoiding explanations, while Thandie Newton's Beloved skitters about like a banshee. Winfrey, who also co-produced the movie, gives an uneven performance hindered by the dialogue; her lack of sparkle reminds us she can be a gravely intelligent presence, but her solemn looks of longing don't register anything intriguing (we're supposed to be drawn to this woman because of Winfrey's personality, I assume, yet with Oprah so subdued we're left with nothing but a skin-deep portrait).

In 1968, there was no way of knowing that a little film would open the floodgates for a new era in cinematic fear, oft-refined by the original ringmaster himself, George Romero. But it did, and for fans of the genre, it is a contribution we should all be thankful for.For those who know Romero and his contributions to horror (while ignoring misfired sidesteps like Bruiser and Monkey Shines), Chilly Billy's line is a contradiction of the anarchic chaos at work in his filmography. The director has often stated that his debut is about revolution (and it certainly came at the end of a decade known for at least declaring it), but as I age, I find myself wondering just whose revolution is taking place amid all the warring elements (unless, of course, Romero is commenting on a revolutionary mentality, in which many factions adhering to many different ideologies and persuasions knock heads and only worsen preexisting problems). It has become more apparent with each successive film that Romero hedges his bets with both human and zombie, while pledging a moderate loyalty to neither.The ambiguity and cynicism of Night still leaves a seriously unsettling mark. If anything, Romero set his film apart from the classical style of Universal, the period pieces of Hammer, and the Gothic offerings of Italy's Mario Bava by transgressing mere hints of moralistic commentary and twist-of-fate ironies and transposing them into an instantly recognizable, rural American setting (the countryside of scenic Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)&#150;populated by people not unlike our friends and neighbors&#150;therefore blurring the line between cinema as mere gaudy escapism and pushing it closer toward something resembling pure, visceral experience. The perfectly integrated use of stock music only adds to the unfolding documentary reality.The film begins in a deserted world, save for brother-and-sister duo Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner), who have traveled to an isolated graveyard to place a wreath on their father's grave. There is an altercation with a mysterious man, and a terrified Barbra flees to an isolated farmhouse. Soon after, night falls and a faceless horde of zombies descend upon the building, as a small group of survivors take an increasingly desperate stand against the walking undead. Romero (and co-writer John Russo) uses this seemingly simple scenario to catapult fireballs of scientific and sociopolitical subtext through the general survival plot. And the survivors are an interesting bunch, shrewdly undercutting the director's point that a half-dozen humans in an escalating situation will find ways to pick apart, antagonize, and even kill one another, equating themselves (if not more so) with the bloodthirsty carnivores outside the door.My first experience with Night came late in my childhood, with next to no foreknowledge of what I was in store for. Responding in a manner similar to how I'd later (at 12) react to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, I found myself shocked, impressed, and generally in awe of what I had just witnessed&#150;granted, I found the dialog scenes of the middle act to be stretched and tedious (and if the film retains a glaring flaw, that's it), but the film overall broke a lot of my perceptions of what was acceptable to show in a black-and-white film. Accustomed to the goreless, vulgarity-free propriety of movies-sans-color, I expected a relatively coy experience (which couldn't be farther from what I got), and nothing remotely resembling up-close gore, glimpses of nudity, or a half-dozen curse words. In addition to its commentary and well-crafted suspense, another reason Night holds up so well is because it truly is a turning point in the streamlining of carnage in mainstream cinema.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"4 June 2008","score":"","review":" Of all the lines uttered, spoken, and screamed over the course of Night of the Living Dead, this one (by way of Pittsburgh TV anchorman Bill Chilly Billy Cardille) may be the most chilling and ironic. In 1968, there was no way of knowing that a little film would open the floodgates for a new era in cinematic fear, oft-refined by the original ringmaster himself, George Romero. But it did, and for fans of the genre, it is a contribution we should all be thankful for.For those who know Romero and his contributions to horror (while ignoring misfired sidesteps like Bruiser and Monkey Shines), Chilly Billy's line is a contradiction of the anarchic chaos at work in his filmography. The director has often stated that his debut is about revolution (and it certainly came at the end of a decade known for at least declaring it), but as I age, I find myself wondering just whose revolution is taking place amid all the warring elements (unless, of course, Romero is commenting on a revolutionary mentality, in which many factions adhering to many different ideologies and persuasions knock heads and only worsen preexisting problems). It has become more apparent with each successive film that Romero hedges his bets with both human and zombie, while pledging a moderate loyalty to neither.The ambiguity and cynicism of Night still leaves a seriously unsettling mark. If anything, Romero set his film apart from the classical style of Universal, the period pieces of Hammer, and the Gothic offerings of Italy's Mario Bava by transgressing mere hints of moralistic commentary and twist-of-fate ironies and transposing them into an instantly recognizable, rural American setting (the countryside of scenic Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)&#150;populated by people not unlike our friends and neighbors&#150;therefore blurring the line between cinema as mere gaudy escapism and pushing it closer toward something resembling pure, visceral experience. The perfectly integrated use of stock music only adds to the unfolding documentary reality.The film begins in a deserted world, save for brother-and-sister duo Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner), who have traveled to an isolated graveyard to place a wreath on their father's grave. There is an altercation with a mysterious man, and a terrified Barbra flees to an isolated farmhouse. Soon after, night falls and a faceless horde of zombies descend upon the building, as a small group of survivors take an increasingly desperate stand against the walking undead. Romero (and co-writer John Russo) uses this seemingly simple scenario to catapult fireballs of scientific and sociopolitical subtext through the general survival plot. And the survivors are an interesting bunch, shrewdly undercutting the director's point that a half-dozen humans in an escalating situation will find ways to pick apart, antagonize, and even kill one another, equating themselves (if not more so) with the bloodthirsty carnivores outside the door.My first experience with Night came late in my childhood, with next to no foreknowledge of what I was in store for. Responding in a manner similar to how I'd later (at 12) react to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, I found myself shocked, impressed, and generally in awe of what I had just witnessed&#150;granted, I found the dialog scenes of the middle act to be stretched and tedious (and if the film retains a glaring flaw, that's it), but the film overall broke a lot of my perceptions of what was acceptable to show in a black-and-white film. Accustomed to the goreless, vulgarity-free propriety of movies-sans-color, I expected a relatively coy experience (which couldn't be farther from what I got), and nothing remotely resembling up-close gore, glimpses of nudity, or a half-dozen curse words. In addition to its commentary and well-crafted suspense, another reason Night holds up so well is because it truly is a turning point in the streamlining of carnage in mainstream cinema. As much as Romero enjoys pushing our moral and political buttons, his films endure for just giving us a blood-caked good time. With zombies.
