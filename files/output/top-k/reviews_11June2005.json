Like Hitchcock, he has the uncanny ability to project flawless and edge-of-your-seat suspense from absolutely nothing. He is a man however that bases much of his films on personal trauma. He was born into the Holocaust in which his mother died. And later with his film career established, was a victim of his Wife's murder by the notorious 1970s cult criminal Charles Manson and his band of supporters. It is following his wife's bloody and traumatizing death that he turned to sadistic, paranoid and frantic style film making. Dark, gloomy, alienated and violent worlds compose his films which have their own recognizable look and feel Polanski is famous for. 'Frantic', I believe was Polanski's heart and soul and definitive film. The whole atmosphere the film ejects feels so personal in contrast with Polanski's real life experience.It begins with a sad European score composed by the great Ennio Morricone, in a time when it's supposed to be a happy business trip for Dr. Richard Walker and his wife Sondra who have also come to relax and explore Paris, the city they both shared on their honeymoon. They check into an expensive hotel in the early hours of the morning, eager to refresh and rest following a long, difficult flight. Everything seems at ease and subtle until Richard finds that the luggage they picked up at the airport isn't theirs. Proceeding a phone call to the airport regarding the error, Richard decides a shower is most appropriate to loosen him up. What follows is the most devastating experience he'll ever fall victim to. A phone call. Sondra picks up. Sondra says something, but is unheard due the thudding shower. Sondra leaves. A bell rings. Sondra, can you get that honey? Richard repeatedly yells. Coming out of the shower and opening the door, he is presented with breakfast and no sign of Sondra. Richard is then awoken a few hours after this in his bed and breakfast again with no sign of his wife. He is informed by a bellhop that his wife sent up a few different things from the lobby. Richard gets dressed and heads down to the lobby, informing staff Sondra has gone and it's unknown of her whereabouts. No messages. No letters. No phone calls. No sign of life. He then frantically heads outside. What follows is the most mentally exhausting search for his wife as he questions ordinary people, contacts bureaucratic French heads of security and police, clashes with American Embassy officials and finally finds the owner of the Luggage he picked up at the airport - a beautiful Parisian girl named Michelle who's involved with drugs and the underground with half the answers - leading him to uncover an international conspiracy. They both must elude stalkers, detectives, the police and the intelligence agencies in order to come closer to the truth behind his wife's disappearance.The suspense this film manages to emulate is so natural, because the situations are so real. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Richard Walker is a 'tour-de-force' and perhaps one the most realistic performances you'll ever see. The emotion and frustration he encompasses involves the audience to such a level, the audience themselves become as 'Frantic' as the name of the film implies. You empathize with him all the way through. You understand everything he is going through. The feeling of being in a foreign country, of being completely helpless, where absolutely nobody can help you - alienated. Harrison Ford's delivery is what makes him such a unique actor. In my opinion, he is one of few actors in the world we can relate to when watching his films. Seeing this film for the first time, I noticed parallels between Ford's character Richard and Roman Polanski. They have suffered very similar trauma. The longing for the loved one. The loss of his wife. The lengths at which he would go to save her life had he the chance. Clearly Polanski's real life experiences inspired him to make this masterpiece. His brilliant direction suggests he put his heart and soul into its creation. Emmanuelle Seigner, Polanski's late wife, portrays her Parisian girl role to perfection. She is so beautiful, and her presence adds a European authenticity to the film.The film's music is the most important in creating a sense of place. Ennio Morricone's suspenseful soundtrack accompanies the film with many poignant moments. However, it is Grace Jones' famous song 'Strange' that gives the film its indisputable authenticity in creating a genuine Parisian feel to the gloomy and frustrating atmosphere Polanski so vividly brings to the screen.'Frantic' is unfortunately one of the most forgotten works in Polanski's long film making career. Upon its release in theaters, the box-office wasn't kind and people quickly forgot about it. However it did find life on Video and Television. I hope more people will discover this true masterpiece which I personally believe to be Polanski's definitive work. No director in the world can so masterfully portray lonely, alienating worlds in which our complete sense of hope is erased. Unfortunately, his unique style and direction are influenced by personal trauma, but he has delivered some of the most influential psychological thrillers in the history of the art - even Alfred Hitchcock would have agreed.

After all, here's a movie that attacks product, profit and the capitalist doctrine and fails to be consumed - not what anyone intended but would it really do for the people involved to make an enormous windfall on the back of its release? It hardly matters anyway because anyone involved in Fight Club must have known that they'd made something so good that it would be adequate reward just to be associated with it. It's a seminal piece of work - a perfect conflation of visual and conceptual imagination that's as deceptive as one of Tyler's bars of soap. You may have thought you were going to see a movie about men beating each other up and the delicious truth is that that's just what many Americans DID think only to be confronted by a film that challenged the most basic assumptions upon which the western world functions - namely that unrestrained, free market commercial enterprise increases wealth and subsequently the quality of life. But Planet Starbucks isn't a paradise, it's nothingness and here's a film that says so more directly than most. Ed Norton's narrator is the emptiness at the heart of the system, emasculated by modernism, numbed by consumption - his life is a corporate by-product and the need to feel some kind of quantifiable human emotion creates Tyler Durden, an unrestrained force for personal liberation. Tyler's destructive counter-cultural revolution is an unflinching satirical knife to the throat of the thinking that blunts so many of us and it's astonishing to see this level of angry denunciation in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Fincher's movie is punk rock film-making, indifferent to the generic considerations that shape most American cinema and one which forces you to think about yourself and the forces that control your life. Freedom is an illusion Tyler shows us and Fincher reinforces this notion by drawing attention to the medium's illusionary potential in a series of virtuoso sequences which shatter that so-called forth wall just as the characters try and break free from the all-consuming commercial blandification of the modern world. A great film the first time you see it, a different film the second time and even better - Fight Club is a perfectly composed reaction to the modern age and its false promises. This movie really does have something important to say, whether you're ready to hear it or not is a different matter. Liberation starts here kids.

But Planet Starbucks isn't a paradise, it's nothingness and here's a film that says so more directly than most. Ed Norton's narrator is the emptiness at the heart of the system, emasculated by modernism, numbed by consumption - his life is a corporate by-product and the need to feel some kind of quantifiable human emotion creates Tyler Durden, an unrestrained force for personal liberation. Tyler's destructive counter-cultural revolution is an unflinching satirical knife to the throat of the thinking that blunts so many of us and it's astonishing to see this level of angry denunciation in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Fincher's movie is punk rock film-making, indifferent to the generic considerations that shape most American cinema and one which forces you to think about yourself and the forces that control your life. Freedom is an illusion Tyler shows us and Fincher reinforces this notion by drawing attention to the medium's illusionary potential in a series of virtuoso sequences which shatter that so-called forth wall just as the characters try and break free from the all-consuming commercial blandification of the modern world.

After all, here's a movie that attacks product, profit and the capitalist doctrine and fails to be consumed - not what anyone intended but would it really do for the people involved to make an enormous windfall on the back of its release? It hardly matters anyway because anyone involved in Fight Club must have known that they'd made something so good that it would be adequate reward just to be associated with it.

It is not intended to tell Picasso's story. Picasso was brilliant, spectacular, the living center of the world of art and a sexual magnet. Women wanted him and, king that he was, Picasso viewed their adoration as no more than his due. Francoise Gilot, a talented painter in her own right - but no Picasso - lives for ten years a life which for her is absolutely worth the pain. And when the pain is so grave that she will surely be overwhelmed, she stands up and leaves. The pain doesn't go away instantly, but it does go away, in time. In one memorable scene, Gilot, at home with the baby, questions Picasso's absences, his obvious womanizing. He tells her in no uncertain terms that he will do as he chooses, that his life outside their home is none of her business. She has no right to question him. He doesn't say, Take it or leave it, but that is the unmistakable message. She takes it, for a few more years, and another child. It would be interesting to know whether Gilot, who was born in 1921 and is apparently still with us, harbors regret. I cannot imagine that she does. Of course she would have enjoyed that ten years better if Picasso had been able to love, in some recognizable way. But would she trade that life for one less magnificent? For one that would not be a good movie? Hardly.The acting is of course perfect. Anthony Hopkins becomes the man Picasso. Natascha McElhone, Julianne Moore and Susanna Harker tell us the truth.

That's probably true, but despite my being a conservative, I didn't mind this underlying tone. 2. The machismo, at time, is so over-the-top it's like watching a WWF wrestling match--which shouldn't be surprising due to Rowdy Roddy Piper (a pro-wrestler) playing the lead character.

But in the movie Omega is substituted for Omicron. This little detail pretty much sums up this little film. Pumpkin ALMOST crosses the legal, politically correct, and taboo topic line many times but always stops short. Unable to decide if it wants to be a satire, a political commentary, or a serious message movie it waffles back and forth. All this is very frustrating plus it's never a good idea to flaunt where you could have gone had you not gutlessly backed off.The result is far less satisfying than if the screenwriter had just maintained a consistent direction. For example, the satire elements actually work pretty well. The visual imagery of films is spoofed as sorority girl Ricci's first bump on the road of life is followed by a montage of imperfection-rats, decaying garbage, a dead bird, etc. which have always been there but which she is just seeing for the first time. Then there are the repeated condescending references to the Chinese sorority sister. And Ricci's attempted suicide using the entire contents of the medicine cabinet, including contact lens solution and Pepto-bismol.

Both Peter and Clark are high school students struggling to fit in. Both have a love interest that seems out of reach; Mary Jane for Peter and Lana Lang for Clark. Both budding superheroes come from modest households and yet also have warm and caring adoptive families. Both of them have rich best friends who flirt with the darker side of human nature; Harry Osborn and Lex Luthor. Eventually both their best friends will become their nemeses. And the fathers of their best friends, Norman Osborn and Lionel Luthor, both extend genuine fatherly admiration for Peter and Clark respectively.As for the movie itself, Spider-man is an excellent translation of comic book to silver screen. Along the way there were some liberties taken, like the fact that Peter's ability to shoot webs is another result of the genetically modified spider's bite rather than his manufacturing of web shooters as was shown in the comics, but all in all the spirit of the source material is maintained. The action sequences and CGI were thrilling upon first viewing in the cinema and they hold up fairly well today although it has to be remembered that technology pushes ever forward. But the action scenes are only a secondary pleasure of the film. The primary pleasure is in watching the relationship between the characters unfurl. At the risk of sounding like a sap, I thought Tobey and Kirsten did a marvelous job in showing how young Shakesperean romantic love develops. I truly felt the euphoria that such an emotion generates. To use a cliché, the two had great chemistry. The warmth and caring of the Parker household was also very touching and the tragedy of Ben Parker's demise, frankly, gets to me every time. To me, however, the most intriguing relationships are the ones between Harry and Norman and Harry and Peter. The viewer can empathize with Harry's yearning for love and recognition from the senior Osborn and the jealousy he must feel at his father's interest in Peter. The scene where Harry concedes that his father was 'right about M.J., right about everything' and Norman admits that he 'hasn't always been there' for his son was played to great effect by James Franco and Willem Dafoe. The relationship between Peter and Harry is also a marvel (no pun intended) to watch unfold. We see their almost brotherly camaraderie at the field trip turn into understated awkwardness and tension over Harry's interest in Peter's girl. The mutual empathy over the parallel losses of their fathers briefly brings them together again until Harry swears a vendetta against Peter's alter ego meaning they are now enemies. Great stuff! I can't wait to see how this develops in further installments of the franchise. All the secondary characters are well cast also. Special mention must be made of Bonesaw (played by real life wrestler Randy 'Macho Man' Savage) and J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons who to a degree reprises his role as Sheriff Pearl Johnson in The Gift which not coincidentally was also directed by Raimi). If I have one minor quibble it would be that I wish that the Peter's first love from the comics, Gwen Stacy, could somehow have been written in. She is such a great character. Then again, to do so would probably dilute the Pete-M.J. story arc. The two-disc editions have a wealth of info and special features, more than enough to satisfy the most ravenous curiosity over the film.

But I've no reason to complain. Very nicely put together indeed. Most of the clips from the old films work wonderfully in the context, some are a bit more off editing- and humour-wise - not too much, though. The resulting exchanges between Martin and the bogarts are often very amusing, but some of the clip-free moments are so good one can't help but wonder what would've happened if they had done it without the extracts. That question remains, as does another one Did I just contradict myself?Everything from the title sequences to the choreography is done in homage to noir. I know nothing of music, I'll tell you that, but the score here by Miklós Rózsa plays amusingly on its predecessors and is otherwise one of the best I've paid attention to - which would elsewhere be noted as a bad thing; here, it's part of the joke and thus allowed to distract.

There are movies that go so far off the tracks in terms of one or several essential features of film art -- casting, script, sets, pacing, editing, lighting, coherence -- that there is no way that you could, being honest, recommend them without qualifications to an unsuspecting viewer.Movies that go off the tracks in these essentials and offer no redeeming features are just plain Bad Movies. You you make fun of them, and then you forget about them.But some Bad Movies offer, amidst the badness, unique moments of grace and truth. You allow yourself to be sucked in, and you studiously ignore or forgive all the screw-ups that went into making them Bad Movies. Angel Eyes is a *Good* Bad Movie.Why Bad? Genre incoherence is the biggest problem here. Angel Eyes was marketed as a supernatural thriller that offered spooky, scary insights into fate, love, danger, and perhaps life after death. Ads, and the first portion of the movie, hinted at a weird alternate identity for one character. Was he a ghost? An angel? A devil? Would Angel Eyes be another Sixth Sense or Wings of Desire? That's all just smokescreen. I'm not revealing any spoilers by saying that no one in the movie is a ghost, an angel, or a devil; that conceit from the ads is jettisoned pretty quickly.There is a subtext of fate, destiny, love and death, but that isn't worked really hard, either. That whole subtext could have been skipped and you'd still have pretty much the same movie.The movie you get is a movie about traumatized people finding love and rebirth. And that is one great theme.Another problem with the movie is its misunderstanding of how quickly people can recover from trauma. But, hey.I say but, hey, because this movie has a lot going for it, and it's worth seeing for what it has going for it.Jim Caviezel is an underrated actor. He's not wooden; he's subtle. It's tragic that we've gotten to an era where audience's eyes can't appreciate a quiet actor in the Gary Cooper mode.Caviezel is a worthy inheritor of the Gary Cooper mantle. He's stunningly handsome, has a big, gorgeous body -- he's a former basketball player, and it shows -- and he possesses Cooper's quiet masculine tenderness and humility.All these qualities have allowed him to strike the perfect note of a very male spirituality in a number of films, from Frequency to Thin Red Line to Pay It Forward to The Passion to Angel Eyes. In his early scenes, when the movie doesn't want you to know quite what he's about, he is perfect as a perhaps ghost-angel-devil-weirdo homeless bum-savior.He's equally good, later, as an entirely corporeal lover.He plays a wounded man, and Caviezel has the gifts to convey his character's inner pain. You believe that he cares as much as he does about what wounded him; you believe that his wounds could have done to him what the movie wants you to believe they did to him.Jennifer Lopez is equally good. Face it -- Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress. Yes, she appears on tabloid covers. Yes, she made Gigli. Yes, she poses in naughty clothes a lot. Yes, she is a Puerto Rican from the Bronx.And you know what? She's a fine actress. Don't let her non-silver-spoon pedigree keep you from appreciating what she can do on screen.Lopez is as good as a cop here as she was in the more celebrated film, Out of Sight. She's winning, charismatic, natural, and lovely to look at. Even in a white t-shirt and navy blue cop uniform slacks, she is beautiful.Like Caviezel, Lopez plays a wounded character ready to be reborn by love. She's equally as good as he, but she conveys her different wounds in a different way. One wounded person retreats; another lashes out in violence. It's interesting to see which party picks which method.Sonia Braga is in this movie. Any movie with Sonia Braga in it can't be all bad.Victor Argo, in a very small part as a very flawed man, is JUST PERFECT. 100% believable and heart-wrenching. I'll never forget his moments locked in silent misery, a misery he causes and a misery he feels.Finally, there is a not-to-be-missed scene between an abused family member and the abuser. A character speaks into a video camera at a family reunion and ... the scene just took my breath away. At that point I wanted to cry and surrender my full respect to the movie, in spite of everything it had done wrong so far.Don't let bad reviews prevent you from seeing this movie. Nothing's perfect. There's enough heart and beauty here for the discerning viewer to appreciate.

Hitchcock (wisely) avoided throwing things at the camera--there are only two instances of this When Kelly is attacked her hand flies up to the camera--it was so real for half a second I almost reached up to help her! Also when someone holds out a key to the camera it comes right out of the screen at you. Hitchcock didn't want the 3-D--he was ordered by studio heads to shoot it that way. Still, he DID manage to use it in an effective way.The acting is almost completely great; Milland is fantastic--very smooth and suave as the villain; Kelly is just visually stunning and also gives out a good performance; John Williams is just terrific as an inspector trying to figure the crime out. Only Robert Cummings is not that good--he's bland and blank-faced the entire time. You really wonder what Kelly ever SAW in him!I like it but I think it drags quite a bit in the second half. I was getting a little bored. Seeing it in 3-D definitely improved the picture.
