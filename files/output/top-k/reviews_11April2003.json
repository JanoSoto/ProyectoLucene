Films tend to be made about conspiracies and mysteries. Everyone has conspiracy theories that they put in movies (JFK, Conspiracy Theory). The Game is a different kind of conspiracy. It is about an entire organization holding something against one man. Only a few people know about this organization and what it does in the movie, it seems. But if only a handful of people know about the organization, how could it possibly get booming business? That's one of the many, many plot holes that The Game seems to have. It just has too many plot holes to save itself. It has a pretty good plot, good acting, good directing...even a good script...but the plot holes in the script cause the problems.Michael Douglas plays a rich businessman, whose birthday is coming up soon. Sean Penn, his younger brother, tells Douglas that he (Penn) has bought a present for Douglas called The Game. Douglas goes to the location of The Game Headquarters (it has a name but I can't remember right now), and there he finds out that The Game Headquarters must test Douglas' health before they activate it (The Game). They ask him questions, do health tests...all of this going to use later...and then Douglas goes to dinner. At dinner, one thing leads to another and pretty soon things start happening. A hysterical Penn tells Douglas that he didn't have enough money to pay for The Game, and now The Game is coming after him. So now Douglas is caught up in this conspiracy which he may never get out of alive. Because now they're coming after him. Blackmail is only the beginning of what they'll do to Douglas.First of all, The Game has a nice setup. I really enjoyed the beginning. It holds a great sense of suspense, and seems to be filmed effectively, in a very suspenseful way. It has all the markings of a Hitchcockian thriller. Unfortunately, Hitchcock would have ironed out the plot holes before he filmed the movie, because despite being a suspenseful film, the plot holes are unbearable, kind of negating all the suspense and belief in the film.SPOILERSFirst of all, how does The Game know that Douglas is going to do everything he does? They're betting an awful lot that he will jump off the building at JUST the right spot to crash through JUST the right glass (if you've seen the film you'll know what I mean). I can't exactly go into the entire film--it would spoil the entire thing--but the plot holes in the movie are just too obvious. They are literally betting on every step Douglas will take, and while they have people to help him make decisions along the way, there are times that he is by himself...how do they know, in a moment of despair, he will not try to put a gun to his head?At the end (major spoiler ahead), Douglas stands on the edge of a skyscraper with a gun. They make it look as though Douglas has just shot his brother (by accident). Douglas, on the verge of a mental breakdown, walks to the edge of the skyscraper and jumps. Here are two things.1. How did they know Douglas wouldn't just lift the gun to his head and blow it off? Why jump off the building? Yeah, I know, that's what his father did and therefore Douglas would do the same--but what if he hadn't? If I were Douglas' character, just because my father jumps off a building doesn't mean that that would be my decision of effective suicide.2.

And even if he jumped off the building at the right point, what if a) the wind (there could be some strong gusts from that high up) blew him away from his destination, and b) from that speed, even fake glass would cut him up IF he reached his destination.That's one of the things that got me, but really, the whole sake of the film lies on what Douglas will do.

After reading many other reviews for this movie, I felt compelled to not only put my own two cents in, but also to clarify a couple of obvious (and puzzling) misunderstandings about the synopsis. For one, the ghosts are *not* pirates; I don't understand why some people keep referring to them as such. In the movie, if you're paying proper attention to it, as the Priest is reading from his grandfather's diary, he points out the fact that they are, in fact, LEPERS.And for two, it was the grandfather, along with five others, who had ended up betraying the leper colony and caused the shipwreck that caused them all to drown. So, even though the six people who are killed during the movie by the ghost lepers seeking revenge are the *descendants* of the six conspirators, and hence had nothing whatsoever to do with the actual wiping-out of the colony, their murders were *not*, as some people have said, random. Again, if you actually pay attention to the movie, it's very clear to see that.Sure, there are admittedly a few plot holes and red herrings (the lepers do go after a couple of people whose ancestors *didn't* have anything to do with the lepers' deaths). But all in all, it STILL makes for one awesome spook story! There is no doubt that Carpenter was at his absolute horror-movie-making prime here. If you enjoy genuine, goosebumpy scary movies, this one (right along with JC's Halloween and The Thing) ranks right up there with today's best horror movies. Remember, sometimes it's the implied and unseen in older horror movies which can be just as scary, if not more so, as the over-the-top, gratuitously gore-splattered films of today (The Blair Witch Project is the perfect contemporary example of my point implied horror, not shown -- yet that movie scared the bejesus out of *millions* of people, myself included). A couple points of interest special-effects make-up god Rob Bottin (pronounced Bo-TEEN) actually plays one of his own creations in this movie -- Captain Blake (Bottin also worked with Carpenter on The Thing) . And Antonio Bay is actually Point Reyes, CA.Unfortunately, over the past fifteen years or so, Carpenter has lost his edge. His recent movies haven't contained any of that gut-wrenching, visceral horror for which he used to be so reknowned and worshipped.

After watching the first 5 minutes of Star Wars (A New Hope), I knew this was my favorite movie of all-time.  Empire Strikes Back was awesome, but was disappointed I had to wait 3 years for the cliffhanger of the century.  Return of the Jedi I hated in the theaters, but after watching it again, actually was a great adventure.Which brings me to Attack of the Clones.  Although not the greatest of the movies, perhaps I am jaded because I've grown up.  If I was a kid, this movie would be TOTALLY AWESOME.

Of course, some would say that doing a Bruce Willis war movie is even more inexplicable, but no one will hold it against her. But while the Carrie-Anne Moss brigade prepare to have their minds blown by the sight of a Real Woman (a term I normally hate, but if ever someone could be described as all woman, it's Miss Bellucci), let's move on to Malena.Strictly speaking, Guiseppe Tornatore's movie is basically a World War II take on The Wonder Years, except earthier and in Italian - but in any case, there are worse TV shows to be compared to. In spite of its title, the main character is actually a little boy called Renato - set in the Italian town of Castelcuto in the 1940s, he first sees Malena Scordia strolling through the streets and instantly and understandably falls in love and lust; as the daughter of the school's deaf Latin teacher, she has much the same effect on all the males in town while driving the females into fits of jealousy, but only Renato sees her as more than a beautiful bottom with a woman attached (insert Jennifer Lopez joke here). This means that as well as giving her a starring role in his fantasies, he also wants, like H.R. Pufnstuf, to be her friend when things get rough... but Malena has to endure obstacles far worse than anything Witchiepoo could conjure up, both from the war and from the feelings of the townsfolk.One of the reasons the movie works is Renato; most of us can relate to being young and wanting to be treated like a grown-up, to having parents who don't understand them, and to being in love and not being able to just go up to the object of desire and say something... anything, just to talk to them (for most of the movie he never does). We're with him all the way, and not only because apart from the title character, he's just about the only person in the movie who appeals.THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SPOILER, BUT WHY TAKE THE RISK?Renato never openly states his views, but stays silent even in the most harrowing moment of the movie (when Malena is beaten and shorn by the town's women in revenge for her consorting with German officers - a scene so hard to watch that I actually had to cover my eyes). And yet you can't hate him; you can hate the other townsfolk for their attitudes, but (her absent and presumed dead husband excepted) Renato is the only one - at least the only one we see - whose intentions are pure and loyal to her throughout. Even when his father takes him to a brothel, not only is his choice of prostitute the one who looks most like Mrs. Scordia, but in his mind's eye she becomes her. Plus he's only a boy; how could he have stopped the women? Similarly, it's indicated that Malena is only doing what she has to do to get by, rather than be the Germans's whore because she wants to; even though the women seem to accept her after the war is over, it's not entirely clear that she's forgiven them - to the end she remains a mystery.THE END OF POTENTIAL SPOILERS.Malena herself is one of the movie's flaws and virtues; for most of the movie we see her through Renato's eyes, making her as much of a distant object of desire for us as she is for him. She doesn't talk much, and she's in danger of becoming a symbol rather than a person, but it's a tribute to both Miss Bellucci and Mr. Tornatore that this never really happens - we really believe that she's more than a walking masturbatory aid, not least in the movie's courtroom scene and the aftermath. At the very worst, the movie's put us in Renato's shoes, not the worst place to be. Praise to both the movie's key performers - as Renato, Guiseppe Sulfaro is remarkable, and this wouldn't have been half as effective without him... but it wouldn't have been half as effective without Monica Bellucci either. Imagine if Pamela Anderson Lee or Angelina Jolie had been cast... shudder.The movie's occasional missteps like some crude humour (such as the running joke about Renato's classmates asking their teacher - who, remember, is deaf - if they can have sex with his daughter) and an overemphasis on symbolism (Renato knocks over a bust of Il Duce, which splits in two leaving two faces facing each other - the place is two-faced, get it?) are more than compensated for by the bittersweet nature of the movie, his delightful fantasies (he loves movies, and his dreams about Malena are often reflected thus), the ultimately hopeful ending, and the overall beauty of the movie itself. A moving and humourous coming-of-age tale, this all comes together in one scene in a classroom. He's daydreaming about her again, and his teacher turns into his beloved as the strings of Ennio Morricone's wonderful score take to the soundtrack.Blissful Ennio Morricone string music underscoring the sight of the impossibly beautiful Monica Bellucci.

Reportedly the most expensive German movie up to that time, Fritz Lang created an awesome city, totally memorable. I was lucky enough to see the restored version of the film -- listed as being 124 minutes, seeming like less -- in the theater with a group of about 70 people. Everyone seemed to enjoy the 75 year-old beast. (There was some clapping at the end -- a tradition that has always perplexed me. I mean, it's not like Fritz and his crew, or even those responsible for the wonderful restoration, are around to bask in the applause. Although, I guess, the applause was meant more for the theater that opted to bring the film here.)This is definitely one for the big screen.The story is heavy-handed by today's standards, but putting myself in the shoes of what I imagine the average audience of the time would have been like made me appreciate the ideas of the film more. (By no means, however, am I suggesting that a 1927 audience was less educated than we. They just didn't have the extra 75 years of movies we do.)The subterranean workers of the great city threaten to overthrow its rulers, led by Joh Fredersen. Now, Joh's son, Freder, sees an angel of a girl, Maria, who shows him his brothers and the terrible conditions of his father's workers. Maria captivates Freder, and she preaches the message of love and peace. The film's message, stated through her, is that the mediator of the hand (workers) and the mind (leader) is the heart (Maria and Freder).Freder goes below, to the depths, where he poses as a worker. He discovers plans for a revolt (more like a strike) where the workers will leave their machines in the hopes of being granted better conditions.But things get more complicated when Joh Fredersen has his scientist, Rotwang, who lives in an old barn-like house that the technical revolutions of the future have forgotten, design something for him. Rotwang has already created a machine man, modeled after Joh Fredersen's dead wife Hel (a sort of replacement), but Joh Fredersen has him affix Maria's face to the machine. Joh plans to use this machine to incite the workers to violence, by having her first get the workers' attention by doing a (not so) sexy gyspy dance. Of course they do, and the city is flooded. The moral at the end of the film is silly, but because the whole film is so unrealistic, so much like a fable, it didn't bother me. (I did, however, lean over to my friend and say in a Fred Rogers voice, Won't you be my mediator?)There really isn't much else you can say about Metropolis. Those images are why you'd see this movie. The way it reflects (or maybe warns against) Nazi totalitarianism is interesting. (One image, in particular, where a machine explodes and turns into a giant devourer, has an unsettling similarity to gas chamber.) I like that Lang was interested both in the ideals of Freder and Maria, but also in a sense of order. With the uprising that does occur, of course, there are repercussions. The dialogues (or title cards) in the film express a protest of the sort of dictating aristocracy of Metropolis, but Lang's own spectacular sets and monumental vision seem to argue with that.The sets and the images (including two memorable camera moves) just can't be overemphasized. Sometimes they look like models or Styrofoam or just plain goofy, but they're incredible and original and influential. Many a homage has been paid to this film, from Dr. Strangelove to more of a blatant rip-off in The Fifth Element.This is a vastly entertaining movie, made no less enjoyable by its sometimes silly premise. (It's not as if the acting in silent movies isn't wildly exaggerated -- and isn't that the appeal in the first place?)

Nevertheless, this is a masterwork.**** ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 April 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Metropolis is, if nothing else, one of the most spectacular visual movies I've ever seen. Reportedly the most expensive German movie up to that time, Fritz Lang created an awesome city, totally memorable. I was lucky enough to see the restored version of the film -- listed as being 124 minutes, seeming like less -- in the theater with a group of about 70 people. Everyone seemed to enjoy the 75 year-old beast. (There was some clapping at the end -- a tradition that has always perplexed me. I mean, it's not like Fritz and his crew, or even those responsible for the wonderful restoration, are around to bask in the applause. Although, I guess, the applause was meant more for the theater that opted to bring the film here.)This is definitely one for the big screen.The story is heavy-handed by today's standards, but putting myself in the shoes of what I imagine the average audience of the time would have been like made me appreciate the ideas of the film more. (By no means, however, am I suggesting that a 1927 audience was less educated than we. They just didn't have the extra 75 years of movies we do.)The subterranean workers of the great city threaten to overthrow its rulers, led by Joh Fredersen. Now, Joh's son, Freder, sees an angel of a girl, Maria, who shows him his brothers and the terrible conditions of his father's workers. Maria captivates Freder, and she preaches the message of love and peace. The film's message, stated through her, is that the mediator of the hand (workers) and the mind (leader) is the heart (Maria and Freder).Freder goes below, to the depths, where he poses as a worker. He discovers plans for a revolt (more like a strike) where the workers will leave their machines in the hopes of being granted better conditions.But things get more complicated when Joh Fredersen has his scientist, Rotwang, who lives in an old barn-like house that the technical revolutions of the future have forgotten, design something for him. Rotwang has already created a machine man, modeled after Joh Fredersen's dead wife Hel (a sort of replacement), but Joh Fredersen has him affix Maria's face to the machine. Joh plans to use this machine to incite the workers to violence, by having her first get the workers' attention by doing a (not so) sexy gyspy dance. Of course they do, and the city is flooded. The moral at the end of the film is silly, but because the whole film is so unrealistic, so much like a fable, it didn't bother me. (I did, however, lean over to my friend and say in a Fred Rogers voice, Won't you be my mediator?)There really isn't much else you can say about Metropolis. Those images are why you'd see this movie. The way it reflects (or maybe warns against) Nazi totalitarianism is interesting. (One image, in particular, where a machine explodes and turns into a giant devourer, has an unsettling similarity to gas chamber.) I like that Lang was interested both in the ideals of Freder and Maria, but also in a sense of order. With the uprising that does occur, of course, there are repercussions. The dialogues (or title cards) in the film express a protest of the sort of dictating aristocracy of Metropolis, but Lang's own spectacular sets and monumental vision seem to argue with that.The sets and the images (including two memorable camera moves) just can't be overemphasized. Sometimes they look like models or Styrofoam or just plain goofy, but they're incredible and original and influential. Many a homage has been paid to this film, from Dr. Strangelove to more of a blatant rip-off in The Fifth Element.This is a vastly entertaining movie, made no less enjoyable by its sometimes silly premise. (It's not as if the acting in silent movies isn't wildly exaggerated -- and isn't that the appeal in the first place?) I'm completely ignorant when it comes to Lang -- this is the first movie of his I've seen. Nevertheless, this is a masterwork.**** ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 April 2003","score":"","review":"  All say this is superb acting, and agree, without reservation, tho it was hard to imagine Demi Moore so well covered up.

It's one of the finest, most interesting films  out of the '70s, a great decade for movies. While I should probably see The Godfather Pt. II again, this film assures Coppola's position as THE filmmaker of the '70s. He somehow managed to take great art -- that was also wickedly entertaining -- and make it commercially viable. There's a sad moment during his commentary for the film where he reflects on never having attained that position again after the great, ambitious masterpiece Apocalypse Now was.The opening shot of the movie, by Haskell Wexler, who, Coppola says, left the film due to artistic differences, is a great one. Shot with long lenses, we see a mime walking around a couple in a park area. He walks by a man who then proceeds to follow that same couple, observing. The man then leaves, goes over to a van, and gets in the back. He's a surveillance expert, we learn. A professional eavesdropper who's been hired to piece together the conversation between the couple in the park. In the van, the man, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) checks on the other people surveying the couple. They're using things like gun microphones which can be aimed at objects from long distances and pick up specific noises. Also in the back of the van is Harry's partner, Stan (the late, wonderful character actor John Cazale).The movie focuses on Harry. The conversation, of course, is important, but what's more important -- what Coppola (who also wrote the screenplay, inspired by Antonioni's Blowup)  is interested in is Harry's life. When Harry goes home, to his apartment, he opens the well-locked door to find a bottle of wine left by someone downstairs. He wonders how they got in, and we start to wonder if Harry is as smart as he seems to be. We see Harry's girlfriend Amy (Teri Garr), though she's not really a girlfriend; Harry just sees her at his own convenience, neglecting to tell her about himself.At Harry's workspace (it looks like a caged section of an underground parking lot) he tries, rigorously, to piece together the elements of the conversation he and his assistants have recorded. When Stan starts to inquire as to what the couple is talking about, Harry becomes incensed, saying it's not important; that what's important is that he gets a good-quality tape to transfer to whom it is that hired him. Of course this is ridiculous, as Harry himself becomes more obsessed with the tape. And when he unscrambles one line in particular, He'd kill us if he had the chance, he becomes infatuated beyond help.The man who's hired him to record this conversation, we learn, is the director, a head of some corporation. When Harry decides to turn the tapes over, the director's assistant (who'll appear later), played malevolently by Harrison Ford, motivates him to change his mind.Harry is deeply religious, and we see him at a Cathedral, in confession, confessing that his tapes have gotten people in trouble before. We hear of one instance, in particular, that left a family murdered; one of Harry's recorded conversations made one man in a two-man scheme think the other had talked to someone.At a surveillance convention, some of the background is given to us. Another surveillance expert, Moran, is thrown into the mix for coloring. He doesn't affect the plot that much (or does he?), but he adds some flavor to the film by penning Harry. When Harry's tapes mysteriously disappear, the movie kicks into gear. Everything up until now has been build-up.Harry becomes a part of a larger conspiracy. His phone number is suddenly made available, he fears that he may have become the surveyed, he doesn't know who to trust.The two repeating themes of the movie are repetition and eavesdropping. The principal tape from the opening is listened to again and again, at different times. The more we learn, the more the tapes begin to mean, the more they change meaning. The editing in the film is, as is often said, amazing. I didn't know how, going into the film, the editing could be anything special, but it really is. The way the initial conversation is edited into the film as it goes; as Harry listens to the tapes, we're shown the scenario in different angles, from different viewpoints again and again. As Harry deciphers the tape, the jumbled words (sounding like computer language) slowly come into form.The sound in the film is extremely important; the subtlety of the tape, the sound of the voices. David Shire's soft, jazzy, haunting piano score is invaluable. Also, the camera is interesting. Aside from that terrific opening shot, some of the camera shots seem delayed, which is interesting. On the commentary, Coppola describes how he intended the camera to act as a surveillance object, moving as if it were automated.The conspiratorial suspiciousness makes an interesting parallel to the Watergate scandal which was occurring (or about to occur) around the time the movie was released.Hackman gives one of his best performances, understated, and intelligent. He plays Harry as a loner who's closest companion is his sax -- a close companion that, by the end, Harry might have been wise to get to know better (wink, wink).Naked from the excess of Apocalypse Now, and not as lush as The Godfather, The Conversation may be Coppola's most important movie in terms of showing what he was capable of, alone, at his peak.

I taped it and didn't think too much of it in the beginning. The only thing I knew about The Doors was their song Light my fire.A friend of mine, who borrowed the film from me, told me he liked the cave scene and the music in it. I myself liked the scene where Jim climbs up to Pam's balcony. That was pretty much it. But then I noticed the song love street which is played in the beginning, and then I realized that the guitar intro to The end wasn't that bad. After that I bought the soundtrack and now I was pretty much hooked. I put my eurodisco records on a shelf and became a rock'n roller, and Jim was my role model. My relationship to Jim Morrison is actually the closest to being a gay that I will ever be.The best part of the film are the opening thirty minutes, where Jim quits his film class on UCLA, follows Pam home from the beach and takes her out on a night walk, rehearses with the band and Light my fire is introduced. Too bad we never get to see the band being formed. I love that story, when Jim meets Ray on the beach and that conversation leads up to Jim singing Moonlight drive. This scene is also one of few which shows the real Jim Morrison, but I will get back to that later. Around this time, Jim meets his girlfriend with whom he stayed until he died. After half an hour, the movie takes on in a different direction. It is from now on, a very dark movie. This is for a reason, and the reason is that Oliver wants the audience to see everything through Jim's eyes. The result is that some scenes are very surreal and after a while you may think that Oliver Stone himself took some acid before shooting them.The negative side of the film, which have made many people upset, is the way Jim Morrison is presented. Jim is high or\/and drunk in nearly every scene he appears in, and since the movie is shown through his angle the result is the surrealism and spaced-out scenes. Jimbo has unfortunately a bigger part than Jim. (See the movie and you'll know what I mean.)I have read practically every book there is to read about The Doors, including the one named light my fire, written by the organist Ray Manzarek. This guy isn't too happy with the movie. I see his point but at the same time, he confirms in the book that most of the things in the movie has actually happened; the back against the audience, the Ed Sullivan sequence where Jim sings the word higher on national television, the TV-throwing in the studio. Other things could never happen or are just simply wrong; the Andy Warhole-party where Jim is abandoned by the rest of the band (something that true friends would never do to one another), Jim's student project (his movie didn't look like that at all), Jim's red mustang (Jim had a blue mustang which he actually called the blue lady).Oliver Stone focuses the movie on the wrong things. Sure, Jim Morrison was a pothead, but he was also a very intelligent, sensitive, friendly and funny person. This is far from the picture most people have of him after seeing the movie. But if you know this, and just want some Rock'n roll in your life you will like the movie anyway. Another strange thing is that Oliver Stone has said that he loved Jim and wanted the movie to be a sort of homage to him!? Some homage. So the film is great, however it is not the real story of Jim Morrison. The only time we see the sensitive side of Jim is when he turns down an early offer from a record company man who tells him to drop those guys. The music numbers are the scenes that impresses me the most. The choreography, the lighting of the stage, and, above all, the fact that Val Kilmer actually sings all the songs by himself. Look at the Not to touch the earth sequence and you'll know what I mean.And now we come to the best thing with this movie. The ONE thing that made me buy it and watch it about 30 times after that. That thing is Val Kilmer. An actor who hadn't made anything spectacular before this and haven't really done anything after it. He was born to do this part. It isn't the real Jim, but an alternative Jim who you kind of love to hate. But now I'm only talking about the personality. Kilmer walks like, talks like, sings like, and above all looks like Jim. And some looks. What wouldn't I give to have that hair or that wardrobe. Besides Kilmer, there are many more great and well-known actors in this movie; Mimi Rogers, Michael Wincott, Josie Bissett, Crispin Glover, Kathleen Quinlan (who plays the very true character Patricia Keneally), and one of the few actors that I can't stand; Michael Madsen. Also, some artists gone acting; Billy Idol, Swedens own Eagle-Eye Cherry (whose scene were cut out from the final film), and if my eyes aren't lying to me; Billy Vera.

I taped it and didn't think too much of it in the beginning. The only thing I knew about The Doors was their song Light my fire.A friend of mine, who borrowed the film from me, told me he liked the cave scene and the music in it. I myself liked the scene where Jim climbs up to Pam's balcony. That was pretty much it. But then I noticed the song love street which is played in the beginning, and then I realized that the guitar intro to The end wasn't that bad. After that I bought the soundtrack and now I was pretty much hooked. I put my eurodisco records on a shelf and became a rock'n roller, and Jim was my role model. My relationship to Jim Morrison is actually the closest to being a gay that I will ever be.The best part of the film are the opening thirty minutes, where Jim quits his film class on UCLA, follows Pam home from the beach and takes her out on a night walk, rehearses with the band and Light my fire is introduced. Too bad we never get to see the band being formed. I love that story, when Jim meets Ray on the beach and that conversation leads up to Jim singing Moonlight drive. This scene is also one of few which shows the real Jim Morrison, but I will get back to that later. Around this time, Jim meets his girlfriend with whom he stayed until he died. After half an hour, the movie takes on in a different direction. It is from now on, a very dark movie. This is for a reason, and the reason is that Oliver wants the audience to see everything through Jim's eyes. The result is that some scenes are very surreal and after a while you may think that Oliver Stone himself took some acid before shooting them.The negative side of the film, which have made many people upset, is the way Jim Morrison is presented. Jim is high or\/and drunk in nearly every scene he appears in, and since the movie is shown through his angle the result is the surrealism and spaced-out scenes. Jimbo has unfortunately a bigger part than Jim. (See the movie and you'll know what I mean.)I have read practically every book there is to read about The Doors, including the one named light my fire, written by the organist Ray Manzarek. This guy isn't too happy with the movie. I see his point but at the same time, he confirms in the book that most of the things in the movie has actually happened; the back against the audience, the Ed Sullivan sequence where Jim sings the word higher on national television, the TV-throwing in the studio. Other things could never happen or are just simply wrong; the Andy Warhole-party where Jim is abandoned by the rest of the band (something that true friends would never do to one another), Jim's student project (his movie didn't look like that at all), Jim's red mustang (Jim had a blue mustang which he actually called the blue lady).Oliver Stone focuses the movie on the wrong things. Sure, Jim Morrison was a pothead, but he was also a very intelligent, sensitive, friendly and funny person. This is far from the picture most people have of him after seeing the movie. But if you know this, and just want some Rock'n roll in your life you will like the movie anyway. Another strange thing is that Oliver Stone has said that he loved Jim and wanted the movie to be a sort of homage to him!? Some homage. So the film is great, however it is not the real story of Jim Morrison.

This included firing incumbent director Lewis Gilbert and writing a more believable plot, to begin with. The second item on the agenda was to write a script which curbed Roger Moore's obsessive tendencies to pile on the jokes. Add a few good villains and allies, and voila! a classic James Bond adventure there is. All right, maybe it was not that simple.This time around, Bond is sent to investigate the murder of one Timothy Havelock, who was working to salvage the wreckage of a spy boat carrying a vital command system called A.T.A.C. Bond's investigation leads him to believe that the Russians are also trying to recover the system, and may be using one Aris Kristatos (Julian Glover) to carry out their dirty work. Aiding Bond is the beautiful sharpshooter Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) and an old acquaintance of Kristatos's named Milos Columbo (Topol).As good as it is, 'For Your Eyes Only' starts out terribly. The pre-title sequence involves an attempt on James Bond's life by a bald guy in a wheelchair with a white cat (I wonder who that could be?). The scene is campy and don't get me started on the remark about the delicatessen in stainless steel (obviously put in there at the request of some actor). I understand why the sequence was filmed, but that does not make it good. Thankfully it would not be a barometer on the rest of the movie!It may not be among the very best in the series, but believe me when I say that the difference in tone between this and the goofy 'Moonraker' is like day compared to night. It is easily the preeminent Roger Moore Bond film, and is well worth watching in every area. The villain is not trying to kill a majority of the human race for some outlandish purpose. There are no extravagant weapons or billionaire lunatics, no silly motives or doomsday schemes. Instead, we have a lean adventure that a Bond fan can actually enjoy. There are many outstanding qualities about this film, mixed in with a few notable negatives.Any list of what went right with this film has to begin with Roger Moore. After two mediocre performances, he really nails down the part here. He is courageous, commanding, tough, and, most importantly, serious, thanks to new director John Glen (who apparently had to do some prying to slow down Moore's humor blitz).Another BIG breath of fresh air is provided by the villains and allies, who are also treated seriously and given unusual depth of character. Julian Glover is exceptional as the ruthless and deceptive Kristatos. It is villains like this that help make the Bond series so great, and Glover is excellent indeed. No wonder Steven Spielberg cast him for Indiana Jones! In Topol, most famous for his work in 'Fiddler on the Roof', we get a terrific ally who has a great chemistry with Bond. I imagine I am not the only person who found him to be much like Kerim Bey in the great 'From Russia With Love'.Then there is the matter of the women, who both bring good and bad qualities to the table. Carole Bouquet is somewhat wooden as female lead, Melina, but can also hold her own when the heat is on, which makes her the best Bond girl in some time. Lynn-Holly Johnson provides a lovable portrayal as Bibi Dahl, a figure skater who gets the hots for Bond (don't get me started on the age difference). Her bubble headed character makes for some humorous moments and is used to make the character of Kristatos stronger. Dahl is also enrapturing to look at, but I find her ditzy part a little too over the top, but not to the point of weakening the final product.Unfortunately, there are a few items that bug me about this film. The first is Bill Conti's soundtrack. While it would be terrific literature for an up-tempo jazz band, it really clashes with the action more than anything. Another weakness is Roger Moore's lack of talent for fight choreography, which detracts from the action slightly. The last is Eric Kriegler (John Wyman), another invincible Oddjob rip-off that at one point picks up a motorcycle and hurls it at a fleeing Bond (!).This is all forgivable, however, because the action, from the mountainside ski chase to the climax atop a rock cliff, is of very high standards. The absurdity of the previous chapter is shed, and we get a highly entertaining adventure that appeals to fans and non-fans alike. I can certainly live with all of the flaws any day. So grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy another great 007 adventure.

It's certainly a good film, and I liked it, but whatever element this film has that makes it any better than the rest of Hitchcock's movies remains unseen by me. To be honest, the only idea that makes me value it any more than a standard Hitchcock thriller is its honesty -- that Jimmy Stewart's controlling nature over Kim Novak parallels Hitchcock's own controlling nature over his actresses.The most thrilling moment of the entire film, for me, was the opening credits, with those classic spirals and the first hint of Bernard Herrmann's great score.The story is simple a cop (Jimmy Stewart), after watching one of his buddies fall to his death, contracts vertigo and acrophobia and leaves the force. Then, one day, when an old school friend calls him to keep an eye on his wife (Kim Novak) who's been acting strangely, believing she's someone else, he gets involved once more. Stewart falls in love with Novak, whom he saves from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, but her aloof nature and apparent psychological damage prevents her from returning the love.Then something happens that would be criminal to give away.I just don't see what makes this movie great, or stand out among Hitchcock's other work. Is it really because it's so personal? Maybe there's something I'm missing, maybe there are subtleties placed throughout the film that I didn't get and that I've completely misunderstood the point of the movie. As far as I can see, though, the film's complex message is that love is either one big trick or a perverted obsession.

I also felt for the heartbroken Stewart, as well as the Midge character, his admirer. I could also sympathize with Novak's character, as she's manipulated by Stewart.Aside from the opening credits, which I adore, my favorite part of the movie may well be the restaurant where we first see Novak.

(Either that, or I'm forced to venture desperately into dream territory Oh, you know, everything after so-and-so was a dream, and that, therefore, makes the movie real complex.)I admire the film's craft, and I didn't find it boring or anything, but I was expecting something very complex, much more than this. I also felt for the heartbroken Stewart, as well as the Midge character, his admirer. I could also sympathize with Novak's character, as she's manipulated by Stewart.Aside from the opening credits, which I adore, my favorite part of the movie may well be the restaurant where we first see Novak. That incredibly red room must have influenced Peter Greenaway when he made The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover. There are also a few camera moves that are nice, and thanks to the terrific transfer, the colors, images, and sounds (which are essential to the film's appeal) are impeccable.While I want to understand what it is people feel that makes them call this movie great, and I'll see it again sometime, I'm not going to re-watch it just so I can get it. I'm generally not a fan of re-watching movies to discover their greatness -- I find most people who do that are, in effect, lying to themselves the second time, convinced that they get it. I hate to be part of the dissent, especially when favorites of mine like Fargo have an equally enthusiastic following that denounces them as completely unexceptional. But as it stands, this movie is just a well-crafted, more-personal-than-usual thriller.*** ","genre":"Mystery, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"11 April 2003","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  MILLER'S CROSSING (1990) ***1\/2  Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Jon Polito, J.

It is the tale of seven gunfighters who are hired by a poor Mexican farming community to help drive off the bandits who periodically show up and steal the communities food and goods.  Of the Magnificent Seven most of the screen time is given to Chris (Brynner), Vin (McQueen) and Chico (Bucholz).  While no details are given about the individual pasts of the Magnificent Seven it is fairly clear what there pasts may have been.1. Chris  A leader, perhaps a former soldier, who has encountered danger before and gained a degree of mastery over his emotions in dangerous situation.2. Vin  A capable man with a gun, perhaps a one time cowboy. He seems to be comfortable working as a loner but clearly would like to one day settle down.3. Chico  The youngest of the Seven and most inexperienced.  He wants to shed his farming past and attempts through acts of bravado to persuade others and himself that he is a gunfighter at heart.4.  Bernardo (Bronson)  A strong solitary man that in many ways resembles Chris although not displaying the desire to lead.  In many ways he is the most interesting character.  He has made quite a bit of money in the past even though he is now broke.  The attention he gives to the local village children and the gift he gives a village girl hint at the idea that while he is good at gunfighting he knows that it is a good family life that is important.5. Lee (Vaughn)  The most difficult character to relate to.  He appears to be a gunman who in the past was cocky, arrogant and self assured but now after experiencing life on the run now doubts himself.  He wants to do the right thing but finds it difficult to step up to the plate when it's his turn.6.  Britt (Coburn)  A loner who is unequaled in a gun or knife fight.  A man whose motives remain his own.7.  Harry (Dexter)  A good man to have in a fight but one who lets greed cloud his every decision.  It would seem that Harry is one of those individuals who is always one step away from gaining riches but somehow never gains them.The leader of the bandits is Calvera (Walsh) who is not an unlikeable fellow.  He appears to believe that it is his job to steal so that he can support himself and his men.  For him it is only a job, not unlike the farmers who work the land to provide for their families.  He has what can almost be describes as a code of ethics for those who make their living with guns.  This code of ethics is evident in the way he treats the Magnificent Seven towards the end of the film.  However, given the films ending, this code does not seem to be shared by the Magnificent SevenLastly, while many people may view this film as a western action film I think there is quite a bit of underlying humanity and character depth woven into the story. It is these underlying characteristics that distinguish it from the average western action flick and have helped to make this film as popular as it is.
