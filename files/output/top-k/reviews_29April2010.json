There is a high level of menacing meanness plus a certain quota of questionable plot credibility, surely...(including a major one concerning the finale) but when the rest is as skillfully manipulative, sweat-inducingly exciting and well-acted (Bridges always excels!) as here, I can happily live with that!

Let's cut to the real point!Nowadays (as everyone knows) whenever you look up for a good horror movie to watch, there's always blood, gore, violence, the same old routine with a couple of teenagers winding up to get killed in various of different ways (after all the sex of course) and really acting stupid when it comes to escaping...But this is something else! A wholly original movie that just comes out of nowhere and grabs your attention and never lets go until the very end that leaves you in a shock which believe me... stays for quite a while! In other words....this is what REAL horror movies are all about! OK first of all. Given the fact that this is a low-budget 70's movie (where apparently the special effects weren't nearly as good as now) I'd say that it is amazing just how the film manages to be so shocking and terrifying...some of the scenes are very tense and can grab your attention almost too well....(my favorite scene is with the hitch-hiker, done so perfectly by Edwin Neal) The actors do a pretty good job (most notable are Marilyn Burns ,truly believable screaming, Jim Siedow and Edwin Niel). The storyline grabs you easily into the heart of the movie, despite of being very simple, and the directing is really good...(The beautiful environments and color's of the landscape in Texas don't hurt either) In the end I hope that people who watch this film will accept it for what it is....A movie that is able to scare one without any big amount of blood, gore or special effectsNo wonder it's a cult classic! This is truly the one and only...THE Texas chainsaw massacre!!

First let's talk about the acting, Boris Karloff and Colin Clive are absolutely fantastic as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster. Every one else dose good but none as good as Karloff and Clive. Now the story line, unlike the First Universal Frankenstein movie, this one follows the book more, like with the old blind man, the bride the the creature wants so very badly, and so on. Never the less it is a great storyline no matter what. Now lets talk about the music score, needless to say it kicks a$$. It's no wonder that it eventually got nominated for an Oscar, which in my opinion it should have won. This is a great horror movie one of the best ever made so go check it out.
