While the animation is of course top-notch, it tackles some philosophically heady material that sets it apart from what I've seen before. The year is 2029, and in this future world technological augmentation of the human body has become a normal thing. There are also ghosts (basically disembodied consciousness, I think) which can operate independently of cyborg bodies, or shells. The plot is about the efforts of a government department trying to catch a villainous hacker known as The Puppetmaster. Like the other two anime I saw previously (AKIRA and PAPRIKA), GHOST IN THE SHELL deals with human's relationship to technology and how it can positively or negatively affect the our collective experience. In this one, however, the primary philosophical concern is the nature of consciousness and what it means to be alive. In a world where artificial intelligence can exist independent of a physical form, would you consider it to be living? That's just one of the many thought-provoking questions the film asks, and attempts to answer. From the technical side of things, I thought the hand-drawn animation was absolutely spectacular and the world-building was amazing as well. There was so much attention to detail that it made this future seem believable. I also liked the score which struck the right tone, kind of a BLADE RUNNER-esque futuristic noir. The only things I can find to complain about are really hardly complaints, though. First, a few of the voice actors in this dub were kind of awkward-sounding, and second, some of the computer animation\/graphics date the film somewhat. Outside of that, however, everything here was exceptionally well-done. Overall, GHOST IN THE SHELL tells a fast-paced, intelligent story that has influenced science-fiction in so many ways (without this film, there'd be no MATRIX). If you're an anime fan, you've probably already seen it, but this would make a good entry point for those just getting into anime (like myself).

David Lynch has always been one for secrecy so I'm not sure we will ever get the true meaning of Mulholland Drive. But I think that's okay, I mean it's good to have multiple interpretations of a film in general. For me, I'm not entirely sure I know the truth, but I can try.It's basically a story of hopeful and broken dreams in Hollywood. Not only is it a commentary on how we think it all works but it's a maniacal thriller about not getting recognition for what you think you have accomplished in life. It plays with reality and the fictionalized versions of what we hope reality was or is. Naomi Watts plays the lead role, Diane Selwyn, a hopeful actress who is wishing for her break or chance to shine in Hollywood. The film also deals with the depths at which you would go to succeed and be noticed. Watts brings so much range to this character. Sure she technically plays both Betty and Diane so it calls for separate personalities. But it's not an obvious change. I think that's the most important part of her performance is that she exposes just the right amount of madness and sadness when needed. It's crazy to think about how the first half of the film is pretty much fake. It's all a reality or dream that Diane creates to see her life how she hopes it would have been and to see Camilla as Rita, a much better fit as a love interest.I basically see this film as the love child as 3 films. It has the story telling and narrative structure as Pulp Fiction, the hopeful then broken dreams of Sunset Blvd., and the descent into madness and suffering like Black Swan displays. Lynch creates a masterpiece of a film but also one that I don't know I will ever want to watch again. Whether it's the maliciously laughing old people or the monster like hobo, Mulholland Drive is one of the more disturbing films I have seen. Not that I read but it's like a book you don't want to put down but are terrified to find out what happens next. Knowing it's a David Lynch film means it's not going to have a happy ending or meaning. Instead it's a bit of a cynical view on Hollywood or what we thought Hollywood was. I love the way Lynch uses the camera as an extra character following around the story to create both more suspense and a certain amount of familiarity with this world. We are going to look back at this film decades from now and realize how incredible it was. The surrealism Lynch brings to the story creates both the promising reality we want for Diane and the tragedy we feared for Betty. It's a beautiful disaster film at it's core. I commend this film for daring to be so different than anything we have really seen before and shout out to Profiles (with Malone and Mantz) for pushing me to see this film.

I like it and I've seen it around five or six times, but there's something about Halloween that I find dissatisfying. Incorrectly regarded as the first slasher ever made, Halloween started a trend of low budget films about mysterious killers wearing a mask and murdering young people with no specific reasons. The truth is that Halloween changed horror movies for good and served as an influence for many horror films that came after. While Black Christmas came four years before this, and it is one of my favorite slashers, I think it is less known, because we never get to see the killer, while Halloween gives us a very frightening looking villain, capable of causing horror to the most experienced horror fans. Michael Myer's design is actually very modest a white mask with black eyes, a blue overall and a big kitchen knife that make him very sinister, without having to appeal to something more brutal and explicit, like some of the slasher killers that came after him. Michael is a very well designed horror villain and he is probably one of my favorites too (keeping in mind that this isn't the only Halloween film). So what is it about Halloween that doesn't quite do it for me?My main problem with Halloween is that I find it a little bit slow (there, I said it!) and I'm sure this is the main reason why other people dislike it as well, which automatically causes avid Halloween fans to accuse the detractors of only being capable of appreciating horror films with a lot of cheap-scares. I actually don't have a problem with slow films, but I feel like most of this film features the main character going on about her business, chatting with her silly friends about high school crushes and stuff, and we occasionally see Michael Myers appearing here and there. I do realize that this is intended to create a frightening atmosphere and it actually works well, but after a while, I find it a little bit tedious.Those who want gory murders will have to skip this film. While I think gore is not always a requirement, I would normally expect the murders to have some kind of shock value and be disturbing, even if we don't get to see a single drop of blood (it can happen). Most of the murders are rather predictable and what we see on the screen isn't too disturbing or shocking, at least not by nowadays' standards. Fortunately, the music during the murders is so powerful and fear-provoking that it makes up for the lack of brutality. For the life of me, I can't understand how Halloween got an R-rating in so many countries. Not only there's barely any blood in it, but also, the nudity is very naïf and harmless. Towards the last twenty minutes, Halloween displays a lot of suspense, mainly with Laurie Strode (the lead) being chased by the sinister Michael Myers. This part of the film is not only full of tension due to the fact that a merciless killer is out to get an innocent high school girl for no apparent reason, but also because two small kids are in danger and it's the lead girl's implied responsibility to protect them. The confrontation between Michael and Laurie is chilling, as the killer is apparently impossible to kill and Laurie, in all her nervousness, goes out of her way to make the worst possible choices when it comes to escaping the lunatic. While I find the night scenario and the dark in general to be fitting for a horror film about a mysterious killer, I find the excessive dark to also make it very difficult to fully appreciate what's going on at times. The acting in Halloween is very solid, which is unlikely to find in slasher films, or at least the ones that came out during and after the eighties. The main three actresses are Jamie Lee Curtis (unknown back then), P. J. Soles and Nancy Loomis, while English actor Donald Pleasence plays Detective Sam Loomis. I have no complaints here, like I said, I found the acting to be rather convincing and spot-on. As for the characters, the lead is a mousy girl, named Laurie Strode, who mostly keeps to herself and behaves like a nice girl.

She's a very mature girl, responsible, hard working, great with kids and even though she doesn't follow her friends' life choices, she doesn't judge them either, which makes her a perfectly likable lead, which is important in a horror movie, because we are supposed to like her and root for her. Halloween holds up pretty well as a solid horror film that manages to avoid the campiness or the unintentionally funny moments, which is crucial if we are hoping to see a genuinely scary horror film.

I like it and I've seen it around five or six times, but there's something about Halloween that I find dissatisfying. Incorrectly regarded as the first slasher ever made, Halloween started a trend of low budget films about mysterious killers wearing a mask and murdering young people with no specific reasons. The truth is that Halloween changed horror movies for good and served as an influence for many horror films that came after. While Black Christmas came four years before this, and it is one of my favorite slashers, I think it is less known, because we never get to see the killer, while Halloween gives us a very frightening looking villain, capable of causing horror to the most experienced horror fans. Michael Myer's design is actually very modest a white mask with black eyes, a blue overall and a big kitchen knife that make him very sinister, without having to appeal to something more brutal and explicit, like some of the slasher killers that came after him. Michael is a very well designed horror villain and he is probably one of my favorites too (keeping in mind that this isn't the only Halloween film). So what is it about Halloween that doesn't quite do it for me?My main problem with Halloween is that I find it a little bit slow (there, I said it!) and I'm sure this is the main reason why other people dislike it as well, which automatically causes avid Halloween fans to accuse the detractors of only being capable of appreciating horror films with a lot of cheap-scares. I actually don't have a problem with slow films, but I feel like most of this film features the main character going on about her business, chatting with her silly friends about high school crushes and stuff, and we occasionally see Michael Myers appearing here and there. I do realize that this is intended to create a frightening atmosphere and it actually works well, but after a while, I find it a little bit tedious.Those who want gory murders will have to skip this film. While I think gore is not always a requirement, I would normally expect the murders to have some kind of shock value and be disturbing, even if we don't get to see a single drop of blood (it can happen). Most of the murders are rather predictable and what we see on the screen isn't too disturbing or shocking, at least not by nowadays' standards. Fortunately, the music during the murders is so powerful and fear-provoking that it makes up for the lack of brutality. For the life of me, I can't understand how Halloween got an R-rating in so many countries. Not only there's barely any blood in it, but also, the nudity is very naïf and harmless. Towards the last twenty minutes, Halloween displays a lot of suspense, mainly with Laurie Strode (the lead) being chased by the sinister Michael Myers. This part of the film is not only full of tension due to the fact that a merciless killer is out to get an innocent high school girl for no apparent reason, but also because two small kids are in danger and it's the lead girl's implied responsibility to protect them. The confrontation between Michael and Laurie is chilling, as the killer is apparently impossible to kill and Laurie, in all her nervousness, goes out of her way to make the worst possible choices when it comes to escaping the lunatic. While I find the night scenario and the dark in general to be fitting for a horror film about a mysterious killer, I find the excessive dark to also make it very difficult to fully appreciate what's going on at times. The acting in Halloween is very solid, which is unlikely to find in slasher films, or at least the ones that came out during and after the eighties.

Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.Life Although the I live my life a quarter mile at a time mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.Cars Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful nu-metal or rapcore music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.Family Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it.

It still felt slightly detached, a bit cool (the cold kind), but I understood it much better.Almost 20 years later I finally get round to watching it a third time. Kubrick's 2001 has a very similar watch-history, and upon its third-viewing just a few weeks ago I declared it my Number 1 favourite film, giving it an easy 10\/10 (only 7 of my 700 rated films are a 10).As a sci-fi fan I was fully expecting Blade Runner to similarly WOW me...alas, it somehow fell just a bit short. That cool, detached vibe was still there. The scenes, as memorable as they are, just sort of happen without much viewer connection (especially the famous final speech). The Final Cut version - first time I've seen this edition - has a couple of jarring edits which added to this odd feeling (check out how the edit cuts after the nose-pulling scene, and another example how after Batty says to JF I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come...come it cuts immediately to Roy looking all theatrical, but alone, in a completely different setting.Add those odd vibes to the overlong romantic scene in the middle of the movie, which just felt tortuously slow, and truly cheesy too, thanks to the only piece of soundtrack music which has dated horribly...Kenny G has a lot to answer for.This 'disconnect' is the reason it can't touch 2001 (which has a very different quality of 'disconnect'). Saying that, Blade Runner is still worth a very good and entirely recommended 8\/10 - this is one of cinema's best-realised future worlds. It's believable & immersive to the point you can almost taste the air.- great cast, with characters that reveal their colour over time...like a fine wine.- aside from that awful misplaced sax, the soundtrack is gorgeous, and fits the world perfectly.- the is he or isn't he ambiguity is nicely done, tho' I wouldn't even call it ambiguous (he is, and so is Adama).- there's a large handful of memorable scenes, even if you do feel weirdly disconnected to what's happening, you'll still enjoy the surreal vibes.Best to watch it when you're feeling that world, if the first 30 minutes don't pull you in then leave it for another day.

Back then I wasn't impressed by Blade Runner at all, probably because I was expecting Han Solo rather than the introverted action we get with the Ridley Scott film.Then I saw it again as a young adult, and appreciated it a lot more. It still felt slightly detached, a bit cool (the cold kind), but I understood it much better.Almost 20 years later I finally get round to watching it a third time. Kubrick's 2001 has a very similar watch-history, and upon its third-viewing just a few weeks ago I declared it my Number 1 favourite film, giving it an easy 10\/10 (only 7 of my 700 rated films are a 10).As a sci-fi fan I was fully expecting Blade Runner to similarly WOW me...alas, it somehow fell just a bit short.

However, after now watching it for the first time since it's release and actually paying attention, it is definitely much better than I initially thought. The film is pretty slow-paced - that view's not changed - but when you pay attention, and understand & listen to what is happening, it doesn't feel all that slow as you become more drawn into the story, which is well written.The story isn't full of implausible moments, it doesn't have that Hollywood touch about it, and isn't full of the usual stalker film cliché's. I also enjoyed how it got you thinking if some of the later scenes were for real or if they were just in Sy's head. I mean the first main fantasy scene wasn't obvious until it's end, so maybe other scenarios weren't real either. It never confused you but it got you thinking which was good.The cast all do a great job with their roles, but Williams was the main standout with his performance of Sy. You know that Sy is obviously completely in the wrong with what he's doing but you still feel sorry for him and this is where Williams plays the part SO well. He doesn't make Sy seem like some clichéd sick twisted psycho...he portrays Sy as just a very nice but a sad, lonely individual whose only friend in life is his pet hamster. No matter what happens during the film, you just cannot feel any hate towards Sy.I sometimes don't notice the way scenes are filmed in movies at times, but the use of the colours to depict the mood for different scenarios was done well I thought. The main instance here being the difference between Sy's own personal world i.e. in his home, compared to that of the Yorkin's. It's not done for the sake of it nor to be artsy, but done with reason which adds to the overall feel of the film.This isn't an amazing film, but it is enjoyable.

If you feel the same and you want a comedic take on this aspect, I think you will enjoy A Goofy Movie. It has some good, memorable songs, a lot of visual and cleverly written humour and a few touching moments too. The best part of the film is the really strong message about the importance of a relationship between fathers and their son(s) and how as the two get older that relationship needs to change and evolve for the bond to stay consistently strong. I like that the story is absolutely ludicrous. You might even call it goofy. I actually wish it was longer because there are a few scenes that feel like they're missing. Our two heroes are in one location and then it cuts to days later and they've traveled a great distance. I wish we could have seen that journey. As far as animation goes, it's not breaking any new grounds, but it more than does the job. There isn't a villain in this story, just the drama between Goofy (Bill Farmer) and Max (Jason Marsden) and the struggles come mostly from the fact that as boys grow up into men, the relationship between father and son shifts in unpredictable ways. It's earnest and heart warming but it doesn't feel cheesy. It's good enough to watch by yourself but it will be a lot more effective if you watch it with your old man for some nostalgic goodness or with your own children.

Our two heroes are in one location and then it cuts to days later and they've traveled a great distance. I wish we could have seen that journey. As far as animation goes, it's not breaking any new grounds, but it more than does the job. There isn't a villain in this story, just the drama between Goofy (Bill Farmer) and Max (Jason Marsden) and the struggles come mostly from the fact that as boys grow up into men, the relationship between father and son shifts in unpredictable ways. It's earnest and heart warming but it doesn't feel cheesy. It's good enough to watch by yourself but it will be a lot more effective if you watch it with your old man for some nostalgic goodness or with your own children.

If you feel the same and you want a comedic take on this aspect, I think you will enjoy A Goofy Movie. It has some good, memorable songs, a lot of visual and cleverly written humour and a few touching moments too.

They are the best because they are all driven to be the best, in a casual, yet f off kind of way. From what I gather, they don't care about the reviews, they are just that far into their characters, which makes for the best kind of film. This movie brings new light to the term cool. I give this film a 10 simply because its real, in a dog eat dog gritty way, Pulp Fiction is a movie I can play on repeat, even with the mistaken over dose scene, and blood, every time I watch it, I fall in love all over again. Real life, if real life came to your front door with a gun. From personal experience I would go into this movie with an absolutely open mind, and freshly open brew.

Bruno Ganz and especially Klaus Kinski did an excellent job acting their parts. One can even argue that Kinski was born to play this role. Atmosphere is chilling, imagery is brilliant and performance are really good. What's not to like? OK, only one thing That laugh was so annoying, like REALLY annoying but it was a minor character anyway. Did I mention that cinematography was excellent? This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies, let me tell you. Nosferatu, the Vampye is for anyone who likes to watch a good-acted brilliant movie. Not for someone who watches movies for their stupid jump scares and explosions. All in all, this is a brilliant effort by Werner Herzog (Director) and Klaus Kinski ( But you already knew that!)
