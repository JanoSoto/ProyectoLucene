In OMF he plays Flint as someone who is 'sort of real' ... for example, when Cramden asks him, Is there nothing you don't know? A great many things, sir. In the fight sequences, they are also played 'not campy' ... the fight in the bathroom ... it's more fun when it looks somewhat real, and when the toilet paper and grunt of Gruber comes at the scene's end, it's the right touch.The same with the fight with the two guards outside Cramden's office. Great stuff. I think Coburn's style influenced Bruce Lee ... or other way around? If Coburn did OMF in 1965 or so, and he met Lee a couple of years later (I'm not certain) .... And after the fight, the comedy is just right; a blend of silliness (the light bulb) and straightness, with Flint saving a life. Notice also when Cramden is darted, and Flint doesn't mug when he does the cut.But in the sequel, Coburn is all over the place, over-mugging. While most of the credit for the downsizing of Flint goes to the writers, Coburn also has to take some blame. There is hardly an action scene where he plays Flint like a fighting master ... just for laffs. Again, counter this with OMF  when he climbs the ladder with the guitar rift, happily Coburn doesn't wink and mug. With that great music, it would've ruined the scene(s).However, the scene in the penthouse, with Flint talking about eating grubs is the Flint form the first movie. The director should have seen this. Or maybe Coburn thought the script was so dumb, he just let loose and had his own jokes. But Flint loses his fun when it became too much Austin Powers.Btw, the Powers movies would have been much better if they had been played as a homage to Flint\/Bond. That's what OMF did so well.

Actually, it started out the way most commercial films start out nowadays as well It was an attempt at repeating the success of a previous film with the same stars. When the studio is focusing on a worry involving the comparison between the height of the male star and the women in the film and have him where shoes that make him taller, when the famous hole in the plot concerning an all-too-ambiguous death that Chandler himself couldn't figure out in his novel's adaptation, and when the majority of Martha Vickers's performance is cut because she has more intensity than the more profitable actress in the film, we're not talking about the celebration of cinematic art. We're talking about making ch-chings.I'm not saying The Big Sleep is a bad movie, because it isn't. It's just an early example of the transformation in film from art to commercialism and the rare wedding of both. Ask most big fans of this movie if they really follow the story. It's such a complex one, not to mention how much it was adjusted for the bankable advantages of having more of Bogart and Bacall on screen than they otherwise would've been. Here's a general description of the gist of the plot Humphrey Bogart's character, down-to-earth private investigator Philip Marlowe, is sent for by General Sternwood, a rich war veteran who is dying from complications of organs that are growing weaker with his old age. Marlowe is asked to deal with blackmail concerning the General's youngest daughter, Carmen. Marlowe finds that the problem centers about the disappearance of Sternwood's favorite employee who has left with a mobster's wife. Marlowe soon finds himself falling in love with Sternwood's oldest daughter, Vivien, who initially takes a deep dislike to Mr Marlowe. As things unravel, the body count increases to cover the villain's tracks.See, now doesn't that sound good? Like a good little detective thriller? What the studio did to malleate it for an ensured profitability is not necessarily a bad thing, especially in comparison to what studios do for the same reasons nowadays, but why not let a movie be what it is? Nonetheless, it's a classic, and it's very good. Great cast, beautiful women, wonderfully earthy dialogue.

However, this simply isn't the case. The use of the n-word is merely for illustrating the racism inherent in society at the time the film is set. I personally don't like the word, and I find its use generally unappealing. However, let's not kid ourselves. People back in the Fifties, Sixties, and even Seventies used the word all the time.

This is the kind of film that was made literally for the big screen. It's what epic movie making is all about.I also think that you should see this on the big screen back to back with Warren Beatty's Reds. Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution, one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.The title character, played by Omar Sharif, is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter, Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves, but naturally like a sister. The real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy, with shall we say, some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. Christie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.Zhivago knows change was inevitable, the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed, in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.I still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film, I think he would have approved.From the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia, David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created, you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie, you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.Other performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago, a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.Doctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories, strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory, I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965.

Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution, one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.The title character, played by Omar Sharif, is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter, Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves, but naturally like a sister. The real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy, with shall we say, some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. Christie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.Zhivago knows change was inevitable, the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed, in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.I still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film, I think he would have approved.From the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia, David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created, you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie, you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.Other performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago, a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.Doctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories, strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory, I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965.
