It's definitely one of the most popular Hollywood blockbusters in history. It could be very easily a dumb b-class action movie , but thankfully it was done by professionals and remains one of the best movies of 80's and best movies ever.The original concept for this film originated as a joke.

Interesting thing &#x96; Jean Claude Van Damme (Bloodsport) was cast to play Predator , but he was quickly fired and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall &#x96; experienced actor who played many monsters in his movie career thanks to his impressive height.It's a true macho movie full of manly men and no love story in it.

Your one ugly motherf****r .The heavy artillery is also cool - ultra-destructive Gatling gun or Predator's blades and shoulder gun. Add to that a great jungle that gives a true claustrophobic feel to the movie. It's probably the best jungle in the history of cinema. Funny thing &#x96; the whole movie was made in studio.Most people remembers Arnold performance here with the classic and incredibly funny Get to da choppa and Stick around one-liners. The truth is this is one of Schwarzenegger best performances . His low-key performance works really well and he is definitely a man who could defeat an alien hunter.

Alan Silvestri's legendary musical score also helps to keep the tension and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. .

The Predator itself is a fascinating creature, scary and full of mystery. A worthy opponent of Alien indeed.The only bad thing is the fact that the movie never really explains what Predator was doing in the jungle and we didn't get to see Predator's ship . The ending also leaves much to be desired in terms of believability , but that's a minor issue.Predator is a simple movie with simple plot done in wonderful way.

The restored film DVD has some bonus shorts with good background on the making of this film. The IMDb movie page has the budget estimated at $5 million. But, the cost was $2.7 million, according to the DVD bonus videos. And that was an astronomical amount for 1954. It made it the most costly film produced in the history of movies to that time &#x96; surpassing the previous most costly, Gone With the Wind.This was a big success for Walt Disney. But it was a real gamble from the start. Before that time Disney had only done animated films. He had some great successes. But, Hollywood didn't consider him in the big leagues since he hadn't yet made a live action film. When one considers that no one in Hollywood had taken on a project like this before then, it showed Disney to be a man of action and conviction. He was already known as a dreamer and producer of fairy tales. At the time he decided to tackle 20,000 Leagues as a live action film, he also had plans underway for the opening of Disneyland. So, this film, with its huge costs, was a make it or break it project for Disney. There was one silent film made before this time &#x96; by Universal in 1916. It had some underwater shots filmed in the Bahamas. But the inability to create the technical submarine and many of the underwater special effects, led the filmmakers to alter the plot considerably. It borrowed from other stories, including some other Verne fiction, and much of it was shot on dry land. With its release in 1954, Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea did justice to the wonderful Jules Verne tale of undersea adventure, exploration and sights. The detailed, elaborate and lengthy designs of the Nautilus are most impressive and yet today give one a sense of being in a real submarine. The underwater scenes, also shot in the Bahamas, are still among the best such scenes used in movies. And the giant squid, of course, seems very real. Younger audiences today may find this classic film somewhat slow. But many aspects of it are still noteworthy and enjoyable. The set, cinematography, special effects, direction and acting all are exceptional.

It's basically the same plot as in Rocky 3 with small changes (Apollo instead of Mick , Ivan Drago instead of Clubber Lang). Unlike other movies in the series Rocky IV isn't a sport drama &#x96; it's too silly for that , too cheesy to take itself seriously. It's more of an unusual action movie with boxing in it. It's more like Commando than original Rocky . If you're ready to accept it , prepare yourself for fun. The movie was a huge success &#x96; Rocky IV was the highest grossing film in the Rocky series, taking some $300 million worldwide. After watching the movie it's not strange to see why. It's a product of it's times , but still very entertaining today.Yes , the Russians are portrayed stereotypical here and in reality, Soviet Heavyweights were not allowed to box professional fighters during the Cold War , but who really cares (except for Russians of course). Rocky IV is largely a metaphor for the tensions between America and Russia which existed in the Cold War. Drago is Soviet Union &#x96; stronger and cruel , while Balboa is America &#x96; weaker, but with more heart and stamina. The famous line it's better to watch two people trying to kill each other than twenty millions actually has meaning here. Communist and Nazis did use the sports for their propaganda and very often in real life politics and sport were entwined. Rocky IV has a strong anti-communist message, which I appreciate unlike other viewers. Communism was a terrifying system that treated people like puppets for the needs of communist party (Drago here is no exception). Rocky IV also has got a simple , but honest (at least to me ) message that people should look past their political beliefs and try to find peace on Earth. There is also some interesting commentary here on man vs machine and dehumanization of society because of technology (Paulie's robot).The movie is far from being realistic , but I have to defend it a little. First of all it IS possible for a boxer to die during boxing match ( Benny Paret vs Emile Griffith in 1962) . Second , it is possible for a crowd to cheer for the opponent when he wins their respect ( in football\/soccer when a player of the opposite team shoot 4 goals in one match the crowd gave him a standing ovation). Third , Rocky's unconventional techniques have a logic behind them. Rocky isn't using technology or steroids , because he doesn't think that's honorable . He makes it harder for himself intentionally and he succeeds . It's not the technology and money , but heart and talent what really count. The training sequences are top notch , great to watch and inspiring. The training techniques and technology that Drago has in this movie were considered science fiction in 1985 , but now they are a standard . And it's true that in communist countries steroids were often used.Stallone was in great physical shape in 1985 as he made both Rambo 2 and Rocky 4. That's all you remember from his performance . Talia Shire , Carl Weathers and Burt Young gave good performances as their repeated their roles from previous movies. Brigitte Nielsen (Stallone's future wife) is OK as the wife of Drago. The real star here is however Dolph Lundgren (The Punisher) as Ivan Drago. He was a perfect choice. His physically incredibly intimidating and definitely one of greatest cinema villains.This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. James Brown Living in America , Robert Trepper No easy way out ( one of the best montage songs ever ) , Survivor  Burning heart , John Cafferty Hearts on fire &#x96; the soundtrack here is just fantastic. Stallone's makes a great use of the songs and Vince DiCola's music (Training montage is incredibly catchy) . He shows a talent worthy of great music video director here. When the music appears it's incredibly inspiring and powerful. The fights scenes are appropriately brutal and unrealistic , but that's what they are so fun. It's an ultimate David versus Goliat fight.The movie is full of memorable , if not silly dialogues and one liners. Who could forget If I can change , then you can change then everybody can change . Other famous lines  If he dies, he dies , Hit the one in the middle , I will break you. The hit the one in the middle exchange, actually did happen in real life fight during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933 .It's definitely a classic movie and a symbol of the 80's &#x96; over the top , but wonderfully entertaining.

Stallone's makes a great use of the songs and Vince DiCola's music (Training montage is incredibly catchy) . He shows a talent worthy of great music video director here. When the music appears it's incredibly inspiring and powerful. The fights scenes are appropriately brutal and unrealistic , but that's what they are so fun. It's an ultimate David versus Goliat fight.The movie is full of memorable , if not silly dialogues and one liners. Who could forget If I can change , then you can change then everybody can change . Other famous lines  If he dies, he dies , Hit the one in the middle , I will break you. The hit the one in the middle exchange, actually did happen in real life fight during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933 .It's definitely a classic movie and a symbol of the 80's &#x96; over the top , but wonderfully entertaining. If I had to rate it for it's pure entertainment value I would give it 10\/10. However since this is an odd entry in a solid series of sport dramas I give it 6\/10.

Raiders of the Lost Ark isn't one of his lesser films, but one might be inclined to think it is his most shallow. I don't believe that's true, because beneath his bone-jangling action scenes and snappy wit there is a level of dark urgency. When this film is mentioned there are usually a lot of knowing smiles and no one doubts that it is fun, but an in-depth discussion is a rare thing. I think I understand why. Raiders can be an easy to write-off as a cheesecake action movie, a lark that Spielberg dreamed up between, Close Encounters and E.T. I think the film is just as deep, where E.T. was Spielberg's personal observation about divorce and Close Encounters displayed his desire to not be alone, Raiders taps into a childhood love of Saturday Matinée Serials and subconsciously to his hatred of Nazis.I think that the movie is far more intelligent than most give it credit for. This is one of the most well-paced action movies I can remember. It takes the time to build a story we care about, unlike most Hollywood product that seems to be playing Beat the Clock with the audience's presumed case of attention deficit disorder. The first hour of the film is a build up long before we see the Ark. Most movies spend five minutes of discussion time before the movie's prize is found (witness Stargate). I rarely see a movie in which the director is willing to devote this much build-up.The hero is intelligent and fallible. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), a professor who moonlights as an adventuring archaeologist digging in caves for lost artifacts (or is it the other way around?). Casting is important here because the role needed to go to a likable guy who can take it on the chin and make us believe that he isn't the center of the action. Harrison Ford broke away from Han Solo by playing a man who is a bit more mature and worn-down. The movie introduces Indiana as a college professor and he is allowed to think rather than just act as the token for action sequences, even though he gets into more scrapes than any action hero that I can think of. He gets punched, beaten, shot, burned, dragged and clipped on the jaw. He is nearly crushed by a boulder, skewered with arrows, bitten by snakes, blown up, hacked by a propeller, crushed between two cars and nearly falls to his death while hanging by his fingernails over a bottomless pit.For me, the movie fulfills two requirements First, It has action scenes that don't feel tacked on and when it is over I feel that something has been accomplished. Of course this movie is all in the journey. Consider how Spielberg allows the movie to jump from one grandiose action sequence to the next. Beginning with the scene in which Indy is down in the Well of Souls surrounded by snakes follows with a mummy attack, a fight on a Nazi Flying Wing and the famous truck chase. For at least an hour the movie doesn't slow down.My second requirement is that the movie has something at stake. For that, the movie has Indiana chasing The Ark of the Covenant before the Nazi's can get their hands on it. We know how horrible and efficient the Nazis were and we know what is at stake if they can become invincible. They have always been the favorite villains in the movies because most of us share a similar hatred toward Hitler and his thugs. We want to see them punished and the movie doesn't let us down.Searching for the Ark, the Nazis understand what is achieved if they obtain it, but they don't understand its power. The Ark is portrayed in this movie as an object surrounded by death. Through the dialogue, Spielberg creates a grim tone around this object so we always know how dangerous it really is. From the moment that the movie calls the Ark into question we are told that The bible speaks of The Ark leveling mountains and Death has always surrounded it. Consider then that every time we see the ark in the movie, it is surrounded by motifs of death rats, snakes, Nazis. There is an eerie scene in which it sits in a cargo hold in a crate embossed with the swastika and from the inside it burns the symbol on the outside. All of this more or less prepares us for what for ultimately happens when the Ark is opened and the spirits punish the Nazis for their blasphemy. There is a level of gruesome joy with which Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas dispatch their villains.The Nazis in this film are portrayed in the best tradition of great films of the past. They are portrayed as shallow and one-dimensional. We see Colonel Dietrich (Wolfe Kauler), a boot-lackey of Hitler who at one point addresses Only our mission for the fuhrer matters. And there is the black coated Nazi Gestapo officer (Ronald Lacey) who enjoys torturing the heroine. The major villain however has a bit more character. His name is Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), a French archaeologist and Indy's chief rival.But as much depth as Raiders has, I must observe that the movie is just plain fun. There are action sequences here that have never been surpassed even a quarter of a century later.

Ford was greatly impressed by Davis' work here and immediately accepted that role. 9 nine actors from US , including Tommy Lee Jones appeared in TF.

He needs help from few other people and that was a refreshing thing to see.The show however belongs to two veteran actors  Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) and Gary Busey (Lethal weapon). They play villains and they are obviously the most colorful and charismatic characters in the movie. They are little over &#x96; the &#x96;top , but never overdone it. The action is a high point here. Some Seagal fans might be a little disappointed because it doesn't contain that many aikido moves like his other movies. Still there is enough brutal violence , shootouts , death traps , explosions and a good knife fight to make every action movie junkie happy. The direction by Andrew Davis is top notch . Harrison Ford watched this film while he was deciding whether to take on the lead role in The Fugitive, which had Davis already set to direct. Ford was greatly impressed by Davis' work here and immediately accepted that role. 9 nine actors from US , including Tommy Lee Jones appeared in TF. The sound is also impressive (2 Oscar nominations). The only bad thing is Gary Chang's bland and completely forgettable score. Under siege  is the best movie of Steven Seagal. It's a good , fun popcorn movie definitely worth watching. I give it 7\/10.

Some of the twists here are simply dumb , while other come close to being simply unbelievable. The main twist is also easy to guess from the beginning , even for people with only half of brain. The plot is also kinda predictable at moments. The love story feels very forced , yet I don't mind because I saw breasts of Mastrantonio The best thing about White sands is acting. Willem Defoe (Platoon) plays here one of the most likable heroes I've seen. Mickey Rourke (Sin city) is great as the arms dealer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Robin Hood prince of thieves) is good and shows her breasts. It was also good to see Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp fiction) and veteran actor M.

This scary triller is plenty of mystery , intrigue , suspenseful and creepy scenes . It is a potentially brilliant and ingenious chiller that concerns about a government agent , Peter Sandza , (Kirk Douglas , he was aged around sixty-one years of age , Kirk was cast as the lead because director had felt that his previous picture had suffered at the box-office without a name draw-card) determined to come to his son's (first major cinema movie role of actor Andrew Stevens) rescue , when a sinister official (John Cassavetes) kidnaps him to harbor his extremely powerful psychic abilities . As he is forced to take on a super-powerful government agency called MORG (it stands for the Multiphasic Operations Research Group) which has kidnapped his son with psychokinetic skills . The intrepid father is helped by a good friend called Hester (Carrie Snodgress) . And then things really get worse . Meanwhile , a young girl (Amy Irving who married Spielberg , she attended a biofeedback clinic to learn about different levels of consciousness, as she had a better sense to play) who personally experiencing psychic changes is taken in a strange Institute of supernatural forces . Peter uses desperate attempts to save hid gifted son from being used or destryed . At the end takes place the ultimate revenge story . This stylish chiller contains long-drawn-out tension , flash violent scenes and shock effects with the accent on gas-provoking , but on most occasion without finesse . Adding special characteristics techniques as ominous camera movements and wide screen . This flick was made and released about two years after its source novel of the same name by John Farris was first published in 1976 ; Farris also wrote the screenplay for the film . It is is a contemporary thrilling tale that utilizes the average man against the unknown approach that made Hitchcock 's suspense films so effective . All this said , the mechanics of suspense are worked quite well and may frighten the easily scared quite badly , but De Palma has made a habit of dwelling on their more sordid shoots . Director 'Brian de Palma''s second movie featuring Telekinesis, his first had been Carrie (1976) , as actress Amy Irving appears in both films . In fact , this picture has often been described as a cross between The Omen (1976) and a peculiar follow-up to Carrie (1976) . Very good cast plenty of familiar faces such as John Cassavetes , Charles Durning , Rutanya Alda , Fiona Lewis , Carrie Snodgres and William Finley who played for De Palma , Phantom of paradise . Being the first film for both Daryl Hannah, Laura Innes and look fast James Belushi as an extra , as you can see him in a pair of dark trunks a few steps behind Irving . The film displays a great and haunting musical score by John Williams , previous his fruitful collaboration to Steven Spielberg ; he composed in the style of a Bernard Herrmann score from an Alfred Hitchcock movie . Furthermore , appropriate and colorful cinematography by excellent cameraman Richard H Kline .The picture was brilliantly directed by Brian De Palma , adding special characteristics techniques and special camera movements .

It was my first time experiencing the film and being a huge fan of David Lynch (my new favourite director) you can only imagine how excited I was. It's now half past eleven in the morning and Eraserhead is still whirling around in my very own head. The film is extraordinary. I've seen my fair share of weird films, from Jan Svankmajer's Conspirators of Pleasure to Lynch's very own Inland Empire, but somehow Eraserhead manages to surpass them both in the weirdness department. Indeed, Eraserhead is probably the weirdest film I have ever seen. It's pure Lynch and pure art. It's a film which you could not put into words; it's something you have to experience for yourself.When the film was over, my sister and I sat there in silence as the credits rolled up. My heart was thumping quickly and loudly. I felt utterly horrified by what I had just watched. I was drained and could hardly walk in a straight line afterwards. I don't get scared very often at all, but Eraserhead actually did frighten me. Its atmosphere is choking, unsettling and disturbing. The images are stuff you wouldn't even be able to find in nightmares.Your enjoyment of Eraserhead is partly down to how you view it. If you watch it in broad daylight with kids running around and not paying too much attention to it, then you're not going to like it. You're going to think it's the biggest pile of shitake you've ever seen and I wouldn't blame you for saying that! To fully experience Eraserhead (and with every other David Lynch film) you must immerse yourself in it. Watch it alone, in the dark, with the sound turned up and an open mind then you will experience something truly unique.The film is virtually plot-less. Or at least it seems that way when you first see it, but I'm convinced that if you dig underneath all the bizarre symbolism then you will find something quite rich and astonishing. It resembles a feature length version of one of David's shorts, especially The Grandmother and it's all the more better for it. I didn't feel like I was watching a film at all, rather I felt like I was having a nightmare. It didn't even feel like I was watching a nightmare. It felt like I was literally having a nightmare! Eraserhead is scene after scene of bizarre and incredibly frightening imagery. It's enough to make a person go insane.David Lynch's directing here is as amazing as it has ever been. He creates a chilling atmosphere with the use of a droning industrial soundtrack which is excruciating to listen to at times. He also makes incredible use of a slow pace and startling black and white photography which has an eerie beauty about it. It's a seriously depressing atmosphere and it's one which will stay with you for a long time after seeing it. The dream-like quality of the film is astonishing. When the lady in the radiator started singing I felt disturbed, bewildered and transfixed all at the same time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the duration of the film.It also feels like it's on for an eternity when you're watching it and I don't mean that in a bad way. It enhances the nightmarish quality as when you have a dream it feels like you're there forever, but when you wake up you can only remember bits. Eraserhead is exactly like this. It's a nightmare captured on film and confirms David Lynch as a master of cinema. His films are unlike any other and they manage to affect me in such a deep manner. I was shaken when Eraserhead had finished and it brought back memories of when I saw Inland Empire for the first time.Having said all this, Eraserhead is not a film for a mainstream audience. Not everyone will 'get it' and I wouldn't blame you if you hated it. Strange doesn't even begin to describe Eraserhead. All I know is that it's a masterpiece.

After his childhood friend is murdered, Axel assigns himself to investigate the murder, despite harsh opposition from others on the force. He travels to Beverly Hills to work for the Beverly Hills Police Department and turns the force upside down with his aforementioned character traits. Murphy is ideal for the role of Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop. Murphy's mile-a-minute conversational humor and rapid-fire wit keeps things moving at a breakneck pace, and the man has enough charisma to keep a story like this moving. Furthermore, writer Daniel Petrie, Jr. makes sure to give Murphy an ample amount of screen time so his Axel Foley character rise is given moments to be fiercely likable and someone we grow to like.And even after giving us an energetic central character, Petrie, Jr. is sure to give us terrific action sequences. For example, the film opens with a fantastic chase scene between numerous police cruisers and a large, eighteen-wheeler carrying dozens of cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes with Axel being thrown every which way in the back of the truck. The scene goes on for about three minutes and possesses the same kind of excitement and practicalness of The Blues Brothers's famous action scenes in the regard that digital effects don't seem to be interfering with the film every chance they get.Instead, the chase scene feels much more natural and real because of the fact that it's as if we're watching a real-life car chase on TV. Another scene similar to this one is the shootout scene between Axel and two other detectives and several other goons using high-powered machine guns. The scene operates like a realistic shootout and is simply a lot of fun to sit back and watch.Another thing levying the entire film is the soundtrack, which blends the likes of electric pop and techno music that allows for an exciting mix of things. For 1984, this was an uncommon thing, and the film's frequent use of one specific techno song allow for a nice consistency and an inane catchiness to the film all around.The Beverly Hills Cop franchise is an interesting footnote in film mainly because all three films are directed by three different directors, who've had strong and prolific experience in the action genre. The first sequel was directed by Top Gun director Tony Scott, while the second sequel by John Landis, who directed The Blues Brothers. As for this film, Martin Brest mans this ship, a man whose entire career has pretty much been devoted to action comedies that pack a wallop. His camera-work and filmmaking techniques are continuously impressive, and with the help of Daniel Petrie, Jr., the story at hand never becomes shackled by the confines of dreary storytelling or even a romance. In a world where it seems buddy cop films can barely establish actor\/ character-chemistry and a credible plot, it's almost shocking to see what Beverly Hills Cop does and does so well.Starring Eddie Murphy.

It seems that director John Woo was more interested in directing a generic love-story than a spy flick, resulting in a weirdly slow (and uneventful) first hour. During the second hour, Woo must have realized how crushingly dull the first half of his film was, and crammed as much action as he could into the second hour. But even then, these action scenes only add up to lots and lots of mindless shooting, a car\/motorcycle chase that lasts far too long, and a well-choreographed (but ultimately tedious) hand-to-hand fight scene. The first hour is a bore, but the second is so mindlessly constructed and even pointless, that one almost wishes to return to the plodding first half.In the process of recruiting Nyah Nordoff-Hall, agent Ethan Hunt falls in love with her, creating an unfortunate complication. The complication is that Nyah is to go meet up with an old love named Sean Ambrose, in hopes of attaining a dangerous virus that Ambrose plans on releasing into the world.I'm all up for a good romance, even if I was expecting an action-packed thriller. But when a romance is written as poorly as this one, it's hard to hold one's interest (some lines are even cringe-worthy). The problem here, is that everything about Ethan and Nyah's relationship is predictable and familiar. There is nothing unique or intriguing about their relationship, nor the circumstances surrounding it, ultimately dooming the first half of the film.The second half focuses far less on Ethan and Nyah's love-story, and chooses instead to hone in on the primary strength of the first film; meaning action sequences. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, the action sequences (while generous in screen-time) are criminally tedious. One extended sequence literally just involves people shooting at each other, to the point where it's impossible to tell what's going on.And, as mentioned, there is a chase sequence where Ethan Hunt is trying to get away on a motorcycle, but it quickly becomes monotonous and repetitive. With this sequence, and a car chase from Jack Reacher in mind, I can only conclude that chase sequences should be banned from any and all Tom Cruise films to limit extended periods of boredom.As far as positives go, I suppose it's notable that the plot isn't even close to as convoluted as that of the first. However, the first half of the film actually goes to the extreme opposite, with a plot and script so simplistic, it's legitimately insulting. The sweeping cinematography might be worth praising too, had it not been for the excessive amount of slo-mo.All the actors involved seem to be on auto-pilot (with a single exception). Thanks in part to bland, and lifeless characters, Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, and Thandie Newton fail to make any lasting (or even temporary) impressions in their performances. Only Anthony Hopkins (as Mission Commander Swanbeck) is especially notable, and in any other film, he might not have been. His two scenes provided more entertainment than the rest of the film combined.The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is simply, terrible. It's the worst score I've heard in a very long time. Emphasizing on electric guitars (and even wailing middle-eastern vocals), this rock-oriented score is nothing short of unbearable. It also commits one of the worst crimes a musical score can be found guilty of. And that, of course, is hurting the film itself. I was tempted to hit the mute button on multiple occasions, out of sheer disgust of the repulsive rock music. Also interesting is the lack of Lalo Schifrin's original theme- making only two, fleeting appearances.Mission Impossible 2 just isn't any fun. The script is bad, the performances are weak, and the action sequences are a total snooze. While it's not as needlessly convoluted as Brian De Palma's original, it also lacks the over-the-top fun that the first at least sporadically achieved.

Thanks in part to bland, and lifeless characters, Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, and Thandie Newton fail to make any lasting (or even temporary) impressions in their performances. Only Anthony Hopkins (as Mission Commander Swanbeck) is especially notable, and in any other film, he might not have been. His two scenes provided more entertainment than the rest of the film combined.The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is simply, terrible. It's the worst score I've heard in a very long time. Emphasizing on electric guitars (and even wailing middle-eastern vocals), this rock-oriented score is nothing short of unbearable. It also commits one of the worst crimes a musical score can be found guilty of. And that, of course, is hurting the film itself. I was tempted to hit the mute button on multiple occasions, out of sheer disgust of the repulsive rock music. Also interesting is the lack of Lalo Schifrin's original theme- making only two, fleeting appearances.Mission Impossible 2 just isn't any fun. The script is bad, the performances are weak, and the action sequences are a total snooze. While it's not as needlessly convoluted as Brian De Palma's original, it also lacks the over-the-top fun that the first at least sporadically achieved. I can't recommend it for much more than an antidote for insomnia.

It was my watching The Birth of a Nation earlier this month and that it's Black History Month that finally got me to do so. My verdict I loved it! The story of Scarlett O'Hara and all her trials during and after the Civil War really got to me and her constant pining for Ashley Wilkes and her later relationship with Rhett Butler got me staying for the whole thing in one sitting. Vivien Leigh truly deserved her Oscar for the role of her lifetime. I wasn't so sure about Hattie McDaniel's award until her emotional scene near the end though her role-like many of the other black servant roles in the movie-do strike one of Minstrelsy especially when it came to Butterfly McQueen's. Still, there was some amusing scenes I liked among them like that of Eddie Anderson's-this was before he became well-known as Rochester on The Jack Benny Program on radio-when trying to catch a chicken! Olivia de Havilland was also fine as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard likewise as Ashley Wilkes. Oh, and Clark Gable was perfect as Rhett Butler! I'll just now say if you hadn't seen Gone with the Wind yet, well, if you're so inclined, just do it! P.S. Since I like to point out when players from my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life, are in something else, here it's Thomas Mitchell as Scarlett's father and Ward Bond as a military officer.
