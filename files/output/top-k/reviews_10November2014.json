Just from this I could tell this movie had something else to this. In an incredible but shocking and, in its way, logical process, it shows a series of shots of a woman running down a road, stopping thanks to a car (driven by our PI, Mike Hammer), and then after a few moments of being safe with this man and the mystery not revealed yet... the car is stopped, feet come forward - and a dissolve over a woman's scream to a woman's legs being tortured. Then the perspective of Hammer, off to the side totally out of it, hearing men's voices discussing vague things involving what to do.As any Screen writing 101 teacher will tell you, getting the opening and the ending of a movie right is so crucial. Here, this movie has both, and the ending involves that briefcase (yeah, that one, thanks Quentin for the reference). But what Aldrich and his collaborators do here is interesting if you hear on the interview on the Criterion DVD, the movie isn't a close adaptation of the book - in fact it deviates a bit. The book doesn't have the whole aspect of the nuclear secrets. It was just another story of Hammer getting into violent s*** and kicking ass and taking names in the midst of his story.Luckily, Aldrich also has a fine lead in Ralph Meeker, who can play tough and take-no-s*** just fine (he never 'made it' as a leading man, but he shows up in a number of memorable movies over the years from Alrdich, Kubrick and Lang). In this story Hammer is out to find out what the hell happened to him that night, who that dame was (played by a young Cloris Leachman by the way), and why he was set up to die in a car crash. He gets help from a mechanic and his secretary, but of course Hammer also has to contend with the FBI. Why are they involved? Oh, you'll find out.The quality of the writing, however much it eschews Spillane's text or not, helps Aldrich to get to what he needs with this story. But it's such a rich film visually, too. He chooses his shots carefully, he doesn't cut to quickly when a key piece of info comes up (i.e. the first time any nuclear talk comes up between Hammer and an FBI guy), and how he follows people and then proceeds to beat them up. Or just talks to the woman by his side in the story (the one who... well, don't want to spoil it just yet).It's the kind of no-nonsense noir I wish I had seen on a big screen first. It's made for that, and I imagine if a film society or retro-house put it on a double bill with something like The Big Heat, also featuring Meeker in a much different role, it'd grow some hair on a man's chest! Seriously, this is strong stuff of the period, which also somehow manages to push the envelope of what you could show at the time by what it doesn't show (how is Christina tortured for example - we don't know, and that makes it worse). It's a director taking B-movie pulp and elevating it with art and craft and a vision. And grit. And blood.

Morgan Freeman is a cop who suspects Gene Hackman of the murders of two pre-teen girls. Hackman agrees to a 10-minute conversation to clear up some points in his statement, as he was the one who discovered the body of the second victim. But Freeman, assisted by accusatory cop Thomas Jane turns it into a marathon grilling in which Hackman's private life is laid bare, including the absence of relations he has with his wife, Monica Belluci, and her jealousy. Hackman finds himself accused of raping and strangling the two girls.The plot details and motivations have been covered in other reviews in great detail. Joe Barrus, in particular, provides an excellent explanation of the psychology of Hackman's character.This is a rather stage-bound movie that tries to avoid too much staginess or confinement to one set by opening out to show the places where Hackman was during the murders and his home, as well as the streets where a carnival is going on. The focus is on the two men, much as in a trial movie. Hackman has the more interesting part and makes the most of it, adding another triumph to his acting vita. His breakthrough movie was in 1967 (Bonnie and Clyde), and he has gone from success to success. While I have not seen all of his movies, the ones I have seen benefited enormously from his presence (such movies as Heist, Enemy of the State, Extreme Measures, The Firm, The Package, Superman, French Connection, The Gypsy Moths, Cisco Pike and Prime Cut). Morgan Freeman, at least on first viewing, doesn't do as much with his part as one may have hoped for. However, that's partly due to the nature of the policeman he plays. In the French version made in 1981 (Garde a vue), Lino Ventura was also relatively restrained.The story is heavily psychological. Despite trying to avoid coming across like a filmed play, the movie still depends quite a lot on dialog to explain events rather than advancing the story cinematically. This is the reason I do not rate it more highly. But it's certainly worth seeing for its story and for Hackman's performance especially.

Everything about this movie rides on the twist at the end. Any lesser film and the twist would have been contrived\/forced, and basically phony. But the subtle way the twist unfolds with the great writing and the top level of acting William's gives in the moment, the twist unfolds very naturally.

Within minutes everyone in the town knows who he is, including Will Danahar (Victor McLaglen), the boorish brother of a woman named Mary Kate, who he quickly takes a fancy to after seeing her run through a field. But Will doesn't like him and soon all sorts of hijinks ensue as he at first refuses his request to marry her, then keeps her fortune. I'm not where to start with this one. Very average, not very good at all, but with enough entertainment to stop me from calling it bad. As usual John Ford is a good storyteller, and the film is very picturesque. I wouldn't call the photography beautiful, more quaint and pretty. Seeing as the film is filled with the very hit-and-miss comic relief characteristic of John Ford films I'm just going to consider it a straight comedy. The comedy is old fashioned, and sometimes it's quite funny, and sometimes not, as in a scene in which a matchmaker repeatedly mispronounces the name Sean Thornton as Thon Shornton. Get it. Because he's drunk. My real problem with the film comes from the unconvincing romance between Sean and Mary Kate. Maureen O'Hara is very good in places, as is Wayne, but Sean's behaviour seems to imply that he wants to get her in bed more than anything. He also seems to enjoy shoving her around as he pleases, and in one scene pushes her to the ground multiple times and kicks her in the butt. The film has a large cast of characters, most of whom appear in a scene for some comic relief, then disappear, then appear later, like in a cartoon. And that's another problem with the film for me; overkill, especially near the end. There are too many cartoonish Irish drunkards and the like, showing up for a scene to say a funny line then disappearing, and the main characters aren't well developed enough for me to really care about them. There's a promising and well done scene of Sean having a flashback to a boxing match that showed promise of making me care about the character, but that's quickly brushed aside for more hijinks.So I didn't dislike the film, but it didn't do anything for me either, and there's only so much I can take of crowds of loud, drunk Irishmen cheering and having antics, to a repetitive and annoying jig.

I've just read another review that commends Adrian Brody for portraying the uprising of British punk rock - was that sarcasm so subtle that most people have passed it by as a genuine comment? What's this film all about? Who knows - other than a hugely dysfunctional few blocks of degenerate's somewhere in the Bronx. What should the film be about? Son of Sam - or at least one would imagine it would be from the title... Adrian Brody is a joke. I couldn't quite tell, but I'm guessing that he's supposed to be a local American Italian character that becomes interested in the punk movement and begins trying to put on a god- awful British cockney\/chav type accent and copying some of the punk fashion styles - pretending to be some sort of quasi punk-rocker. At least I hope so - if he's supposed to be a British punk character living in America, it was embarrassing beyond words. It was pretty bad - no matter which way you look at it. That's when he's not being super-camp in little denim shorts on a stage appearing to be some sort of stripper... how very punk rock. What's the majority of the film about? Well, as far as I can recall, too much of the film is actually a soft-porn effort for John Leguizamo's character - whether he's having his end away with his wife, a hairdressing customer or someone else from a club. What's the relevance of this sex? Who knows - it has nothing to with Son of Sam, the murders, the hunt for him or his arrest and conviction.The film really drags on. Really drags on. Wait until the black dog. That's a laff. Was I on drugs when I saw that? Phew - it's over. I started this as I was watching it... It's just finished in a totally underwhelming, but entirely predictable conclusion. Idiots - is all I can say about the characters. Idiots. I'd avoid it if I were you - watch Zodiac instead (Gyllenhall version) - it's a far better film about a serial killer and the hunt for him.

I couldn't quite tell, but I'm guessing that he's supposed to be a local American Italian character that becomes interested in the punk movement and begins trying to put on a god- awful British cockney\/chav type accent and copying some of the punk fashion styles - pretending to be some sort of quasi punk-rocker. At least I hope so - if he's supposed to be a British punk character living in America, it was embarrassing beyond words. It was pretty bad - no matter which way you look at it. That's when he's not being super-camp in little denim shorts on a stage appearing to be some sort of stripper... how very punk rock. What's the majority of the film about? Well, as far as I can recall, too much of the film is actually a soft-porn effort for John Leguizamo's character - whether he's having his end away with his wife, a hairdressing customer or someone else from a club. What's the relevance of this sex? Who knows - it has nothing to with Son of Sam, the murders, the hunt for him or his arrest and conviction.The film really drags on. Really drags on. Wait until the black dog. That's a laff. Was I on drugs when I saw that? Phew - it's over. I started this as I was watching it... It's just finished in a totally underwhelming, but entirely predictable conclusion. Idiots - is all I can say about the characters. Idiots. I'd avoid it if I were you - watch Zodiac instead (Gyllenhall version) - it's a far better film about a serial killer and the hunt for him.

I've just read another review that commends Adrian Brody for portraying the uprising of British punk rock - was that sarcasm so subtle that most people have passed it by as a genuine comment?
