Yes, it's all a bit drawn out at times, making this movie feel overlong and overall pointless but it's all actually being very consistent with the style of film-making and the approach they were going for with this movie.Basically this movie is being like an old fashioned epic, with grand looking landscapes and a bigger than life story, or in this case love story, in which everything moves slowly but steadily. As often is the case with this type of movies, it's hard to get into at first, since it doesn't really become apparent, right from the start on already, which direction the story will be heading at. But once things are starting to take form and it becomes more clear what the story is going for, it becomes an engaging movie, as also truly was the case with this movie.I really loved it how things slowly started to take shape within this movie. It also made it more apparent what an actual good and original story this movie has in it. It's not being too complicated either, which makes this movie all the more engaging to watch. No, this really is far from being pretentious genre movie, though it still has some pretentious tendencies in it, especially when it comes down to its acting and characters.Let me just say I wasn't too fond of all the performances in this movie and that goes for Ralph Fiennes' as well. He actually somewhat annoyed me, which is something that Fiennes had never achieved before, at least not with me. I truly think he is one of the best living and still working actors around but in this movie he went for an approach I just didn't liked very well. But really, it might also be very well due to his character and the writing of the movie that I couldn't really appreciate his performance. His character, in my opinion, isn't being likable enough and the love story he gets himself involved in also isn't exactly my idea of a romantic one. Nothing cute about a love story that involves infidelity and it prevented me from rooting for its main characters and for them to end up being together.But OK, I get it. Love just happens sometime, no matter what the place or the circumstances are. And then again, the love story in this movie was never meant to be a happy or careless one, in which everything works out peachy perfect. And that's actually what saved it and made this movie work for me, once I started to realize all of that. It also definitely makes this an original romantic movie, also since the romance itself is often hard to find in the movie. Please don't mistake this movie for a chick-flick, or something like that, since the movie and its story have far more to offer and often goes for a far from typical romantic approach with things.There are also plenty of other things happening in this movie. It doesn't just follow 2 main characters but it has a wide variety of characters in it, each with their own thing going on. It gives the movie plenty of welcome distractions and often helps to give the movie and some of its themes more depth as well. It's also a nice touch that the movie is basically following 2 plot lines, one set in the 'present' and one in the past, all linked together by its main character, played by Ralph Fiennes. This also helps to give the movie some variety and helps to keep the story moving and it's being a good way for the movie to have some mystery and surprises in it as well.Just as good as any other genre movie from the earlier days of the genre, in my opinion!8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"2 September 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It's perhaps easier to simply make fun of this movie but it's in my opinion ridicules to call this a bad movie as well.

She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film.Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs.There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film.

To reveal the new twists would be murder.The casting is very interesting, with Michael Douglas leading the cast as the not-so-loving husband, someone who might have definite plans on how to improve his current situation. He is suave, sophisticated, and plays the charming businessman very well; yet there is something about him that sets off alarms when you look closely. He's married to a wealthy socialite, a woman who is worth more than we'll ever see in our lifetime. She's cultured, kind, beautiful, but no quite a perfect human being. As we soon discover, she is involved in a relationship that might be too dangerous for her.Things become complicated as the parties start interacting with each other, and new motives and machinations arise. It's like a chess game, and it's at this point that we go back to the original source and have to admire what Davis attempts to do. He has updated the original premise, giving more depth to the husband and wife's roles. It's hard not see the differences between both movies' leading ladies, but Paltrow does a fine job portraying the damsel in distress. The film gives this character to show a side we never saw in Grace Kelly's portrayal. It is more than a representation of the social particulars of an era.

THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL is one of the greatest films ever made about Hollywood because it's not afraid to show things as how they really are. Some people have called this film a soap opera, which would be fair but it takes the drama and the soap of Hollywood and really turns it on its head and delivers a very memorable film with three terrific stories. Basically all three short stories add up to show why this producer was not only a genius but also someone no one could really respect as a person. What makes the film work so well is the fact that all three stories are strong enough to where an entire film could have been done on them. The story dealing with Turner feels like someone that could have been about the real actress and it provides her with one of her greatest characters and performances. The way she plays the tortured soul was highly memorable and something that not too many others could have pulled off. Both Sullivan and Powell are extremely good in their parts and once again you could argue that they deliver the best work of their careers. Oscar-winner Gloria Grahame is also very memorable in her few scenes. Then, there's the always wonderful Douglas who turns in another winner here. This is really a complete character and Douglas nails every aspect of it. Whether it's the fast-talking, charming side or the ruthless, succeed at all costs jerk. Director Vincente Minnelli does a wonderful job at keeping all three stories moving and we also get some fantastic cinematography, which almost makes this look like a film noir.

Yes, there are moments of inspiration, including some double-exposed stock where a scene takes play in the sky over another scene on the ground.

The naturalism of the three leads helps you get emotionally involved. The most famous by far is the woman, Paramount's biggest star, Clara Bow. She doesn't get a huge role (the men do the fighting and flying) but at least when she's there she's a treat. The flying is actually done by the actors, and many of the people involved were veterans (including Wellman, who was a WWI pilot himself).It's pretty exciting to find this so exciting all these years later.

It doesn't help that it's too obvious that Craven was trying to create another Freddy Krueger in the form of raving maniac Horace Pinker, a savage psychopath played to foaming- at-the-mouth perfection by Mitch Pileggi, eventually to become better known for playing Skinner on 'The X-Files'. Pinker's on the loose, slaughtering whole families, but opposing him is college football star Jonathan Parker (a remarkably sincere Peter Berg), a nice guy who was raised by a police lieutenant (Michael Murphy). Jonathan and Horace, who are connected in a way that the younger man doesn't anticipate, are also psychically linked, and Jonathan is able to give the cops his name and place of business and before too long the killer is caught and executed. But the story doesn't end there, as Pinker, in league with Satan, survives the electric chair and lives on to overtake various unlucky people and control their bodies, including, in the movie's most memorable sequence, a little girl. How can one not hold in their laughter watching this blonde haired moppet curse like a sailor, and try to operate a bulldozer? Ultimately, the movie is a little too absurd for its own good, but damn if it doesn't have some good atmosphere, show off some amusing ideas, and go overboard on the bloodshed. One particular murder scene is just drenched in the red stuff. One of the methods used to combat Horace is pure corn, involving Jonathan's love for girlfriend Alison (Camille Cooper) and an all-important locket. The best stuff is the wonderfully ridiculous climax in which a rampaging Horace and Jonathan run amok through TV programming (they end up in an episode of 'Leave it to Beaver' where Jonathan pleads for the Beaver's help).

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, released in 2001, is so full of little cinematic delights that it doesn't really matter if the film isn't regarded as the highlight of Woody Allen's career. After more than 30 films, Allen is more than allowed to give himself a break, and although I read he considered the film one of his worst, I wouldn't be surprised if in the years to come, The Curse gains more popularity, as I see it, it's got all the ingredients to become a cult-classic.The 2000's were a mixed year for Woody Allen, but the recent successes of Vicky Cristina Barcelona and especially Midnight for Paris spoke very eloquently for a revival of Woody Allen's international prestige, for the fan's great satisfaction, the little neurotic guy with glasses still got it. But for myself, there's something that attracts me more to a 'little' film like The Curse of Jade Scorpion than these last Oscar-material successes, tailor-made to please European film-critics and God knows how they can get pompous or overly enthusiastic when it comes to Woody Allen, and take it from a fan. Of course, we all love to be taken off- guard by an established film-maker but when you get tired of the whole love letters to Barcelona, to Paris and this year to Rome, you start looking at the less ambitious comedies as very endearing little gems. After Small Time Crooks, The Curse of Jade Scorpion provides another example of Woody's talent to make great little films, even greater because they remind of his earlier slapstick films before the more artistically oriented 80's.But let's get back to 2001, to The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. The film's premise is one of these simple yet very creative ideas, like imagining a fictional character getting off-screen and discovering the real life or a man meeting at midnight the writers and artists that made Paris' history. Woody Allen wondered what if someone could get hypnotized in order to commit a crime and not remembering it, what if this guy gets involved in the investigation. From a simple comedic premise based on the idea of a perfect crime, the other elements of the story come up very naturally, what if the hero is an insurance investigator? How to make the curse start? How about a stage hypnotist show? Then what best way to prove that it works by taking two persons strongly hating each other, and then through the magical power of hypnosis, they suddenly falls in love. Bingo, you have your romantic subplot, the perfect crime, and the design to remind of the Golden Age of film-noir.Woody Allen is C.W. Briggs, a talented insurance investigator and Helen Hunt is Betty Ann Fitzgerald, the new efficient expert, she's sometimes too sophisticated or too modern to be believable as a woman of the 40's, even if her performance is meant to remind of Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn, but anyways. Fitz and Briggs hate each other so much that we know that they would end up together, although she's closer to Barbara Stanwyck than he is to Fred MacMurray. The reference to Double Indemnity is more than intentional, but would you imagine Edward G. Robinson involved in a romance? Well, I can buy anything a movie would if as a screwball comedy, it provides the right laughs. Although the scenes are unequally funny, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion benefits from great casting, Dan Aykroyd and Wallace Shawn play their part with nuance and a little comedic something I couldn't put my finger in, even Elizabeth Berkeley was believable as the sexy secretary. But it's Charlize Theron that provides the best bits of dialog with Allen, as the obligatory femme-fatale.And then there's the plot, both Briggs and Fitz can be 'programmed' when they hear two magical words, respectively 'Constantinople' and 'Madagascar'. When Briggs hears 'Constantinople', he instantly gets under the hypnotist's control and executes any of his orders, which all of them include stealing and hiding jewels. It works as a great running gag, carried by a catchy guitar music, the little tone that sticks in your mind after the film ends, you may think it's a detail but the enjoyment of a film is made of little details you wouldn't suspect. And that's probably why some reviewers were more severe about the film, while it was good in our book, by Allen's standards, it could have been better. I also think the film would have fit a shorter length or that some parts were redundant while the resolution was a bit too abrupt, well, I can't disagree with these reactions. I also think there was much more to do with the magical words, but again saying a film could have been better doesn't make it bad. Indeed, even a filmmaker like Woody Allen is not committed to perfection, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion remains enjoyable from beginning to start. Perhaps, my only regret is that Woody Allen didn't make the film earlier when he was at the top of his game in terms of writing and acting. He had a fabulous chemistry with Helen Hunt, but even for Woody Allen, it's difficult not be distracted by their age difference. Briggs was a bit too old, and I'm sure the film, had it been written in the 70's would have featured smarter jokes, hell, I can even imagine Diane Keaton playing in Helen Hunt's part. Still a good film, with a great casting, great design and great use of music.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"2 September 2012","score":"","review":" The sepia tone impeccably restores the feeling of the 1940's and the wisecracking exchanges between Woody Allen and Helen Hunt, although a bit overused, don't lack the savor of It Happened One Night dialogs, and like some of the best screwball comedies, the romantic undertones never distract from the gags, or make us lose their tracking. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, released in 2001, is so full of little cinematic delights that it doesn't really matter if the film isn't regarded as the highlight of Woody Allen's career. After more than 30 films, Allen is more than allowed to give himself a break, and although I read he considered the film one of his worst, I wouldn't be surprised if in the years to come, The Curse gains more popularity, as I see it, it's got all the ingredients to become a cult-classic.The 2000's were a mixed year for Woody Allen, but the recent successes of Vicky Cristina Barcelona and especially Midnight for Paris spoke very eloquently for a revival of Woody Allen's international prestige, for the fan's great satisfaction, the little neurotic guy with glasses still got it. But for myself, there's something that attracts me more to a 'little' film like The Curse of Jade Scorpion than these last Oscar-material successes, tailor-made to please European film-critics and God knows how they can get pompous or overly enthusiastic when it comes to Woody Allen, and take it from a fan. Of course, we all love to be taken off- guard by an established film-maker but when you get tired of the whole love letters to Barcelona, to Paris and this year to Rome, you start looking at the less ambitious comedies as very endearing little gems. After Small Time Crooks, The Curse of Jade Scorpion provides another example of Woody's talent to make great little films, even greater because they remind of his earlier slapstick films before the more artistically oriented 80's.But let's get back to 2001, to The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. The film's premise is one of these simple yet very creative ideas, like imagining a fictional character getting off-screen and discovering the real life or a man meeting at midnight the writers and artists that made Paris' history. Woody Allen wondered what if someone could get hypnotized in order to commit a crime and not remembering it, what if this guy gets involved in the investigation. From a simple comedic premise based on the idea of a perfect crime, the other elements of the story come up very naturally, what if the hero is an insurance investigator? How to make the curse start? How about a stage hypnotist show? Then what best way to prove that it works by taking two persons strongly hating each other, and then through the magical power of hypnosis, they suddenly falls in love. Bingo, you have your romantic subplot, the perfect crime, and the design to remind of the Golden Age of film-noir.Woody Allen is C.W. Briggs, a talented insurance investigator and Helen Hunt is Betty Ann Fitzgerald, the new efficient expert, she's sometimes too sophisticated or too modern to be believable as a woman of the 40's, even if her performance is meant to remind of Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn, but anyways. Fitz and Briggs hate each other so much that we know that they would end up together, although she's closer to Barbara Stanwyck than he is to Fred MacMurray. The reference to Double Indemnity is more than intentional, but would you imagine Edward G. Robinson involved in a romance? Well, I can buy anything a movie would if as a screwball comedy, it provides the right laughs. Although the scenes are unequally funny, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion benefits from great casting, Dan Aykroyd and Wallace Shawn play their part with nuance and a little comedic something I couldn't put my finger in, even Elizabeth Berkeley was believable as the sexy secretary. But it's Charlize Theron that provides the best bits of dialog with Allen, as the obligatory femme-fatale.And then there's the plot, both Briggs and Fitz can be 'programmed' when they hear two magical words, respectively 'Constantinople' and 'Madagascar'. When Briggs hears 'Constantinople', he instantly gets under the hypnotist's control and executes any of his orders, which all of them include stealing and hiding jewels. It works as a great running gag, carried by a catchy guitar music, the little tone that sticks in your mind after the film ends, you may think it's a detail but the enjoyment of a film is made of little details you wouldn't suspect. And that's probably why some reviewers were more severe about the film, while it was good in our book, by Allen's standards, it could have been better. I also think the film would have fit a shorter length or that some parts were redundant while the resolution was a bit too abrupt, well, I can't disagree with these reactions. I also think there was much more to do with the magical words, but again saying a film could have been better doesn't make it bad. Indeed, even a filmmaker like Woody Allen is not committed to perfection, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion remains enjoyable from beginning to start. Perhaps, my only regret is that Woody Allen didn't make the film earlier when he was at the top of his game in terms of writing and acting. He had a fabulous chemistry with Helen Hunt, but even for Woody Allen, it's difficult not be distracted by their age difference. Briggs was a bit too old, and I'm sure the film, had it been written in the 70's would have featured smarter jokes, hell, I can even imagine Diane Keaton playing in Helen Hunt's part. Still a good film, with a great casting, great design and great use of music.

After murdering his father in some rural town, Eli and his brother Joshuah are put in to foster care to live with Mr and Mrs. Potter in Chicago. It isn't long before Eli starts praying to he who walks behind the rows and planting corn seeds in an empty factory next to the Potter's house. We quickly find out that Eli and Joshuah aren't actually related. Eli was adopted by Joshuah's parents and was one of the original children from Gatlin (therefore he hasn't aged since 1964). Anyone that gets in Eli's way or finds out his secret gets knocked off in grotesque ways, leading to a fiery ending in which Joshuah realizes that his brother must be stopped.I like seeing the two Amish-like brothers interact with the city kids, it was interesting dynamic. This sequel in the franchise definitely gets points for trying something new and taking the story outside of the cornfields in either Gatlin or Hemingford. The problem with it taking place in Chicago is that it doesn't have that same feel as the previous installments did. The special effects are also pretty good once again. Instead of so much blood like in Children of the Corn II, it is more and creative and disgusting in this one. The acting from everyone involved was really good, especially from Daniel Cerny who played evil Eli. This film does have it's flaws. It is VERY slow moving at times and becomes tedious during the middle frame. I also hate that they didn't continue with the story from the previous films. Yes, Eli was from Gatlin years ago but that's it. At least Part II continued off from where the first one finished. Overall a decent film which fans of the franchise should enjoy.

Rather, he plans a heist to rob three of Vegas' biggest casinos and loot over 150 million dollars. Of course, this job is too big to do alone. Ocean get's 10 other recruits, for a total of eleven people, making this genius heist.Ocean's Eleven would like to convince you that there's an emotional core to the film. In fact, there is, in the form of Ocean's ex-wife Tess, whom he is trying to win back. Alas, this romance is written with a minimal of elegance, and creates problems for the film's pacing. Ocean's Eleven is at it's best when ignoring the romantic aspect of the film, and focuses on entertaining.Despite the fact that Ocean's Eleven is, in fact, a heist movie, the action is not what makes Ocean's Eleven such an entertaining film. It's the characters, whom are funny, developed, and best of all; memorable. Ocean's Eleven has a huge assembly of wonderfully entertaining characters who really make the movie.George Clooney plays Danny Ocean who we sympathize with, and he gets much of the one-liners. Brad Pitt portrays Rusty Ryan, who may strike one as less humorous than the rest of the cast. Matt Damon plays a nervous wannabe named Linus Caldwell, and Julia Roberts acts as Tess- Ocean's ex. The more humorous characters, Saul, Basher and Reuben (the arguable standout that should've been in more scenes) are played by Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle and Elliott Gould respectively.Constant attempts at quotable lines are made, and while most of them work, a decent amount fall flat.

It works well for the movie overall, but it's extremely forgettable. Also, the music played at the end is truly atrocious, mostly because it doesn't match the film at all. A clunky piano piece and a sudden change to orchestra made the ending feel incredibly dramatic, like the conclusion to a masterpiece. Ocean's Eleven is not a masterpiece, and the music is almost laughably out of place at the end.Flaws aside, Ocean's Eleven is marvelously entertaining and incredibly fun.

If so, Tim Burton answered it in 1993 with his release of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film opens in Halloweentown with shots of ghosts, skeletons, vampires, and witches. Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king and a highly respected citizen. He is lonely and sad, though, because he wants something more than scares and frights. When walking through a forest, he comes across a door that takes him to Christmasland and he instantly knows; this is what he has been looking for.

This movie, inspired by Tim Burton's poem, is enchanting to look at and the animation is unbelievable. However, don't be expecting a lot of Christmas cheer in this holiday story because it is lacking in that aspect. Also, being a Christian, I found the lack of any mention of the birth of Christ disappointing. However, Christmas is portrayed as something special, so much so that Jack can't even explain it to his friends. And that in itself shows that Christmas is not a regular holiday like any other. Jack's intentions also are good, for he wants to give and make people joyful. Though it is not perfect, I still think it is quite a good movie, primarily because of its creativeness and originally, both of which are qualities that always appeal to me. I also highly recommend reading the original poem or even better, listening to Christopher Lee read it with the animation and art from the movie.

Would've been fairly easy to make an entire movie of the first half--a baseball coach who inspires his under- achieving team to rally and win district, then an entirely different movie of the second half--a 30-something science teacher giving himself one last chance to make the big leagues.For me, this movie is right up there with other great sports movies, such as Hoosiers, Miracle, and Chariots of Fire. Perhaps not quite at that level, but the story is great and definitely inspiring. Even if you're not a baseball fan, you can appreciate the emphasis this movie puts on the realities and pressures that families face every day in balancing work and taking care of the kids. And I love that they bring out the challenges of minor league baseball--long bus rides, very little income, and away from family for months at a time.My favorite scene is after Jim finishes his tryout and is walking back to his truck, the scout comes up to tell him that he, although almost twice the other kids' age, actually threw 98 mph. The scout tells Jim that if he doesn't call it in he's gonna get fired and that Jim can expect to get a phone call. Just wish he'd throw away the dirty diaper!

That's exactly my point of view here and so read on accordingly.I've seen a dozen 007 films, and tend to like some aspects of them and hate others. This is a purely middle of the road, halfhearted movie in nearly every way. And if there's something a Bond film should be, it's not middling. Start with the man himself, played by Roger Moore, who lacks the charm, the physical power and elegance, and the smarts, frankly, required of the character. (I think he does better in his later films.) In the very first scenes, this top notch agent is led along, duped, and outsmarted in every step of his return to New York. He gets away only when the bad guys let him.The other great things about Bond films are restrained here, as well. There aren't gadgets (except the silly magnetic watch) and he doesn't have his car. His sometimes hilarious deadpan interactions with his superiors (M and Moneypenny) are drab and cut short. His affairs with women are numerous of course, but pretty routine stuff.And I don't mean the women are routine. This is actually a benefit of being halfhearted--the movie isn't as demeaning to women as most of the others, score one for mediocrity.Finally, the plot, the plot! That is to say, what plot? So he's somehow interested in this gang of crook on a Caribbean island, but why? They followed him from the airport and killed his chauffeur, sure, but there is no really compelling reason for this long chase after the obviously evil mean. And it surely doesn't seem like secret agent stuff, more like the usual drug running gang. With the twist that they are going to flood the U.S. market with free heroin. Yes, free.Okay, so there is a long, long, did I say long boat chase near the end, including some ridiculous flying over bits of land that get in the way at various times. The Mississippi sheriff stereotypes are fun for those who don't hale from there, I'm guessing. But it all goes on forever. And there is the shark cage and the threat of being eaten alive. Wow is that a lame game and played out with no sense of flair or suspense. You'll see.So, now that I think of it, what the heck is there to enjoy here? Well, it's a high budget Hollywood movie with a cute leading man set in an attractive exotic local. The secondary actors, all of them, are peculiar and interesting and not always the best actors but they keep their heads above water. The cast and some of the sub-themes are distinctly blaxploitation stuff, which I liked a lot, and I only wish it had been pushed harder. The pivotal movie Shaft had been out and successful before filming began on this one, but it seems only the superficial aspects were picked out of the genre. (It might matter that Shaft was directed by a black American, the great Gordon Parks, and this was directed by a white British bloke, the redoubtable Guy Hamilton, who did direct Goldfinger and other Bond staples.)There is Solitaire, the reason I actually picked this Bond film instead of something else--not for her (she's a generic pretty object who really barely acts at all) but for her cards, the specially made James Bond Tarot deck. This deck is now kind of famous in the Tarot world because it's been released (and re-released) as a working, fully illustrated, and rather good 78 card deck. There's the famous moment, as well, where Bond reveals he has a special deck made of 78 cards all the same--the Lovers. Clever fellow. And pretty quick printing job, I say.Roger Moore fans, I apologize. He didn't have the aura of Connery or the physical energy of later Bonds like Bronson or Craig. In this first of his several attempts, he did however make Bond dignified. I'm not sure that's a good thing. Oh, and this is the Bond film with the McCartney theme songs (which you can hear morphed in little ways throughout the movie, under George Martin's hand). The music is certainly good stuff, and some of the sets underground make for exciting chases.
