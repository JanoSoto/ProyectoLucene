COURTENEY COX is again on hand as an intrepid reporter and David ARQUETTE is back as Campbell's protector, who needs protection himself from the caped killer trying to murder most of the cast.It's strictly Halloween stuff for slasher fans, this time a little more suspenseful than SCREAM 2, with a tighter script and better direction.CARRIE FISHER has a fun two minute segment looking up someone's name under Reynolds. But along with some sly humor, it's the scary stuff that still works pretty well despite the sameness of the theme.PATRICK DEMPSEY makes a good impression as a police lieutenant who actually becomes one of the suspects. The revelation of the killer's motive doesn't quite ring true, but there are hints along the way that make it seem somewhat probable.Summing up The Wes Craven touch is evident.
