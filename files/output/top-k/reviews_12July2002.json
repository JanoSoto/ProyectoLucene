I must say i am very very unhappy and very dissapointed at dimension films and at the writers and director for doing something sooo dissapointing and killing off The Original horror movie Herione. shes survived this long,why kill her now?? it makes no sense. and For Jamie Lee Curtis her self to have had let this happen after she has said in many interviews that Laurie Strode Was her Favorite character until she did True Lies, is just unbeleivible. i my self have met Jamie and she was the best but now ive lost some respect for her because of this.

Set in London and the English countryside at the tail end of the 60's, the state of mind of the two main characters reflects the mood of the times. Impoverished actors, Withnail (played superbly by Richard E.

Their dealer, Danny\/Headhunter, ensures that they shall never be set free.When the claustrophobia of the city becomes too much, they embark on an ill-advised and poorly planned (to say the least) holiday in the countryside, staying at the cottage of Withnails' rich uncle Monty. Here they endeavour to adapt to life away from the convenience of London. Matters become complicated by unhelpful farmers, the local poacher, and the unannounced arrival of Monty.We cannot help but to like Withnail, despite the fact that he is almost entirely self-centered and a slave to alcohol. His hedonisitic, live for the moment attitude makes him something of an anti-hero. Many people will identify with the main characters in the film; it is regarded as a cult classic on this side of the Atlantic, beloved especially by students perhaps because they can identify with the lifestyle of these disenfranchised but clearly talented people.Overall, this has to be one of my favourite films.

I'm a huge Halloween fan, and I don't remember ever expecting so much from a movie and getting so little.  I liked H20 a lot, and I thought it provided a very satisfying and logical conclusion to the series.  So when we're told right away that it wasn't really Michael who was beheaded at the end of H20 (it was, uh, a paramedic with the exact same size and build as Michael who swapped clothes with him, and apparently couldn't tell anyone because his voice box was crushed), I was left hoping against hope that the movie itself wasn't going to be as convoluted and stupid as its setup.Of course, it was.  The characters are all strictly cookie-cutter, with the majority of lines being completely gratuitous sound bytes (more on this later).  There are several stupid and obvious references to the first movie (e.g. bedroom closet door being smashed from the outside as girl cowers inside, MM pinning guy to kitchen wall with knives, MM sitting up creepily in the background as the camera focuses on the foreground), which only shows a lack of creativeness on the part of the filmmakers.  Perhaps worst of all, virtually all of the killings are unimaginative, garden-variety stabbings\/impalings that we've seen hundreds of times in hundreds of better movies.  The other weak Halloween sequels could at least innovatively satisfy a general desire for gore.  Next, although I don't know a great deal about filmmaking, I could see some poor editing going on here.  At one point we're shown Michael lurking in the shadows, and the tip of his knife is stained with blood.  This is before Michael has used the knife on anybody (the knife he uses in the beginning of the movie is clearly disposed of). Really not good.  Finally, I don't know what other people thought of this, but I thought the concept of the movie was pretty condescending.  I can completely imagine someone saying Hey, since everyone's using the internet now, we'll tack this 'webcam' twist onto this classic horror series, and everyone will think it's really modern and edgy and want to see it!  This is augmented by a lot of really stupid and unnecessary technological references and gimmicks (communicating on the palmpilot, etc.).  I could be overreacting here, but the whole attempt to adapt the Halloween series to fit the 21st century strikes me as really ill-conceived.Last thing I don't understand the impetus to keep casting rappers in action\/horror movies.  Save one funny scene where he dresses up as MM and rants, watching Busta Rhymes was painful.  The talent he showed in Finding Forrester was drowned completely in an atrocious script.  Choice lines of his include As Michael apparently gets his in the end, Busta shouts Happy Halloween, Mikey! (or maybe it was Happy Halloween, MOTHA****A!...

That looks like some fried chicken-ass shit! or something like that upon seeing MM's body.  I'm reminded of LL Cool J in Deep Blue Sea or to a lesser extent Dr. Dre in Training Day.  These guys aren't bad actors, they're just getting stuck with terrible lines that the writers think are cool.Anyway, please skip this movie whether you're a series fan or not, as it degrades all of the good Halloween movies that have been made.  It's very disheartening that instead of ending the series on a high note and preserving its reputation among horror movies, it was decided to milk the formula for more money.  We can only hope there's no Halloween 9, although this movie appropriately ends on the biggest unkillable-monster horror movie cliche of all time, leaving us dreading what they're going to come up with next to mangle this once-great idea.P.S.
