Notice how it fails to crack the top 250 on this site, while at the same time poor films like There Will Be Blood, V for Vendetta, and others dot the list. Steve McQueen gives one of his finest performances as Jake Holman, a sailor at odds with the rest of the crew on a tiny gunboat stationed off the China coast in the 1920s. The cast is well-rounded, the locations very authentic, the acting superb, and the story engrossing. This is just what an epic should be...Our story takes place during the tumultuous period between world wars and in a rapidly changing China. Nationalists, Communists, and war lords battle for control while foreign dignitaries are put at grave risk. This was a time of what was known as gunboat diplomacy for the United States. These tiny craft resembling riverboat casinos of today are put in harms way as their crew begin to feel the wrath of the Chinese who are tired of foreign interests dominating their country. Jake Holman arrives to the San Pablo hoping to just man the engine below decks and keep out of people's way. He is kind of an anti-social anti-hero that McQueen could play so well. To Holman's dismay, he finds that Chinese coolies are expected to do all the manual labor on the ship, and they want no part of him working on the ship's engine. No sooner does Holman arrive when the engine has trouble and a boss coolie is killed trying to fix it. Holman is then forced to train another man how the engine works, and the two become friends, further alienating Holman from the white sailors on board. All the while tensions are brewing on land, and the crew soon finds themselves help in a state of siege for an entire winter.

Holman falls for Candice Bergen who plays a teacher. She and the missionary she works for are in grave danger, but seem to think they can just denounce their American citizenship and not be harmed. Ha! Holman's best friend on the San Pablo, played by Richard Attenborough, falls for and impregnates a local hostess of a bar. This increases the tension as it looks like the Chinese will over-run the ship at any moment. The ship's captain is played by Richard Crenna. He tries to come off as a disciplinarian, but once he's in his quarters we learn that he lets a lot of things go. The lack of discipline on the San Pablo is largely his fault.

I don't think I ever watched any of The Little Mermaid after the early 90's, until this month, when I finally decided to rent it. (Before that, I didn't even know how the film ended, and the last bit of it didn't ring any bells.) Although I hadn't seen any of it since I was a little kid, and there are obviously many things which entertained me then but wouldn't now, I knew it was a popular Disney effort, so I had relatively high expectations. These expectations weren't quite met, but it has enough for me to give it a good review.Ariel is a sixteen-year-old mermaid and one of the daughters of King Triton, the Sea King. Her best friend is a yellow and blue fish named Flounder. The teenage mermaid is not happy with life underwater, and wishes to be a human, living up on the land. However, her father believes that all humans are barbarians, and forbids Ariel to ever go up to the surface, though she sometimes does. He assigns his assistant, a crab named Sebastian, to keep an eye on her, but this doesn't turn out to be easy. When Ariel sees a ship at the surface, she goes up to observe the human activity. She sees Prince Eric, and immediately falls in love. When a storm comes and destroys the ship, the young prince nearly drowns, but Ariel rescues him and takes him back to shore. After more conflict with her father, Ariel goes to see Ursula, the Sea Witch, and makes a deal with her, but doesn't realize that the evil Sea Witch intends to use her to try and take King Triton's place as the ruler of the sea! There are reasons why this particular Disney effort failed to absolutely blow me away, and one of them is the main character. Sometimes, Ariel's naivety can be excessive, and sometimes, thanks to her, the story doesn't seem quite right. It's certainly not the greatest love story ever told. The Little Mermaid doesn't have the greatest bunch of characters ever featured in a Disney film, and the script might sometimes be a problem as well. Fortunately, despite these flaws, there are quite a few things to like in this film. As usual with animated Disney films, there's humour here, provided by the likes of Scuttle, Ariel's seagull friend who tells her things about the human world (even though they are incorrect), as well as Sebastian, and sometimes other characters. There are also several memorable songs in this film (I can remember them from my childhood), which aren't bad, plus there's some excitement and nicely colourful animation, as usual for Disney.It seems many people absolutely adore this 1989 Disney flick, and apparently, it turned out to be the most successful film Disney had made in quite a while. I think I've made it clear that I'm not one of the film's strongest admirers. In fact, around the beginning, I might have even been a tad puzzled about all the hype. Nonetheless, it is pretty good family entertainment. I'm unfamiliar with the original fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, which this movie is based on, so I don't know how good this Disney effort is in comparison. As an animated feature from the Walt Disney Company, it's weaker than quite a few others in this category, but if you're a Disney fan, it can be very entertaining. It's definitely a lot better than High School Musical, and probably certain other recent trash from the Disney Channel, which I haven't seen, and probably don't want to.

Norris, in his minimalist acting style(..often earning him the scorn from many a critic often claiming he had nothing but nonperformances)is quite a formidable adversary towards the Vietnamese enemy, more of a symbol of the Great American Soldier than an actual character, larger-than-life, certainly a more realistic example than Stallone's Rambo. Norris is a haunted soldier, motivated to find and rescue missing POWs from a Vietnamese compound, who'll do whatever it takes, and that includes killing everyone that challenges him, to save those men. James Hong, in a limited amount of screen time, always could provide a memorable Asian villain, in this one a leader of the new Vietnam a decade after the conflict had ended, accusing Norris of abusing innocent citizens, war crimes he didn't commit. Hong, as Tran, only fuels his desire to save those men from captivity. The film follows Norris' journey to find them. Lots of action, including Norris choking the life out of Vietnamese soldiers, including jungle warfare, lots of ammunition fired from machine guns, exploding guard posts.It's essentially Norris against the enemy, tapping into the scorn that was continuing to permeate after so many American lives were lost in a conflict that went on far too long including a cost that left emotional scars, gaping wounds that continued to bleed. Norris is a hero that those scorned soldiers could root for, and MISSING IN ACTION would provide a victory they didn't receive during their tours in Vietnam. As you'd often see in 80's action films, the enemy can fire rounds upon rounds of ammunition, never hitting Norris, yet his Braddock can blow away a vast number of Vietnamese with limited gunfire. Zito's direction places emphasis on the threat to Braddock's life, and he always points out that there are dangerous individuals all around. But, you always had faith that Braddock would be successful because he was a cool customer that fully understood his mission, and his survival in Vietnam before this movie's current plot provides us with an idea of his skills as a soldier, his courage and intelligence.

From the clichéd look at happiness and love in Richard Curtis' Love Actually to the intimate look at how friendship affects relationships in Rob Reiner's When Harry met Sally we have seen highs and lows at an important part of how love and lust affect our lives. Recently the trend has lowered where everything is set in stone such as Hitch or Intolerable Cruelty. Good films with humour but an inevitable conclusion. So where does Steven Soderbergh's picture rank?If, in the first half an hour, you become bored with the obvious predictability and over dramatic inclusion of Andie MacDowell's marriage then just think of this as build up for something mercifully better. This opening with MacDowell's protagonist Ann conversing with her therapist is frankly boring. Then we see her husband having an affair with her very own sister. So already this feels like an episode from Coronation Street. Graham's introduction though at first ultimately boring becomes interesting once we see his bizarre hobby. Finally the script all starts to make sense. This boring build up layers the foundation for Grahams' inclusion and the implication of sex and the significance of happiness in adversity. Sex is the most covered topic out of the three keywords but for some reason we barely see any so the fact that it is debated so much but shown minimally begs the question of the significance and the lack of enthusiasm for it. Nevertheless there is no shaking the subject is relative, whilst combining mildly interesting plots about affairs, unemployment and perversion.Yes, it's soapy and you pick up clues as easy as Graham picks up women but this is almost irrelative thanks to a sharp performance by Spader.

The constant use of narration is overplayed and just seeing all these problems with the production does not help the film's supposed cause to preach and entertain.

Personally I can't help but see the film as a silent masterpiece with un-needed sound added in. Much of the dialog is just as pointless as the opening narration by Orson Welles. What silent master director Vidor has done, aided by some of the best actors of the silent era including Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore, is to create a truly stunning motion picture that has many individual frames of incredible beauty that could stand alone almost as portraiture, but which combine in a heady and dramatically implausible way into a moving and sometimes rambling topography of the western United States of myth and fantasy.The real acting weight of the picture is carried, surprisingly enough, by Gregory Peck as the ill-mannered brother who's as close as this film comes to a villain. It makes me feel like a lot of his talent was wasted in the vast majority of his roles as his career developed. Here he is natural and even graceful where ordinarily he is stiff and mannered. Cotten seems dull by comparison, and Jennifer Jones' performance is fascinating but for the most part unsuccessful. Only in the final moments of the film does she really take control of her role and her presence. Barrymore has no fear of chewing up every frame, but he's so good (and well-cast) in this film that it doesn't matter. Gish brings all her innate tenderness to bear in a role that's more pathetic than sympathetic.In fact one of the most striking things about Duel in the Sun is the way that the film equivocates about its characters, the ambiguity in so many of them. The Walter Huston character, for example, is taken very far almost into the territory of parody but without any explicit textual condemnation nor any dramatic consequences for his hypocrisy. The Peck character is so heinous at times that we long for his punishment and death, and yet he remains the most vital and appealing character in so many other ways. With its almost overbearing style, the film seems to be saying that these dramatic conventions don't really matter; that any scenario can be forced and pushed into the rough form of the convention without approaching any closer to dramatic or intuitive human truth. The film itself seems to be saying as much about its main character, Pearl Chavez as performed by Jones -- that her wild spirit can be stuffed into corsets and fine lace, but never in a comfortable or totally convincing way. Thus does the film form an uneasy argument that is both conservative and anti-establishment -- it seems to condemn the establishment figures, particularly the Gish character, for their very good intentions.

The Psychlos are represented primarily by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker, but their brand of Disney villainy extends only to constant bickering which may well be unintentionally hilarious but it's not the least bit menacing. Indeed Travolta makes for one of the worst screen villains in recent memory, his Terl coming across as petulant, stroppy and very, very campy rather than the terrifying monster the film is so desperately crying out for. It's this need to keep things safe so the little 'uns won't be scared that saps any sense of danger from proceedings.

It looks like any other, but, to paraphrase Bogart, only more so Nicholas Musuraca's black-and-white cinematography is brighter and darker than any film noir's; Robert Mitchum's character, fugitive detective Jeff Bailley is more sarcastic and fatalistic than ten Sam Spades. Jane Greer plays Kathie Moffat, an unrepentant, cold-blooded femme fatale whose alliances change as quickly as the weather. Kirk Douglas is a soft-voiced, mild-mannered villain with a Machievellian mind and Paul Valentine plays the coolest henchman ever. And then there's the unforgettable ending, which represents the essence of the genre.The movie starts simply but develops a Byzantine plot full of twists and turns and the most quotable dialogue ever. Jeff Bailey is a gas-pumper whose shady past catches up with him when Joe Stefanos comes by. Bailey is trying to lay low and live a good life, but there is no peace or redemption in this movie, and soon he's caught in a web of deceit and murder. Saying more is unnecessary.What really matters is the dialogue, the back-and-forth witty, sarcastic quips, the expressive acting from the perfect cast, the cinematography and the pervasive atmosphere of doom. Although the viewer will be laughing from start to finish, this is no funny movie.

Then she tries to explain what really happened all those years ago to the Company board, but they instantly turn the story down, much to her disbelief. However on the same planet where her previous crew found the Alien egg, she finds out that now a colony of families have moved there and they could be in serious danger and her fears are proved correct when And one of the main reasons why this is a sequel that works so well is because it's aware that its a sequel and its a real continuation of the first movie. And this and Terminator 2 Judgement Day are living proof of why James Cameron is the one and only guy to be making sequels and he can make his sequels just as good as, if not better than, the first movie.Because that its a true sequel, you would expect Ripley to be even further developed, and she is. In Aliens you get to find out so many things about her that you didn't realize in Alien, such as the fact that she had a daughter who died while Ripley was in hypersleep, wow what a shame, because of this she tries to make up for her mistake by bonding with Newt, whose family was killed by the Alien attack. And we even find out her first name towards the end And her development is actually continued from the first movie rather than her developments being abrupt and coming out of nowhere. And while Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar and she should've won obviously, because part of the reason why Ellen Ripley is an iconic character is not because of how she was written but how she was acted.The supporting cast was among the best I've ever seen in any movie and it possibly rivals the one in Predator as the all-time greatest. The characters can remembered on the back of anyone's hand; Hicks, Vasquez, Hudson, Bishop, Burke and Apone and they all have their own thing for us to remember them by.Hicks is blended in by the fantastic Michael Biehn as the silent, intelligent leader (I like to keep this handy, for close encounters). Vasquez is the totally bad@$$ woman pumped in sheer masculinity and toughness, (I only need to know one thing, where....they....are). Bill Paxton is at his prime as Hudson, who acts tough all the time but is actually a timid little child inside (How do I get out of this chicken$h!t outfit?). And Bishop, the android with the big heart, plays an important role in Ripley's development through the movie, in Alien the android named Ash went berserk and made the crew expendable to get the alien organism since the start. And Ripley had an extreme distrust of Bishop even though Bishop is clearly gentle the minute you first see him. At the end they both make peace and sort it out when Ripley learns he ain't as bad and messed up as Ash was. And also, Paul Reiser is perfect as the slimy corporate guy who only wants to make a profit above other people's lives, and when he gets killed you're gonna stand up and cheer, I assure you. And Apone is the awesome sergeant who frequently belittles Hudson (You secure that $h!t, Hudson!, Hudson, get over here, over here! in the film's funniest sequence).The action is totally relentless and packs a heck of a wallop. But during the first hour you won't be seeing any of the aliens or the gunfights so we can focus on the characters and get to know them first. But the action has everything, big machine guns, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, you name it. And the final stand-off between Ripley on the loader and the alien queen (Get away from her, you bi**h!) is among one the greatest ever filmed and it might be the fact that it was really a girl on girl fight which makes it more unique. And that's also why it works as a sequel, because the overall tone is different compared to Alien, and the worst thing that Cameron would've done was to make it a rehash of the original, but he avoided doing that at all costs. And this isn't considered one of the best ever action movies because of the action itself, but because it depicts a once innocent woman who lost nearly everything by a hostile species and will do anything to avenge herself and also try to rebuild what she lost. Awesome, awesome movie, this gets a perfect score from me.

How can anyone be bored by such a daringly resolute film, unless they've become such sleepy filmgoers that no movie can make an imprint on them unless it complies to their expectations? Stanley Kubrick's three-hour adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque tale, which succeeds transcendently as a film which experimented with film stock, lenses and natural lighting, may not be a great entertainment in the traditional sense, but it's a reckless augmentation of directorial clarity Kubrick saying he's going to make this text work as a model of the way he sees the world. The chamber music saturating the soundtrack is so delicate and sophisticated yet so primitive, as is the setting and time.This four-time Oscar-winning period film is substantially hostile in its deliberate coldness. Many of its turns take place offscreen, the cleverly opinionated narrator tending to tell us what's about to happen and we learn long before the film ends that its hero will die broke and unfruitful. This disclosure doesn't much dishearten us, because Kubrick has directed Ryan O'Neal in the title role as if he were an oil painting. He would be a dauntless man of power were he not seeing tunnel vision.And the film has the pomposity of greatness. Aside from how much it cost, how many years it was in the making, not being the commercial success Warner Bros. had been hoping for. How many directors would have Stanley Kubrick's self-assurance in taking this body of history and drama, this basically small yarn of a young man's rise and fall, and completing it in an approach that ultimately bids our approach to it?

And all of these things feel capricious. Young Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's son by Sir Charles, despises Barry from the start. The marriage is not a happy one, yet they celebrate a new son. Barry enjoys himself and philanders whilst keeping Lady Lyndon in apathetic isolation.The key is that the Baroness's son is another Redmond Barry. We're reminded of the righteous renegade young Barry. And we see through the depictions of the world around him that conquering was the inclination to acquire love. He was conquered as a young Irishman, as the rejected third of a love triangle, thus his likewise response was to conquer one's rivals, which heightens the intensity of the Baroness's pain and desperation when she is subjugated by him after being of such dominant distinction.

Two stories are woven together. One is Charlie's on-again off-again friendship with a wealthy drunk. The guy has a case of multiple personality. When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts. When he's sober he doesn't recognize Charlie at all.The second story involves a pretty, blind flower girl who, given certain distances, angles, and lighting, resembles Uma Thurman. Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballs.Charlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy, he's sober and won't support Charlie's story. Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail. When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel, broke and bitter, he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands. The happy ending.There's sentimentality in the story of course. There often is in Chaplin's later films. But, as usual, it's somehow tempered. Here, it's undercut by irony.When Charlie meets the wealthy toff, the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him. He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope. He's about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes, gives him a pep talk, and changes his mind. His spirit revived, the rich guy spread his arms to the sky, dropping the boulder that falls on Charlie's foot.And when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl, she's enthralled by his gentleness. Unseen by her, the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail. Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills. Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain, himself enraptured. Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlie's face. Well, it's not the blind Mr. Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W. C. Fields' general store, but what is? A note. There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film, not counting the Dempsey-Tunney debacle, but I don't think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed here.It's hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this. Black and white, and silent. Applause, please.

Winning 3 Oscars and scooping plenty of other nominations, the story of the struggling screenwriter and failed actress has a level of humanity and realism to maintain its timeless classic tag.Oscar nominated William Holden (The Wild Bunch) opens the story by taking viewers back 6 months before a tragic event recalling how he ended up working for the neurotic Norma Desmond, cinemas once finest star. Holden's reflection on society and his desperation to work is charismatic, ensnaring and occasionally funny. The obsession with the car is witty and when he first appears on screen in dealing with the finance agents is cool and collected deceitful, establishing the character's core exceptionally well. But this charming on screen presence is overshadowed by an obsessive and starry-eyed portrayal of fame by Gloria Swanson as the unforgivably self obsessed actress.With the film world growing bigger each year we see more actors come and go and get lost in a whirlwind of controversy off camera. Gossip magazines are more concerned with the battles with diet and appearance and frankly it's amazing to see this depicted in a film made in the 1950's. Swanson is the symbol of today's modern stereotype. Once the star she descends into a world of obscurity and absentmindedness, lost in past glory before seeing the light and preparing herself for her comeback. I'm ready for my close up Mr DeMille is an unforgettable line and still remains powerful, with the performance stealing the scenes.The story itself representing the struggle of writing and surviving for the film industry is consistently accurate and interesting. The power of the bosses, the struggle of independent writers and penning the greatest novel ever reveal the desire and controversy of the industry.The inclusion of issues such as desire, lust, suicide and money add to the realism of Billy Wilder's acclaimed picture.Wilder chooses scenes carefully, maintain enough realism to make an almost fantasy about the story. The swimming pool scene and Norma's last scene are testament to the concept of madness of the film industry. This, from all the films I have seen, has one of the finest rounded off endings ever screened, perfectly pitched, entertaining and justification to the film's preaching morals of madness and the powers of film.The inclusion of an affair and a secret long lost crush add to the depth and drama of the film, which makes Sunset Boulevard packed with fine preaching issues, stunning acting and enough drama and interest to keep you hooked right until a stunning end ","genre":null},{"date":"19 April 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Down on his luck, screenwriter Joe Gillis (Holden) reluctantly takes a job writing for once famous actress Norma Desmond (Swanson) who is planning her comeback.Made almost 60 years ago Sunset Boulevard was a marvel at the time of release.
