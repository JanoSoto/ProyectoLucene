The movie far from trivializes anything about the Nazis, it simply tries to portray a moment before the bloodiest war in history on a smallish scale.Would it be better to just have a movie that says Nazis are bad and they killed six million Jews.? No, because that wouldn't be a movie.It's like when people complained that a mini-series about Hitler's life that was supposed to be shown on TV would humanize Hitler. Well, news flash, he WAS a human. That's the worst part, a human could do that sort of thing. What good is it to call evil-doers monsters and then leave it at that? When Swing Kids succeeds is when it's portraying the conflicts of youth as their country goes mad. Can anyone honestly say they feel NO sympathy for those who were forced to join the Hitler youth? It's easy to say you would have done different.And the idea that the music being key somehow trivializes the events of WWII, um, it's based on an ACTUAL subculture, swing kids. There were lots of them and at first they were fairly lacking in politics, but later in the 40s when they were cracked down on more so by the Nazis some were more active.It's not like the movie makers pulled the concept of kids, Nazis and swing out of their asses, which is what people seem to think.And at least it was something, at least it wasn't giving in totally. Remember these were young kids, high-school age, nobody can expect them all to be Sophie Scholl.Where Swing Kids lacks is its occasional excessive heavy-handedness. The ending is a bit excessive, something more subtle would have been better.But as I say, the conflicts between the three main leads are fantastic and bring up questions of what you would do in such circumstances. I think the boys's indifference in respect to the Jew being beat up in the beginning of the movie is a good touch. This is NOT about the holocaust, because it was just starting and was largely unknown at the time. I hate when people can't lose what they know to watch a movie.I recommend everyone to read some swing kids history, just look them up, it makes the movie much better and more interesting to know the facts.This is a fairly good movie with very good acting, great great music and costumes, a great story that was influenced by deeply interesting history, and too much heavy handedness.But seriously, who can resist a movie put out by Disney that includes the line of dialog You're turning into a f*cking Nazi!?

Having thought up that idea, I can now take credit if it's ever filmed. A ship sent to learn the fate of an earlier expedition finds only one scientist (Pigeon) & his attractive young daughter (Francis) surviving, served by the all-capable, polite but wry-humored Robbie the Robot. The ramrod tough but compassionate captain (Nielsen) soon learns from the reluctant, reclusive scientist that the planet is home to the ruins of an astonishingly advanced, but now dead, civilization. The scientist warns them that his own companions were long ago slaughtered by an unstoppable, invisible attacker that inexplicably left him & his daughter alone. When the captain's own command is subjected to escalating sabotage & attacks, he suspects the scientist, who makes no secret of his wish to be left alone & may be growing jealous of his daughter's undisguised attraction to the captain. Do either the captain or the scientist really understand the forces with which they tamper? Not until 2001 did a another major film so searchingly, even hauntingly, explore our fears of contacting an alien intelligence so far ahead of us that it may not even care if we exist at all. This is one of those films whose flaws actually add to its appeal. The actors & crew struggle with the strictures of the 1950s, reinforcing age & gender stereotypes (cantankerous old father, tough-guy spacemen, leggy blonde) giving sugary prominence to the schoolyard romance of the captain & the girl, and even throwing in a silly subplot about the ship's cook, determined to get his hands on whiskey. Before we throw too many stones at the '50s, of course, our own jaded Law & Order, CSI decade could not have depicted the scientist & his scantily clad daughter without some sort of slur about incest. Distinguished actors never quite distinguish themselves here, Pigeon sometimes seeming bored or tired while Nielsen & Francis give us nothing that hasn't been done a million times before or 2 million times since. But few sci-fi films, before or since, have so well woven popular science into its tale, including physics, Freudian psychology (sans the sex stuff) and robotics. Though it is done on an impressively futuristic set, much of the story's scientific background is done in dialog between the actors. This would have been great in a book but tests our patience in a movie, where our eyes & ears demand constant movement. The climax between Nielsen & Pigeon more than makes up for any earlier boredom. Predictably primitive by today's standards, the special effects are a model for any film, illustrating without overwhelming the action. The weapons make far less noise than the phasers of Star Trek or the blasters & light sabers of Star Wars (why do electromagnetic weapons have to make noise, anyway? Wouldn't silence be a benefit of such equipment, so that Obi-Kirk & Darth Klingon can sneak up on each other?). Forbidden Planet also makes effective use of red herrings with no fishy aftertaste, keeping those of us who haven't seen The Tempest performed lately guessing. The cutting-edge, haunting electronic music score by the Barrons may not be for every taste but sets the mood of introspection, mystery & wonder as effectively as John Williams's orchestration frames the heroism, villainy & conflict in Star Wars. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Forbidden Planet is one of the most honored films in history, from the all-American military discipline and micro-miniskirts of the Star Treks to the 'droids and mysterious, invisible Force of Star Wars (thought that was all New-Age Buddhism, did you?). 2001, Stargate, Farscape, Space 1999 and Close Encounters also delve into our fear of & wonder at more advanced aliens and our own computerized creations, while Lost in Space is either a parody or a cheap rip-off, whatever your pleasure. The highest honor that can be given to this film is that it is a definitive view of how mainstream America, then flush with victory in war and prosperity at home, mindful yet fearful of the electromagnetic powers that it had just harnessed, looked at its own fears & hopes for the future.

First, the plot. Without giving anything away, suffice it to say that a distracted young chimp could anticipate each of the so-called twists. Now, the acting. With the exception of Montegna, who is the only remotely believable character, the performances wouldn't pass muster at a community theater in the outskirts of Boise, Idaho. Several lines\/scenes are downright comical. My only defense of the movie is that it may have been adapted from a play, because that's what it felt like - a group of mediocre stage actors, directed by a 20-year old drama major, collectively trying to muddle their way through their first film.

He was born as an in-valid which means he is not a genetically modified human as his brother is. Ever since Vincent was a kid, he had a dream of going into space. However, Vincent was born with a 99% chance of getting a heart condition. This meant that Vincent's dream of going into space was not possible. He met a man named Jerome Morrow. This guy does not have any defects of any kind. So Vincent and Jerome work together and succeed in turning Vincent into Jerome Morrow. His dream was now possible. However, after the murder of the mission director, Vincent accidentally leaves an eyelash at the scene! So to elude capture, Vincent must take special precautions in order for him to continue pursuing his dream of going into space. With the authorities hot on his tail, Vincent must make some tough decisions to keep him from getting caught and quite possibly be taken away from his dream which lays just off in his horizon.Gattaca in my opinion, is the best sci-fi thriller of 1997. It combines characteristics such as action, suspense, and some good science and is all wrapped up into this truly enjoyable bundle. Even though this is a Hollywood movie, it has some great science which can be used in so many different ways. I watched this movie in science class today and let me tell you, this movie was a great asset to what we were learning about in class. I actually learned almost as much about DNA in this movie as I did in class!! Ethan Hawke, who plays Vincent Freeman\/the fake Jerome Morrow, gives us an amazing performance in this film. He should have won the Oscar for best actor in 1997. Since seeing this movie, I truly appreciate Ethan Hawke much more than what I used to. I have discovered that he is an amazing actor and I will definitely remind myself to buy\/rent more movies in which he stars in.The director of this film, Andrew Niccol, does an amazing job at directing this film. I believe this man should have got the best director Oscar for this film. It boggles my mind that this film is the first film in which he directed!! This is a sign of what's to come. I believe Andrew Niccol will become the next big thing in Hollywood. He certainly has gotten off to a great start!!

It is a story about lovelorn cops just trying to find love and connect with movie. A 20 year old Takeshi Kaneshiro stars as the pineapple eating cop 223 who has just broken up with his girlfriend and is crushed. He resorts to eating from 30 pineapple cans(because his girlfriend loves pineapples) in one night(the day before his birthday. He soon decides to fall in love with the first woman he meets in a bar and that woman (unknown to him) happens to be a drug dealer. Even though she is hesitant at first, they connect as two people just looking for a sense of belonging. The second story is more romantic but by no means overtly sweet. Its realistic. Waitress Faye Wong (who LOVES California dreaming by the mamas and the papas)falls hard for cop Tony Leung 663 and breaks into his apartment and basically acts as a housewife without him knowing! Whereas Tony Leung, still lamenting over losing his air hostess girlfriend is oblivious to this and talks to his objects and appliances at home. He finds what she is doing and asks her out. She leaves and goes to California but leaves him a letter. At the end though, she comes back after a year to see that he is in charge of where she used to work and they reach a sort of, perhaps, hopeful agreement. The reason i love this film is for the sheer madness and beauty portrayed. I used to live in hong Kong and knew where these scenes were shot(although i came on 1997). It was so wonderful to see a movie showing Hong Kong in its true light.In fact, it was after this movie that i took an interest in hk movies etc. The other reason i liked this film was because its the type of film that you can keep watching and discover each time something new. It has that sort of timeless quality in its message and visual showing Now time to review the actors. Takeshi Kaneshiro - in my opinion, one of the most beautiful men in the world. And he can actually act. I love the way he is able to shows his vulnerability and the need to love someone. He is hilarious in his telephone calls to his girlfriends family. He seems to me a very real character but also the most optimistic one and thats why i find him attractive. Briggite Lin - though we never see her real face (we only get a small glimpse after she takes off the wig and sunglasses), she is wonderful in terms of her body language her facial expressions. Tony Leung - i think he is wonderful. a truly deep character who suppresses all his emotions. Unlike Takeshi who is young and hopeful, tony is more a cynic and quiet. He shows his vulnerability too but also is very masculine in his representation of it. Faye Wong - great actress. love her cranberries tribute and it seemed SO suitable to the movie.

As a child this movie made me believe that the turtles existed. Probably because the design and articulation of the animatronic Turtles and Splinter made them look astonishingly real. And with no CG required! We're able to see each character's different personality; Leo's cautious leadership and warm concern for his family, Donnatello's laid-back attitude and memorably corny jokes, Michelangelo's endearingly childlike behavior and undying love for pizza, and of course Raphael, whose intense moments of frustration, turtle tantrums, and occasional reacting before thinking, a lot of people can relate to.The human characters are also very well portrayed, especially Casey Jones who Steals every scene he's in. And Splinter is perfectly rendered as not just a Wise teacher, but a loving father.To this day, this film is able to please both fans of the comic and fans of the original cartoon series, (I myself am a lifetime fan of the lovable toon.) Maybe because it's both dark and humorous. Maybe it's the unforgettable original score that alternates between being suspenseful, intense, and totally radical. But it also has a ton of heart. It was able to do so without manipulation or overly-extending the sweeter moments. It touches fans in a subtle way, whether it's out of nostalgia, or the endearing relationship between all 4 Turtles and their beloved sensei.Something about this movie defines around the time the 80's went into the 90's. A time that seemed more innocent yet wasn't afraid to have our childhood heroes say Damn and show teenagers in a PG-rated movie smoke cigars and break the law. It's like being shown the real world and not watching some phony BS Disney-Channelesque movie where everything is clean, friendly, and obviously fake, and everyone's personality is perfect, shallow, and plastic.I will always hold the first Turtle movie in a special place in my heart.

Not only is it the sequel to the film that started the whole movement ('Wes Craven's New Nightmare' notwithstanding), but it carries the postmodernist game-playing to a new level. Horror purists loathed it for being populist and 'ironic', critics hated slasher movies on principle, and the larger audience were suffering from in-joke fatigue by the time they saw it. So unfortunately, nobody notices that not only is it a better film than the one it succeeds, it's probably the best horror film of the period.The opening sequence is particularly striking. Everything that made the original's celebrated opening sequence so iconic is either subverted or built upon. So again, a young woman and her boyfriend are stalked and murdered, but this time it plays out in a crowded cinema (showing a tacky reinterpretation of the original, just to reinforce the connection). Where the horror used to be in isolation, it is now found in alienation - the nightmare of dying in front of hundreds of people and nobody lifting a finger to help you is particularly potent. The iconography of ghost-face is played upon here too, not only in the film-within-a-film but the masks members of the audience wear. Given that the film seems to be a refutation of the old 'violent movies cause violence' argument (Sarah Michelle Gellar's character acts as the voice of sanity, Timothy Olyphant's character parodies what Wes Craven clearly considers the voice of insanity), it's striking that in this opening sequence the audience is seen as partly culpable for the murder. The moment when a bleeding Jada Pinkett-Smith cries out on stage, framed by the projection of ghost-face's mask (and bleached out by the white light, an interesting visual cue back to the debate over black characters in horror films that opens the film), and the baying audience subside in uneasy realisation, is one of the most indelible images in a horror film I've ever seen, and a slap in the face for the (real) audience, who have come to the cinema in order to see people get sliced up, after all. It takes a brave movie to implicate its viewers before the film has really got going, and certainly underlines the fact that this is neither a dumb slasher flick or a cheap cash-in on the success of the original.The potency of the death of this character we have only spent a few minutes in the company of illustrates something else about 'Scream 2' (and 'Scream', for that matter) - that, despite the repeated use of the word by lazy magazine and newspaper critics who ought to know better, they are not 'ironic'. No wonder Kevin Williams turned the definition of the word into a running joke in his later script 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'; he must have been sick of the misallocation of the word in almost every review he read. It implies a style that contrasts the apparent and actual meaning of situations and dialogue. Irony in this sense undercuts what we are being shown and what the characters experience, usually turning it into bathos. There is no irony in the deaths of the characters in 'Scream 2', unlike 'Final Destination 2', for instance, where characters being sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence or crushed by a falling pane of glass are both moments of horror and moments of humour. In contrast, when Hallie buys it so soon after surviving the film's most excruciating suspense sequence, it's horrific because she's a likable, funny character who doesn't deserve to die. The audience responds to the characters on an emotional level, mainly because of Williams's unfairly uncelebrated skill at creating three-dimensional characters in just a handful of scenes (compare with 'Scream 3', scripted by Ehren Kruger, where only Parker Posey's self-obsessed film star stands out), but also because of the skills of an above average cast (particularly Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber - although frankly Laurie Metcalf calmly pockets the entire movie in a single scene. Compare also Neve Campbell's likable, determined Sidney with Jennifer Love Hewitt's Julie Jameson in the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' films - a drip written (initially by Williams, irritatingly) and acted with half the skill, who constantly needs rescuing by her boyfriend as though she were the heroine of a Victorian melodrama). These are not the corpses-in-waiting of most slasher films, but funny, rounded individuals with their own foibles who die senselessly and horribly. The humour (and it is a very, very funny movie) is not at the expense of the horror, or the characters enduring it. It's also worth noting the real skill with which Craven orchestrates the suspense, the excellent use of music (particularly some borrowed from the 'Broken Arrow' score), Tori Spelling's gameness (although she gives away the plot twist of 'Stab' in that interview!), and Portia di Rossi's remarkable eyebrows. This movie needs serious re-assessment. Personally, I think it's richer than your average horror-snob's favourite.

Not only is it the sequel to the film that started the whole movement ('Wes Craven's New Nightmare' notwithstanding), but it carries the postmodernist game-playing to a new level. Horror purists loathed it for being populist and 'ironic', critics hated slasher movies on principle, and the larger audience were suffering from in-joke fatigue by the time they saw it. So unfortunately, nobody notices that not only is it a better film than the one it succeeds, it's probably the best horror film of the period.The opening sequence is particularly striking. Everything that made the original's celebrated opening sequence so iconic is either subverted or built upon. So again, a young woman and her boyfriend are stalked and murdered, but this time it plays out in a crowded cinema (showing a tacky reinterpretation of the original, just to reinforce the connection). Where the horror used to be in isolation, it is now found in alienation - the nightmare of dying in front of hundreds of people and nobody lifting a finger to help you is particularly potent. The iconography of ghost-face is played upon here too, not only in the film-within-a-film but the masks members of the audience wear. Given that the film seems to be a refutation of the old 'violent movies cause violence' argument (Sarah Michelle Gellar's character acts as the voice of sanity, Timothy Olyphant's character parodies what Wes Craven clearly considers the voice of insanity), it's striking that in this opening sequence the audience is seen as partly culpable for the murder. The moment when a bleeding Jada Pinkett-Smith cries out on stage, framed by the projection of ghost-face's mask (and bleached out by the white light, an interesting visual cue back to the debate over black characters in horror films that opens the film), and the baying audience subside in uneasy realisation, is one of the most indelible images in a horror film I've ever seen, and a slap in the face for the (real) audience, who have come to the cinema in order to see people get sliced up, after all. It takes a brave movie to implicate its viewers before the film has really got going, and certainly underlines the fact that this is neither a dumb slasher flick or a cheap cash-in on the success of the original.The potency of the death of this character we have only spent a few minutes in the company of illustrates something else about 'Scream 2' (and 'Scream', for that matter) - that, despite the repeated use of the word by lazy magazine and newspaper critics who ought to know better, they are not 'ironic'. No wonder Kevin Williams turned the definition of the word into a running joke in his later script 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'; he must have been sick of the misallocation of the word in almost every review he read. It implies a style that contrasts the apparent and actual meaning of situations and dialogue. Irony in this sense undercuts what we are being shown and what the characters experience, usually turning it into bathos. There is no irony in the deaths of the characters in 'Scream 2', unlike 'Final Destination 2', for instance, where characters being sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence or crushed by a falling pane of glass are both moments of horror and moments of humour. In contrast, when Hallie buys it so soon after surviving the film's most excruciating suspense sequence, it's horrific because she's a likable, funny character who doesn't deserve to die. The audience responds to the characters on an emotional level, mainly because of Williams's unfairly uncelebrated skill at creating three-dimensional characters in just a handful of scenes (compare with 'Scream 3', scripted by Ehren Kruger, where only Parker Posey's self-obsessed film star stands out), but also because of the skills of an above average cast (particularly Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber - although frankly Laurie Metcalf calmly pockets the entire movie in a single scene.

Honestly not one, no director Atom Egoyan found a way to kill all of the children in 1 breath, taking it not into the absurd, but in fact with a touch of realism.Imagine a small town somewhere in the mountains of Canada, where yo have a lot of individual houses who stand in the mountains. Imagine it being winter, and having a dead wood covered in perfect white snow. Imagine 1 school bus, on it's way to deliver the small group of country kids to their normal school day. Imagine that the driver losses control, over the wheel on the icy and slippery road. Imagine that the bus falls of a low cliff onto the ice. Now imagine the bus going through the ice, where most kids (all but 1) meet a ice cold and wet grave.The ones who are left behind are the parents who can only grief in silence, until after all reporters are gone, a lawyer shows up, who tries a make a claim, to look for a guilty one, in this tragedy.But really WHO IS TO BLAME ?

Sadly, Justin Chambers makes a better d'Artagnan than Chris O' Donnell, but only because he doesn't do any acting at all, which is better than the profuse overacting of O' Donnell. And Stephen Rea is a good actor, but his character isn't remotely as menacing as Richelieu should be.With all of that said, if you just view it as a movie, and try to block the actual story out of your mind, it can be entertaining. The fight scenes are very well done, and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. Perhaps this movie could have been really good if it was about the story of a musketeer NOT named d'Artagnan, and his unique adventure.

But since it tries to be an interpretation of Dumas, it falls miserably short. As a movie, it is so-so, but as far as an interpretation of the famous story, it is absolutely terrible.

For one thing, it seems to try and hang on to some parts of the story by Dumas, and yet it also is an entirely different story. Seemingly, the only real similarities are the names of the characters. This movie would be much more effective if it was entirely its own story, and not using the names of the famous characters. The reason? This movie totally dashes the names of those characters.The most unsettling part for me was the fact that the Three Musketeers are nothing like themselves. Porthos is not the least bit arrogant or over-the-top. Aramis isn't religious at all. And Athos does not even remotely resemble the character in the book. Sadly, Justin Chambers makes a better d'Artagnan than Chris O' Donnell, but only because he doesn't do any acting at all, which is better than the profuse overacting of O' Donnell. And Stephen Rea is a good actor, but his character isn't remotely as menacing as Richelieu should be.With all of that said, if you just view it as a movie, and try to block the actual story out of your mind, it can be entertaining.

However, I do understand that what's good as text doesn't always translate to what's good on screen. The visuals, as always in a Spielberg film, were top notch the dinosaurs, the sets, the camera angles. There were some good acting performances. It wasn't a bad film, per se. What I find unflattering is all the wacky additions. The dino hunters, the Southern California-based theme park... all very unbelievable to me. It's like having our favourite killer shark Jaws stay in an occupied swimming pool in Las Vegas. It just wouldn't happen. At least I think it hasn't happened, I've only seen through part 18 of the Jaws series. Now I know some people find this exciting. What if a T-Rex got loose in the city! What if we went Battlefield 2 on their dino-***es! I admit, I'd be slightly curious to see how it played out too. But only in the slight curiousness one might have to see, say, X-Men vs. Street Fighter; or when those crazy Flintstones met those silly Jetsons. I think we have proved well enough that while these sound like good ideas at first, they fall far short in actuality. I suppose going to Site B to study dinosaur behaviour while the villainous Dodgson tries another one of his schemes and ultimately gets the chaos theory ball rolling doesn't sound exciting enough for mainstream film industry. Certainly not as exciting as a dino theme park gone awry. But I find the book's sequence of events quite exciting. There is plenty of action and intrigue, and Malcom's theories satisfy the intellectual side of the brain that you might not realise you have. In conclusion, while I am not entirely against major changes from book to screen (The Lord of the Rings is a good example), I find this one to have gone a bit overboard. Fans of this film will continue to enjoy it, while I will stick to the book.

The director is overly fixated on 'creating the scene'. As the film takes place in Cuba sometime well in the past (maybe the late 19th century?), it's understandable to flaunt the romance of the setting, but it comes off like a slutty romance novel. Of course the erotic scenes with Jolie and Banderas (and later other men), only add to that feeling.The purpose of the music is to add to the mystique and romance of old Cuba even more. The problem is that while it's adding to the setting, it's hurting the story. This movie is supposed to be a bit of a thriller, and music is always a big part of creating suspense in film. The music here just doesn't get the job done, and it really hurts the flow of the movie.Because of all these issues this movie really drags. A lot more footage should have been chopped in the editing room, but its redemption is that if you wait long enough, you find it does have a point and a good one at that. The melodrama never really leaves, but the story nonetheless comes together in the end. I can't say I'd particularly recommend it, but it's watchable if you're patient.
