I sort of cheered when Alex's friend's gave him is just desserts by kicking his ass after he had done the same to them in the past.  The end of the movie showed what I've always believed  No one gets away with anything, if they do something with malicious intent.Now at 43, I have to see it again, come back to IMDB and do another review. I will tell you right now  I will not see this movie at night.  I don't think my nerves can deal with violence so frivolously as I did back in time. Remember, gang violence, teenage violence was a great minimum in the 70's. The Love Generation was still around and we did not think of anything but loving our brother and sister.  So Clockwork Orange was an unbelievable story for the 70's.  Now look where we are at in the 90's  A Clockwork Orange.See you later with Part II of my adult review of A Clockwork Orange.

Neve Campbell), a soon-to-be-well-known script writer (a.k.a. Kevin Williamson), and a famous horror director (a.k.a. Wes Craven) than you might not call Urban Legend your typical horror film. Unlike the past Scream and I Know... movies, Urban Legend has its own, unique way of scaring you. Instead of ghostface popping out from behind a hidden door or the fisherman breaking through shower glass, the killer in Urban Legend doesn't just jump out and attack his victims, he makes them legends. He tends to put you in suspense almost making the movie come alive and feeling like reality. Just like the tagline says, just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't.The director chose well known legends almost everyone has heard of, such as the psycho in the backseat or the threatening phone calls to the babysitter which are coming from the children's bedroom. Since we know these stories so well it makes us feel like we are there and that we are the next victim. Even if you don't care for a character you almost feel sorry for them knowing exactly how they're going to die. The opening scene in the movie with Natasha Wagner in her car is by far the most suspenseful and scary part of the film. As you see the killer rise behind her, your heart starts pounding and you are hoping she turns around in time before he swings his axe. After this scene the legends are not as scary or threatening, but an action scene in which Tara Reid is pursued is rather gripping.As well as action, the film also has some funny and quite clever lines driven by Tara Reid's character Sasha while speaking over the radio with some freshman. This film was surprisingly scary and shockingly entertaining and I recommend it to all horror fans, but if you are a dog lover I strongly suggest to not see this film!

It's not like the Friday the 13th movies where no one ever concerns themselves with how to kill Jason because up until the last five minutes or so of the movie, teens are still being killed.Let's look at how Freddy was dealt with in the previous films.#1. Nightmare on Elm Street -- Here Nancy mumbles some stuff about how dreams aren't reality and can be controlled. Her plan was to pull Freddy into reality where he could be killed in the flesh. At this early point in his career Wes Craven enjoyed the normal people fight back against the bad guys theme. You can see examples of this in both Last House on the Left and The Hills have Eyes. So I look at the conclusion of this film as simply the director going back to the same well for ideas, and is not particully interested in how Freddy might come back.#2. Freddy's Revenge -- Kind of the same idea as the last film, except since Freddy was inhabiting the body of the protagonist, the lovely Kim Meyers had to find some way of forcing Freddy's evil spirit out by reaching the human side of the poor lad.#3. Dream Warriors -- Here's where the rules get laid down. Using Nancy's dream control theory, the characters find a way to give themselves powers in Freddy's dream world. Also, we find out that to be destroyed forever, Freddy's bones must be given a proper burial.So that takes us to this chapter which seems to exist only for marketing purposes. No real reason is given for Freddy's return, and the storyline is more of a fragmented series of sections where Freedy offs the uninteresting teens than a conventional narrative. This disjointed storytelling technique almost works. There is a scene where the two main characters rushing to save a friend find themselves caught in a sort of time loop. In a way, the viewer almost feels the same way while watching this, as the lack of a storyline gives the movie a dream-like feel where anything could happen.But since any producer wanting to make money could resurrect Freddy, it sort of makes this whole film seem pointless.The sub-par special effects don't help much either, although a sequence where a character turns into a cockroach is interesting.Personally, I would recommend going right to #5 since the direction is better. Go ahead, it's usually right next to #4 on the video store shelf.

Then I saw a preview for Blade.  As a kid, I had been a big Marvel comics fan, and since Blade is neither a popular comic hero like Batman or Spawn, I was wondering how or why anyone would want to make a film about him.  I also admit that the preview was less than convincing.  I convinced myself to see it simply because I am a big Wesley Snipes fan and Blade was a cool character.  Then came August 22. I had just come back from out of town and immediately my friend Mike called me informing me that it was definitely one of the baddest-ass action movies in the history of filmmaking.  So, on August 23, I saw it.  From the previews, one would expect a Seagal-ish cheap-ass action flick with poorly choreographed action sequences, lame as hell moves, and crappy acting on the part of supporting characters.  Of course, one could not hold the plot against the movie.  Why would you go see a movie like Blade, an obvious action extravaganza, for a realistic plot?  The filming style was incredibly unique.  And of course, Wesley Snipes lets himself go, letting loose incredible arrays of fighting sequences involving capoiera, aikido, and several styles of kung fu.  The supporting actors, mainly Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue, also performed to the peak of their abilities.  All-in-all, Blade is an excellent movie for those who prefer violent, go for the throat action movies with an exceptional badass ring to them.

As a kid, I had been a big Marvel comics fan, and since Blade is neither a popular comic hero like Batman or Spawn, I was wondering how or why anyone would want to make a film about him.  I also admit that the preview was less than convincing.  I convinced myself to see it simply because I am a big Wesley Snipes fan and Blade was a cool character.  Then came August 22. I had just come back from out of town and immediately my friend Mike called me informing me that it was definitely one of the baddest-ass action movies in the history of filmmaking.  So, on August 23, I saw it.  From the previews, one would expect a Seagal-ish cheap-ass action flick with poorly choreographed action sequences, lame as hell moves, and crappy acting on the part of supporting characters.  Of course, one could not hold the plot against the movie.  Why would you go see a movie like Blade, an obvious action extravaganza, for a realistic plot?  The filming style was incredibly unique.  And of course, Wesley Snipes lets himself go, letting loose incredible arrays of fighting sequences involving capoiera, aikido, and several styles of kung fu.  The supporting actors, mainly Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue, also performed to the peak of their abilities.  All-in-all, Blade is an excellent movie for those who prefer violent, go for the throat action movies with an exceptional badass ring to them.

Keep in mind that this film premiered the same year as Jaws.  It was up against one of the most popular movies of all time.  Jaws was a pop corn-saturday afternoon-I hope we can get tickets, retreat.  Barry Lyndon required effort, patience, and an appreciation of beauty.
