There are so many great things going for this movie that it is one you might not want to miss if you are into the war genre. And even though some may not like it in their own opinion, criticizing this very artistic picture by Terrance Mallick as some distasteful film critics did is nearly a crime.The plot is very simple and lets itself at you 10 minutes into the film. A rifle infantry known as Charlie Company are set to raid Guadalcanal Island ordered in a 5 minute performance by John Travolta and led throughout the film by Nick Nolte in a very intense performance. As the large group of mostly young soldiers sets foot on the island to fight the Japenese the action jumps in right away. Throughout the following 2 hours of almost nonstop war different platoons are given different orders to take over the island step by step. Each platoon has their own result, some involving major sucess while others suffering in loss.A trouble The Thin Red Line ran into for being released this January is that it's being severly compared to another very different WWII film Saving Private Ryan. Terrance Mallick and Steven Spielburg have a much different vision on war, different storyline, different location, different enemy, and different characters. Saving Private Ryan's intensity was for it's considerable realism throughout while The Thin Red Line's intensity may not be as real but extremely horrifying. If you even think about comparing these two films you minus will throw in all the other WWII films like Das Boot into the mix, because they are all very different.There are so many great things in Terrance Mallick's film it's almost hard to name them all. The visuals were absolutly spectacular which made most of the war scenes not only to make you feel that you were in the war but if you were surrounded. The location which was reportadly shot on Guadalcanal is also incredible which is what makes some of the scenes so scary from the amount of surroundings the soldiers were in during their battles. The sound effects and soundtrack are both outstanding which help give a lot of meaning to the mood and feel for the movie.The cast to The Thin Red Line is something quite unique and unusual. There are so many familiar faces in this film that it's hard to keep track of them all and the young cast members (especially the main character played by Jim Caviezel) are also superb. It's surprising to see though how little screen time many actors like Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, and especially George Clooney (not even a minute) were given. Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and John Cusack all gave wonderful performances with very memorable characters. One thing that added a lot of emotion in some scenes of this 3 hour epic were the flashbacks to give character background. This gave the characters enough realism to make some of their deaths very dramatic.Out of the eight of ten I gave it there are only a few problems. One of which is the narratives that seem to never end and it's hard to imagine some of these soldiers speaking so poetically with such symbolism. But the main problem The Thin Red Line had can be thanked to 20th Century Fox. When Terrance Mallick was done filming he supposedly had over eight hours of film (much of which was probubly lost in the editing room since Mallick is known to aim for perfection in his films) and when he gave 20th Century Fox the rough draft of the film they wanted it to be cut down drastically. This caused the film to feel a little choppy in many parts and could have been fixed if they let Mallick release his original version of the film instead of the very cut 3 hour version. Hopefully there will be a directors cut released on DVD to help fill in the taken out scenes.Overall this is definitely a good choice. Terrance Mallick's direction is a one of a kind experiance and if you haven't seen his earlier films like Badlands you will be surprised at how different his films can be.

Dad has quickly found work as a building contractor and seems to be doing well. Ironically, having been driven out of his own country by Serbian ethnic cleansing, he finds NZ's mild multi-racial society impossible to tolerate, at least when his gorgeous daughter falls seriously in lust with Eddie, a handsome Maori, in the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant where they both work. Being a fairly typical NZ movie, the theme is played for comedy rather than tragedy, though there is plenty of tension. An erotic scene early on dissolves into a minor domestic mishap. Cars get their windows smashed but no-one gets their head smashed in. The real tragedy is back home in Croatia via home videos from remaining relatives. The young couple progress from 90% lust \/10% affection to about 50\/50, though it's a rocky road. Dad however just can't adjust. Civil enough with his Tongan (coconut) neighbours, the idea of his little girl having it off with any Maori sends him ballistic (it could have been worse - the lover might have been Serbian). With his knucklehead son, he attempts to break them up, with predictable lack of success. It's a great sketch of a tough, admirable (in some ways) but unadaptable man. Why is he like that?

There's a mildly amusing sub-plot regarding an immigration scam run by Nina and Eddies's employer, with the characters involved verging on caricature.

Conversely, Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE garners equal parts praise, equal parts derision, and is called the product of an expatriate flower-child who's clearly lost his mind.  Four days after seeing Malick's film, I am haunted, not by horrible images of war, but something far deeper and beguiling.  Seeking truth, I see Ryan again, feeling diplomatic and ready to accept each film as two sides of the same coin  - SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the Id, flesh, machination, mission, answer and nostalgic history, to THE THIN RED LINE's conscience, spirit, garden, journey, question, and utopian vision.Right out the gate, Spielberg is onto something big when he stages the battle of Omaha Beach.  Consider that he arrives on location with only five pages of script for the entire invasion of Normandy, then gets busy in his sandbox, re-shooting and fine-tuning the gore until an immaculate vision of carnage is rendered - mostly thanks to Janusz Kaminski stripped lenses and newsreel cinematography.  Reading the U.S. Army's technocratic account of D-Day, one is spirited to learn there is a real-life rifle company that lands at Dog Green amidst slaughter and confusion, blows a gap in a mine-field, fights its way to the top of a bluff, and cleans out a machine-gun nest.  This incursion actually takes several grueling hours, not twenty minutes - that this should be surprising is testament to the power of  Spielberg's false realism.That Spielberg didn't just tell the whole story of D-Day is a bit of a shame.  I suppose he didn't want to remake THE LONGEST DAY (1962), with its ham-and-cheese heroics.  I kind of wish he had.  Instead, he opts for something more sentimental and personal in scope, but sadly, his vision suffers for it.  The very moment Tom Hanks' Captain Miller looks back at a beach littered with corpses (body parts curiously absent) the film loses its well-crafted, objectivity. That the eviscerating horrors of the battle still weigh on the mind is no excuse for the parade of stock characters, inappropriate comic relief, and desperate pastiche that follow.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is no rip-off of THE THIN RED LINE, more so, an inversion. Red Line's single, gripping battle scene is bordered by metaphysical yearning, while Ryan bookends its uneasy spirituality with two scenes of sensational combat. Red Line features the hypnotic and ferocious presence of a green jungle, where Ryan's palate is leached of all color, save mud, gun-metal and brick. Red Line poses unanswerable queries into the nature of human existence, while Ryan asks the rhetorical question, am I a good man?All attempts at anticipating Malick's opus would be denied, for up to the second of his film's release, he still worked on it.  Here is a man who will never play by Hollywood's rules.  Consider that Malick spends twenty years in hiding, is begged out of retirement by a pair of iconoclastic producers (Robert Michael Geisler and John Roberdeau), spends many more years adapting James Jones' novel in secrecy, fires his producers, arrives on location in the wildernesses of Australia and the Solomon Islands with a small army, ditches his script, shoots 1,000,000 feet of 70mm film over a six-month period - most exclusively in evening and early morning light - cuts the film at eight hours, and lastly, writes a haunting, poetic narration to bind the final, three-hour cut.Those not hypnotized by Malick's vision are finding this film infuriating, though.  A common complaint is that the film lacks a central hero to rally behind; but such is the film's belief that there exists a collective unconscious shared by all, and all men are somehow the same.  The physical similarities between Privates Witt (Jim Cazeviel) and Bell (Ben Chaplin) emphasize this point.  Both men carry with them memories of a great love, be it sensual wife, or primal paradise; both pass through war never to return to this love.  In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN you hear about a soldier's mental island, where one must go in battle to remain sane; but in THE THIN RED LINE, you experience this, and you mourn its passing.In the end, THE THIN RED LINE is about World War II as much as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is about Death, the dark, senseless way one is mutilated through war.  THE THIN RED LINE is about Life, light, and its fragile presence in all living things.In conclusion, I must address which film and which director will carry home more Oscars?  The Academy faced a similar conundrum in 1978 when considering COMING HOME vs. THE DEER HUNTER for Best Picture. (This was the same year Malick made Days of Heaven, then disappeared). The war in Vietnam, long a taboo subject, was then recognized in mainstream cinema but, who had the supreme vision, Hal Ashby or Michael Cimino?  The question is superfluous for neither film is about the war so much as the disintegration of the American psyche.  Ultimately, The Academy chose THE DEER HUNTER with its deeply layered character studies over the cloying, P.C. sentimentality of COMING HOME.  I am hoping that today's voters are of a similar sensibility. Therefore, I most humbly suggest to the esteemed members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for your consideration, for Best Picture&#133; THE THIN RED LINE - not because it is the better representation of war, because it is the greater realization of life.*****  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 1999","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  January 15, 1999 - Stephen Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN seems the stuff of greatness  it elevates cinematic realism to new heights, is a catalyst for passionate discourse on World War II, emboldens new respect for our veterans, and gives Spielberg an early lock on all things Oscar.

Glory is no exception.Yes, there are a million war movies out there but only a handful, Glory included, that accurately portray what it means to be fighting in war, both physically and mentally speaking. Based on the experiences of the colored 54th Massachusetts Infantry enlisted to help during the Civil War, Glory speaks volumes on themes such as honor, duty, and love--things not only directed towards the country being fought for, but also towards the fellow men fighting alongside. Glory strongly invests itself in such classical themes of the American cinema and turns out to be one of the greatest and most valuable films of all time.Performance-wise, this is illustrative of what coalesces when several fine thespians unite for one cause. Denzel is in no uncertain terms unworthy of his oscar award-winning performance, arguably the finest of his career. Broderick is nothing less than brilliant and captivating as Colonel Shaw. The performance required of him--he has to display his inherited abolitionist views on the surface while underneath, harboring a plenitude of humanity his soldiers initially think he lacks--is a hard one and he unexpectedly demonstrates he can do it as easily as he skipped school in the now cult-classic Ferris Bueller's Day off. Morgan Freeman, as always, is effective as the wise one who knows that brains, not brawn, wins wars.

My only hope is that more people see Glory because it is one of those rare films that accomplishes, with utter poignancy I might add, in demonstrating both what movies and, ideally, this country is made of.

This film deftly blends an array of fine performances, excellent camerawork, beautiful scenery, Robert Farnon's spirited musical score, and well- choreographed ship battle sequences into a brilliant work of art that will leave audiences - and fans of Forester's series - wanting to see it again.  An excellent choice!

I am visibly shaken by the feelings i experienced from watching it.  The only other movie that comes to mind as being absolutely essential to see would be Surviving Desire which is also a Hal Hartley Masterpiece.  Who is this genius and when can I meet him to thank him for changing my life??  Ever since I witnessed Martin Donovan's character Jude in Surviving Desire, I have been possessed with the will to live every moment of my life without pausing to think of how much pain I may experience from caring about someone or letting my feelings be known. Now, with Henry Fool I feel like Hartley has realized what he is best at and returned to what he knows is his best work. James Urbaniak is amazing! I hope to see him in many more movies. I have been so disillusioned by the so called critically acclaimed actors like Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro. It is so refreshing to see an actor like James Urbaniak. He gives me hope for the future. I am also happy to know that Hartley continues to work with Parker Posey. Henry Fool is my pick for Movie of the Decade!!!

Roman must takes measures into his own hands in order to flush out the true suspects behind this whole elaborate scheme. Taking all of the folks working for the Internal Affairs Department hostage, Roman decides to find out who are the culprits who set him up for murder in the first degree...Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey) is an expert in the field of negotiating who must find a way to work out a reasonable truce with Roman before violence precipitates and disaster occurs...The Negotiator zeroes in on-target with suspense sustained throughout the film. Of course, The Negotiator is made to be even more believable with a morose sense of humor. The late J.T. Walsh (Breakdown) is right on the money as a wisecracking, curse-spouting, obstinate Internal Affairs Officer Niebaum. Niebaum may or may not be embroiled in this shameful money laundering some boys in blue have committed. Other humorous bits include Roman disparaging a novice negotiator, for all the faulty he has done.The Negotiator has detailed layers of characterization that are conveniently built. The character angles are fine and each performer gives an individual personality, inserting mood and emotion into each of the players. Samuel L. Jackson delivers a powerhouse performance as a once heroic hostage negotiator turned hostile hostage taker. Kevin Spacey is persuasive as the brave soul who must risk going against the authorities' wishes just to negotiate his own probable truce. Perhaps Spacey may even switch allegiance...The pressure never mitigates in The Negotiator. The intensity grows as each character, especially the hostages determine their fate...and prey that they may survive and the ordeal will end. The rules of engagement, the nuts and bolts of handling a hostage situation are fairly played out well and there are plenty of interesting, didactic footnotes on handling these quandaries involving human lives. This film is not without its faults of course. The Negotiator plodded for too long and 20 minutes or so of this movie's content could have at least been edited out here and there. Also, the advertisements for The Negotiator are often misleading, protruding this film as a high speed chase. However, this motion picture works a lot better as a drama and especially a murder mystery. The audience never finds out who the real killer(s) is\/are until the absolute end!The Negotiator is a superbly strong thriller with rapid fire punches creating every single beat. The visceral feeling of the sweat and nervousness of the main characters in The Negotiator can also be vicariously felt in the audiences as well. This film is achieved as a poignant drama for the characterization is unforgettable, the direction is taut, and the surprises are unexpected.

Being Dutch-speaking It had taken me some time to get to grips with Nabokov's book (still one of my favourite books of all time). The movie is in my opinion the best possible adaptation of the book. This doesn't mean the movie is perfect, far from. But it's as good as book adaptations come. The cast is nearly perfect. Especially Jeremy Irons, who is appropriately tragic and funny, and newcomer Dominique Swain (most people will remember her as the teenage daughter in Face off) as Lolita. The movie is very much like Nabokovs novel a combination of a love story, a tragedy and a lot of Irony and sarcasm. There  is one fatal flaw in this film though, which stops it from getting a 10 mark from me. The ending. The overly theatrical death scene of Quilty. While (like the rest of the movie) following closely to Nabokovs very words (the playing piano...) it should have either been a lot more (sarcasm) or a lot less theatrical. Still that's not enough to spoil a truly great film.Now as you may have seen I'm Belgian. Remember, Belgium is the country that started all this paedophilia witch hunts. So when (surprisingly) the movie opened here, I saw a review in one of Belgium's most important weekly mags (Humo) who were furious about this film. (and gave it zero out of four possible stars). There main reasons were these one you don't make this sort of movie post-dutroux(The belgian child molester), second you don't remake a kubrick movie. There was no word on Nabokov's book or even the movie itself. I was furious. First of all their two reasons for destroying this film are invalid the movie was greenlighted quite some time before the dutroux-scandal and it's not I repeat NOT a remake of a Kubrick film. It's an adaptation of one of the greatest works of fiction of the 20th century! I hope people will dare to see this for what it is and not for what they think it is. And I also hope the Oscar voters dare to nominate it . There are at least two spots more than deserving of an Oscar best actor (Irons) and best adapted screenplay.
