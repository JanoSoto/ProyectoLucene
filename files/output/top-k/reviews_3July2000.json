[{"date":"3 July 2000","score":"","review":"  If you see the Farrelly Brother's Outside Providence looking for more of the gross-out style humor you saw in Something About Mary or are currently seeing in Me, Myself and Irene you're going to have to look elsewhere.  Outside Providence is a coming of age type movie with little in the way of gross out and more in the way of story.  It concerns the trials and tribulations of young Timothy Dumphy, who is shipped off to an exclusive private boarding school by his father after an arrest on a drug and drink filled night with friends.  Shawn Hatosy plays Tim (his dad has a less than flattering nickname of a sex toy for him).  This is a good portrayal of a young man who is growing up and learning life's lessons.  His younger brother Jackie (played by Timothy Bone) is in a wheelchair after a touch football accident (the explanation is hysterical) and is dependent on Tim driving him around to do his paper route. Tim is a good character, hard to dislike him and as the central character he remains constantly interesting.  Alec Baldwin plays Old Man Dumphy, and as a blue collar working class guy is great.  Wonderful personalization and sounds so much like my father it's frightening.  This was a nice return for Alec, and he plays a surprisingly strong supporting character.The lovely Amy Smart plays Jane Weston, the object of Tim's affections at school.  She is the main turning point in Tim's life and this character has a pivotal role in his outcome.  Smartly played (no pun intended) Amy.  I like you more and more every role you do.  Supporting cast is good. Jonathan Brandis and George Wendt are about the only names you'll recognize, but Jon Abrahams as Drugs Delany (Tim's closest friend) is a nice sideman.  Loads of fun to be had by this bunch. Outside Providence was a good changeup to follow Mary, but was done in by the from the people who brought you.... bit.   Had it stood on it's own merits, Providence would have been better received in my opinion.

When a young black man is killed outside of a restaurant by the son of wealthy businessman, NYPD cop John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) takes him down; but the kid, Wade, (Christian Bale), gets bail, then proceeds to skip to Switzerland for the next two years.  Meanwhile, the only witness to the murder, a waitress named Diane (Toni Collette), disappears.  When Shaft gets a tip that Wade is coming back to town, he makes it his business to see that justice is done, and meets him at the airport.  When Wade gets bail again, Shaft resigns from the force, to take the matter into his own hands, and to do it on his own terms.  First, he has to find Diane; without her, they have no case.  During his pursuit, he runs afoul of drug lord Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), whom Wade has hired to kill Diane.  Making things even more difficult for Shaft are two wrong cops (Dan Hedaya, Ruben Santiago-Hudson), who are in league with Peoples.  But Wade and Peoples soon find out they have their hands full dealing with Shaft, who is backed in his play by Uncle John (Richard Roundtree), and Carmen (Vanessa Williams), another of NYPD's finest. Jackson is outstanding as Shaft, a role that it seems he was born to play. He plays Shaft as one cool, in-your-face, intimidating you-know-what; savvy and fearless.  This is one guy you do not want to get on the wrong side of. He's got the attitude, the manner, the whole package, and it all adds up to total credibility.  Bale, as well, is excellent as Wade, to whom he lends a subtle, almost psychotic bravura, which aptly demonstrates his versatility as an actor.  Another notable performance is turned in by Wright, who brings just enough menace to Peoples, without overplaying a role that would've been easy to take over the top.  A lot of credit has to go to John Singleton, who doesn't miss a beat here.  He knows this territory, and it shows; he captures the language, rhythms, and mood of the environment with which he's dealing perfectly, and keeps it all moving right along.  Collette does well with her Diane, a pivotal, but rather minor character.  She doesn't have a lot of screen time, but makes the most of it when she's on; her fear, and the anxiety wrought of her situation, is palpable. The supporting cast includes Busta Rhymes (Rosen), Josef Summer (Fleming), and Philip Bosch (Mr. Wade).  There's something satisfying about watching Shaft do his thing; a self-assuredness and lack of political correctness he employees in the pursuit of real justice that is refreshing to behold. Most importantly, `Shaft' delivers on it's promise of action, and plenty of it, and with the added benefit of having story enough to support it. Singleton and Jackson definitely deliver the goods in this one, and of course there's the familiar Isaac Hayes theme on hand to underscore the proceedings, and it's every bit as effective now as it was in the original version.  If you want to get the adrenalin pumping, check this one out.  I guarantee you'll be glad you did.

We need men to catch those fish. Who's going to do it? You, Marky Mark? You're not a fisherman. You don't even know what you want.I want to fish!You can't handle the fish!With awful dialogue lifted from cut scenes of the last five years of military dramas, The Perfect Storm is a pathetic story told by idiots, full of storms and furies, signifying nothing. It is a tortuous experience to watch, as every time a character opens their mouth something horrible, cliched, and melodramatic comes out. I found myself cringing when I knew dialogue was imminent.The Perfect Storm is about a group of fisherman from Gloucester, Massachusetts who keep coming up short on their swordfish hauls. At their Captain's request they choose to go out again for one last time in late October, the beginning of storm season. What they didn't know is that three storm systems were converging in a meteorological phenomenon. These storms collide behind them as they cross the Great Banks, sealing them off from home. They go out further than they should, get a huge haul of fish, and turn around into the mouth of the colossus. Their friends and family back at home drink themselves silly while waiting for any news.George Clooney plays Billy Tyne, Captain of the Andrea Gail, the doomed ship. At one point Tyne barks at Mark Wahlberg's Bobby Shatford character that's an order! I just want to clarify something here when you are called Captain on a commercial swordfish boat, you're not really a Captain in the military use of the title. You've got the license, you've got the lease on the boat, and sure, it's your ship to pilot and steer. But don't let it get to your head. You're not a real Captain. Your crew of miscreant, drunken fisherman aren't going to follow your orders in a chain of command. Why? Because they're fisherman, not soldiers. In fact, you're more the equivalent of a breakfast cereal mascot in that you both can be addressed as Cap'n.There could have been a good story here, but the writer blew it. I have not read Sabastian Junger's book, even though it was a bestseller and apparently made its GQ (both looks and substance) author famous. I can tell you that the screenplay that Bill Wittliff adapted from it is drain clog material. Not only are the characters, dialogue, and relationships entirely contrived and laughably stupid, but the execution of these people by the actors and director Wolfgang Petersen is vacuous and retarded. I have to make a distinction here, in that the film jumps back and forth between action at sea and drama at home. The drama at home was mindless drivel and a complete waste of time. The action at sea, including the Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technicians' rescue of a sailing vessel, is exciting and directed with oceanic action expertise (Petersen is after, the man behind Das Boot). However, the contrite, empty, cliched dialogue between Clooney, Wahlberg, and the rest of the dramatic cast (including their respective romantic interests) lacks any compulsion or interest enough to sustain it through the half of the film that it occupies. The story at sea is a complete fiction, so there can be no excuse that the authors did not have complete creative license to tell whatever story they wanted of these fishermen. The only facts on record would be a brief, stuccato radio communication and then a lot of silence.The Coast Guard rescue is a subplot, a tip of the hat in honor of their actions and courage while also underlining the severity of the storm. Most of what I got from this small portion of the film is that if you ever need to be out at sea, the Coast Guard has the best gadgets for survival and rescue. In fact, forget life preservers. Just get yourself a Coast Guard special unit. They can inflate a six man raft out of a pocket on their jump-suit, they can swim over 50 foot waves, and they can see a mile in whipping rain. I assume in a pinch they can ride tandem dolphins like Aquaman. It seems that in an effort to be kind to the memory of these fishermen and the community, the filmmakers wanted to concentrate on the love the characters had for their friends and family. This was nauseating. Far too long is spent on these (barely even) two dimensional characters. I have absolutely no interest in the new apartment Bobby has waiting for him. I can empathize with his character being torn between going out on one more run and the money it brings in against staying at home with his girlfriend who has harbinger dreams; but then I'm done. I don't need a fifth of the film devoted to these beer swilling people. Give me enough material to attach to them, not long enough to notice the facial hair inconsistencies.We're given a couple scenes with a weatherman in Boston who explains the storm system with Pictionary level intelligence and finger pointing. Unfortunately, the appearance of Christopher McDonald in any dramatic role, even TV weatherman, is a sign of doom. He's campy - by accident. I remember him on the Tracy Ullman show and finding him car-salesman smug. It just got sillier when he started dancing well. At any rate, this could have been the meat of their story a la the excitement of Twister's weather hounds, but this was wholly overlooked in favor of misty shots of Bobby Shatford's fiancee and mother.I would have liked to see a real explanation of the weather system that was happening; that is an El Nino front causing multiple vortices and colliding systems resulting in an explosive and rare weather phenomenon. There is only one beauty pass of the camera flying into the hurricane, but this should have been expanded and brought back in detail. If Industrial Light + Magic were going to spend the time developing a fluid dynamic system to produce the massive waves and then add particle effects to mimic blowing white cap effects, and then go so far as to model and detail hurricane behavior then why on earth wouldn't they make a film that exploited this visual excitement?Secondly, hundreds of thousands of people make their living as fishermen at sea. This is rarely shown in films, other than as background scenery while cops shoot at each other through fishmonger kiosks. I would like to have seen more of the fishermen and their trade. I enjoyed the parts of the film where the crew was working, baiting, and fishing. In fact, even the parts I didn't necessarily like would appeal to people who like to fish. Big fish catching is very popular, otherwise there wouldn't be ESPN shows about it. I didn't need more than ten minutes to set up the relationships of the fishermen at home (instead of the thirty five minutes the film took). Take your main cast out to sea and concentrate on the life of the merchant fisherman. Cook up your weather system details, hell - even give local TV news a taste of Hollywood effects treatment with shots of the maps behind the weather people exploding in detail.Get the fear factor going through detailed explanations of what we know is about to happen to our heroes, kind of like Quint's stories in Jaws that make the whole experience more frightening. Then, WHAM! the storm hits and you shove your audience into the tandem stories of the Coast Guard rescue and fisherman fighting their way back home.This movie, billing itself as an action drama, fails miserably at its drama and scuttles its action by having no story. I hated the way the actors worked with each other. None of the rapport between Clooney and Wahlberg was allowed to come through the disgusting dialogue. Bill Fichnter and John C. Reilly's loggerheads was a poorly constructed and therefore useless diversion. The music by James Horner was completely inappropriate and excruciating. The times that the movie became exciting and interesting, the score was wholly unpleasant.The Perfect Storm is simply a perfectly bad movie.

I have to make a distinction here, in that the film jumps back and forth between action at sea and drama at home. The drama at home was mindless drivel and a complete waste of time. The action at sea, including the Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technicians' rescue of a sailing vessel, is exciting and directed with oceanic action expertise (Petersen is after, the man behind Das Boot). However, the contrite, empty, cliched dialogue between Clooney, Wahlberg, and the rest of the dramatic cast (including their respective romantic interests) lacks any compulsion or interest enough to sustain it through the half of the film that it occupies. The story at sea is a complete fiction, so there can be no excuse that the authors did not have complete creative license to tell whatever story they wanted of these fishermen. The only facts on record would be a brief, stuccato radio communication and then a lot of silence.The Coast Guard rescue is a subplot, a tip of the hat in honor of their actions and courage while also underlining the severity of the storm. Most of what I got from this small portion of the film is that if you ever need to be out at sea, the Coast Guard has the best gadgets for survival and rescue. In fact, forget life preservers. Just get yourself a Coast Guard special unit. They can inflate a six man raft out of a pocket on their jump-suit, they can swim over 50 foot waves, and they can see a mile in whipping rain. I assume in a pinch they can ride tandem dolphins like Aquaman. It seems that in an effort to be kind to the memory of these fishermen and the community, the filmmakers wanted to concentrate on the love the characters had for their friends and family. This was nauseating. Far too long is spent on these (barely even) two dimensional characters. I have absolutely no interest in the new apartment Bobby has waiting for him. I can empathize with his character being torn between going out on one more run and the money it brings in against staying at home with his girlfriend who has harbinger dreams; but then I'm done. I don't need a fifth of the film devoted to these beer swilling people. Give me enough material to attach to them, not long enough to notice the facial hair inconsistencies.We're given a couple scenes with a weatherman in Boston who explains the storm system with Pictionary level intelligence and finger pointing. Unfortunately, the appearance of Christopher McDonald in any dramatic role, even TV weatherman, is a sign of doom. He's campy - by accident. I remember him on the Tracy Ullman show and finding him car-salesman smug. It just got sillier when he started dancing well. At any rate, this could have been the meat of their story a la the excitement of Twister's weather hounds, but this was wholly overlooked in favor of misty shots of Bobby Shatford's fiancee and mother.I would have liked to see a real explanation of the weather system that was happening; that is an El Nino front causing multiple vortices and colliding systems resulting in an explosive and rare weather phenomenon. There is only one beauty pass of the camera flying into the hurricane, but this should have been expanded and brought back in detail. If Industrial Light + Magic were going to spend the time developing a fluid dynamic system to produce the massive waves and then add particle effects to mimic blowing white cap effects, and then go so far as to model and detail hurricane behavior then why on earth wouldn't they make a film that exploited this visual excitement?Secondly, hundreds of thousands of people make their living as fishermen at sea. This is rarely shown in films, other than as background scenery while cops shoot at each other through fishmonger kiosks. I would like to have seen more of the fishermen and their trade. I enjoyed the parts of the film where the crew was working, baiting, and fishing. In fact, even the parts I didn't necessarily like would appeal to people who like to fish. Big fish catching is very popular, otherwise there wouldn't be ESPN shows about it. I didn't need more than ten minutes to set up the relationships of the fishermen at home (instead of the thirty five minutes the film took). Take your main cast out to sea and concentrate on the life of the merchant fisherman. Cook up your weather system details, hell - even give local TV news a taste of Hollywood effects treatment with shots of the maps behind the weather people exploding in detail.Get the fear factor going through detailed explanations of what we know is about to happen to our heroes, kind of like Quint's stories in Jaws that make the whole experience more frightening. Then, WHAM! the storm hits and you shove your audience into the tandem stories of the Coast Guard rescue and fisherman fighting their way back home.This movie, billing itself as an action drama, fails miserably at its drama and scuttles its action by having no story. I hated the way the actors worked with each other. None of the rapport between Clooney and Wahlberg was allowed to come through the disgusting dialogue. Bill Fichnter and John C. Reilly's loggerheads was a poorly constructed and therefore useless diversion. The music by James Horner was completely inappropriate and excruciating.

We need men to catch those fish. Who's going to do it? You, Marky Mark? You're not a fisherman. You don't even know what you want.I want to fish!You can't handle the fish!With awful dialogue lifted from cut scenes of the last five years of military dramas, The Perfect Storm is a pathetic story told by idiots, full of storms and furies, signifying nothing. It is a tortuous experience to watch, as every time a character opens their mouth something horrible, cliched, and melodramatic comes out. I found myself cringing when I knew dialogue was imminent.The Perfect Storm is about a group of fisherman from Gloucester, Massachusetts who keep coming up short on their swordfish hauls. At their Captain's request they choose to go out again for one last time in late October, the beginning of storm season. What they didn't know is that three storm systems were converging in a meteorological phenomenon. These storms collide behind them as they cross the Great Banks, sealing them off from home. They go out further than they should, get a huge haul of fish, and turn around into the mouth of the colossus. Their friends and family back at home drink themselves silly while waiting for any news.George Clooney plays Billy Tyne, Captain of the Andrea Gail, the doomed ship. At one point Tyne barks at Mark Wahlberg's Bobby Shatford character that's an order! I just want to clarify something here when you are called Captain on a commercial swordfish boat, you're not really a Captain in the military use of the title. You've got the license, you've got the lease on the boat, and sure, it's your ship to pilot and steer. But don't let it get to your head. You're not a real Captain. Your crew of miscreant, drunken fisherman aren't going to follow your orders in a chain of command. Why? Because they're fisherman, not soldiers. In fact, you're more the equivalent of a breakfast cereal mascot in that you both can be addressed as Cap'n.There could have been a good story here, but the writer blew it. I have not read Sabastian Junger's book, even though it was a bestseller and apparently made its GQ (both looks and substance) author famous. I can tell you that the screenplay that Bill Wittliff adapted from it is drain clog material.

It also helps that director John Dahl basically casts to the point where he doesn't even NEED to direct, he can just sit back and let the cast take hold of the material.The real beef of the film comes then in the scenes between Damon and Norton, who take good material and make it almost like it could be material for a play on a stage, with a solid conflict that makes good drama (love the dialog). There's also a couple of really terrific scenes between Damon and Martin Landau as a judge, one of those 'old man breaks it down for the young guy' kind of scenes in films that's done without over-doing it. And in general there's a nice rhythm put in place to the film by director Dahl; nothing is too forced, everything happens rather naturalisticlly, and it ends on a great, great note with Malkovich turning in one of his best as Teddy KGB. So, I would recommend it perhaps more than when I first wrote in my review great performances save this movie.

The movie starts with an intriguing premise. Mel is a guy who doesn't want to fight because he has personal demons from the past, and is a single parent raising a large family.  Obviously, at some point the British push him too far, and he gets Revolutionary on their red-coated behinds.  There is a very well done, hair-raising rescue\/ambush scene which kind of sets up that the movie won't just be a simple revenge melodrama, but that Mel's war will really be one about overcoming personal demons, and holding his family together.But just as quickly, they toss all this good setup out the window.  It becomes a simple revenge melodrama.  They tick off Mel, and he grabs his monogrammed tomahawk and turns into the terminator.  Now I like these kind of movies too, so I was prepared to shrug my shoulders, relax and see a dumb summer action movie.But then they don't do this right either.  The movie devolves into a series of extremely violent but hokey situations, fakey relationships, cliches galore, and trite attempts at tying up all the plot's loose ends.  The worst thing about this, is that it's all done in the name of historical accuracy.The film, IHMO, is *not* historically accurate at all.  And I'm not saying that as a stickler for getting a proper history lesson at the expense of seeing a good movie.  I like dumb action movies as much as the next guy. But the story is so cliched and manipulative that the what little historical accuracy is achieved on the part of the Smithsonian-advised production designers\/costumers (etc) is wasted on situations that are totally implausible.For example, Mel's slaves are conveniently freedmen working for wages. Joely Richardson's plantation slaves are very accurately costumed, but seemingly happy (yes happy!), and only exist in the film so the British can blow them away (to alert the main characters that they're in danger, kind of like the pack-bearers in a Tarzan movie who get killed off so the main characters know to duck).Finally, Mel's family escapes to a real place, Gullah island, populated by escaped slaves (real-life historical reenactors who sing Gullah-dialect songs and practice traditional Gullah crafts).  All this historical accuracy is a bust, because when Mel's family arrives, none of the islanders even asks what a bunch of white slaveowners are doing in their village, or who the heck they are!  All they do is provide happy, singing local color, and imply that America was racially harmonius and united against the British.  But mostly, Gullah island is just like the Ewok village in Return of the Jedi.  I kid you not!And how come the movie takes place over 7 years time, but at the end, Mel's kids haven't aged a day?  How come a bunch of swamp-based guerilla fighters always seem dressed immaculately?  Especially Mel in his suit and starched collar?  And why do battles always take place at dawn or dusk, and the sun always backlights everyone?  And how come after he totally alienates his kids, they all suddenly love him because it's convenient to the plot?And the cliches!  The British are the usual bunch of stereotypical effeminate jerks.  There are three scenes in which British leaders are told bad news while being dressed or shaved.  Then they have a tantrum.  The evil villain has no depth.  All he does is kill stuff evilly.  If there were baby seals to club and whales to harpoon, he'd do it in each scene.SPOILER ALERThe even gets shot, and while seemingly dead, suddenly springs back to life to kill a major character.  Is this cliche?  Just rent Halloween 1,2,3,4; Friday the 13th 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 & 8; and all the Freddy Kruger movies to find out!  Oh yeah, and Mel pulls the same move later on.  Twice in one movie. Yecch.ANOTHER MINOR SPOILER ALERTAnd the worst thing that happens in the Patriot, is that LOTS of people die (probably a higher body count than the actual war).  Mel loses half his family.  A guy loses his wife and child so he blows his brains out.  An entire church full of the guerilla fighters' loved ones is burned to death. Yet at the end, everyone is way too happy, AS IF NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED! Un-freakin-believable.  And the attitude of the film makers is see, you're seeing something really profound and moving.  No I'm not!  I'm just seeing a blah action movie with characters who use Freddy Kruger-Fu in lieu of intelligence or a good plot.There are so many more problems like this, they are beyond counting. There are so many, no matter how much I wanted to like the Patriot, I couldn't ignore them.

","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"3 July 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I had high hopes for the Patriot coming into the film, but was disappointed after the first 30 minutes.  The movie starts with an intriguing premise. Mel is a guy who doesn't want to fight because he has personal demons from the past, and is a single parent raising a large family.  Obviously, at some point the British push him too far, and he gets Revolutionary on their red-coated behinds.  There is a very well done, hair-raising rescue\/ambush scene which kind of sets up that the movie won't just be a simple revenge melodrama, but that Mel's war will really be one about overcoming personal demons, and holding his family together.But just as quickly, they toss all this good setup out the window.  It becomes a simple revenge melodrama.  They tick off Mel, and he grabs his monogrammed tomahawk and turns into the terminator.  Now I like these kind of movies too, so I was prepared to shrug my shoulders, relax and see a dumb summer action movie.But then they don't do this right either.  The movie devolves into a series of extremely violent but hokey situations, fakey relationships, cliches galore, and trite attempts at tying up all the plot's loose ends.  The worst thing about this, is that it's all done in the name of historical accuracy.The film, IHMO, is *not* historically accurate at all.  And I'm not saying that as a stickler for getting a proper history lesson at the expense of seeing a good movie.  I like dumb action movies as much as the next guy. But the story is so cliched and manipulative that the what little historical accuracy is achieved on the part of the Smithsonian-advised production designers\/costumers (etc) is wasted on situations that are totally implausible.For example, Mel's slaves are conveniently freedmen working for wages. Joely Richardson's plantation slaves are very accurately costumed, but seemingly happy (yes happy!), and only exist in the film so the British can blow them away (to alert the main characters that they're in danger, kind of like the pack-bearers in a Tarzan movie who get killed off so the main characters know to duck).Finally, Mel's family escapes to a real place, Gullah island, populated by escaped slaves (real-life historical reenactors who sing Gullah-dialect songs and practice traditional Gullah crafts).  All this historical accuracy is a bust, because when Mel's family arrives, none of the islanders even asks what a bunch of white slaveowners are doing in their village, or who the heck they are!  All they do is provide happy, singing local color, and imply that America was racially harmonius and united against the British.  But mostly, Gullah island is just like the Ewok village in Return of the Jedi.  I kid you not!And how come the movie takes place over 7 years time, but at the end, Mel's kids haven't aged a day?  How come a bunch of swamp-based guerilla fighters always seem dressed immaculately?  Especially Mel in his suit and starched collar?  And why do battles always take place at dawn or dusk, and the sun always backlights everyone?  And how come after he totally alienates his kids, they all suddenly love him because it's convenient to the plot?And the cliches!  The British are the usual bunch of stereotypical effeminate jerks.  There are three scenes in which British leaders are told bad news while being dressed or shaved.  Then they have a tantrum.  The evil villain has no depth.  All he does is kill stuff evilly.  If there were baby seals to club and whales to harpoon, he'd do it in each scene.SPOILER ALERThe even gets shot, and while seemingly dead, suddenly springs back to life to kill a major character.

So we put on make-ups, perfume, designer dress, IKEA furniture to define ourselves and to portrait an image of ourselves that we want other people to see.  Ironically, our society cannot function without all these phony smiles and bogus outlooks.When asked what we want to become in grade school, we all said we want to be professors, doctors, dentists, accountants, and lawyers.  But the reality is our society doesn't need 50,000 professors, doctors, lawyers and such. Someone has to clean the street, handle the garbage, wait the table.  We are brought up thinking we will all be rich and famous and not the inevitable that some of us, a good portion of us to be exact, will fail to be anything of any significant purpose.Some people might envy the condo life (I do) Norton has in the movie but Fight Club told us that Norton is actually a member of the bottom pillar of the society (all condiments and not food).

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 July 2000","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"    Here is the ultra-simplified American history for the MTV generation.  The Patriot is a movie that essentially takes the entire American Revolution with all its complex motivations and political nuances, and boils it all down into a revenge plot.  It's almost amusing to see how the movie tries to struggle free of this notion, as it offers up some simplified images of glory and honor, while all the while the lead character's motivation is essentially the same to kill his nemesis.   That's not to say The Patriot is all bad.  Once you get past all the (literal) flag-waving and glorified American perspectives on the Revolutionary War, its actually pretty involving.  I found myself drawn into its story almost against my will.  It's a credit to Roland Emmerich, the director, and the screenplay, that the movie succeeded at making me care about Gibson's quest for justice even as I couldn't help rolling my eyes as he grabs an American flag and charges up a hillside to rout the fleeing rebel troops to turn around and press forward.   The process by which Gibson gets there is a long and dark journey.  His character, Benjamin Martin, is a farmer and dedicated family man with a South Carolina plantation where he simply wants to harvest his crops and live in peace.  He is a highly respected hero of the French-English War years ago but has decided that war should never be used, even as a last resort, and is willing to sacrifice principle to this cause, as he lectures on in a speech he makes before a voting council that must decide on whether or not to join the revolution.  The movie opens in 1776 as the Declaration of Independence is about to be announced.  Martin's oldest son, Gabriel, signs on with the Continental army against his father's wishes, and goes off to war, where he fights for two years and becomes battle-hardened but loses none of his idealism.   The same cannot be said of the rebels themselves, whose morale begins to falter as they suffer one defeat after another.  The decisive battles in the war were not won on the traditional battlefield, and the untrained and ill-equipped militia forces are cannon-fodder for the stalwart British.  Eventually, Martin is compelled to join the fight when one of his young sons is killed by a vicious British officer named Tavington, who chooses to use fear and repression to crush the revolt, and employs brutal tactics to accomplish this goal.  Martin gathers a ragtag bunch from the surrounding towns and forms a militia of his own, that hides out in the swamp and uses hit-and-run tactics to catch the British off-guard.  Ultimately his goal is to search and destroy Tavington.   The British are portrayed as either weak-minded or cruel, with the intent of making us feel a certain satisfaction when we see them being killed by muskets and hacked by tomohawks.  The guerilla tactics used by Martin to halt the flow of supplies are far more effective than the marching of the Continental troops into overwhelming fire from the enemy.  What's odd is the way the movie seems to be suggesting that Martin was the first one to come up with the idea, when by 1778 I imagine this idea had occurred to and even been used by George Washinton.  But the famous figures of the Revolution, including Washington, are never seen, and indeed are but shadowy figures in the movie while Martin leads his men into battle and more or less wins the war singlehandedly.  I admit I found it hard to believe at the film's climax when the battle slows to a crawl to allow Martin and Tavington to go at it, mano-e-mano.  This is all a sort of laughable revisionist history to embrace, but I was able to overlook it and just enjoy watching Gibson at work.  He has a way of seeming plausible in the face of such silliness, and even though his character exhibits similar traits to that of his portrayal of William Wallace from Braveheart (to which this movie will inevitably be compared) I still identified with his losses and his principles.  He brings a certain dignity to the role.  I also enjoyed seeing Chris Cooper as the weary commander of the Continental regiment he is aiding, and Heath Ledger as his impulsive son who joins them.     One complaint I would register is the way that the African-Americans in this movie are relegated to the position of mute observers.  If the movie had not shown blacks at all I might have preferred that to watching them be dismissed out of hand, but due to the prevalence of slavery in the Carolinas in that day that would hardly have been realistic.  There is one slave who joins Martin's band but his thoughts and motives aren't really explored.  While it is true that slaves who joined up were generally given their freedom at the end of the war, I felt as if this character was being used as a token, and it made me somewhat uncomfortable to watch as the movie tipped the race card.  Having watched Glory which revealed how black soldiers helped turn the tide of victory to the Union and treated its black characters with more dignity, this sort of pandering seemed superficial.  All this aside, The Patriot works on the level of pure entertainment, and I enjoyed it as such.  I also would not recommend it be shown in history class.

If the book had a different message, who cares.  Probably both are good.  The character of the kid kind of connected with me.  I don't have a lot of respect of authority with how my life has gone.  One of my English teacher's (not that anyone of you would know from Will. C Wood High School) Mr. Gary Kimsey, got me to open up and didn't judge me on the way that I thought.  He judged me on the content of my character.  We had great discussions, and I was a good student.  I am a troubled child even though I am now 18 and have graduated from Will. C. Wood High School. This teacher helped me understand what I was feeling.  I will remember him for the rest of my life.  I am sure the character Nick Stahl portrayed if he really existed would remember that teacher for the rest of his life.  The movie was done so well.  My situation was no where near as tragic as in the movie.  The only tragic part is that he is not my teacher anymore.  This movie really hit home for me.  But, unlike Chuck Norstadt, I want to become an actor and it doesn't seem as if anybody really believes I can pull off becoming a movie actor.  But he did.  Maybe I want to become an actor so I can be whoever I want to be, and not who someone wants me to be.  But, that's the major reason.  Not the money.  Another reason is I want to be the next Val Kilmer, or Al Pacino.  This movie deserves a 9 or 10. For me, maybe because it hits home.  I don't know if my teacher realizes how much of an impact he had on me.  But, I'll let him know next year when I visit him, and jam it into his head.

Just another vigilante-out-for-justice flick with uninspired dialogue, tepid pacing, dull action sequences,a disgusting use of race baiting, and one of the worst endings ever. John Singleton's new version of an old classic has the always cool, ultra-talented Samuel L. Jackson as a violent detective who is waging a war against anyone who does anything wrong to black people. Jackson is one of the best actors around and is especially good at playing bad motherf'ckers so it was a huge dissappointment that a character that he was born to play turned out to be a hypocrite with an indifference to white people and the centerpiece of this lousy film spewing lame lines and mowing down inept bad guys. Christian Bale gave the stand-out performance of the film(in my worthless opinion) as the primary villain, even though his role was a pretty bad stereotypical character. I felt sorry for his character by the end of the movie due to everything he had to go through. Enough has made about Jeffery Wright so I just say I liked his performance too. Vanessa Williams and Toni Collette were criminally under-used in thankless supported roles. But Buster Rhymes...I couldn't stand him.I hated him in Higher Learning(another bad Singleton movie) and I hated him even more here and if I listened to his music I'd hate that too.He was such an idiot talking like, Whuuut chuuu tawwwkin bout daauwg? For once I'd like to see a movie like this where the race roles were reversed, but of course it would labeled as a racist. Anyway lots of people liked and it made money so I guess it accomplished what it set out to do. Hopefully the sequels will have good scripts, better action sequences(something beside quick cuts of Shaft and the bad guys taking turns shooting at each other) and eliminate the racial under-currents.One more thing Racial tension is not a one-sided problem  anymore!It p***ed me off how almost all the characters who weren't black were pompous bigots and the blacks were shown at heroes even if they were just as bad.

Studios keep their films about dying mothers with cancer and families that have to put up with those alcoholic fathers and psychological journies into the porthole of someone's mind, until the snow is on the ground here in Canada and the Northern U.S.A.  Summer films on the other hand, would take those same premises and twist them around so that the dying mother with cancer would be just a minor subplot for when the giant asteroid comes crashing to earth, the alcoholic father would be murdered by his son only to come back as a blood thirsty zombie and the porthole into someone's mind would really just be a porthole into hell where Jason and Freddy and perhaps the Grmelins rule together.  Winter films are praised for being risque and intelligent while summer films are chastised for being silly and sell outs.  But look at most of the top money making films of all time and you will realize that they came out between May 2-4 and Labour Day weekend.  Jaws, Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones, Batman, Independence Day, Lethal Weapons, Jurassic Park, E.T. All are brawny summer films.  The one exception, of course is Titanic, which came out just before Christmas in 1997 but that was such a great film that you could have released it in March and it still would have grossed almost 2 billion dollars.The Perfect Storm is another example of the summer film.  This is a film that has very little box office drawing power going for it, except that giant wave.  Clooney, Wahlberg and company are not box office giants but Warner Bros had great confidence in the film, so much so, that it hired an A-list director and it saturated the market with trailers and other forms of advertisments.  All of this built the consumer up with great anticipation and we were all dying to see it.  This was the one summer film that I have been looking forward to since I first began seeing clips of it about four months ago.  Now the big question is, does it deliver?  And the answer to that is a resounding YES!I think we can skip the commentary and summation of the story because it really doesn't matter.  In a nutshell, a bunch of fisherman get caught up in the biggest storm ever recorded and they have to battle mother nature. Simple enough story but its what they did with it that makes the film so compelling.  It's also funny, I have always thought that George Clooney could read the barf bag on an airplane and still make it sound interesting. But in The Perfect Storm, his role could have been given to anyone and the film still would have been great.  That is not a discredit to him, it is a credit to the rest of the film and those behind the scenes that were involved in it.  Much like Twister, the actors and the story take a back seat to the events and the special effects.  ILM and Wolfgang Petersen should be lauded as heroes for their work in this film.  I don't really have much to compare it to but the illusion that you are really at sea with these people is really quite the achievement.  Giants waves come crashing into the Andrea Gail, winds blow water mercilessly onto the boat and wreak havoc on it's passengers.  Thunder and lightning are omnipotent on this journey as well.  I can honestly say that my emotions were taken for a ride.  I was exhausted when I left the theater.  Even though we don't know the guys to well, we know them well enough that we care what happens to them.  There is also two other great sub plots as three passengers, on a small sailboat are caught down south in the eye of the storm.  And we also have the story of the heorics displayed by the Coast Guard and the other rescue team that attempt to rescue the Andrea Gail but fails.The Perfect Storm has a slow first thirty minutes.  And that is acceptable because you have to introduce the cast and the conflict and try to get some kind of emotion involved here.  In the beginning, we are introduced to Bob Brown, the owner of the Andrea Gail.  Played by Michael Ironside, I was thrilled to see him back in the movies.  I enjoy his work and even giving him a small role like this one was a credit to the film.  I also enjoyed seeing Karen Allen of Indiana Jones fame back in the saddle.The Perfect Storm has everything going for it, a great cast, a veteran action director and a giant wave that has a thirst for blood.  This is a perfect summer film.  It may only win some technical Oscars but the fact that it will probably go on to be one of the three top films of the summer should be quite the consolation prize.  This film has the chance of breaking 400 million dollars in the world wide box office and that should be all the recognition it needs.8.5 out of 10.... The second best movie of the summer so far.  If you can't enjoy this film, there is always the winter coming up very shortly.  Jane Austin and Emma Thompson should probably have a movie produced by Merchant Ivory coming out in November or December, so don't fret.For the rest of us.

He never REALLY thought it was okay to kill people.  He exhibits a kind of insincerity which is all too widespread in academia.  And Rope plays out a fantasy which I am sure is also widespread in academia an acka who pretends to hold some radical thesis finds himself face to face with someone who really DOES hold it, and gets the shock of his life.

I'm sure he would have been a better director still if he'd broken with his theories more often.  (The old canard that artists shouldn't theorise about art is, after all, true.)  Hitchcck's one-shot technique works like a charm; Rope is one of his best, most compulsively watchable films; there's one minor but obvious flaw, but it has nothing to do with technique, or with the basic idea.The one problem is that Cadell manages to shrug off moral blame a little too easily.

When I popped this film into my VCR I was expecting an evening on the edge of my seat. Ha, not hardly. The beginning was OK (kinda).  Tom Ripley sits in for a friend at a piano performance, ending with a bang - lying to the parents of Dickie Greenleaf, a playboy who ran off to Italy.  He said that he knew good ol' Dickie, which, of course, he didn't. So Dickie's Dad talks him into going to Italy in order to talk Dickie into coming home.  Mr. Ripley accepts, begins to study things that Dickie likes, such as jazz, in order to befriend him more easily, and so on and so on and so on. Pretty much south from there, I was snuggled up in my chair yawning to death when WHOA! RED ALERT! HOLY FISH STICKS! WHAT THE HECK!

Just in case you're not I'll give it to you loud and clear, spoiler or no spoiler Each and every man in the film, from Peter, to Frederick, to Dickie, to Tom Ripley, was pictured as both queer and straight, AND SHOWN AS ACTING PERFECTLY NATURAL!!!

No heavy, needless violence, no sex, no really bad language, but superb acting & wonderful directing.

There are no egos hogging the screen here unlike with some so-called big stars who share the billing with other so-called stars.Redford has that playful innocence about him, the loveable urchin who needs a hug and some worldly advice. While Newman plays the relatively elder statesman with authority but with that radiant little grin that he is blessed with.Together they seem to reprise and update their Butch & Sundance roles but with a tad more fluidity this time. They don't have to try too hard to impress us unlike their first film together. There isn't a single flaw in this movie. I've tried to find one but failed, although I suppose if I really, really, really wanted to be picky I would say it was a bit too stagey.
