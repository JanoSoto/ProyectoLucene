I felt that it was a one-dimensional cartoon, the plot and ending were recycled about a thousand times over and it felt so 60's-ish. Even taking this into account, 'Scooby-Doo' the movie is a piece of c***, created solely to bring in some cash, not because the studio concerned (Warner Brothers) wanted to at least try to make a good movie. This is clearly shown by the choice of director, cast, etc. There are a few redeeming qualities, but they are swamped by the wretchedness of the rest of the film.Anyway, on to the 'plot'. I put 'plot' in inverted commas because it is as flimsy as the plot for your average Scooby-Doo cartoon. You see, Fred takes all of the credit for the Scooby Gang's successes and Daphne's sick of being a 'damsel-in-distress' (more on this later), so the gang split up, leaving Shaggy and Scooby to languish over the mystery van. Two years later, they are reunited by Mondavrious, who is worried by teens attending his amusement park turning into zombies. Much derring-do occurs before the real villain is suddenly introduced and is (predictably) defeated. I don't feel at all guilty about spoiling the plot by the way, because there's precious little TO spoil.Now, as a point of interest, the setting and also, the CGI. I don't usually mention the setting of movies, but the setting of Scooby-Doo is notable for it's cheap, neon, garish tackiness. It is at it's worst in the amusement park, where the garish colours, horrendous-looking CGI creatures, bright lights and the tackiness of all and sundry will make you a) fast forward b) become violently ill c) have an epileptic seizure. To sum up what the amusement park looks like, I'm just going to utter Marilyn Manson several times. While I'm on the subject of CGI, Scooby-Doo himself is horribly conceived and looks worse than the Scooby-Doo of lore.The acting is the best part of Scooby Doo, which is actually not saying that much. Linda Cardellini does a pretty good Velma, while Matthew Lillard has Shaggy's voice, look, facial expressions and personality down perfectly - even more praiseworthy considering that all he has to work with is a nonexistent CGI character. On the flipside, Freddie Prinze Jr., our washed-up one-dimensional pretty boy wannabe actor of the moment, screws up the role of Fred. I mean, how the hell do you screw up Fred?! He's MEANT to be bland and superficial! Truly remarkable. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, she looks hot as, that's for sure. Unfortunately, she misses Daphne's personality completely, instead preferring to act like Buffy. She even participates in a laughable catfight with several men, but that's more the fault of the script. Her turn as a damsel-in-distress is truly unbelievable, even more so if you know about her martial arts skills. Also, what the hell is Rowan Atkinson doing in this movie? He is kind of amusing, but then again, he's amusing in just about everything he's in.I'm going to load my conclusion with a list of Scooby clichés, which suits the movie and indeed, the entire franchise, since it is all so clichéd. So to sum up then, this is 'Scooby-Poo'. A note to the studio that released this mess I would have been so much more content with life if it weren't for you meddling studio hacks. I guess (or I hope) that you're thinking 'Scooby-Don't'. Zoinks! You know what? You're right. To milk more money out of the movie-going public, they released another one. Jinkies! Rhat Really Rucks! Like I said earlier, there are a few good qualities here, just that they are buried underneath all of the other 'Doo'.1.5\/5 stars ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"10 January 2006","score":"","review":" Let me start this review by saying that, even when I was younger, I never really got into Scooby-Doo.

It is a spoof documentary, well Rockumentary, with film-maker Marty DiBergi (Reiner) following the career of heavy metal British rock band Spinal Tap through the years. The members are Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest, also writing) on lead guitar, David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean, also writing) also on lead guitar, Derek Smalls (The Simpsons' Harry Shearer, also writing) on bass, R.J. Parnell (Mick Shrimpton) on drums, and Viv Savage (David Kaff) on keyboards. It sees their rise to fame from the early 1960's to the present day with their magnificent music and impressive lyrics (not really). It also sees them preparing for their comeback tour to America, with their infamous eighteen-inch-high Stonehenge stage prop. Also starring June Chadwick as Jeanine Pettibone, Tony Hendra as Ian Faith, Bruno Kirby as Tommy Pischedda and Ed Begley Jr. as John 'Stumpy' Pepys, with cameos from Patrick Macnee as Sir Denis Eton-Hogg, Billy Crystal as Morty the Mime, Anjelica Huston as Polly Deutsch and Fred Willard as Colonel On Military Base. The band members are all wonderfully stupid, and even though they are rubbish at singing, accompanied by the music and amusing lyrics you can't help but like the songs. It is also a very well done satire of the rock industry itself, using all the music clichés available, and even being fictional, the film made the band so popular that they released albums for real. I admit I didn't get all the gags, but for the near-realistic documentary style, the characters, and of course the music, this certainly deserves to recognised as one of the best (fake) Rockumentaries ever made. It was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, and it was number 10 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!
