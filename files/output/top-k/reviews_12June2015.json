Speaking of which, this explains why The Flintstones is such easy prey to incessant panning &#x96; it's a movie based on a cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, does it work for what it is and the answer is a resounding yes! Movies should be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve. For instance, Godzilla is a colossal-creature movie and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original Apocalypse Now it's dreck, but how does it stack-up to other gigantic-monster movies? It's the same thing with The Flintstones. Roger Ebert criticized the film on the grounds that the story is confusing, not very funny, and kind of odd, given the target audience of younger children and their families. Do kids really care much about office politics, embezzlement, marital problems, difficulties with adoption, aptitude exams and mothers-in-law? For one thing, the film IS funny if you're familiar with The Flintstones and, more so, if you're a fan, which I am. I've seen the movie four times now and, without exception, laughed from beginning to end. Now the laughs may be more giggling at silly humor than uproarious laughter, but laughing nonetheless. As for the criticism that the story's confusing and misses the supposed target audience because of adult-oriented elements, this just shows that the target audience wasn't just kids. The Flintstones is for kids AND adults equally, which was true of the original cartoon as well, but more so with the movie, and I'm glad. The live-action version of Dudley Do-Right (1999) made the mistake of aiming solely for kids &#x96; real little kids -- and it seriously bombed and justifiably so because it's a complete dud. It's impossible to watch that movie as an adult and stay interested. The Flintstones doesn't make this mistake and that's why it was such a hit and remains thoroughly entertaining to this day.The cast is great, even Rosie O'Donnell as Betty (who I didn't think would work), but John Goodman as Fred is so good it's like the cartoon come to life!

My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The bottom line is that The Flintstones is entertaining from beginning to end for all the reasons noted above and it wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Sun Valley, California, and Snow Canyon State Park, Utah.GRADE A ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" While critics love to bash this live-action cinematic version of The Flintstones and the rating here at IMDb is surprisingly low, the movie was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because this is a great movie for what it is.

Yes, Lex Luthor is back as the villain of the week, and Nuclear Man is one of the stupidest villains I've ever seen. But, one thing sets this apart from the other entries in the series this is a Cannon film, with all that implies. Cannon Films are best known to me as the home of several of Chuck Norris' early titles, and they're known for schlocky, low-budget stinkers that are so bad they're good. While I wouldn't quite put SUPERMAN IV in that category, there are a number of elements that, given a bigger budget, could have made this an awesome film. Even still, it's very watchable and certainly more entertaining than SUPERMAN III.The basic plot has Superman campaigning for worldwide nuclear disarmament. There's also trouble at the Daily Planet as a rich businessman tries to take it over and turn it into a vehicle for sensationalism as opposed to real journalism. However, Lex Luthor is back on the scene and isn't about to let Superman eliminate a lucrative business and creates Nuclear Man to take him on.First, the good, which is actually more than you would think. The story this time is a marked improvement over the silly one in SUPERMAN III. Christopher Reeve has a story credit on SUPERMAN IV, and I have a feeling that he was instrumental in the direction the film took. Addressing nuclear disarmament and war profiteering (to a lesser degree) was\/is a timely subject, and particularly so in 1987 when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse. Granted, the bulk of this message is contained in two speeches that come off as straight-faced moralizing, but the fact that they tackled the issue at all is commendable. I also liked how Superman is treated as a more international hero than a purely American icon. Here we get to see Superman rescue people (who aren't Lois) in other countries besides the US. In terms of technical details, despite being a Cannon film the production values aren't too bad. Even the acting is perfectly fine (with one huge exception). In fact, most aspects of the production are acceptable except...The special effects, due to the low budget, are pretty awful. In particular, the flying sequences and fighting in space were very bad. Still, all of this is understandable when you consider who produced this film. What I didn't care for at all was Nuclear Man and Jon Cryer, who plays Lex Luthor's nephew. While he played a fun, quirky character in PRETTY IN PINK, Jon Cryer was absolutely risible here, and his character was annoyingly stupid. He also affects this accent which just adds to how much I hated the character. His presence made me long for Otis and Mrs. Teshmacher. Then there's Lex Luthor's latest creation, Nuclear Man, who his birthed when a missile carrying a strand of Superman's hair explodes in the sun. If that origin wasn't bad enough, his appearance was also ridiculous. Fortunately they had the foresight to dub Gene Hackman's voice over the muscle-bound non-actor who played Nuclear Man. The last thing I'll comment on is the length of the film. Basically, it could have stood to be a little longer and develop the high-minded themes that it dared to address.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how watchable SUPERMAN IV turned out to be. By no means would I consider this a good movie, but its heart is in the right place. It might have been hampered by a reduced budget, rendering the special effects more dated and cheesy than its predecessors, but the story and themes are an improvement from the overly silly SUPERMAN III.

And some weaknesses in the film still remain - such as Ryan Philippe, who is a bit limp despite being more than pretty enough for the role. But in so many other ways this is a far far better film, taking a film I'd only have rated maybe a 4 in the past, to at least a 7 now. About 40% of the film feels entirely changed, all for the better.

The parties are wild and bisexual and very disco. And the whole direction of the drama has been altered, now that the dull studio-imposed romance with Neve Campbell has been removed.

Quite a chore to sit through, this coming-of-age war drama from Steven Spielberg is completely devoid of his usual flair, remains monotonous in tone from start to finish & is pretty much unsure of what it even wants to be.Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, the story of Empire of the Sun is set during the Second World War in China and tells the story of Jamie; an English kid who after getting separated from his parents during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai ends up in an internment camp where he learns to survive despite the poor conditions & establishes a good living but when the war nears its end, so does his innocence.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens on a fine note by wonderfully introducing all its characters and while there are various indications that the story might pick up anytime now, that moment never really arrives. The whole story feels like a compilation of many episodes sewn together without any clear idea of what Spielberg intends the film to be, plus whatever emotion it was trying to evoke from its audience simply falls flat.Most of the technical aspects are sound in its execution but that part is a default option in a Spielberg feature. Production Design team does a brilliant job in putting up some authentic- looking models & set pieces, Cinematography nicely captures the surroundings & unfolding events but it also lacks the immersive dimension that invites the viewers into the story. And while John Williams delivers an expressive score, it only works in bits n pieces.Editing is disappointing for the story is way longer than it needs to be, isn't properly paced either & its 154 minutes of runtime is severely felt. Also, some sequences that made its way into the final cut should've ended up on the editing room's floor instead. The only thing that saves Empire of the Sun from being a complete disaster is the magnificent performance by Christian Bale in what is his on-screen debut & he's finely supported by John Malkovich.On an overall scale, Empire of the Sun is possibly about the loss of innocence but it travels in so many directions that it ends up halfway on everything it was trying to be. Its motive is unclear whether one approaches it as a coming-of-age story or a war drama. The only good thing about the film is that it brought on screen a promising talent who would later go on to become one of Hollywood's most sought actors but apart from that, Empire of the Sun has nothing interesting to offer.

Production Design team does a brilliant job in putting up some authentic- looking models & set pieces, Cinematography nicely captures the surroundings & unfolding events but it also lacks the immersive dimension that invites the viewers into the story. And while John Williams delivers an expressive score, it only works in bits n pieces.Editing is disappointing for the story is way longer than it needs to be, isn't properly paced either & its 154 minutes of runtime is severely felt. Also, some sequences that made its way into the final cut should've ended up on the editing room's floor instead. The only thing that saves Empire of the Sun from being a complete disaster is the magnificent performance by Christian Bale in what is his on-screen debut & he's finely supported by John Malkovich.On an overall scale, Empire of the Sun is possibly about the loss of innocence but it travels in so many directions that it ends up halfway on everything it was trying to be. Its motive is unclear whether one approaches it as a coming-of-age story or a war drama. The only good thing about the film is that it brought on screen a promising talent who would later go on to become one of Hollywood's most sought actors but apart from that, Empire of the Sun has nothing interesting to offer.

Many critics blamed it on the strange sexual fetishism that the film celebrated. I guess its just creepy, coming from Polanski. Perhaps it was to much to watch coming from a man with such a disgraceful past. But Bitter Moon is so good, at being so risqué. This is some pretty heavy erotica. The performance by Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner as the on-and-off, shagging couple is damn delicious. They just let it all hang out, and I mean that in the most literal sense. I loved seeing those two lusting over each other, then completely tearing each other apart in over-sexed rage. It's so over-the-top. A few things bring it down a bit. One, I have a problem with dogs involved in sexual acts.. I think this movie may have violated a code in the AHA. Also, Hugh Grant. Going into this, I had my hand hovering over the stop button, because of.. well, Hugh Grant. He's a terrible actor. It's that same shy but dashing British gentleman over and over. It kind of works here, since his role is so insignificant, but he can still get under your skin. The scenes on the boat also seem unnecessary next to the exquisite tale that Oscar spins. I think the movie would have been perfect, if it was just that sick love story, and nothing more. I really appreciated Polanski's effort. This is a little- known, but satisfying art-house film.

However, as the film grows on, it develops a certain tedium, and eventually becomes a redundant and repetitive film with an annoying lead performance.Woody Allen starts off as a brilliantly written character, with tons of neurotic quirks that make him unique. Jewish jokes aside, his comedic performance was very charismatic. However, an hour into the film, I found myself annoyed by the sound of his voice, and the frequency he would complained about the most mundane of things. This is where the shift into tedium begins, because this whole time I was wishing the film would end so I would no longer have to hear him talking. The same here goes for Diane Keaton, who I loved at first, but I eventually grew annoyed with as time went on. And their insistence on being annoying could've been intentional, there's no denying that, but that doesn't make it any less annoying, and it doesn't stop Woody Allen from type- casting himself in his own movie.One thing I can certainly compliment is the exquisite direction. I've always been a huge fan of long takes, making the feeling of the film more intimate, and this film features tons of those. There is a brilliant shot where, Woody and his friend are walking down the street, and we here them talking, but they're not yet in frame or just out of frame. As the shot and conversation continues, we see two individuals come down the street casually, and eventually we see this is Allen and his friend. The shot then continues and follows them where they're walking. It's brilliant, and in some scenes it even heightens the comedic value, especially in the scene when they're waiting in the line at the movie's with the film snob talking pretentiously behind them.There's no doubt here that the writing here is also very well done, until the third act, because in typical comedy fashion, it brings in the dramatic plot that you don't care about,and drops nearly all of the jokes, making it even more tedious than it already was. But nonetheless, there's lots of hilarious chemistry between Keaton and Allen, especially in the lobster scene, which I found to be one of the most genuinely written in the film. The characters talk quickly too, so reading the Oscar-winning screenplay is only that much better for helping you catch all of the jokes you might have missed. This film's winning of the Best Picture Oscar however emphasizes it's rather OK quality. Make no mistake, this is a well directed, well acted, and well written film until the third act comes in. But it's that third act that simply makes the movie OK. A bad ending is certainly worse than a bad beginning, because an audience member is more akin to remember a movie finishing bad, then starting good, and vice versa. This is a bit of a generic romcom the more I think about it, with a few artistic quirks. It's certainly not the worst Best Picture, that honor goes to either Driving Miss Daisy or Shakespeare in Love, but nonetheless, this is your typical overrated classic which people praise but don't watch.I recommend it to someone who's an Oscar completionist or somebody who just wants a quick laugh with an artistic edge, but anybody else, especially people who aren't already fans of Woody Allen, should stray away from this.

With Jurassic Park III, however, we now have two very capable films to compare this one to, and this, on top of several issues this installment bears, work to not only derail a franchise that had fairly solid footing in the ground but managed to defy odds to become one of the few defining films in American history for its special effects.Jurassic Park III can't manage to conjure up the same kind of danger that the original film did, nor the moodiness and the energetic cast of misfits of the second film. It plays like a theme park ride, with little sense of danger and a heavy sense of perfunctory happenings that simply occur in without much added spark of ingenuity or creativity behind them. Where Steven Spielberg had a method to his madness, and a terrific sense of buildup in both of his films, director Joe Johnston and writers Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne (yes, Election and Sideways Alexander Payne), and Jim Taylor simply stumble when trying to find a route to take with Jurassic Park III that works and breeds new life into material that's beginning to show signs of wear.We refocus on Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) of the first film, who is now refreshed with the events of Jurassic Park out of his mind. Despite saying he has no ambition to return to a life involving dinosaurs, Dr. Grant meets a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife Amanda (Téa Leoni), who cut him a blank check to give them an aerial tour of the island of Isla Sorna. He reluctantly agrees until, while on the plane, realizes that the Kirby's want to land on and explore the island, resulting in a plane crash that leaves the three of them, plus Grant's son Billy (Alessandro Nivola) and a handful of Kirby's men, stranded in a playground filled with dinosaurs. Worst of all, many of the dinosaurs are Pterodactyls, soaring menaces that hunt for prey on the ground before scooping them up and taking off without a trace.The Pterodactyls steal the show in this film, for they are the ones who are unpredictable, quick-witted, and more entertaining to watch than the group of misplaced actors on display. The Lost World had the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Vince Vaughn, all actors you wouldn't think would star in a Jurassic Park film, but somehow found their way onto the set and decided to make due with what they had. In turn, they turned into be a cast of likable character actors, making for one of the most surprisingly functional misfit casts I have yet to see.Jurassic Park III, on the other hand, is what happens when a series of actors find themselves working together and something feels off. It's not really an involvement thing, but there seems to be a general level of discomfort amongst the actors; actors like Macy and Leoni seem terribly out of place with a film like this, and no character, not even Grant, bears any likability throughout the course of the film. The original Jurassic Park had its share of empty characters, but at least devoted enough time to them to show that Spielberg and company were trying to provide audiences with an even balance of talking and action, whereas The Lost World found a way to more-or-less balance the dichotomy out to a rather effective level. Jurassic Park III can't seem to do either very convincingly; it's too busy trying to set up the next action sequence when it focuses on the characters and is too busy looking for an easy way out during the action sequences.Finally, there's the emotionally manipulative angle that comes up with this film too, particularly in the ending, which ties everything together with a very incredulous circumstance combined with cloying choral music to let us know that everybody involved is safe and sound. This kind of thing only works to soil the scope and power of the original film and the kind of dark, brooding atmosphere The Lost World bravely built. The special effects are still strong, only this time, merging CGI with animatronics leaves a bit of a hokiness to the dinosaurs, particularly the Velociraptor, which bears a feathery coat (while this may be more scientifically accurate, it looks messy and unbelievable on-screen). Where the other two films were creating a powerhouse franchise in film, Jurassic Park III is looking for a quick buck, and that part is evident from the cast choices, the writing, and the general feel, all of which feel significantly squandered and traded in for something convenient rather than daring.Starring Sam Neill, William H.

It's not really an involvement thing, but there seems to be a general level of discomfort amongst the actors; actors like Macy and Leoni seem terribly out of place with a film like this, and no character, not even Grant, bears any likability throughout the course of the film. The original Jurassic Park had its share of empty characters, but at least devoted enough time to them to show that Spielberg and company were trying to provide audiences with an even balance of talking and action, whereas The Lost World found a way to more-or-less balance the dichotomy out to a rather effective level. Jurassic Park III can't seem to do either very convincingly; it's too busy trying to set up the next action sequence when it focuses on the characters and is too busy looking for an easy way out during the action sequences.Finally, there's the emotionally manipulative angle that comes up with this film too, particularly in the ending, which ties everything together with a very incredulous circumstance combined with cloying choral music to let us know that everybody involved is safe and sound. This kind of thing only works to soil the scope and power of the original film and the kind of dark, brooding atmosphere The Lost World bravely built. The special effects are still strong, only this time, merging CGI with animatronics leaves a bit of a hokiness to the dinosaurs, particularly the Velociraptor, which bears a feathery coat (while this may be more scientifically accurate, it looks messy and unbelievable on-screen). Where the other two films were creating a powerhouse franchise in film, Jurassic Park III is looking for a quick buck, and that part is evident from the cast choices, the writing, and the general feel, all of which feel significantly squandered and traded in for something convenient rather than daring.Starring Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, and Alessandro Nivola. Directed by Joe Johnston.

It focuses on three young boys living in the suburbs and follows them for a few hours during one particularly chaotic day when one of their friends, a protester by the name of Abdel gets critically assaulted by the police.Kassovitz successfully manages to capture the feel and the bleak nature of life in these projects. The conditions that the boys of the neighbourhoods grow up in are completely unsuitable for children and the violence and chaos existing all around them after a point engulf them all whether they like it or not. Gyms getting damaged, schools getting burnt down and constant fighting with the police are part and parcel of the lives in these ghettos. Vinz, Said and Hubert are boys who also during their lives have been exposed to this violence and as a result they have also become violent, although Hubert is the most sensible among them. They constantly feel the need to act like badasses just to prove that they are brave and bigshots, although they are all boys who are pretending to be something they are not. The direction is stylish. The film is in black and white. A reason for that might be to show the hopeless nature of life in these projects where colour as a symbol of hope has not entered. Mathieu Kassovitz uses fast zooms, Raging Bull-esque slow motion and some other techniques which work well.The screenplay for the most part works well and I remained engaged. But during the last 30 minutes the story sort of lost its way a bit and lost the intensity that made everything that came before very captivating and the climax felt a bit contrived.The acting is very good and every one looks natural and at ease in front of the camera. Vincent Cassel deserves a special mention.La Haine is a very good film depicting the hardships that come along with living in the ghetto. While it may not be perfect, it certainly does manage to provoke the viewer to think about the world at large.

Stealing, lying and deceit top the list. These aspects are interwoven with a hero who says selfless things and who acts in kind ways. So, he's inspiring.

West Side Story and Grease are essentially the two I would rate, with the feasible exception of Camp Rock for nostalgic reasons. Grease stands the test of time because it isn't even set in the time period it was made. Set in the dazzling era of 1950s America, a time when many of the great aspects of teenage life truly began. Rock'n'roll was coming in, youngsters rebelled against their parents' ideology and thus the term 'teenager' began. Every generation likes to believe that theirs was or is the first to experience this, but only the adolescents of the 1950s\/60s can say it honestly.Grease encapsulates that beautifully by contrasting the leader of the T-Birds, Danny Zuko with the newly appointed Pink Lady, Sandy Olsson. As the plot unfolds, Danny has to find a window between being with Sandy who he has feelings for and maintaining his greaser reputation. This is addressed pretty early on in the film with the first inclination of it as a musical. Before Danny and Sandy even know they now attend the same high school, they brake into 'Summer Nights'. This is potentially my favorite of all the songs, even though there are some belters later on.

If you read my list of filmmaking influences, I'll tell you that Hitchcock was the man who inspired me to become a filmmaker. 5 years later, I decided to watch one of his films again. So I chose this one. After 5 years, It's actually even better the second time. Why do I like it? Well, let's tell the plot first.Brandon (John Dall) & Phillip (Farley Granger) had recently strangled their classmate, David (Dick Hogan) and stuffed him in their chest. Now is a great time to say that those for the faint of heart shouldn't watch this. In Brandon's words, he just committed 'the perfect crime' because he wants to prove that they're both superior than the rest of the world. So in order to test the perfection of the crime, they both set up a party for David's friends and family. However, they've become a bit worried about David's unusual 'absence'. Their tutor, Rupert (James Stewart), is also invited and while the party's going well, he begins to suspect that something could have happened to David. But the biggest question is Did they really commit the perfect crime? It's up to you to find out.Now normally, I would give out multiple reasons why I love the movie, but it's a first here as I'm going to give out only one reason why I love the movie. I will admit, it's interesting to see long takes and the performances are decent. But that's not why I love it. The reason I love it is that...It's more character-driven than you think. Rope may look simple in terms of visuals, but if you dig deeper, you start to find more under those 10-minute long takes. The dialogue is the part that relates to the story the most. It says everything about potential futures, problematic pasts, relationships, reflections, fear of going to jail, obsession with superiority, etc. This isn't a crappy 2014 blockbuster that just likes to say stuff instead of dialogue, This is a play-turned-movie that explores themes through dialogue. Most movies will express them through visuals, like Old Boy, but it's an accomplishment for a screenwriter to write dialogue that actually relates to something to do with the movie. To create dialogue that is interesting to listen to and something to think about sets a new level for writing a screenplay. The dialogue says everything about our characters and how they feel and with the long takes, they become raw and interesting. Especially with the parts where Rupert describes what would happen if David got murdered, where Ms. Wilson cleans up while everyone discusses David's disappearance and where Phillip sees the rope used for something and becomes afraid. That's really good story-telling and tells us more about our characters without becoming over-dramatic and becoming truly suspenseful to watch and with those final frames, you'll start to wonder how truly haunting this is. Rope is more than a technical achievement, it's also a storytelling achievement. In just one location, the screenplay explores themes that are expressed through dialogue and visuals. They work simultaneously to tell the most haunting and the most character- driven story Hitchcock has ever told. Everything is perfect from the camera-work to the dialogue. I give congrats to Hitchcock for his direction and screenwriter Arthur Laurents for his superb screenplay. It's a film I would be more than happy to watch again. This is one that deserves to be seen by any film lover and one who wants a deep psychological thriller. Go ahead and take a shot! You won't regret it.
