I was expecting some subtle but wonderful metaphysical theme.  What I got, though, was this muddled mess.I believe the word pretentious (not to mention self-indulgent and self-important) was created to describe this film.  I don't particularly care that the plot here is thin.  The plot of 2001 is thin, and yet, that is a brilliant motion picture, one of the absolute greats of all-time.  The difference, you see, is that Kubrick understood that there is a certain method to including large amounts of symbolic meaning in a film.  And the most important rule is that a director should never stray from the narrative content of the film for the purpose of an important symbolic concept.  A film is not an editorial.  It should be, in some sense, a story.  The conventional plot doesn't need to be large if there is a lot of symbolic content, but if the conventional plot is so lifeless and rambling that the film has no narrative flow, the symbolic plot will be lost in the process. I mean, 2001 doesn't have much plot or dialogue, but each image helps to tell an underlying story WHILE keeping the viewer involved in the conventional conflicts of the plot.This film, however, fails in this respect.  The first half of the picture is, apparently, a pretentious and lengthy introduction to Antonioni's message about the existential concept of reality.  We are shown this photographer in his empty, objective life.  But my God, we certainly do see him for a while before anything happens, don't we?  This film doesn't even exist until he goes to the park, and even then, the film is so vague and directed that we aren't even certain of the murder until the photographer tells us!  It would have been much better for us to see the murder clearly and then for the film to take that knowledge away from us, but then we wouldn't have the endless and repetitive scene in which he figures it out. Plus, did anyone not know that she was going to steal the pictures? (Presuming she did...)  Oh, and another note on the lack of pictures when he returned...if the film is trying to suggest that reality isn't what it seems to be, that this murder may never have happened, that this great existential mental conflict is unfolding before our very eyes and ears...how come there is obvious evidence that the pictures were there?  They were torn from the wall, but parts of them are left!  So they obviously WERE there, weren't they?  Just a thought...And finally, a note on the great existential finale...could the mimemobile be any MORE contrived?  Usually the term deus ex machina refers to a narrative solution, but I believe that the mimes are the straightfaced deus ex machina for the symbolic plot of this film.  They just drive by and start playing tennis, providing an excellent (and wonderfully convenient) statement about the nature of objective reality.  No reason for their being there, no point at all...  But it is well directed, and I guess that's all they ever really cared about anyhow...

Arye Gross is as excellent as ever as Jesse, the new owner of the house, and Jonathan Stark, best known for his voice abilities in animated shows, is without equal in his role as Jesse's quirky and weird friend Charlie.This movie will take you from the Wild West to the ancient Aztecs to the Crustaceous Period to the present time (October 30, 1986 in the movie). Charlie and Jesse get involved in one absolutely hilarious adventure after another. Like House I, this movie is horror with a comedy bent, and doesn't have the nudity, language, or extreme violence that categorized most horrors of the eighties. It's good, clean fun. Sure, there's a few long-dead guests, but they're basically harmless. Add to the thrill some humorous, and well-done, special effects, and some interesting new pets, and you've got a winner!If you enjoy House II, it would be worth your while to check out The Never-Ending Story -- they work on a similar bent of fantasy and comedic special effects to catch your interest.

They are foul mouthed, unlikeable in many cases, but every kid presented in this film is 10x more realistic than in any kid's movie you will see nowadays. Plain and simple, this film would not be made today. It is TOO realistic. Little league is just like this. Little league PARENTS are just like this. I think the film does an excellent job showing how the parents sometimes take the fun out of the game for the kids. Walter Matthau, Tatum O'Neal, Jackie Earle Haley, and especially the late Vic Morrow (coach of the Yankees) all turn in excellent performances. Not only that, but the film reaches some incredibly dramatic moments that catch you off guard. You're not supposed to like all the characters, but taken as an overall whole, The Bad News Bears is a movie in which the filmmakers really did their research. I think it gets underrated because it is a kids movie, but It is without a doubt one of the best movies in my collection.
