[{"date":"20 June 2014","score":"","review":" Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is in LA hosting his own TV show. Ghostface calls demanding to know where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone. Cotton refuses and becomes his murder victim. Sidney lives in seclusion. Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) is investigating Cotton's murder. Ghostface left a picture of Sidney's mother at the crime scene. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) goes to Hollywood where Stab 3 is being made with Dewey Riley (David Arquette) working as a technical adviser. Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) is the director. Ghostface starts killing people related to the movie even flushing Sidney out of hiding.This franchise is tired and lost the freshness of the self-referencing writing. The big addition is a doppleganger effect of the Stab cast and the real characters. Kevin Williamson is no longer involved in the writing. The jokes are half hearted. The Hollywood people make a lot of comments about the inside baseball. They even have Jay and Silent Bob make a cameo. And Randy Meeks comes back from the dead to describe the rules about trilogies which boils down to no rules at all. At least Wes Craven is back in the director's chair. It has devolved into a game of clue. I don't particularly like the convoluted explanation of Sidney's mother. The kills aren't exciting or compelling. The new Hollywood people might as well be cannon fodder. It would have been more poetic to have Cotton Weary as the killer. His killing is probably the high point of the movie. It's a weak end to the trilogy. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2014","score":"","review":" Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is in LA hosting his own TV show.
