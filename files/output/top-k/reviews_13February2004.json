That book, along with many others that I never had any interst in, had been collecting dust on that bookshelf for as long as I could remember. That day, I was bored and felt like reading something, so I picked it up and thought I'd read it real quick (it's very short).  I knew nothing about the book, the author, or the movie at the time.  I ended up being quickly drawn into it and had it finished very quickly.  I loved the book, and naively thought What a great movie that would make.  Even though I knew nothing about film and had relatively little interest in it, I thought the book would be very easy to adapt to a movie and I had a lot of great ideas about who would play the roles, how I would alter the dialogue, etc, etc. However, I was only 16 and lost interest fairly quickly.  But I did love the book and would think to myself (and only myself) Someday...someday...About four or five years later, when I was in college, I saw something shocking on the shelves of a local video store and I was crushed.  You see, I still hadn't given up on my dream of writing Love Story for the screen, but there it was.  And it had been done nearly 30 years earlier.  I immediately abandonned plans to rent Mallrats and rushed home to see how my vision had ultimately played out.I enjoyed the Arthur Miller\/Segal adaptation, but was disappointed for a number of reasons.  Over the years, as my knowledge of film has dramatically increased, I still find myself with the same complaints about Love Story that I had many years ago.  The biggest problem I have with it is the haphazard way it plows through the first part of the book, basically Oliver and Jenny's meeting, courtship and engagement.  That early part of the book is so critical because it's there that we meet Oliver and Jenny and see (read) their banter and bickering quickly evolve into love and infatuation. Emotionally, I was hooked by the book at that point.  I cared about the characters enough to be seriously moved by later events.  The film, in skipping so much early dialogue and interaction, doesn't give us the chance to make the same investment in the characters and it's hard to be moved as a result.  This is through no fault of the two leads, Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw, as the script doesn't give them a chance early on.After Oliver and Jenny are married, the screenplay actually follows the me at of the books story almost to a tee, which is frustrating because I felt it was more important that it followed it to a tee early rather than later. It's not as though Love Story is a long film (barely 100 minutes) and needed to be pared down for time.  Perhaps if I hadn't read the book and had simply seen the film, I wouldn't have these complaints and would have thought it as great as so many people did in 1970.O'Neal and MacGraw as the leads have actually grown on me over the years. I knew of O'Neal when I first saw the film (from Irreconcileable Differences!), but had no idea who MacGraw was.  Of course, neither would have been my choice at 16 to play the roles, but they do an admirable job with one serious exception  Almost without question, the most important line in the film is Love means never having to say you're sorry, and it is spoken twice.  Once by Jenny to Oliver and the other by Oliver to his father.  Both O'Neal and MacGraw's deliveries of this line made me cringe before and still do.  MacGraw's crying fit while she speaks the line is so nauseating that it makes the line almost comical.  O'Neal speaks the line so matter-of-factly that it conveys no emotion or comprehension of what it means.  The film definitely takes a serious hit because of it.  The emotional punch that that line delivered in the book was lacking in the film first because of what I stated earlier, and second because of these terrible deliveries.John Marley as Phil is a solid casting and his role in the film was one of the few things about it that didn't disappoint me, even when I didn't know who he was.  Fortunately, I hadn't yet seen the Godfather either, so his more memorable scene from that film hadn't been permanently planted in my mind.  Ray Milland tried to play Oliver III admirably, but was just too stiff.  Unfortunately, that's probably what he was told to do, so I can't blame him.  What seems to have been lost in the film version about this character was that he probably wasn't totally the old sonofabtch that Oliver IV thought he was in reality.  That's how IV saw him, and that's how he ended up on screen.  The emotion that III did exhibit in the book is lost onscreen.This film is not bad by any means.  Again, I actually enjoyed it, even the first time I saw it.  It captures the spirit, the time and the location of the book very well.  The leads play the characters very well.  And the second half of the film is superbly adapted.  But it was just utterly disappointing for me to see then, and now, the emotional wallup that the book contained almost entirely lost onscreen.  Maybe a remake will be in order someday.

I don't think there was a more talked about film in the 80's than Fatal Attraction, it made so many people think. It was a very intelligent thriller with great characters and a terrifying story. How many women get rejected by a man and haven't fantasized about just ruining their lives as revenge? Alex Forrest was the woman who didn't just fantasize, but lived it. How many men have a woman who won't let go of them no matter what they do? Even vice versa, but this was the movie that scared men right back into their wife's arms.Dan Gallagher is a successful, happily-married attorney living in Manhattan when he meets Alex Forrest. While his wife, Beth, and daughter are out of town for the weekend, he has a passionate affair with Alex. Though he thought it was understood to be a simple fling, she begins clinging to him. Dan explains that he must go home and Alex cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She continues to call until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. She then phones his home at all hours, and then confronts him saying that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. She will do anything at this point to make him be with her, even if it means destroying his family.Glenn Close who had only played the nice girl roles blew everyone's mind when she played Alex Forrest. What passion she put into the role and part of you couldn't really hate her. She brings up a great point to Dan Because I won't allow you to treat me like some slut you can just bang a couple of times and throw in the garbage?. Your heart does break for her but at the same time you want to scream at her to let go of Dan and not hurt his family. Michael Douglas as Dan plays the role extremely well. He gives Dan a sense of realism, he's not a major jerk who just looks for random women, he makes a mistake and owns up to it. He's still very smart, but very frightened and rightfully so when he learns what Alex can do to him. You believe that he loves his family, he made a bad choice and don't we all? The consequences were a bit extreme this time. Ann Archer as Beth was not only beautiful, classy, but incredibly intelligent. She makes Beth so real and I loved her line that I found out was improvised when Dan tells her that he cheated What is the matter with you?!, how many women or men have screamed that when getting hurt? Ellen Hamilton Latzen as Ellen, their daughter, is one of the best child actors you could imagine. She doesn't make her character annoying and when she sees her parents crying, she breaks down and you just want to hold her so badly. What talent at such a young age. Fatal Attraction was made so well and the reason why I think it holds up is because it is a very intelligent movie with great characters. You could relate in one way or another. Just a side note, I do wish they stuck with the original ending since it would have made more sense with Alex's character, I won't give it away, but it also would have been ironic with her and Dan's love for Madame Butterfly. But people wanted to see Alex get what she had coming after her being named a bunny boiler. But trust me when I say this is one of the best movies to come out of the 80's and I still love watching it.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 February 2004","score":"29 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the most talked about films of all time, Fatal Attraction, where married men learned a very valuable lesson keep the pants zipped.

And as for Kiefer Sutherland - well, as much as I love me, it pains me to observe that he only ever seems to play one character - moody, maverick, darkly sexy - hell, take the fangs of David, and you're looking at a teenage Jack Bauer! Deeply disappointed by the dvd - would have loved to see some extras ,but is was milding amusing to see the appalling lipsynching used in a attempt to make Corey Haim's immortal 'my own brother . . ' line palatable for the trailer. ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"13 February 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Happiness. A movie with that title is clearly not going to be cheery. No, Happiness is a disturbingly harrow tale, not unlike Magnolia, which features characters universally in a state of despair.Happiness follows the lives of a collection of people who all have a link with each other whether they know it or not. It doesn't necessarily contain a plot as we know it, rather it studies each character as they struggle to fight their own respective demons;Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Allen, conveys a lonely, sad man whose existence revolves around sex, or his obsession about his lack of it. He's in lust for one neighbour who barely acknowledges him, and he 'satisfies' himself by calling random numbers and talking to females while 'doing the business'.Dylan Baker is Bill, on the surface a balanced, happily married psychologist. Under it he's a disturbed sick paedophile - his character is incredibly well handled because we never feel totally appalled by him (Though we do feel appalled by his sickness), rather we have a slight level of sympathy for him because he knows he's sick and is in a perennial state of despair.Jane Adams is Joy Jordan who's never quite managed to get a hold of her life and seize the day. She's living a frustrated existence and doesn't know what to with herself. Her 2 sisters Cynthia (Married to Bill) and Helen have their own issues too, and patronise Joy 'expecting more from her' - Helen in particular has become a huge success through her writing but underneath is a total fraud and she knows it.These are the main characters, though there are many more, and it's ultimately a study of them, like Magnolia.  It is extremely well acted as we would expected from the class of player here, and the direction is subtle and allows the story to flow. Granted you won't be thrilled at any point, but it is pretty gripping stuff in context of how the characters develop.The main problem with the movie is who it is aimed at, because it is harrowing and distressing fare, really. Paedophilia, loneliness, rape, emptiness, murder, frustration, and futile despair tend not to be attractive themes, especially when they're so graphically portrayed as they are here. If you can tolerate such ideas, then you might appreciate this movie which never pulls a punch. It's treading a fine line, but just has enough dignity not to be sensationalistic, rather, just raw.One last thing - I really don't see it as a comedy drama, as it advertises itself. It's a dark drama with the occasional amusing moment.PS As the 11 year old Billy, Bill's son, Rufus Read is outstanding.

Though I enjoyed the twist of a dragon and a dragonslayer teaming up to fool some village people, the poor camera, editing, school theater performance acting and a lot of cliches turned this nearly-half-good plot into an unbearable thing to watch.The villain must be the most badly hair-dressed and uncharismatic evil overlord of all history; he looks like a not very intelligent child in the beginning, when he is in fact a not very intelligent child, and when he has become the king, he still looks the same. Huh, I'm scared! If he hadn't been introduced as the king earlier in the movie, he wouldn't stand out in any way from the surrounding people. Just his over-the-top stupidness gives some slight hint that he might be the antagonist, like inviting the woman who has just tried to assasinate him into his private chamber and even letting daggers lie around the place.

Every time he spoke offscreen, I thought Oh, there's another person around, who is it?

It is restrained, elegant, and contains no sexual overtones and minimal blood and gore.  It was the movie that made me really appreciate Christopher Walken.  This came out the same time as another film featuring him as a sympathetic, tortured individual (Brainstorm).  In that movie, he played a scientist; in Dead Zone, he's a school teacher, but they are more or less the same character.  The film is not particularly scary, but it is extremely suspenseful, and seeing Martin Sheen as an evil Presidential candidate may be hard to take for his West Wing fans.

When watching this movie one should remember that the people parodied in it were at the time of its release very, very much in power and that they had powerful friends in all countries. Yes, it must have been a tremendously courageous act. Mr Chaplin risked his name and possibly large parts of his wealth by doing The Great Dictator and I believe that it was honestly made out of idealism.The use of sound is outstanding. The ideas for it seem to come from the silent era careful, very good choice of musical scores, the creation of funny situations by special sound effects. The dialogs are wooden, there is hardly any really meaningful exchange. But then there are Chaplin's monologs. His imitation of the German language is funny and at the same time chilling. Amazing how well he caught the rhythm and speech-pattern of that foreign tongue &#150; I guess for him it was all a kind of music.In a strange way Chaplin reveals himself to be an Englishman at heart. The use of sound in The Great Dictator reminded me strongly of British Comedies from the Ealing Studios, the Goons show, Monty Python. Somehow they all seem to stand in the same cultural tradition. It was just amazing to hear how English his voice sounds when he makes his final speech (and who had heard Chaplin talk before?). The speech really comes from the heart and is very powerful and moving. It is a strange internationalistic frontal attack against modernism as a whole, the very economical eruption he owed his wealth and popularity to. Just compare it with a song of his compatriot John Lennon's Imagine.There may be flaws in this movie (the beginning is confusing, Paulette Goddard seems somewhat lost, the storyline is sketchy), but the terrific performance of Chaplin &#150; who even had the greatness to let himself play literally against the wall by a fellow comedian Jack Oakie as Benzino Napaloni &#150; more than compensates for them. It's wonderful to watch Charlie move. Such elegance and agility! And he was over fifty, the same age as Adolf Hitler.
