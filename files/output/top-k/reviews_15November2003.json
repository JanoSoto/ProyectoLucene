But no fear, Obi Wan incredibly has caught up to them and can catch the saber with two fingers. OK, the force is great, but this is stretching it a bit, isn't it?.The movie then splits in two stories (as Empire did) One follows Anakin and Amidala and as the two young ones just need to fall in love, no one bothered to write any interesting dialogue. Anakin turns into a sissy for a while and whines a lot as Amidala wants to stretch the running time of the movie and holds of falling in love proper. Anakin then wants to prove he's not a sissy and decides to go off and rescue his mother, never forgetting that he needs to fall in love by the end of the movie.

I feel I should expand it to at least 10 lines since the first one was so brief and especially since this is Veteran's Day.I am a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces but I naturally I never encountered anything like the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944. When I was growing up in the 70's, calendars still had little icons denoting D-Day, VE-Day, and VJ-Day. Apparently, that's too politically incorrect for today's youths, since they are too busy being indoctrinated in school. But I digress...The scope and breath of this film is amazing. The fact that the film stays together after so much detail is amazing in itself. I read many of the user comments and tend to agree that a lot of the dialogue is stilted, especially in the American scenes. The best part of the film for me was the scenes involving the Germans. Their acting was years ahead of its time. I love the scenes where the German officers are afraid to wake Hitler to tell him about the invasion. The only French scene I can stomach is at the beginning when Irina Demick is on the bike trying to distract the Germans from the adjacent wagon of hay, in where her comrades were hidden. Holy crap she was hot!I thought the best American performances were from Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer and Henry Fonda, whose role was unfortunately too brief. The best British performance was from Richard Burton. His scene at the end is great.Although nothing can match the Normandy landing in Saving Private Ryan, I'd take this version of D-Day anyday. While people have commented about the armchair warhawks like John Wayne, I similarly find the inclusion of Matt Damon and other Hollywood lefties in SPR just as revolting.

His look was cool, dangerous, fluid; his character, while a bit flat, was different enough in this type of movie to provide some satisfaction to the viewer.The sumptuous colors, the fecund, luxuriant locations and cinematography were a true pleasure to experience, at least in dvd format or on a big theatrical screen.The lead actor in this movie, Samuel Le Bihan, has a smooth panache and intelligence that recalls some of the flavor of the old Hollywood movie stars like Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, etc. For some of us rough-edged Americans, he was lovely as the focal point of the film. He was easy to embrace as the hero, without the filmmaker having to force this feeling on us with a trite setup story.The plot of this movie was not spoon-fed but sometimes smoothly delivered, and at other times, sloppily or fuzzily presented.A lot goes on as the story moves forward and watching it only once will ensure that much is missed.  This movie can be watched many times and reveal a little more each time. Some pieces that are dangled in front of the audience are never fully delivered and this leaves it in a bit of a gray area it foments some Jung-like ideas that can be pursued for those interested (or may pop up in our dreams later), yet it could have been a better film if more of these pieces were actually used to complete a final picture with some sense of accomplishment associated with it.The conclusion of the movie leaves us wanting a little something more, but it is still very enjoyable to watch - like a well-sung opera we don't really understand.

At the time the movie came out, similarities were made between the movie and the life of William Randolph Hearst. For instance, when reporters down in Cuba stated that there was no war there, Kane stated `there will be war when I say there is war.' This was the actual position that Hearst took at the time. Whether Kane is modeled after the life of William Randolph Hearst or not, the resemblance is strong.  Both men would sacrifice anything to write the news, and in some cases, they would make up  the story so circulation could increase.The movie begins at the end of Charles Foster Kane's life. The opening scene shows a large castle in the background..  The camera pans the scene to show a couple of monkeys in a cage and two empty gondolas. It is a lonely setting.  The castle remains in the background with one solitary light flickering in an upstairs window.  The scene changes to a house within a snow globe.  All of a sudden you see a pair of mustached lips, that whisper `Rosebud.'  The hand holding on to the snow globe, drops it and the globe shatters in to small pieces on the ground.  Charles Foster Kane's life has ended. Now  begins the task of solving the mystery of who is `Rosebud'. At this point, the movie  goes back and forth from present to past as reporters interview everyone who was close to Kane in an attempt to discover who Rosebud is.Through the use of  news reels, Kane's life is shown from its beginning to his rise to power. As a child, Kane was given up by his mother so that he could live a better life. Kane moves away with his new guardian, a rich man named Mr. Thatcher (played by George Coulouris) Kane becomes a reckless young man who in time is expelled from several colleges and universities. Mr. Thatcher provides Kane with money and options to own a few gold mines, but Kane decided to go into the newspaper business because `it might be fun'.  As the story continues, he marries a girl ( played by Dorthy Comingore)  from a prominent wealthy family. It is interesting how the movie shows the progression from a  young happy couple to  a marriage of that is less loving. As you may suspect, Kane meets someone else. This proves to be a downfall for Kane. At the time he is running for Governor and everyone assumes that he will be elected. His opponent uncovers his involvement with the other woman and  it becomes a scandal.  Kane marries the other woman and appears to support her in her desire to sing. It is clear, however, that his support is not to encourage her, but is a way for him to exercise power over her.Orson Welles' portrayal of Kane helps us see him as a man who feels love for power and money.  Although he has grown up in a poor family, Kane overcame poverty with a desire to  have every thing. He only seems to be happy with money and having the people of his community under his control.  That is probably why he was twice married and twice divorced. His wives were very different. One came from a wealthy well known family, the other came from a working class family. One was developing an independence from him, the other allowed herself to be controlled by him.   Although the reviewer felt Kane would have done better if he had stayed with his first wife rather than marrying again, that would have gone against his nature.Joseph Cotten Played Jedediah Leland who is Kane's best friend .He was also an employee of Kane's newspaper.  Shortly after Kane married his second wife, Leland found himself in the unpleasant position of writing about her debut as an opera singer.  The performance, which was incredibly bad, Kane walked in to the office  and found  Leland passed out on the typewriter. A partially written  review about Kane's wife was in the typewriter and a bottle of whiskey was nearby. Kane took Leland's review, and finished it. After that, Kane fired him.  The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Did Leland get drunk because he did not want to write the review? Was he struggling between having to be truthful or being loyal? The movie does not give all the answers, but lets the viewer fill in the gaps. What is interesting about this is that while Kane finished the review, he did not change its negative tone. This leaves us with another question. Was Leland fired because he got drunk ? Was he fired because of what he wrote about Susan? Or was he fired because Kane thought if he struggled with the decision of telling the truth or hurting a friend he could no longer report the news accurately?The reviewer gives this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating.  It is filmed era after era making the viewer believe that the years are passing by in every scene.  Other movies have `Flashbacks' in them, but they have not been as intriguing, as this one has been. It was  interesting to follow the reporter who interviewed close friends of Kane to try to find out who or what `Rosebud' is.  He  never found out, but we did.  When the workers were cleaning out Kane's possessions,  they threw  his stuff into a fire, one of those things was an old sled, with  `Rosebud' printed on it.For a movie over 60 years old the cinematography was terrific.

In other words, a movie that desperately needs to exist. And be seen.A bizarre combo protein-shake of black comedy, thriller and horror show, this is one of those Slow Saturday Night cult films that the weirdo clerk behind the counter is always personally recommending for those customers who are kind of like his pals.Very Bad Things is a film that plays out like a worse-case scenario. One of those movies that puts a group of relative people in a situation where everything that can possibly go wrong... does. Hopefully, with results that translate to a good movie.I found the movie to work on multiple levels. As an angry, aggressive, and assertive male-bonding comedy. As a thriller. As a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film. As a nightmare.Writer\/Director Peter Berg remarks he came up with the idea for this movie when he was at a bachelor party and saw the rowdy and over-the-top behavior from a lot of the other guests. These guys were looking for trouble, he said. What would happen if they found it? More than they could handle.The movie is all-over-the-map, but I like that about it. Berg sets up some cynical suburbanites and their rowdy behavior and puts them in several life-or-death situations, which despite what many say, is thrilling to watch.Christian Slater gives the strongest performance as the devil-may-care Robert Boyd, a man who seems to have no moral threshold. We never doubt his actions for a second. Slater knows how to play this character as plays him to the hilt.Daniel Stern plays his usual nebbish. From the City Slickers movies, the Home Alone movies and all his others, he's appropriately nervous and uneasy--especially after what's occurring right now. There's are massive murders bobbing up and the body count is still rising.Cameron Diaz is also effective doing an evil turn on the wedding-obsessed loon she was in My Best Friend's Wedding as a woman who doesn't care about anything else but having her big day. As far as she's concerned, the guests and the groom are secondary. She nitpicks and she bullies and berates. Many guys see this as the epitome of the woman who's about to have her big day.Jon Faverau isn't as money as he's been in other roles, but maybe that's because he's supposed to be the straight man. He's a little too straight. Too stiff. You kind of wish they had spiced him up some more. He appears to just be in shock and going along with the flow most of the time, like a tag-along.The movie plays out as a dark comedic thriller and at times a morality tale. What I like the most is the anarchy of the film and the performance of Christian Slater and especially the different ways the men and women in the movie react to him.Watch for his scene with Tripplehorn when they go one-on-one. The homages to Good Fellas and Reservior Dogs are cute and memorable too.Like I said before, this is a must-see for anyone who hates generic, paint-by-numbers movies. If this sounds like your cup of tea (and it damn well should), you're someone after my own heart.

Here is a movie that feels like it has it's own ideas, thoughts, edges and all.The studio executives didn't dig their claws into this one, sucking all the nerve and originality out of it just to make it inoffensive and more filtered for mass consumption.All the more making this a move that's really worth seeing for those who don't like movies that just connect-the-dots and paint-by-numbers. In other words, a movie that desperately needs to exist. And be seen.A bizarre combo protein-shake of black comedy, thriller and horror show, this is one of those Slow Saturday Night cult films that the weirdo clerk behind the counter is always personally recommending for those customers who are kind of like his pals.Very Bad Things is a film that plays out like a worse-case scenario. One of those movies that puts a group of relative people in a situation where everything that can possibly go wrong... does. Hopefully, with results that translate to a good movie.I found the movie to work on multiple levels. As an angry, aggressive, and assertive male-bonding comedy. As a thriller. As a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film. As a nightmare.Writer\/Director Peter Berg remarks he came up with the idea for this movie when he was at a bachelor party and saw the rowdy and over-the-top behavior from a lot of the other guests. These guys were looking for trouble, he said. What would happen if they found it? More than they could handle.The movie is all-over-the-map, but I like that about it. Berg sets up some cynical suburbanites and their rowdy behavior and puts them in several life-or-death situations, which despite what many say, is thrilling to watch.Christian Slater gives the strongest performance as the devil-may-care Robert Boyd, a man who seems to have no moral threshold. We never doubt his actions for a second. Slater knows how to play this character as plays him to the hilt.Daniel Stern plays his usual nebbish. From the City Slickers movies, the Home Alone movies and all his others, he's appropriately nervous and uneasy--especially after what's occurring right now. There's are massive murders bobbing up and the body count is still rising.Cameron Diaz is also effective doing an evil turn on the wedding-obsessed loon she was in My Best Friend's Wedding as a woman who doesn't care about anything else but having her big day.

The plot is interesting as I quite enjoy sci-fi when it is done well, although it maybe doesn't deliver everything you'd expect in terms of thrills.  It has a nice slow patient build up throughout the film, we are invited to be unsure if Jillian is losing it or if she's catching on to the reality of her situation.

Denzel's skin color is not an issue with me, casting him is more proof of Branagh's outlaw brain. My issue with Washington is his too sedate delivery, though he finds his footing a bit better as the film progresses.Were Shakespeare to be secreted at a screening I think he would heartily approve of Michael Keating's performance as Dogberry.

Look at Angus Macfayden's performance...can you spell brilliance?  Some say scenes were not cohesive...MAYBE THATS ON PURPOSE!  Tim Robbins isn't exactly Ang Lee directing The Incredible Hulk!  The whole film gives the feeling craziness and distraction, to quote the film.  Bill Murray is just as good as Translation or, dare I say, Ghostbusters.  Susan Sarandon gives a career best performance, I love it!  Anyways, before I get off topic, this film  is a spectacular look at MANY angles of the theater business, as an art, during a time in our history when that particular business was dangerous water to be treading in.  BRAVO.  If you didn't like it the first time, watch it again and this time watch it!

Everyone always looks down on this movie, but it was a really good addition to the Superman movies.Basic storyline *MINOR SPOILERS --Richard Pryor is Gus Gorman, a computer genius who becomes involved in a scheme where he writes a computer program to steal money from his company. (See OFFICE SPACE) He is caught and then blackmailed by the company's owner Ross Webster. (Robert Vaughn) It turns out they sort of blackmail each other -- Webster makes Gus reprogram the weather satellite to control the weather and change the course of oil tankers. He also has Gus create a recipe for Kryptonite to get Superman out of the picture. On the other hand, Gus makes Webster's company build him a supercomputer.Meanwhile, Superman\/Clark Kent is back in his hometown of Smallville where he rekindles an old flame with sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole, who ironically plays Clark's mom on the SMALLVILLE TV series). Superman comes in contact with the homemade Krytptonite and all havoc breaks loose.The most exciting sequence of SUPERMAN III has to be the Clark Kent\/Superman fight in the junkyard. The final fight with Superman vs. the supercomputer (Pac-Man sounds included) is also pretty good.SUPERMAN III is my 2nd favorite movie in the Superman series. Better than SUPERMAN I & IV, but not as good as Superman II. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2003","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SUPERMAN III rocks.

I've seen The Shining, Carrie and It. I hate all of those. But this one was really good. It was scary and atmospheric, all the way through. The music was great, very moody and scary, the basic theme was pretty good, and the acting was, if not great, sufficient. The effects were mostly good, though I thought the moving corn, was, well, corny(no pun intended). It's interesting, all the way through, and has more likable main characters than your everyday horror movie. Both main characters are pretty well developed through the movie, and you actually care about them. This is a movie you should watch, at least once, if you like horror movies, even if you hate Stephen King(I do, and I loved the movie). 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have to admit, I usually hate Stephen King films.
