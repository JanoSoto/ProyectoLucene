He puts out the most vile and sophomoric films that are made with the sole purpose of getting high schoolers to laugh at pubic hair and weed jokes.  You might say that he needs to take off that raggy hooded jacket and get away from anything resembling a camera.  You might say he is just not funny.  I, however, might say I think he is a comedy mastermind. (And I do.)In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back we find the ultra-baked duo setting out to Hollywood to defend their good (?) names after being repeatedly slammed on an internet movie guide (kind of like this one, just not for the whole family) after a movie is set to be made of in their image.  Along the way they hitch a ride with a sexy group of diamond thieves who set them up for an orangutan kidnapping and they cross paths with characters played by some of the finest comedy people of all time. (George Carlin, Wil Ferrel, Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, etc.)That's about the long short of the the plot. (it really is.)  This, however, allows Smith to not only satire his own films, but everthing else Hollywood. And most of the fun is poked at decent films!  For example, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and director Gus Van Sant doing a quick poke at Good Will Hunting, (a very outstanding film,) when Jay and Silent Bob stumble upon the filming of Good Will Hunting 2, Hunting Season.  They not only take stabs at the movie, but at each other's fame.  (Grip on bullhorn to set extras if you make any eye contact with Mr. Damon or Mr. Affleck, you will be fired!)  And, yes there is the Star Wars rips, too.  (Keep an eye open for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher cameos.)  Satires of Hollywood is exactly the kind of thing we need more of, trust me.So you must understand, Mr. Smith was not out to create an intellectual movie here.  Of coarse it's beyond silly.  This is his most slapstick and profanity-filled film to date... and I for one enjoyed every minute of it. As soon as the movie begun, I found myself laughing with tenth-grader glee until the end, all the while my wife looked on in shame, yet trying not to laugh, herself.  I felt no guilt in this nor did I feel that I should have spent my time watching some smart arthouse film like Waking Life or something.  (Hey, you're talking to a longtime fan of Bevis and Butthead here!)I watch the subtle brilliance of Kevin Smith and have always recommended his movies to friends.  Plus, the DVD came with a bonus disc were you may watch deleted scenes(some kept out to miss a NC-17 rating)with introductions by Smith and others.  I dug this too, as it left me with a more personal touch on the film.  Kevin Smith never comes off as some misunderstood genius who belongs to some kind of higher order like alot of directors. (Tim Burton?) I saw him and Jason Mewes as guys who like movies and like making movies. They came off as if they were talking to me directly, as if I might have even been hanging out with them.  Now, alot of you complained but I propose quite simply this movie wasn't for you.  And I bet all the complainers normally like fart and sex jokes any other time.

In this one, the Pinocchio is an advanced robot who looks and acts like a real boy. David (Haley Joel Osment) is the first of his robot line to have actual feelings, and naturally he runs into problems reconciling these emotions with his logical side.    David is purchased by the Swinton family as a sort-of replacement for their son, who lies in stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. Mr. Swinton (Sam Robards) buys David to help his wife deal with the stress of losing their son; but it's kind of the same as buying a new puppy immediately after one's dog has been killed. Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) doesn't quite know what to make of the new addition to her family. She resents the intrusion, and doesn't know how to treat David. Unlike traditional serving robots, David is designed to be a cute little kid, which means he doesn't just sit back and wait for orders to be given; he's supposed to be more interactive and proactive, learning as he goes.   David develops a real love for his adoptive mother. But when the younger Swinton actually is cured from his disease and returns home, things get very complicated. It's soon clear that David's days with the family are numbered. Monica knows that if David is returned to the manufacturer, he'll be taken apart, and she's also grown fond of the boy robot. She takes him to a huge forest where decommissioned androids and other robots wander, thinking he'll be better off with those of his own kind. But David's love for his mother outweighs all else, and through all of his adventures - in which he meets up with fellow robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law), his one goal is to return to his beloved mommy. He is under the impression that he can somehow become a real boy, Monica will take him back and they can all live happily ever after.  If you're in the mood for absurdist cinema, this is a treat. The special effects, which were nominated for an Oscar, really are good. But special effects aren't as special as they used to be, now that most big-budget films have them in some way. True, the makeup (by past Oscar winner Rick Baker) and costumes are excellent, but the story and acting, sadly, are not.   Each scene elicits an oh, come on reaction, as it tries to top the previous scene. Look at me! Look at me! the scenes practically cry out. It's a self-absorbed mess. The theme's not a new one, but the makers of this piffle tried way too hard to make the story different from all of the other I want to be a real boy movies; there's a fine line between quirky and unbelievable.    Yes, you should suspend your disbelief for this movie; you should suspend it, expel it, and forget you ever had it. There's plenty that doesn't make a bit of sense, and a really schmaltzy ending. It tries its damnednest to pluck at your heartstrings, playing out more like a cheesy disease-of-the-week TV movie than a serious, heartfelt film.  Osment's not bad, under the circumstances. One great thing about playing a robot is that one can give a poor performance, and it'll seem believable. There are also a few celebrity cameos that were completely unnecessary, although I won't ruin their surprise by outing them here.  Most of the middle portion of this film (which clocks in at over two and a half hours) is deadeningly dull, and none of it was worth the megahype that DreamWorks mustered up for it.

Unlike traditional serving robots, David is designed to be a cute little kid, which means he doesn't just sit back and wait for orders to be given; he's supposed to be more interactive and proactive, learning as he goes.   David develops a real love for his adoptive mother. But when the younger Swinton actually is cured from his disease and returns home, things get very complicated. It's soon clear that David's days with the family are numbered. Monica knows that if David is returned to the manufacturer, he'll be taken apart, and she's also grown fond of the boy robot. She takes him to a huge forest where decommissioned androids and other robots wander, thinking he'll be better off with those of his own kind. But David's love for his mother outweighs all else, and through all of his adventures - in which he meets up with fellow robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law), his one goal is to return to his beloved mommy. He is under the impression that he can somehow become a real boy, Monica will take him back and they can all live happily ever after.  If you're in the mood for absurdist cinema, this is a treat. The special effects, which were nominated for an Oscar, really are good. But special effects aren't as special as they used to be, now that most big-budget films have them in some way. True, the makeup (by past Oscar winner Rick Baker) and costumes are excellent, but the story and acting, sadly, are not.   Each scene elicits an oh, come on reaction, as it tries to top the previous scene. Look at me! Look at me! the scenes practically cry out. It's a self-absorbed mess. The theme's not a new one, but the makers of this piffle tried way too hard to make the story different from all of the other I want to be a real boy movies; there's a fine line between quirky and unbelievable.    Yes, you should suspend your disbelief for this movie; you should suspend it, expel it, and forget you ever had it. There's plenty that doesn't make a bit of sense, and a really schmaltzy ending. It tries its damnednest to pluck at your heartstrings, playing out more like a cheesy disease-of-the-week TV movie than a serious, heartfelt film.  Osment's not bad, under the circumstances. One great thing about playing a robot is that one can give a poor performance, and it'll seem believable. There are also a few celebrity cameos that were completely unnecessary, although I won't ruin their surprise by outing them here.  Most of the middle portion of this film (which clocks in at over two and a half hours) is deadeningly dull, and none of it was worth the megahype that DreamWorks mustered up for it. This is a good movie to leave on as you fall asleep.

I liked how the dogs were brought in, but Alice quickly dispatches with all 6 or 7 of them in a single scene (One in which she wanders off alone and returns without any questions).  It almost seemed like the scene was shot later after primary filming had finished.  Another thing I liked was the opening part of the film, showing what a normal day in the Umbrella Corp. was like.  This was really the only part of the film where I felt tension and suspense that seemed to be lacking from the rest of the film.  The inclusion of the Lickers from Resident Evil 2 I thought was really cool and how it gave some background into their origins (I don't recall if the game included any).  At the end of the movie, when the camera was panning out from Alice, I really liked the various small details; such as the streaks of blood from an open window and despite the entire film, it made me hopeful for the sequel.  Either that or I'm just gullible.
