The characters are loosely based on figures david bowie, his once wife, and mick jagger\/iggy pop type character. While david bowie wasn't involved in the movie (although the director asked him to be, and said he read and approved of the script) it has always been believed that david bowie had an affair with another major rock star - just like the characters in this story do. While this movie is about the characters of this time, it also portrays the fans of this time through christan bale, a sexually confused teenager during the glam rock period who goes back to revisit his past 10 years later to do a retrospective journalism article. This movie is full of sex and drugs, but as far as gay sex scenes go, this movie has one of the best. It is not totally overdone as so many are, but is quite tasteful. The best things about this film though are the costumes and soundtrack. Both old and new music (specially made for the film) are used. The director enlisted the help of some of the period's stars to make this film, such as iggy pop and brian ferry, so the periods portrayal wasn't solely fiction. I really enjoyed this movie for its originality, and its frankness. However i will admit that it is not for everyone. Not for the easily offended, repressed or homophobic. 9 out of 10.

She was portrayed at times as a nin-com-poop which is stupid and false as far as I'm concerned.

Glam rock, in case you had forgotten, is forgettable power-trio ballads performed by heavily mascara-ed, sequin-wearing bi-sexual males.  David Bowie spent a few years in this phase and skipped out, but other acts, like Mott the Hoople and Gary Glitter, remained true believers, trundling out artery-clogging double concept albums well into the 1970s.The David Bowie-based character is Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Davies). There's also American Curt Wild (Ewan MacGregor), whose career is languishing after a brief stint as headman of a proto-punk MC5-like garage band in the early 1970s.  Slade re-animates Wild's career, brings him on tour, slathers him in mascara, sequins, and feathers, and, naturally, copulates with him.  This pretty dull story is told from the perspective of an English journalist, who's sent to determine what has become of Slade in 1984, long after he has dropped off the celebrity radar screen.  The assignment rekindles the journalist's misguided teenage love affair with glam rock, much to the audience's chagrin.The story is mainly told in voice-over interviews with people who knew Slade in the 1970s.  By far the most tiresome of these is from Slade's ex-wife Mandy (Toni Collette), who is a member of perhaps the most annoying demographic on earth -- talentless, bitter ex-spouses of rock stars.  In a whiny, sulky voice, she complains about how when she and Slade married in the early 70s, there was, like, a groovy feeling of sexual liberation in the air.  They were divorced after it got a little old watching Slade shellac his mind with galaxies of narcotics while frenetically rogering anything on two legs -- except, it seems, her (What did she expect?).  Yawn. The other voice-overs are a little more promising, but hers is by far the most prominent.  The accompanying flashbacks feature enough eye-makeup, fornication, drugs, polyester, and sexual ambiguity to last this viewer a lifetime.The script is, for the most part, pretentious claptrap.  Instead of investing the characters with any recognizable character traits (much less sympathetic ones), director Todd Haynes has them prance around striking poses, occasionally uttering vapid, oh-so-clever observations about the nature of celebrity.  (The first duty in life is to create an image.  The second duty is yet to be determined.)  The only interesting thing about them is the way they dress, and that gets old pretty damned quick.  I suppose the underlying theme here is that there's no point in getting to know these characters under the surface because their entire lives are devoted to cultivating their external appearance.  Whatever sociological accuracy this theory may have, it's fatal to the narrative.  Because these dumb, self-involved, inarticulate sybarites offer nothing to hold the viewer's interest, their little spats and couplings and musical mincings are about as interesting as Canadian Parliament.  Nevertheless, Haynes presents these doings with PBS-documentary touches (spinning newspaper headlines, excerpts of press conferences and news reports), that invest them with a sense of fake solemnity.Even if the characters generated a spark of interest, the movie is replete with turgid, self-indulgent musical set pieces that cry out for the cutting-room floor.  The audience is forced to watch movie actors perform contemporary pastiches of not-terribly-good glam-rock songs.

Thirdly, I am so sick of seeing people complain about this and any other film, unless you are an out of work producer, director or actor (and as such, you can't be too good at your craft if you are)then you truly should try to remember that these people put their lives on hold for nine months so that we could have a movie that we can be proud of.

Throughout the movie there is the thought, hey, this is a movie, he won't die. But he does. That's not a spoiler. It's a part of life, and the life cycle, that this movie treats with great respect and consideration. In short, this film is about the persona of Death, who comes to earth on a holiday with the intention of learning about the modern world and the people who inhabit it. He chooses for his guide, Bill Parrish, a whole-souled, worldly media magnate with two loving daughters. Marcia Gay Harden's character apparently plans parties for a living. Susan, played by Claire Forlani, is a doctor. Now, if you have to go, you could have worse escorts than Brad Pitt. He's amazing. We all think he's cute, when he's not doing weird things to his hair, but in parts of this film, the strange innocence of a character who does not really know the world, combined with that face, is almost too much. Despite the fact that death brings thoughts of hideous decay and putrefaction, in this film, death wears a face from heaven. It softens the blow for Bill Parrish and beyond that, it brings some kind of quality of luminescence to a movie that could be so shadowed. Inevitably, there is a love story and this one effectively convinces us that it is one of those timeless true loves. In part, it can't be anything else - Death probably doesn't have flings. Forlani, the girl, is wonderfully fragile and human, and more importantly she has a wonderful truthfulness about her. She's not just an actress acting, but a real person in the midst of experiences that are almost incomprehensible. The film has the some of that icky Hollywood quality where every scene, every room, every restaurant are perfect, shiny and bright, slaved over by some set designer. This world of the incredibly rich that grates a bit. The final scenes are set at a party that is unfortunately reminiscent of the party scenes in the recent Harrison Ford Sabrina. It's a world of fantasy that doesn't play in real life. When it's blown up one hundred times on screen it's far too much to take. And it is the last scenes, the last five minutes of the film, that are Meet Joe Black's only failing. One senses the influence of test audiences and focus groups. Sometimes people don't know what's good for them. In this case, what's supposed to be a kind of happy ending compromises the integrity of the rest of the film.

This is not a film to watch if you're looking for a good time. There is no real secret to the sense of identification with the victims; they are not fully-fleshed characters any more than necessary. Simply put, the threat of torture and murder presented by the family of maniacs is so overwhelming, so incompatible with subjectification with the killer, that one cannot help but sympathize with the victims (at least, if one is not totally warped). And what the lead character is put through (not to mention the questionably less fortunate other characters) is so grueling, lasts for so long, that the overall experience is one of a nightmare from which the viewer cannot escape. No other film I can think of does this so effectively; the film delves so deeply into latent fears (not only of violent death, but socially based ones as well), that it becomes as close an experience with evil as one can conceivably experience behind the safety of a television screen. Oddly enough, what sticks out in my mind is the field of sunflowers the first victims walk through on their way to the house where their worst fears are realized.

A wonderful actor, a beautiful writer, and an even better director.  This masterpiece has truly inspired me!  Every single scene of this epic film looks like it is a periodic painting sprung to life. I watched this film with my girlfriend, and I expected to fall asleep.  I could not be more wrong!  It held our attention through from the opening scenes to the tragic, tear-jerking finale.  It was the shortest and most enjoyable four hours of my life.  I have purchased the film and viewed it six times since.

One word that sums up the whole film. I was totally blown away with it. Steven Spielberg did such a fantastic job with 'Saving Private Ryan', furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in Tom Hanks' career. For those of you who manage to sit through the first twenty-five minutes of carnage, you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call, 'the greatest war movie of all time'. I was in awe of the feat Steven Spielberg has accomplished. Some may place it alongside 'Schindler's List' as his greatest achievement. Me, I rate it higher.Seeing the film in a cinema, with surround sound, places the audience in the middle of the D-Day Invasion. Gruesome as it may be, the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history. With strong back-up performances from the relatively young supporting cast, 'Saving Private Ryan' will no doubt go into the 1999 Academy Awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories, including best actor (Hanks), best director (Spielberg), and best picture.It has opened the door to reality. The public can finally see what war was really like. Frightening. Some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie. But finally we have a realistic war film. 'Rambo', 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Deer Hunter'. None of the myths of war these films have created. 'Platoon' is the only realistic war film in recent memory. Yes, they are all Vietnam movies. But give me an example of a decent World War II movie. Alongside, or even above, 'Das Boot', 'Saving Private Ryan' is a classic World War II film. A modern classic. No more, no less. Congratulations to Steven Spielberg on such a fine effort. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 1998","score":"","review":"  Wow. One word that sums up the whole film.

At first I was captured by the non-stop violence but on more recent viewings I am caught deep in the storyline about a cop who has his life ripped from him and replaced by that of violence.

The movie did not live up to my expectations.  The movie was good, but I was expecting something more.  Denzel Washington (Crimson Tide, Fallen) stars as an FBI agent who has recently had a flurry of terrorist attacks happen in New York.  Annette Benning (The American President, Regarding Henry) plays a CIA agent who knows a lot about the bombings.  After they are not able to stop the attacks, the President orders a General to go to New York and set up martial law.  The General is played by Bruce Willis (Armageddon, Die Hard).  This presents an issue about how we would react to this situation and the real enemy is.  The movie is well-directed by Edward Zwick (Glory, Legends of the Fall).  The movie lags and gets a little boring in the middle, but picks it up towards the end.  Denzel Washington is strong in the lead role.  Annette Benning gives a respectable performance.  Bruce Willis is great as the General, but has a fairly small role.  Finally Tony Shaloub (Big Night, TV's Wings) gives an excellent supporting performance as Washington's partner who is Arab, just like the terrorists.
