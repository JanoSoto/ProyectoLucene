Their happy and peaceful life in Italy is soon interrupted when they are taken from their home to a Nazi concentration camp, when Dora finds this out she demands to get on the train with them even though she is not Jewish. Guido throughout the film tells his son that the whole situation is a game and that the first person to get to 1000 points will be the winner and will receive a real life size tank as the prize, this stops Joshua from being scared for a while but when all the other children disappear Joshua doesn't understand why. meanwhile Guido is trying to contact Dora in anyway possible, to let her know that he is thinking of her and that they are safe. Guido is constantly trying to cover up the harsh reality of the camp but even he cannot deny the horrors he sees. A scene in particular that I found great was when Guido has finished working as a waiter for the night and is carrying Joshua back to their cabin when he sees a massive pile of bodies, the scene is shot using mist and fog to represent how people knew what was going on but chose to ignore it, the film contains many scenes such as these ones that make you think about the true message they are trying to show.Roberto Benigni has done a fantastic job on this film, he has focused it on the individuals rather than the situation or the camp they were in. It makes you come to love the characters as individuals not just a mass race like how the Nazi's saw them, that is one of the main reasons this film is so emotional and effective. many things in this film are played down that aren't in others such as the appalling conditions and endless amounts of miserable and depressed looking people(even though that was how they were probably feeling), it shows the life of three ordinary and lovely people trying to make the most out of a horrible situation, which is why I find the film so endearing. Even the deaths are played down, I feel this is because to them it was just another person dead, it had no significance, it was just 1 in 6 million, I found this to be totally unique to the film, I would recommend EVERYONE to watch this film because not only is it a brilliant film but it gives us hope that even in the worst of situations there is always a way around it. By the end you will be just as in love with the characters as I was! Absaloutley amazing film, i will be watching this one again!

Gustav Von Wangenheim really performed well too while Greta Schroder looked nice but quite confusing at times. Directed very well and screenplay was good. Art direction and cinematography were excellent. i loved that hilarious sequence that looks so funny when Orlok arrives in the town running with his coffin in his hand. and in other scene looked creepy but rather heroic standing on that ship with everyone dead and looking forward to the fact that he was going to get Hutter's wife who he finds beautiful. many sequences were actually scary and quite creepy. i loved the whole atmosphere of this movie. it is rather enjoyable and very lovable as it ends you feel like you just watched a high budget action Sci Fi movie. creepy and scary sequences with one of the very best or actually the best portrayal of a Vampire or Dracula i have seen. this is a must watch.Rating4.5\/5A-Follow My Blog HollywoodAndMe.Blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"25 November 2011","score":"","review":" StarringMax Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schröder, Alexander Granach, Georg H.

And real life mirrored from this with sexuality inversed, the events of an actual case that may be the weirdest in world espionage. Both are layered here, fiction and life. On one hand it is about the Westerner's efforts, recast here as a French diplomat in 60's Beijing, at first condescending, cynical but gradually admiring, to capture the heart of a strange exotic world. That world seduces him with the face of a Chinese opera singer, herself a Butterfly performing the opera when we first see her, exuding all those things the idealized image of the Orient is meant to ancient mystery, scented allure, covert eroticism.(of course we know that the Madame Butterfly opera was based on a story in turn based on recollections of the writer's wife from her visit in Japan. It is a purely Methodist dream of the Orient, itself a prosthetic hybrid, an illusion. There was never any inside truth in the adopted images, any truly Oriental heart to be captured)From her end, we learn that she is manipulating that image from inside, presenting what he wishes to see to gain actual knowledge of Western machinations.But of course, this being patterned after an opera, it is about the music, not the story. So all the lachrymose love stuff makes sense, that may seem overt and heavyhanded at first glance. The flowery visuals, arranged in decorative beauty. The complete artifice of a stagebound China, that only furthers the connection with a staged reality. The project was originally meant for Peter Weir, no doubt he would have envisioned a better density for this world, a more enveloping alienation from the encounter; but the material suits Cronenberg's prosthetic worldview just fine. More than fine. The idea is that everything groomed to look beautitul should be revealed deceptive, illusionary. So he creates a natural copy of everything that should have rung true and lived, based on the idea that as an audience we are as open and eager to be seduced by images as the protagonist is.It works just subtly enough to throw us for a loop as just another Oscar bait about love and political intrigue. It is not, with all the emotional outpour that we experience as the film perversed as the instruments of a cruel deception.

Full circle with another Butterfly performing a role, but this one funneling broken soul into the thing. Everything is questioned, identity, contact, even sex. The result elicits a shock that is real, it's quite wonderful to watch.Overall it is near masterful stuff for me, about the power of images to seduce and break. I could see something like this come from Peter Greenaway, with the whole thing in quotation marks. But Cronenberg was daft or smart enough, I can't tell which, to make the maudlin and wooden stuff so unassuming it works deeper than Greenaway would allow. So it's not really a conventional love story but only dealt with in those terms. The opera that he's watching around him.

But Cronenberg was daft or smart enough, I can't tell which, to make the maudlin and wooden stuff so unassuming it works deeper than Greenaway would allow. So it's not really a conventional love story but only dealt with in those terms. The opera that he's watching around him. So a man falling in love with an idealized depiction of beauty, itself a cinematic essence, but that we have to deal with as viewers on our own. Do we open up to it only to be hurt when he is? Do we keep our distance and admire aesthetically? ","genre":"Drama, History, Romance"},{"date":"25 November 2011","score":"","review":" There will be no rematch &#x85; there will be no rematch! I don't want one This is from the first 'Rocky' film, right after the final bell and before Bill Conti's 'Final Bell' would conduct one of the greatest and most unforgettable concluding movie scenes. Rocky didn't win the match, but he went the distance, he didn't get down and never abandoned &#x85; and if Apollo won the fight, Rocky won the heart of the spectators, of the woman he loved, of all the viewers in the world who identified with one of the greatest and most inspiring cinematic characters.Apollo didn't want a rematch, neither did Rocky. So when Rocky II, the sequel starts with Apollo asking for a rematch, you know there's a problem in the continuity department. Does it really matter? Not necessarily, but this is what separates between the great and the very good films, Rocky II ignored some plot details left in the glorious first opus because it was a necessary move to justify the sequel's very existence. Still, did the film need a sequel? I believe if it wasn't for the series, the character wouldn't have become so hugely popular all over the world, and there's so much optimism in Rocky and Adrian that it's impossible not to root for them, not to feel something for the little universe evolving around them. So even if the quality suffers, the series helped to construct a legend, and if anything, it contributed to show how great and deserving of a Best Picture Oscar, the first movie was.Consequently, there are two ways of reviewing Rocky II on its own, it's a very poignant drama with an inspiring message, when compared to Rocky, it's inferior, but for its defense, it's still closer to the quality of Rocky than all the other sequels. What makes it inferior is clearly the characterization during the first act. While Rocky was a lovable dim-witted guy, his personality flirts with plain imbecility more than in one occasion, Mickey was a funny grumpy old-timer, he became annoyingly aggressive, but still this is nothing compared to Apollo, who traded his charismatic flamboyance for an obvious villainous mask, so obnoxious and condescending toward Rocky, it's like the fight from the first film never happened. In Rocky II, it looked like everything was changed for the sake of the plot, accentuating the character's worst traits, with the exception of Paulie, whose transformation is left for interpretations... but doesn't add much to the appreciation of the film anyway.Another weakness is in the pacing, too slow and not as rich in characterization and content as the first, basically, it's all about Rocky losing the money he won, trying to find a job, becoming a bum again, teased by Apollo for the rematch, facing Adrian's refusal, and then Adrian's coma leading to a whole sequence where we're waiting for her to wake up and give her blessing. I'm not saying these parts are not correctly handled, on the contrary, many of them provided some of the most memorable sequences of the trilogy. The problem is that nothing can ever catch us by surprise, the viewer is inevitably ahead of the characters, we know Rocky will play (and certainly win) the fight, it's just a matter of time; we know he'll endure all the humiliations, from Apollo or Mickey, before becoming a hero again. It's so obvious that I could even picture Stallone thinking Rocky must conquer his pride back, so he must lose it before. This obviousness was totally absent from the first film, that ended up with Rocky, unexpectedly losing the match. Here, we're 100% sure that he will become the Worldwide Heavy Weight Champion.So, inferior to the first film, Rocky II is, but it's so superior to the following sequels, that nonetheless, the movie works on an emotional level. It features so many scenes that are both poignant and inspiring, the marriage proposal in the zoo, Rocky's attempt to build a life for his family, the coma sequence, the birth of Rocky Jr., Rocky's (hairy) heir and the father-and-son relationship growing between Rocky and Mickey. Being analytical toward the movie's minor flaws doesn't prevent from appreciating its simple and naive beauty; as a drama it's a decent one, and as a sports movie, it has the merit to surprise us through a very spectacular finale. I don't know if it's realistic or not, but at least it leads to a thrilling suspense and a final bell sequence that echoes the greatness of the first one.Despite everything, the Rocky films have a unique talent to redeem their own flaws through their finales, proving that it's all about 'heart' and passion, and any rational attempt to decorticate what works and what doesn't, ultimately loses its significance. Whatever you say about Rocky II, it's a very good film that remains faithful to the spirit of the first one, it sins by being a little over the top sometimes, but overall, it's a great work from Stallone, and as the first film I saw from the series, it'll always have a special place in my heart &#x85; I remember how I wished I could be among those schoolchildren who ran with Rocky through Philadelphia.Now, I'm more skeptical toward that running scene, which is too 'cinematic' to be fully appreciated on a realistic level ... but Stallone is so sincere and genuine that I'm sure he only wanted an inspiring on-screen depiction of the 'Rocky' effect, an ordinary hero whose running steps pave the way for success, inviting us to follow them to go the distance, over and over again.

The idea that this could be a rudiment is easily debunked by the quantity of reviews that are all nearly consecutively impeccable.Some of the praise for this film can be laid upon Sjostrom's masterful direction replete with the novel of Hawthorne's lyrical words and story. Of course, the films screen time and period is set in the 1800's and it illustrates the hypocrisies of the church, the relentless protest against heresy and that unbelievably taking place all because of a pointless hullabaloo of Hester Prynne not turning up to church. She becomes enamoured with the priest; then she gets pegged as an adulteress.There are subtle moments when her denotation and symbol that is firmly on her are then drew by her Daughter, the most innocuous thing in her life that she couldn't just punish for not understanding.

The minister\/priest's performance can be hyperbolised at times, but this was probably to posit an alternative state of ambivalence, so it's only a nitpick.

His movies never felt like it had any storyboards or were rehearsed in any way. There was never a pre-setup plan, concerning any of its camera-work or positions and the actors all also seemed to be ad-libbing at points. They were just simply shooting away, which gives the movie a very raw and authentic feeling. I think this is the foremost reason why people really like his movies. I myself can appreciate it but that doesn't mean I'm that fond or impressed with it as well.No, it's not really an easy or pleasant movie to watch. It's because the story is not really following a clear main plot line and things just seem to happen very randomly. I just simply prefer a more clear and straightforward story, since it also seemed to me that because of Cassavetes' approach, some of the sequences seemed to go on for ever and often weren't making that much sense for the story either.I can still understand the story and what Cassavetes was trying to do and tell with it. It's basically a look into married life and not about any of its peachy or happy aspects. But however, like I mentioned before, I would had been more taken by it and probably would had find the story to be a more interesting one, if it had a more straightforward story and approach to it.But yet I never hated watching this movie either. I can still definitely appreciate the way it got made and also all of the actors were a joy to watch. The movie really has some fine actors in it and I was especially fond of John Marley's performance. It were however Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel who received an Oscar nomination for their roles in this move.Actually it seems quite amazing to me how this movie managed to score 3 Oscar nominations, since it's such an artistic movie, that normally would hardly get ever noticed or recognized by any of the big award shows. It perhaps says something about the popularity or status of director and writer John Cassavetes at the time or how people looked at movies.For most people this movie will probably be too tough to bite through, or it simply won't be interesting enough to sit through but there is still a large crowd for these sort of movies out there.

It were however Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel who received an Oscar nomination for their roles in this move.Actually it seems quite amazing to me how this movie managed to score 3 Oscar nominations, since it's such an artistic movie, that normally would hardly get ever noticed or recognized by any of the big award shows. It perhaps says something about the popularity or status of director and writer John Cassavetes at the time or how people looked at movies.For most people this movie will probably be too tough to bite through, or it simply won't be interesting enough to sit through but there is still a large crowd for these sort of movies out there. So if it sounds like it's your thing, chances are you'll probably end up loving it.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 November 2011","score":"","review":" The vicissitudes of winning or losing a game and doing the best you can to be successful at it whether playing clean or pulling some dirty tricks are what makes of Blue Chips an nice film whose main character played by Nick Nolte has to fight against the odds of losing another championship for another consecutive year.

I started watching it at 12 in the morning and I was in shock, all the way till the end, wondering and thinking about what I just saw.Being brief, the film is about a woman and her husband who move to an apartment where the man becomes an actor but struggles with it, and the woman soon becomes pregnant. The apartment is also filled with crazy people and Rosemary's nightmare becomes a deranged reality. Even the husband starts going cuckoo.I really enjoyed this a lot. It is a classic and I don't think it needs to be remade. I love how we go through the perspective of Rosemary in her dreams and her wildest, darkest fantasies as she can not tell what's going on or what is happening around her. I also like the sense of dread throughout as that the neighbors become much more evil and more psychotic as we look at them more. Even the husband, Guy who suddenly goes crazy, day after day reminded me of The Shining when Jack Nicolson's character went ballistic. I also like the unreal aspects like when she got pregnant, witches and demons.This is a masterpiece and possibly up there with some of my other favorite horror films. It's creepy, eerie, dramatic, horrifying and sometimes dark in every way.I also thought that the actors were excellent in their roles. Each actor was very believable. Mia Farrow as Rosemary is superb in every way possible. She makes us feel sympathy and sorrow for her.

It perfectly captures the pessimistic view of America at the time, and succeeds in creating the ultimate anti-hero whom people across America turned to. The film has a very simple storyline. Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) attempt to rob a bank, but only manage to get $1100. To make matters worse, the police arrive and the duo are trapped in the bank with 12 hostages. Sidney Lumet had already proved his ability to direct long conversational scenes with his masterpiece '12 Angry Men', but Dog Day Afternoon', as mentioned before, does so in a much more sympathetic manner. The audience feels real sympathy for Sonny, despite his criminal intentions. The character struggles through life as so many Americans did at the time. Sonny is kind hearted, and his inexperience and struggles only earn him more sympathy. Al Pacino portrays Sonny in a very realistic manner, based upon the real life Sonny whose attempted robbery inspired the film. The sympathy and support for Sonny is intensified further when crowds in the film cheer him on, and the issue of homosexuality was raised, being a controversial topic. These make 'Dog Day Afternoon' an almost unbearably realistic film, and this only enhances the quality of its direction. The mixed pace of the film, sometimes fast and sometimes slow only intensifies the confusion experienced by Sonny, and again intensifies the sympathy toward him. The film is intense, and this is a result of the pace as the audience feels the anger and frustration that the characters do, unaware of what will happen. This is a very successful feature of the film. However, this does remove the ability to revisit the film regularly as the impact is not the same the second time around. Nevertheless, I consider 'Dog Day Afternoon' to be one of Pacino's best films, and also John Cazale's second best performance. The chemistry between Pacino and Cazale (real life friends) is clearly visible on screen and adds massively to the film's emotion, especially at the end. Had the film not been up against 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' for the Best Picture Oscar in 1976, I am sure that 'Dog Day Afternoon' would have won.

Many have seen it, some have wounded it, none have claimed it. He can neither forgive nor forget this loss, and travels out to sea, hunting the creature like a predator stalks its prey, risking the lives of his crew, with no other gain in sight than to destroy it. His pride and his hatred seals the fate of all of them. Based on the Norman Melville novel(which I have not read(so I can draw no comparisons), albeit I do know the gist of it... who doesn't?), this is a truly epic picture. It's gorgeously shot, with astonishing FX(I have no idea how they made it appear so real back then... the exceptions being the green-screens). Gregory is not the only one to nail his given role... everyone is compelling in this. The lines, dialog and monologue alike, are delivered with a true passion that makes the flowery prose(much of it straight from the book, as it should be) even more effective. Ray Bradbury's script is phenomenal. The pace is tight, with every scene providing development and\/or excitement. You get a real sense of how harsh the conditions were back then, and how much worse still they are on this journey. It feels like you're there on the quest with them. The characters are all memorable. They got some perfect types, physically and as far as attitude goes.

The ways in which a fighter gets exploited by gangsters and gambling interests are depicted very convincingly and the negative effects that sudden success can have on a young boxer are also portrayed in a style which is both powerful and authentic.The events that take place during the fighter's rise from obscurity to world championship level involve a great deal of intrigue, intensity and drama and no doubt, this is exactly what inspired so many other filmmakers to produce similar types of movies which frequently featured many of the same situations that are seen in Body And Soul.Charley Davis (John Garfield) is a fighter from New York's lower East Side who's determined to escape the impoverished circumstances that he and his mother find themselves in after his father is accidentally killed when the speakeasy next to his candy store is bombed. Ignoring his mother's wishes, Charley decides to pursue a career in boxing.Charley's best friend Shorty Polaski (Joseph Pevney)had become his manager after convincing local trainer Quinn (William Conrad) to take Charley on and soon after, Quinn arranges a series of fights in which Charley is so successful that he attracts the attention of a gangster called Roberts (Lloyd Gough) who's the most powerful figure in the boxing business in New York. Roberts promises Charley a title fight but the cost is high as Roberts demands a 50% cut of Charley's earnings and the effective sidelining of Shorty.Roberts arranges a fixed fight for Charley against the ageing middleweight champion Ben Chaplin (Canada Lee) who has a blood clot on his brain. Charley is told nothing about his opponent's condition and after a punishing contest during which Ben takes a large number of blows to the head, his manager understandably feels double crossed by Roberts.Shorty is appalled when he discovers the circumstances surrounding the fight and after telling Charley what he knows, resigns. Tragically, he then gets beaten up by one of Roberts' henchmen and still groggy after his beating, staggers into the street where he gets run down and killed by a car.Peg (Lilli Palmer) had been Charley's loyal girlfriend since his earliest involvement in the fight game but after seeing what had happened to Shorty and becoming concerned about Roberts' activities, decided that she could no longer continue their relationship unless Charley decided to give up boxing. Predictably, Charley refused and then broke off their engagement.As Charley's success in the ring continues, he gambles heavily, becomes increasingly indebted to Roberts and starts seeing an acquisitive nightclub singer called Alice (Hazel Brooks). After an extended period as the champ, Charley is scheduled to fight a young contender in a fixed match which he's instructed to lose and to use his payment of $60,000 to bet against himself. How he deals with this situation proves to have significant consequences, not only for him, but also for Ben (who becomes his trainer) and Peg who starts to see a future for them together if Charley does finally give up boxing.The boxing sequences in Body And Soul were expertly filmed with hand held cameras being used to augment the work of the main camera crew and Francis D Lyon and Robert Parrish's contributions were recognised when they won the Oscar for Best Film Editing. John Garfield's performance won him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Abraham Polonsky also received an Oscar nomination for his marvellous screenplay.John Garfield gives a top class performance as the naive fighter who's seduced by the promise of wealth into a corrupt business where, in order to hit the big time, he has to make a Faustian deal which costs him his lifelong friendship with Shorty and damages his relationships with Peg and his mother. Lilli Palmer is excellent as the warm hearted Peg who's more intelligent than Charley and also has higher ethical standards. The supporting performances are also very good with Canada Lee making a particularly strong impression.

The ways in which a fighter gets exploited by gangsters and gambling interests are depicted very convincingly and the negative effects that sudden success can have on a young boxer are also portrayed in a style which is both powerful and authentic.The events that take place during the fighter's rise from obscurity to world championship level involve a great deal of intrigue, intensity and drama and no doubt, this is exactly what inspired so many other filmmakers to produce similar types of movies which frequently featured many of the same situations that are seen in Body And Soul.Charley Davis (John Garfield) is a fighter from New York's lower East Side who's determined to escape the impoverished circumstances that he and his mother find themselves in after his father is accidentally killed when the speakeasy next to his candy store is bombed. Ignoring his mother's wishes, Charley decides to pursue a career in boxing.Charley's best friend Shorty Polaski (Joseph Pevney)had become his manager after convincing local trainer Quinn (William Conrad) to take Charley on and soon after, Quinn arranges a series of fights in which Charley is so successful that he attracts the attention of a gangster called Roberts (Lloyd Gough) who's the most powerful figure in the boxing business in New York. Roberts promises Charley a title fight but the cost is high as Roberts demands a 50% cut of Charley's earnings and the effective sidelining of Shorty.Roberts arranges a fixed fight for Charley against the ageing middleweight champion Ben Chaplin (Canada Lee) who has a blood clot on his brain. Charley is told nothing about his opponent's condition and after a punishing contest during which Ben takes a large number of blows to the head, his manager understandably feels double crossed by Roberts.Shorty is appalled when he discovers the circumstances surrounding the fight and after telling Charley what he knows, resigns. Tragically, he then gets beaten up by one of Roberts' henchmen and still groggy after his beating, staggers into the street where he gets run down and killed by a car.Peg (Lilli Palmer) had been Charley's loyal girlfriend since his earliest involvement in the fight game but after seeing what had happened to Shorty and becoming concerned about Roberts' activities, decided that she could no longer continue their relationship unless Charley decided to give up boxing. Predictably, Charley refused and then broke off their engagement.As Charley's success in the ring continues, he gambles heavily, becomes increasingly indebted to Roberts and starts seeing an acquisitive nightclub singer called Alice (Hazel Brooks).

Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson.Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off.One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies.Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being Be Myself, A Shine on My Shoes, That's Entertainment, Dancing in the Dark, I Love Louisa, I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan and the joyously macabre, Triplets. These are then crowned magnificently by Girl Hunt, an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves.Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings.Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 November 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
