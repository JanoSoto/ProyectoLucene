This movie has everything the teenage girl is looking for (and even something for guys, too!) cute boys with accents, great choreography, excellent singing, a great cast of children and adults, and a wonderful message. In fact, I nearly started tearing up when I heard Christian Bale's beautiful voice crooning Santa Fe.  There are a few slow parts, I must admit, like the scenes with Pulitzer and his men, but those are few and far between.

She sends in the wrong transcript by mistake, of some loser with a  D average and combined SAT of 900, and he gets rejected. So he tries to get in by meeting a Stanford trustee, but his entire family due to pure bad luck spoils all his chances. His only recourse is to drive over, and talk it over with the Dean of Admissions. What makes this movie so funny is how Colin Hanks (Tom Hanks's son) is the straight man, while every single person he's surrounded by is incredibly nutty and neurotic. It's got the same charm as Seinfeld, as each person gets a moment to steal the show. Jack Black is his druggie brother, John Lithgow is his obsessive father, Catherine O'Hara (Home alone) is the neurotic mother.Aside from that, there are a bunch of cameos, from Ivan Reitman to Ben Stiller to Chevy Chase and Kevin Kline.

It's a complete rip off of another film's central premise (and an episode of Red Dwarf).

And is that not the thing that was worth it? But in Meg Ryan's case, I am sorry but I saw right thru her. Her acting is too fake. Not real enough to prove me that she is Kate. How Hugh Jackman acted. I was convinced that he was Leopold. He was a duke, and Kate was, Meg Ryan trying to fit the role. As one can tell Hugh Jackman has been nominated for best actor and he deserves it. I do believe that Meg Ryan was not nominated at all. But the movie was over all wonderful for a person like me who thinks that Hugh Jackman rises above all. The movie is worth the price to pay. Hugh Jackman has a way of playing his character, so that he is real.

Meg Ryan wasn't wonderful, as you see, when she always acts. She acts like the kind of person she is. My saying is,'A great actor is someone who acts what they are not.'. Hugh Jackman played his role very well, it was odd yet amusing. Its was funny and yet sad. I cannot say if Hugh Jackman was very good, but to me I was satisfied. I was pleased.

Julianne Moore shines; however it'd have been a lot better if Jodie Foster had played Clarice, since she acted in the first one. I really didn't like the fact that Jodie Foster is not acting in this movie; since she was wonderful to star as Clarice in the silence of the lambs, she made it so great. Anyway I think Julianne Moore was very well cast to replace Jodie Foster's character. I just couldn't believe Jodie Foster turned down this role; I have no idea why she did it, since she won an academy award for best actress in a leading role in the silence of the lambs in 1992. The movie is not as bad as many people said through the comments. I think they just compare it with the silence of the lambs. `The silence of the lambs' was pretty good too. But `Hannibal' kept me in more suspense, so I just think it wasn't that bad. Many people say it was disgusting, yes, sort of, but this is what a criminal can do to others. I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors in Hollywood. I like most of his movies. Maybe his performance as Hannibal Lecter made me follow the movie without disliking it. It was great to see this sequel and I think the ending was quite good and different. I like when Hannibal is on the plane and gave a kid a piece of his food, which was a piece of brain. I also like as he cuts his hand off to save Clarice. I thought he was going to cut Clarice's hand off, but he didn't. It shows us the true side of a criminal. What a different love story! It also shows us that the worst psycho is capable of falling in love with another person.Overall, I don't think this is an excellent movie; nevertheless it shouldn't be entirely dismissed, since it's not that bad 8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2002","score":"","review":"  Having seen this, I just think I didn't waste my time by watching it.

On the one hand, compared to Daisy, Conan's dialogue, acting, plot, human insight etc. are laughable, at best.  On the other hand, I am fairly sure that Conan could kick Miss Daisy's butt.  So I think the only fair way to do this is to review Conan as an example of its genre -- does Conan do what it set out to do?And if that's the scale, then Conan is a great movie.  This is not the gentle tale of a friendship which buds over a period of decades between an elderly southern lady and her black chauffeur, this is the tale of a musclebound barbarian who watches his family get slaughtered when he is a kid, and dedicates the remainder of his exceedingly violent life to seeking revenge on the guys who did it -- you just can't judge the two movies on the same scale.  Does Conan have its limitations when it comes to acting? Yes, emphatically.  But does that seriously detract from this movie doing what it sets out to accomplish?  Not in the least.  A movie like this doesn't need pinpoint acting and deep, insightful conversation, it needs some serious butt-kicking going on from start to finish -- and that is what this movie delivers in spades.Arnold simply IS Conan, and with the exception of one unintentionally hilarious episode with a giant latex snake, the movie rarely strays into cheesiness.  It was actually one of the few fantasy flicks before the current Lord of the Rings triology to have the guts to take the genre seriously -- its actors all deliver patently ridiculous lines with complete conviction (especially James Earl Jones, who is great), and the result is that this movie is NOT a joke (unlike its much inferior sequel which was almost a parody).  This movie is brutal and primitive, and that is exactly as it should be -- even Arnold's broken English fits the part perfectly (not to mention his ridiculous physique).  Conan hacks a wide and bloody path through his world, and its great fun if this is your sort of thing.  Two warnings however first, between all of the blood and body parts flying around this may be the ultimate NON-chick flick -- don't expect your girlfriend to get it; second, this movie is such a testosterone rush that you really shouldn't try to drive or operate heavy machinery for at least six hours after viewing it. 8\/10 (with special mention to the awesome soundtrack -- as perfectly barbaric as the rest of the movie).
