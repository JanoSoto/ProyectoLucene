[{"date":"25 August 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Jim Carrey delivers a superb performance as Andy Kaufman. Carrey clearly did his homework in preparation for his role as all of Kaufman's mannerisms, speech, facial expressions, and body movements are nailed down perfectly. Here's a role that perhaps only Kaufman himself could of played better. This film, in addition to his work in Truman Show, solidifies Carrey as a legit film actor who can perform brilliantly in dramatic roles.In fact, drama is the strength and backbone of this film. Although no serious film about Andy Kaufman could of been made without showing the comical genius of the comedian\/entertainer, the film's best moments are when it takes you behind the scenes and show Kaufman as a human being and his deep relationships with his friends, not just a silly Kaufman on stage as either a prankster or wrestler or comedian.Perhaps my only problems with the film were the recreations of televised footage of Kaufman such as when he appeared on Saturday Night Live, David Letterman Show, Taxi, or his wrestling matches. What I would of love see is to transpose Carrey's image over Kaufman's image (ala Forrest Gump style) in those real footages and thus allow the audience to see the actual events as they had taken place.

To see the Muppets playing themselves, as they did in the first 3 movies before Jim Henson passed away, instead of some adaptation of a classic story, excited me. Unfortunately, when Jim Henson died, the heart of the Muppets went with him. While he tried to draw more adults to The Muppet Show, even going so far as titling the pilot Sex and Violence, this one caters a bit more to the younger bunch, with some awfully misused '70s music and an ex-Nickelodeon director. Why Jerry Juhl and co. were apparently afraid that the movie wouldn't attract enough kids is a mystery to me, but here we have an opening scene set to Brick House. Unfortunately, the bottom line is that this movie is just not that funny. Bordering on brilliance at times with a hilarious scene borrowed from Independence Day and a cameo by Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson (I wish Dawson was here), the rest of the movie just chugs along with too many unfunny jokes. Yes, Steve Whitmire finally has Kermit down to an art, and all the Muppeteers do fantastic jobs, and Jeffrey Tambor does a great job with the material, but once again I stress, NOT FUNNY. So sorry. I'll go back to The Great Muppet Caper now. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 August 1999","score":"","review":"  As a die-hard Muppet fan, I'd been waiting for this one forever.
