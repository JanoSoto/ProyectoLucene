Since then, every film I have watched has not met the bar which had been set so very high&#x85; until Before Sunrise. Why is this the best film of all time? Because you will struggle to find another film like it. The plot is so straightforward; a boy is on a train to catch a flight which will head him back to America alongside a girl on the same train who is travelling back to France. They both meet in conversation and together, decide to spend the next 24 hours within the beautiful and gorgeous city of Vienna. Sounds like an easy and simple plot but what makes this film so enthralling and interesting is what happens in Vienna and the thoughts and feelings expressed by the two lead characters, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who portray such outstanding and realistic performances which make you forget that they are just acting. This is a film which consists heavily of pure dialogue which may put off some people; however that is the beauty of the film. There are no explosions, car chases or action scenes but simply two people exploring each other inside a wonderful city debating about such topics such as Reincarnation, Death, Love and many more. The conversations are so real, so vivid and so dreamlike that it makes the film it own. It's almost as though they are in an alternate reality where their normal routine life is put to a hold and they escape inside a dream world. Towards the end where the night is over and the sun has risen, Ethan Hawke's character Jesse quotes that they have gone back into real time which shows that the moments they have shared and the collection of memories that they have made, are those which will last forever in their own little world and time. A classical romance which does well to stray away from the old cheesy and clichéd films of that genre, Before Sunrise is superbly filmed and wonderfully acted with rich, pure and realistic dialogue making it one of those rare films that shine with magnificence, a film that everyone has to see.

This film is one of my favorite fantasy films of all time, their really hasn't been another film like it, nor to I feel they make films like this anymore. The late great Jim Henson whom is one of my favorite effects masters, this was his first movie and I feel still one of his best, it's a real shame he didn't direct more movies because I would of loved to of seen what more he could of done with his puppet specialty.The production value is great like the use of the locales. This film it's all puppets which is amazing, this was a gutsy move but it works because this film after all takes place in another world so it makes sense there wouldn't be anything human. But they really pushed the puppetering designs and effects to the limit and broke it, it I felt demonstrated that you can do more with puppetering, tell other stories with it not just comedy.The story I think is great, it's the simple fantasy motif of freeing the land from an evil that has ruled. But what makes the work is where it takes place and that is the fact it's in another world. This was a brilliant idea which I don't really see done much in most fantasies or RPG's. What intrigues me about this otherworld and story is this broad sense of mystic and depth that revolves throughout the film. As it progresses we begin to discover hidden aspects in culture, enviorment,animals and characters. There is just so much to see and discover, it's something where words can't do it justice you just have to see for yourself to believe it. Some questions are answered but others still to this day (unless a sequel is made) are still a mystery, I still at times can't help but wonder, What are all of those other planets on Augra's mobile star chart model is our planet there also? or even What more was there to this Gelfling civilization? Usually unanswered questions can hurt a story but I feel if executed right it can believe it or not give the fantasy world a greater sense of depth because you feel that there can be anything in this world and anything can be possible.And I really love the score from one of my favorite composers Trevor Jones. The score is just fantastic it really has a broad epic and mysterious tone to it and in some places really conveys emotion.The characters are also very good; the Skekis are very good villains. I really like the design of them they all look almost like giant grotesque birds. Which perfectly reflect the rotten nature of them. I like that each of them have a slight unique persona but are equally corrupt, pathetic, deceitful, power addicted, just almost all the above on bad. But I also like how their kinda funny sometimes. My favorite moment with them was the Trial by Stone scene. I thought that test was cool because it was basically the Sword and the Stone principle in the reverse, this test was one of will power.Augra is a fun supporting character, she looks almost like a lost sister to Patty and Selma from The Simpsons. She's a wise but grouchy and eccentric scientist that probably doesn't get out much.But to me the characters I really like are Jen and Kira whom are solid and sympathetic protagonists since their the last of their kind. I like how both are drawn out where you actually do care about them and what their doing matters. I like how different both are, Jen is sort of an intellectual since his specialties are in music, reading\/writing, and open to new and old wisdom; he's also sort of the passive aggressive type. Kira is my favorite, she's almost like the mythological goddess of spring since she is intuned with nature with her ability to communicate, but like that she's a warm, strong, feisty, and aggressive female. I really like the chemistry between both Jen and Kira both play off each other well, you do sense there is growth. It is a friendship but you can see as they spend more time together, it becomes love. Sure there no love scene between then, but you know both are meant for each other and will become more in the future. The dynamic between both of them you can say is almost biblical allegory.

And I loved it. It's easily my one of my favorite David Lynch film up there with Blue Velvet and Elephant Man. Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me is a perfect example of atmospheric, surreal horror at it's very best. I loved the creepy and unsettling images, the otherworldly performances by the cast and Lynch's flawless direction. Yes, it doesn't make that much sense, but here the plot isn't whats important. The character of Laura Palmer and the atmosphere are the elements you should be focusing on, rather than trying to piece together what's going on. The central performance by Sheryl Lee is absolutely great. I love very intense, operatic performances, especially if they are done in David Lynch\/David Cronnenberg films. The only problem with the cast is the age of so called teenagers. Sheryl Lee looks slightly too old for the character she was playing, but that didn't bother me that much since she completely immersed me with her exceptional performance. The supporting cast provide your usual types of performance you would see in David Lynch's films. From terrifying and creepy to goofy. Watch out for the appearance by David Bowie and enjoy the terrible line deliveries by Mr. Lynch himself.Everything about Fire Walk With Me worked. The soundtrack was exceptional and created a very strange mood that's both unsettling and very relaxing at the same time. Visually it's as good looking as other works from Lynch. It's absolutely beautifully shot and the surreal atmosphere just draws you in as you watch it. There are many problems with it but they just didn't bother me at all.

And go watch as a standalone film and forget that the show ever existed. If you can do that, you will significantly increase the chance of enjoying this great film for what it is.

So when I found a copy of this, naturally I was excited. I heard it was incredibly beautiful and a masterpiece in all senses. And, I couldn't disagree. While I like Badlands a bit more, this still is in my top 15. Days of Heaven is, IMO, the most beautiful movie ever made. IMO, even topping off Lawrence of Arabia. Badlands was very beautiful as well, but you can see how low the budget was in some scenes. In this, you can see that Malick had more money and more time, so this does feel more perfect. It's not only about the look, but even if you don't like the film, you can't really say anything negative about the cinematography. This was mostly shot during the magic hour, when evening is turning into the night and when the dawn is turning to a morning. So naturally that will lead to great cinematography. And there are no epic shots of the sun or anything like that, just the endless fields and that one haunting house. That house is one of the most haunting things about this film. I don't know why. Maybe it's how it was shot, it reminded me about Norman Bates's house (Psycho). A large house, lonely looking house, almost like an haunted house. Before the camera shows the house, we see it like an castle. Where the evil ruler lives. Like Badlands, this movie delves into philosophical questions about love, commitment, human nature, the alfa-male and like Badlands, your destiny. Or is there a destiny. Also I noticed religious theme and a sub-story about growing up. Mainly the little girl grows up during the film. How he sees the dark side of humans, and realizes that nobody's perfect. But Richard Gere's character doesn't grow up. He never takes any responsibility and manipulates people for his own benefit. He is a anti-hero, but charming though. This is a really interesting film on how it's written. If there would have been a different director, he would have put an villain in this film. But Malick doesn't. There was a great opportunity to show their boss as the bad guy, but no. We actually grow to like him, even more than Gere's character. At least I felt sympathy for him and he had more morals than Gere. And that's the kind of character who would be the bad guy in any other movie, but Malic shows him as an human being, not some stereotypical guy who took his girlfriend. The end of the film is brilliant. When the harvest burns down. That is one of the most haunting and emotional scenes ever filmed. There's some symbolism in there, mainly religious. How their lives burn down as well, how everything they worked on burned down, how everything was destroyed, physically and emotionally. But also the last 5-10 minutes are very haunting and kinda ambigiuos. We don't really know what will happen to the girl, we (kinda) know what happened to Brooke Adams and what happened to Gere, but she just wanders off with another girl, not having a plan or a future. In a strange way a beautiful ending. The music is perfect, haunting, emotional, beautiful and really goes well with the visual look. Malick's direction is subtle and intelligent, cinematography is the greatest ever, can't complain about the performances, all around a perfect movie.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Terrence Malick made one of my favorite movies ever, Badlands.

This film is perfect in so many ways. It truly depicts the terrible nature of the Holocaust and one of mankind's darkest hours very beautifully.The film starts out by showing us Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party who you would want to be friends with if you were alive at the time. He has money, connections, and charm. Who wouldn't want to be on his good side? Oskar is shown as a womanizing, egotistical, opportunist who is looking to make money off of cheap labor, aka the Jews. If someone were to watch this movie before knowing anything about Schindler and what he did, they might dislike him at first. However, he's also one of the few people in the movie who never despises the Jews. He did not care about the fact that his accountant, Itzhak Stern, was Jewish, even before he made the decision to save as many Jewish people as he could. He doesn't hate them, but at the same time, he doesn't feel he owes them anything.As the movie moves forward, you gradually see Schindler's change in attitude, brought on by his accidental witnessing of the ghetto liquidation. Like many of us, his eyes follow a young girl in a red coat as she walks through the streets and runs into a building to safety. In my foolishness, I genuinely thought she had a chance at making it. Seeing her rather gruesome looking body being carted off to be incinerated was extremely disturbing for me because of that. That is also the scene in which Schindler really came to realize what a horrible regime this was. He looked horrified when he saw her body. Soon after, he begins to develop his list, paving the way for the rest of the movie.There are so many moving scenes in this film. The ones that made me either want to cry or actually cry were the result of a build up of emotions from earlier in the film. For example, I can never hold in my emotion when Schindler and his wife are about to flee the country. Seeing him cry over the fact that he didn't give up even more and save just one more life really told me what this film was trying to get across; every human life is precious. The scene when each survivor and the actors who portrayed them put a rock on his grave also made me cry. When Emilie Schindler, his widow, came up to put it on his grave, she couldn't even reach it from her wheelchair, so the actress who played her did it for her. When she was being wheeled off, she looked back at his grave with an expression I can't even describe, like she wished she didn't have to leave her husband's grave, yet she also looked proud of what he had done.Liam Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler was phenomenal. He used just the right amount of charm and emotion needed for this character. His natural charm shows through, making him even more perfect for this character. In him, I can sense Schindler's confusion, doubt, and the obligation he feels to save 'his people'. His portrayal was Oscar-worthy.My absolute favorite portrayal in the film was Ralph Fiennes as the brutal, real life SS officer Amon Goeth. To put it lightly, the man was a psychopath who murdered anyone he desired, usually just for the heck of it. It was extremely hard to watch him shooting people at point blank-range because they simply did a small thing to set off his violent temper. The creepy obsession he had with his his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, made his character even more complex. He hates himself for feeling these things for a Jew, so he takes it out on her by beating her brutally. It's hard to believe such a nightmarish character actually existed and did even more gruesome things than showed in the film. Survivors on set found it difficult to be around Fiennes because he reminded them so much of the real Amon Goeth.If you have not seen this film, please do, it will be worth it and if you truly understand what messages they're trying to convey, it will stay with you for a very long time.

It's not. This smart comedy is about how both sexes perceive themselves and each other. Dustin Hoffman plays actor Michael Dorsey, who's a dramatic purist. He wants to bring pure art to theatre whether people like it or not, like feeding spinach to a toddler. He's trying to raise money for a rather dismal play about people moving back to the location of a toxic waste disaster, Love Canal. In the meantime Michael is trying to get his aspiring actress friend, Sandy, a job on a soap opera. She doesn't even make the first cut. Later Michael has a show-down with his agent, George, who basically tells him he's been labeled as trouble and nobody will ever hire him.These two events come together and the next shot - on the streets of New York City - is Dustin Hoffman dressed as a middle aged lady going after the part that Sandy crashed and burned at the previous day -he's going to prove his agent wrong. At first Michael\/Dorothy looks like she's going to be snubbed too, but by using what he knows the soap opera wants in the character as fake personal characteristics he gets a reading and gets the part.Now the hard part, he has to keep up this charade without anybody knowing, especially Sandy, since as an actual woman she couldn't get this job. Here is where Michael makes his first mistake. Waiting for Sandy to come out of the bathroom he undresses and tries on some of her clothes since he is going to need a wardrobe. Sandy comes out unexpectedly, Michael is standing in his underwear. Michael's reaction? Tell this extremely vulnerable woman that you want her and sleep with her of course! This really made me dislike Michael. Sandy even recognizes this might just be sex and says she'd like her pain now. But, no, Michael falsely promises it's the beginning of a relationship. It is not.Michael starts out his job with two quests - to raise enough money to do the Love Canal play himself, and to prove to his agent that people can work with him. But then the problems begin. He begins to catch on as a performer and his\/her little bits about handling difficult men in the workplace cause Michael\/Dorothy to become a feminist hero, the show's ratings rise, and scads of fan mail arrive. Most of all, Michael becomes interested in Julie (Jessica Lange) an actress on the show who is involved with the lecherous director of the show (Dabney Coleman). Although Michael demonizes the guy, he really isn't treating Julie any worse than Michael is treating Sandy. Remember Sandy? Waiting for dinners that never happen and dates that are never kept? Michael\/Dorothy also gets a taste of how aggressive men can be when they want something or someone, and in the process of courting Julie he attracts the romantic attention of Julie's father, old fashioned widower Les (Charles Durning). Michael also discovers what women say they want from men isn't always the truth, even when they (think they) are talking to another woman.Special mention to Sydney Pollack as Michael's agent. He was perfect as a guy at his wit's end dealing with a person (Michael) who doesn't exactly have normal coping skills.

He's trying to raise money for a rather dismal play about people moving back to the location of a toxic waste disaster, Love Canal. In the meantime Michael is trying to get his aspiring actress friend, Sandy, a job on a soap opera. She doesn't even make the first cut. Later Michael has a show-down with his agent, George, who basically tells him he's been labeled as trouble and nobody will ever hire him.These two events come together and the next shot - on the streets of New York City - is Dustin Hoffman dressed as a middle aged lady going after the part that Sandy crashed and burned at the previous day -he's going to prove his agent wrong. At first Michael\/Dorothy looks like she's going to be snubbed too, but by using what he knows the soap opera wants in the character as fake personal characteristics he gets a reading and gets the part.Now the hard part, he has to keep up this charade without anybody knowing, especially Sandy, since as an actual woman she couldn't get this job.

Sandy comes out unexpectedly, Michael is standing in his underwear. Michael's reaction? Tell this extremely vulnerable woman that you want her and sleep with her of course! This really made me dislike Michael. Sandy even recognizes this might just be sex and says she'd like her pain now. But, no, Michael falsely promises it's the beginning of a relationship. It is not.Michael starts out his job with two quests - to raise enough money to do the Love Canal play himself, and to prove to his agent that people can work with him. But then the problems begin. He begins to catch on as a performer and his\/her little bits about handling difficult men in the workplace cause Michael\/Dorothy to become a feminist hero, the show's ratings rise, and scads of fan mail arrive. Most of all, Michael becomes interested in Julie (Jessica Lange) an actress on the show who is involved with the lecherous director of the show (Dabney Coleman). Although Michael demonizes the guy, he really isn't treating Julie any worse than Michael is treating Sandy. Remember Sandy? Waiting for dinners that never happen and dates that are never kept? Michael\/Dorothy also gets a taste of how aggressive men can be when they want something or someone, and in the process of courting Julie he attracts the romantic attention of Julie's father, old fashioned widower Les (Charles Durning). Michael also discovers what women say they want from men isn't always the truth, even when they (think they) are talking to another woman.Special mention to Sydney Pollack as Michael's agent.

The most obvious being a young gifted actor who died way young before his time. 10 something, Vern, a younger Jerry O'Connell, a fatty here (yes, the same guy, whose ordinary looks shot up, making him a romeo sort, later on) overhears a conversation about a dead body by some local thugs, while scrounging for cash underneath the porch of his house. He rushes back to tell his friends, and so begins a two day adventure to locate the body of a missing teen. Ideally this movie is one about the joys of friendship, where along the way they encounter adversity, home truths, imaginative stories, while also nearly getting run down by a train, on a tall bridge, that proved quite a hairy moment. And too we had that lake\/leech scene, one of them getting inside Jerry's drawers. The fat kid story told in great visual flashback was another of the treats in this fine film, plus bad and abused kid, Teddy, an excellent Feldman, who spits water in Vern's ear. When seeing Phoenix in this, and seeing him in later films, he seemed so different or he had grown up really quick. He's the best buddy of the other kid, Wil Wheaton through which this simple story and those imaginative ones are told. Wheaton's star should of shone brighter when judged by this performance, where he was really the only one who lucked out, later on as an actor. And now to put a rain on their damper, are the thugs in a convertible out to track down the body too, headed by Sutherland, who likes to smash a row of letter boxes with his baseball bat. The film's flow never bores or disappoints, and we learn things we wish we didn't about some of these poor kid's childhoods. Richard Dreyfuss as an older Wheaton adds a nice touch at the start, reminiscing, when reading one of the tabloids involving murdered best friend, Phoenix, while he returns at the end, in front of a computer screen, the author at work. The end where there's a standoff between the two groups again, failed to disappoint. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film. A near perfect film, it's fiftie's period captured beautifully. As a movie lover, it's a film, I urge you to see, if you haven't. Another scene of mention was in the candy store, Wheaton and the older owner, sharing conversation regarding the older and more favorable brother, (John Cusack) who had recently died, Wheaton, the excluded, the centre of blame by his father.

So what do we get with Resurrection? Well, as with Halloween 5, Michael's death is retold to show that he didn't really die; that he in fact traded places with a medic, going so far as putting his mask on the guy after crushing his larynx...because, obviously Michael knew that Laurie would steal the ambulance and decapitate the body.So Resurrection gives us the last battle between Laurie and Michael and ends with Laurie's death. Apparently, Jamie Lee Curtis would only reprise her role as Laurie if they killed her off...a rather smart move on her part because she could see where the franchise was headed.

I especially appreciated Harry Lennix's moments on screen, who's dialogue had the most 'character' and best portrayed the words spoken.I'm not sure what the intention of the direction was, but feel that it was either just some San Francisco (Frisco) Bay Area crap, which many other reviewers have also stated as being 'artsy' and 'high minded'. Or, that it was an attempt at allegory to display the decadence of the portrayed Roman period in relation to more contemporary times (again related to the Frisco culture). One should wonder what would result from a choice to give control of the nation, to the former mayor (Gavin Newsom).Though other reviewers have stated that 'this' is the worst film they've ever seen, I know that there are many more that would exceed it in that category. I would rate it as being alongside War Horse, though I spent most of my time viewing 'that' film 'laughing out loud' at its absurdity, as apposed to 'cringing' at the bad elements of this one.The best thing I can say about the movie, is that the DVD quality was exceptional, which along with the modern upscaling of my Blu Ray player and LED television, presented an HD-like picture quality with beautiful color and clarity.

The make-up used for The monster was so realistic. It did not take away from Karloff's features.What the make-up did do was dramatize his features. This created a more believable character. Being that this movie is black and white, I cant help but speak on the lighting. The lighting in this movie played a huge part in setting the mood of certain scenes. I don't want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it yet. However, pay attention to the specific scene where Frankenstein's creation is being lifted onto the roof top. The lighting in this scene is very dramatic. It's dark, chilling and extremely eerie. This is where the genius of movies comes into play. It's amazing how these effects set the tone for the audience.

I love the technical aspects of it as a film and then there is the timeless story. Few film versions of the Arthur legend capture the Once Upon a Time feeling of Excalibur, but director John Boorman bathes his mythic vision in blood and grime. Excalibur plays like great tragedy. As others have mentioned, even minor characters make an impression like the reluctant Uryens who has two or three brief but memorable scenes. All the leads do fine jobs carrying the film. Nigel Terry's transformation from the young, naive Arthur to the just and commanding king of legend is remarkable. It's hard to believe it's the same actor in this under-appreciated performance. Cherie Lunghi's portrayal of Guenevere is flawless and Helen Mirren appropriately vamps it up as the sorceress Morgana, bent on exacting unholy revenge. Her on screen chemistry with Nicol Williamson comes with a memorable repartee. Paul Geoffrey's Perceval is also an underrated performance that follows a similar trajectory to that of Terry's in that he plays the character across a broad spectrum of years beginning first as a lad. For a time, he carries the film. Nicholas Clay as Lancelot deserves more recognition, too. It saddens me that Clay died so young; the world was robbed of a great and talented actor. Here, he delivers dialogue with confidence and also undergoes a transformation that's very much in keeping with some of the source material. His ventures into the forests, where spends much of his time, provide opportunities to see some gorgeous, emerald landscapes &#x97; dark, mossy Irish forests &#x97; rendered dreamlike by Alex Thomson's cinematography. If Clay and Lunghi as Lancelot and Guenevere represent Excalibur's heart, Williamson's Merlin is its soul. He embodies a world of dreams and magic, of pagan nature religion in the autumn of its days as Christianity spreads throughout the land. The heady mix of pagan and Christian imagery and symbolism is a leitmotif as embodied in the juxtaposition of Merlin and Arthur. There's nary a dragon to be found except for the metaphorical variety. Here the real monsters are only men and women and our greatest adversaries are ourselves.
