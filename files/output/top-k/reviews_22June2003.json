Above all, the acting by all the principal characters is outstanding, and the writers & director were successful in preventing the film from degenerating into just another early-afternoon soap opera.  The well-crafted and surprising (and, in all fairness, rather unrealistic) conclusion made the story ultimately palatable.As a man watching the movie I tried to be objective, but within the first 30 minutes my allegiences were squarely with Ted (Dustin).  Upon realizing his abandonment and understanding his predicament, he immediately reconfigures his priorities to care for his son, even to the point where it costs him his job (which, we are led to believe, was the totality of his existence).  Then Joanna (Meryl) has the audacity to return from wherever, spout the nauseautingly familiar mid-70's feminist tripe about finding herself and getting away from an oppressive home life, and THEN ask for her kid back.  Not exactly a character that would generate any sympathy in my view.  In fact (again, straining to be objective), it seems to me that the entire picture is oriented to make Ted (not Joanna) the object of sympathy.  I wonder if other people had the same impression.  From a legal perspective, KRAMER vs. KRAMER doesn't cover the divorce itself -- it just sort of happens within a year or so; no mention of how it happened.  The courtroom battle of course relates to the custody issue and, contrary to some, I found this element of the movie rather weak.  Ted's counsel could have made a stronger case, and Joanna's case was (in my not entirely unprejudiced view) rather flimsy.  However, the overall outcome probably wouldn't have been any different in the real world, and so perhaps the producers chose not to devote an overwhelming amount of time to this sequence so that it wouldn't become the centerpiece of the film.In summary, a film I was surprised to find enjoyable and, based on the competition (and I'm not a big APOCALYPSE fan), a worthy Best Picture winner for 1979.

Manhunter is by far the weaker movie, in a variety of ways. First off, the protagonist, Graham, is not as complex as Starling. While he supposedly habitually goes too deep into the mindset of a psychopath, at no point did he seem anything other than an apt cop to me, whereas Starling was a cop dealing with her outsider status as a woman, an orphan, and a farm girl, thus resulting in a multi-layered and more believable character. Secondly, the main villain is not as well-defined. The Tooth Fairy has seemingly no past and no well-defined psychosis and is played by Tom Noonan as what might be creepy if we knew what he was thinking behind his ominous silences. In contrast, Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill is truly loathsome, with a well-defined psychosis centering on sexual change and a performance that is convincingly chilling. Finally, the relationship between Graham and Lecter is not very well-defined, as compared to that of Starling and Lecter. I do not demand that Lecter appear more, although Brian Cox's portrayal could have proven better than that of Hopkins if we knew anything about the good doctor, yet those unfamiliar with the character will have no idea why Graham is so afraid of him. My complaint is that Graham's main character trait seems to be his being haunted by his past with Lecter, and yet that past is never clearly defined. The haunting thoughts of the psychosis are never really dramatized, and Lecter's cannibalism is never revealed at any point.However, there are some things to recommend this movie. Petersen, Farina, and especially Cox give great performances, but they are trapped in a film that fails to appropriately flesh out their conflicts.

This movie may not of had all of the high-tech animation but the emotion that is clearly shown in this movie is enough to move anyone!  I have and will continue to recommend this movie to everyone! It's a great movie to watch alone, or with a group. I love the movie Pete's Dragon and I hope you give this movie a chance, you won't regret it!!!   ","genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 June 2003","score":"","review":"  Whereas the story of how the old democratic republic slowly comes to an end could be very interesting, it is simply not told. Ten-thousand (!) solar systems have joined a separatist movement.. Why? This is one part of the story which I would like to have been told. Of course, this is only one of the numerous plot errors in the film. Furthermore, the acting performance of Mr. Christensen is devastating for the film in its totality, only to be saved by the light-hearted hints at humour and excellent performance of Ewan McGregor.The special effects of this movie would have positively astounded anyone in the seventies, however, nowadays this is often the case, and although I was impressed, it is simply not enough. In sharp contrast with the old trilogy, in which a desperate rebel force is ridiculously outnumbered by an evil empire, the choices that the so-called wise Jedi make seem somewhat ridiculous at times. Why, for example, send in a Jedi force to deal with some droids near the end of the film? The best trained warriors ever to exist fighting a couple of mass-produced droids in a local conflict? Naturally, some of this can be explained away by the presence of the Dark side of the force, but SOME logic would be nice.Lastly, what was dearly missed in this episode is some sense of fun. At no time did this film bring even as much as a smile to my face, despite the heroic efforts of McGregor, as mentioned before.On the other hand, the story told is, indeed, extremely serious, since there is no New Hope, more the other way round The menacing threat of the upcoming evil empire on the horizon.In its entirety , it remains an interesting film to watch, despite the non-existent chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, which make the romantic scenes very non-convincing. The story, of course, continues, and I'm very curious how part three will link up with the old trilogy.
