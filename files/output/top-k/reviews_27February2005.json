We have again Clarice Starling here (this time played by Julianne Moore), who this time is searching the world for the escaped and highly dangerous Hannibal Lector. She is not the only one. Mason Verger, once being a patient and one could say admirer of Lector (and became obsessed of him), wants to take revenge for something Lector did to him years ago (which I will and can not reveal here).Although I really admired The Silence of the Lambs for its quality and shocking moments, I tried not to have too great expectations and watched Hannibal for its sake and partly for the cast (Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta and of course Gary Oldman) which leaves almost no wishes left. Almost because of Julianne Moore, but I'll come back to it later. Unfortunately I have to admit that Hannibal not only cannot compare to the quality of The Silence of Lambs, it does not even reach the level of average. There are one or two surprising moments in the plot but are they neither scary nor shocking, they sometimes just look ridiculous and most of the time simply disgusting. Although Hannibal has some kind of a plot (people hunting Lector for personal reasons) until the last second you just don't get where it's aiming at. There is no structure No preface, no climax, no resolution. People just get together, part, meet another people and now and then somebody dies. The hunt for Lector leads to nowhere and I'd say there is only one highlight, when Lector and Clarice meet at last and he does something very strange but beautiful to her (we're not talking about sex here). But all in one the movie is boring, celebrates the cleverness of Lector and the (emotional) coolness of Clarice from time to time but besides this doesn't even make the effort to deal closer with the four protagonists, their feelings etc. That's why the viewer cannot feel with them and after ½ hour asks himself Why should I worry about them at all if even the script doesn't? Talking of the script Either it was not finished or changed so often by so many people that one just doesn't understand what they wanted to say with this film.A word about the cast Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as usual and just a pleasure to watch. Ray Liotta has an unthankful role as Starling's boss for reasons I cannot reveal but if you see the movie you'll understand why. Gary Oldman shines through this movie mess and even manages to save his ridiculous role (with his unique sarcasm) and give it some dignity, but actually has an unthankful role too. The worst thing about Hannibal is Julianne Moore. Jodie Foster wasn't a very emotional Clarice, too, but still she is a great actress, she could add a dignity, sex-appeal and a fragility to this role that Moore can only dream of. Julianne Moore is just a bad actress, lacking class, charisma and basically everything that is human &#150; I think if you replaced her by a dummy and let someone speak her lines from off screen you wouldn't notice a difference. And by miscasting the leading role the producers basically ruined the movie from the beginning on. All in one I'd say that the only reason (or three reasons) why you should see this movie are its male protagonists, but Hannibal is just boring and dumb and cannot in any way be compared to The Silence of the Lambs. In fact, this sequel is an insult to the first film. So if you want to see a good movie, do yourself a favour and watch the original instead. Don't, just don't ever do a sequel to a great movie &#150; when will Hollywood learn that at last???

On the way, they run into a shipwrecked Paul Sarone (Jon Voight), a bizarre character who claims to be an Paraguayan priest-in-training turned snake hunter. Although oddly captivating, there's something fishy about Sarone, who claims to have first-hand knowledge of the Shirishama. Is he helping them out or leading them into danger? Although much maligned by some genre fans, Anaconda deserves accolades. While those looking for strict realism might be disappointed, Anaconda is a brilliant, genre-bending film, with just the right blend of beautiful cinematography, excellent but quirky performances, well directed and edited suspense and action scenes, and compelling monsters--both serpentine and human.The construction of the film is relatively simple--it is basically a Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)-styled horror\/thriller\/adventure film. Director Luis Llosa is a Roger Corman alumnus; the depth of Anaconda's characterizations and structure may seem surprising in light of its pulpy exterior.The ensemble cast is fantastic, and I especially love Jon Voight's performance, which to me is Oscar-caliber. Voight turns out to be a snake of a man, and he's just as much if not more the villain of the film. Everything about him is enigmatic, charismatic and threatening--all at the same time, even including his mannerisms and strange accent, which belies his cover story.Keeping with snakes as a theme, Llosa structured the film so that it begins with wide Amazonian vistas but gradually narrows its scope&#151;visually\/environmentally and with classic horror-styled Ten Little Indians knockoffs--becoming tight, claustrophobic, and horrifically constricting.But of course there are real snakes in the film, by way of an effective combination of animatronics, CGI and live, smaller snakes. Two animatronic snakes were made, costing millions--one 25 feet long, one 40 feet long, and each weighing at least 1000 pounds. Animatronics and CGI might not sound like something that would come across as provoking compelling thrills for an audience, but thanks to the deftness of the effects crew and the skill of the actors, the attack scenes are tense and enthralling. Unlike many modern films, Llosa keeps the action crisp, well choreographed, continuous and well lit. Of course, the performances were aided by the fact that the snakes, although animatronic, really were dangerous to the actors--a wrong move (or one electronics glitch--the mechanical beasties had at least a hundred mechanisms a piece, controlled by computers) could result in being crushed by what amounted to a medium-sized truck.If that wasn't exotic and dangerous enough, Llosa had the cast and a crew of 200 flown down to the Amazon for a five-week shoot. There are scenes in which tens of real snakes were used, many of which subsequently got lost in the set, to the dismay of some snake-fearing cast members. This aided in depicting the increasing emotional tension throughout the film that is its driving force. The Amazon shoot also provided frequently beautiful cinematographic backgrounds.Although superficially, Anaconda seems to be a thin, effects-heavy monster movie, Llosa and crew made an excellent film by sticking to the basics--telling a great story with great actors who have chemistry together, and showing them working through a series of conflicts and manipulations with often-tragic results.

Unfortunately, more disturbing than the plot holes, are that a lot of the special effects are not very well done. Either it is apparent that the train for example is a model or that the scenes are filmed in a studio with background added separately. Other than that the movie delivers exactly what I expected. Seagal is as he usually is, Heigl is good as the niece, her character could have been given a little more time and space and McGill and Bogosian are good bad guys. And Chestnut is a great sidekick to Seagal. So, settle down in the couch and let yourself be taken for a ride.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"27 February 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After the fire explosion that occurred in Halloween II, Michael Myers has been in a deep coma over the last ten years...and apparently over these ten years Laurie Strode(heroine from one and two)has died in a car crash, leaving daughter Jamie behind in the care of the Carruthers family. Unfortunately for her, Michael is about to wake up from his very long nap... During a routine transfer from the Richmond Mental Institute on a rainy Halloween Eve, Michael awakens in the back of an ambulance and proceeds to kill everyone on it(even using his thumb)... and thanks to the discussion that the personnel were having about his young niece living in Haddonfield, Michael once again sets his sights on the quiet little community that he terrorized ten years earlier.Upset by the fact that the doctors let it be taken out of the hospital, Doctor Loomis(Pleasance)makes his way to Haddonfield to warn Jamie and her foster family. Along the way, however, he runs into Myers at a gas station and ultimately loses his ride in a fiery explosion (caused by Myers). Now Loomis has to hitchhike, giving our favorite psycho a head start towards Haddonfield. Suspense and thrills galore as Michael arrives during trick-or-treating time and proceeds to terrorize\/stalk Jamie and her sister Rachel. To quickly sum up the rest Loomis eventually arrives in Haddonfield, convinces the new Sheriff Meeker(Beau Starr)to help him out, they find Jamie and Rachel and take them to Meeker's home(where Meeker's daughter Kelly and Rachel's supposed boyfriend Brady are hanging out), and they all end up barricading themselves inside the house in hopes of keeping Michael out. Well, if you ask me, this 'barricading' idea is a pretty nice way to get the audience anxious because by now most people are going to figure out that Myers is probably already inside. So that's the rundown of the plot. Seems a little long, huh? That's a good thing...Anyhow, what Halloween 4 lacks in originality it makes up for with some very well directed scare scenes. There are several, and I'll start with my favorite which is the scene with the Sheriff's daughter and Deputy Logan. This is easily one of the most subtle scenes that I remember from these eighties slasher flicks. It kind of comes out of nowhere, and I say 'kind of' because I always assumed that he was in the house already, but I was never really sure. Then there is the scene on the roof. VERY suspenseful, especially if you are afraid of heights, like I am. It always bugs me when Rachel is reaching towards the highest point of the roof and her fingernails are scratching on the shingles...and then, of course, it breaks!! And finally there is the climax involving the truck, which I won't spoil.Now on to the gore\/death scenes. The gore in this installment is pretty high(a jaw gets ripped off, a head gets crushed, there's a thumb in the forehead, a shotgun through the midriff). Most of the death scenes are fairly inventive, like the scene where Michael shoves a shotgun all the way through Kelly and it comes out on the other side of the door, pinning her to it. The brief fight between Michael and Brady was pretty rough, and definitely ended nicely since he was such a jerk to Rachel.Basically, I like Halloween 4. I read somewhere on IMDb that it is sort of an homage to the original, and I couldn't agree with that more. It is an homage, and a good one, too. Another good thing is that it opens up a lot more plot for the sequels to come. I definitely recommend it for a Halloween night marathon.8\/10. Deducted a point for the bad directing\/editing in the schoolhouse scene where Michael has seemingly gotten a dye job within the last two minutes that we last saw him. But don't let that mislead you. The film is still good. Trust me. Followed by Halloween 5The Revenge of Michael Myers, which is just as good, in my opinion. But I recommend watching 'The Return' first.

I remember going into an almost empty theater when I saw this movie. It is really a lot better than it looked. I'm guessing most people were just expecting a Disney type of movie.This is a great movie for kids, not because it is part cartoon, but also because it has plenty of great science facts in it. This is a fun way for kids to learn what would probably bore them to death in a class room.This is part animation, and live action. The best scenes are the scenes that take place inside of Frank, because the live action scenes don't have much life to them. Some of the live action scenes can be quite gross as well, with the ingrown toenails, the vomiting, and the popping pimples.The animation is great. Chris Rock is great at providing a voice for a white blood cell, and one of my favorite actors, Lawrence Fishburne(Yes, that's Morpheus from The Matrix) is the voice of a disease. He makes a very cool, convincing, and terrifying villain.This is a good movie. Despite it's poor box office success, it is shown on Cartoon Network, it is shown in science classes a lot, and it has a cartoon series based upon it(it's not a very good series though).
