But it was obvious that the ballet heavy original could not be done on screen as it was on stage. What remains are the choice bits of music and dance plus a few great new songs. The basic storyline remains of three sailors on leave in the Big Apple and the three women they fall in love with over a 24 hour period. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra return into their sailor suits from Anchors Aweigh and are joined by the comical Jules Munshin and three of MGM's top singing and dancing beauties. Betty Garrett stands out as the flirtatious taxi driver (A lady cab driver, how revolting, she cries in one hysterical comic moment) who makes it her ambition to get Sinatra all alone at her place. Ann Miller adds her usual enthusiasm and fiery tapping in an amusing if somewhat silly museum set musical number, Prehistoric Man. The dubbed Vera-Ellen has the least showiest role but stands out in the dance sequences. A hysterically funny Alice Pearce steals her brief scenes with her squeaky dead pan delivery as Garrett's lovable plain Jane roommate, and when she joins the leads for a comical production number, it is a moment of pure joy. Another scene stealer is lovable Florence Bates as a dipsomaniac dance instructor.There is one ballet moment left for fans of the Broadway show to enjoy, plus a few of the original songs which includes New York, New York. Up until Kander and Ebb wrote the same-titled song for diva Liza Minnelli in the 1970's, this was probably the definitive song about the Big Apple. How many people have gone to Manhattan and not gotten lost because of those lyrics, The Bronx is Up, and the Battery's Down!? That lyric was even used comically in Tim Burton's adaption of Sleepy Hollow. When Sinatra and Garrett duet Come Up to My Place, the lyrics are slightly different than the original version, but they are just as witty. Ironically, Garrett would star in another altered version of the Broadway musical Wonderful Town with songs by Bernstein, given back its original title of My Sister Eileen, where all of his songs were dropped in favor of a new score by Jule Styne. Unfortunately, the decision to drop the beautiful Lonely Town from the original was a mistake, as well as Lucky to Be Me and the totally profound Some Other Time which could have been the anthem for sailors on leave during World War II. Lonely Town could really have been a great solo for Sinatra as he had the perfect pipes to sing it. Otherwise, this ends up being perhaps the best movie musical of a hit Broadway show with tons of changes only slightly affecting its impact.

People are less to blame than the media-centric system that knew how to deal with the public emotion, and the key thing is that emotion has a short-term memory. George W. Bush could get away with the second Gulf War on the basis of fallacious arguments just by exploiting the September 11 trauma, and any attempt to question his choices could immediately lead to anti-patriotic accusations. And this emotional exploitation is the basis of Barry Levinson's Wag the Dog, a hilarious satire in the same vein of sharpness than such masterpieces as Network or Dr. Strangelove, and as prophetic. In August 1998, Bill Clinton confessed of having had inappropriate conduct with Monica Lewinsky, a few days later, terrorist strongholds were bombed in Africa in response to the attack of the American Embassy in Tanzania. Replace Monica Lewinsky by a Firefly girl, Africa by Albania, Clinton by an unknown President, and you have the basic plot of Wag the Dog, and by 'plot', I mean the story the way it is shown on TV to the American audience. Yet Wag the Dog is less about the plot than the plotters.Wag the Dog starts with a crisis, the President has been caught with an underage girl and his opponents prepared an accusing videotape clip using 'Thank Heaven for Little Girls' as musical background, 11 days before the election, if the President's men, lead by a woman, Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) don't come up with an idea and quick, the President is screwed, and his lame We don't change horses in midstream campaign won't help. They call Conrad Brean, a spin-doctor; played by Robert De Niro. He comes up with the most likely idea to distract the audience from a scandal a war, the easiest catalysis of sentimentalism and emotions through sheer patriotism. As long as people would be thirsty for magnificent displays of solidarity and humanity, incarnated by these We are the World-like songs, it would be easy to manipulate them. So let's start with rumors about a B3-bomber, There's no B3-bomber, Great, even deny its existence.Barry Levinson's film hooks us to Brean's smartness so well that we even forget that the President would indeed deserve to lose these elections. It already starts to work on us. If the tail was smarter than the dog it would wag the dog, the dog is the audience, give them what they want and they will bite it. It's all a matter of storytelling. As a screenwriter student, I was taught that what counts the most in a story is the idea the premise, then comes the plot, and then the storytelling, all count but it all starts with the idea. The war was the idea, but then the rest of the plot comes up very fluidly. In Albania, why? Why not? Who knows about it anyway? Who knew about Afghanistan, Iraq or Vietnam anyway? What matters is that a country shows as a potential threat, to what? To the United States, to its lifestyle, its values &#x85; the plan can't fail, the whole storyline comes us so fluidly that the scandal is almost forgotten. But we live in a media-centric society, people need images, they can't rely their emotional involvements on rumors, on unseen stuff. Time for the second protagonist of the film to make his flamboyant entrance; it's Dustin Hoffman in an electrifying performance as Stanley Motts, the producer. He's as passionate, dedicated and enthusiastic about producing as Depp in Ed Wood except that he has talent, and this is why the team hires him. He constructs a war with archive footage, sound effects and a young actress to play an Albanian refugee (Kirsten Dunst). People need a gimmick, like the stray cat in Vito Corleone's hands give her a kitten. Motts understands very well how the identification process works, it asks for symbols, for colors, for memorable stuff, like the raising of the flags in Iwo-Jima or the naked girl in Vietnam. Wag the Dog makes us laugh for the same reasons Network angered us.Yet, as funny and goofy as it is, the Oscar-nominated script (the second nomination along with Hoffman) never takes its original premise for granted and takes us to unexpected and realistic twists without losing this capacity to surprise. At one point, the CIA, bought by the other side, makes a surprising statement there's no war anymore, and Brean suddenly abandons the whole plot because it's over, how so? He saw it on TV, TV is the Alpha and Omega; the Network days are not over. This is where Motts surpasses his mentor, with his unforgettable catchphrase This is nothing, the war won't be over until he says when it's over. The war was just a pivotal moment, but like every story, you need a second pivot how about a hostage, a war hero, a man who was kept prisoner. Abandoned like an old-shoe, how about a folk song titled Old Shoe, a soldier whose name starts with Shoe, like William Schumann (Woody Harrelson), you would believe this is really nothing.The saddest thing about the film is that even after watching this, the tail still wags us as we allowed many pseudo wars to happen. So even if it isn't the first political film to highlight the connection between politics and media-manipulation, it's the most related to our time. It's also a remarkably insightful film about the creative process of storytelling and a job passion, Moss is too obsessed by his talent that he'll never accept the idea of not taking credit from it, while Brean is the straight man who takes everything so normally he reminded me of another expert from a same year's movie, Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black, except that Brean's underworld is much scarier.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"16 October 2012","score":"","review":" Let me start this review by giving The Poseidon Adventure the credit it deserves. Ronald Neame's film is a spectacular entertainment and the accomplishment is even more impressive because way back in 1972, filmmakers couldn't rely on CGI and digital effects. To recreate the nightmarish setting of an upside-down boat with such a gritty realism elevates The Poseidon Adventure, on a pure technical level, into a milestone in the same vein than Star Wars or Who's Afraid of Roger Rabbit. But the risk with special effects is that they are often taken for granted as the only pillar of the film's success instead of being exploited for the sake of a story. Indeed, even the most dazzling images and impressive stunts aren't enough to hook an audience from the beginning of the show to its end, otherwise, it's called overproduction or simply show-off. A film is still about people and it's of people that viewers care, rather than moving, flying, falling or exploding objects, no matter how big they are. I guess that's the reason why disaster films rely on an all-star cast; there have to be recognizable faces to drive empathy because, given the parameters of the genre, each character has a limited screen presence, so there's no time for getting too psychological about them. This is why among the characters who survived the spectacular giant wave; most of them are Oscar-winning actors, an unknown face, an extra is only a soon-to-be-corpse. And on the casting department, Poseidon offers a very sympathetic gallery centered on the impassioned Frank Scott, the reverend with unconventional methods, played by Gene Hackman and the sweet and caring Belle Rosen, the Jewish grandmother, played by an Oscar- nominated Shelley Winters. The rest of the cast includes the gentle Red Buttons, the torridly sexy Stella Stevens, a handsome Roddy McDowell and Ernest Borgnine as the obligatory short-tempered character, you know, the one-who-is-always-wrong. There has to be the guy who never pays attention to a child when he gives precious information, to systematically disagree with the hero's choices. And although Borgnine's tantrum gets a little bit repetitive, he's obviously a confused man with arms of steel and heart of gold (Rest in Peace, Ernie!).The performances are unequally convincing, some characters, especially female like the scared singer or the teenager with infatuated with the robust hero, are obviously meant to fill obligatory archetypes, but it's never overused in the film, the center of gravity remains Frank Scott, and the claustrophobic journey he leads in the belly of 'The Poseidon from the top to the bottom (the bottom which happens to be at the top, follow me?) a trajectory that will not go without obstacles and a few collateral damages in the process. The Poseidon Adventure follows a very simple plot line, but this simplicity serves the film because it goes straight to the point in a very short running time, a good choice because more would have been boring. Maybe that's because the scale is smaller than other disaster films such as Airport, Earthquake or The Towering Inferno but it fits in the case of Poseidon.Still, there are several aspects that can't be seen in a non-sarcastic way, I, myself, couldn't take seriously the sight of Leslie Nielsen as the Captain, although I'm aware he started in serious roles. I laughed at the one-dimensional managing businessman who orders to increase the speed, I wanted the kid to shut his mouth sometimes and act like a real one who'd be more scared than thrilled by this adventure, not like the blonde singer mind you because that one who almost got on my nerves. Or maybe I was too distracted by the panties of Stella Stevens, or some campy lines such as one passenger who says the pursuer is right with such passion and intensity, it obviously serves to underscore Scott's position as a misunderstood loner. But I didn't laugh very long because the basis of the adventure and the efficiency of the special effects really grabbed me.I also didn't laugh because I felt concerned by some characters, and that's another positive consequence of the minimal casting that gives another edge over the other disaster films.Without spoiling the events, it's obvious that there are more deaths to go during the heart- pounding journey, but one of them, and the reaction it inspired from Gene Hackman touched me deeply in the heart. It's one thing to see some stuff coming; it's another to genuinely react despite the predictability.

Ronald Neame's film is a spectacular entertainment and the accomplishment is even more impressive because way back in 1972, filmmakers couldn't rely on CGI and digital effects. To recreate the nightmarish setting of an upside-down boat with such a gritty realism elevates The Poseidon Adventure, on a pure technical level, into a milestone in the same vein than Star Wars or Who's Afraid of Roger Rabbit. But the risk with special effects is that they are often taken for granted as the only pillar of the film's success instead of being exploited for the sake of a story. Indeed, even the most dazzling images and impressive stunts aren't enough to hook an audience from the beginning of the show to its end, otherwise, it's called overproduction or simply show-off. A film is still about people and it's of people that viewers care, rather than moving, flying, falling or exploding objects, no matter how big they are. I guess that's the reason why disaster films rely on an all-star cast; there have to be recognizable faces to drive empathy because, given the parameters of the genre, each character has a limited screen presence, so there's no time for getting too psychological about them. This is why among the characters who survived the spectacular giant wave; most of them are Oscar-winning actors, an unknown face, an extra is only a soon-to-be-corpse. And on the casting department, Poseidon offers a very sympathetic gallery centered on the impassioned Frank Scott, the reverend with unconventional methods, played by Gene Hackman and the sweet and caring Belle Rosen, the Jewish grandmother, played by an Oscar- nominated Shelley Winters. The rest of the cast includes the gentle Red Buttons, the torridly sexy Stella Stevens, a handsome Roddy McDowell and Ernest Borgnine as the obligatory short-tempered character, you know, the one-who-is-always-wrong. There has to be the guy who never pays attention to a child when he gives precious information, to systematically disagree with the hero's choices. And although Borgnine's tantrum gets a little bit repetitive, he's obviously a confused man with arms of steel and heart of gold (Rest in Peace, Ernie!).The performances are unequally convincing, some characters, especially female like the scared singer or the teenager with infatuated with the robust hero, are obviously meant to fill obligatory archetypes, but it's never overused in the film, the center of gravity remains Frank Scott, and the claustrophobic journey he leads in the belly of 'The Poseidon from the top to the bottom (the bottom which happens to be at the top, follow me?) a trajectory that will not go without obstacles and a few collateral damages in the process. The Poseidon Adventure follows a very simple plot line, but this simplicity serves the film because it goes straight to the point in a very short running time, a good choice because more would have been boring. Maybe that's because the scale is smaller than other disaster films such as Airport, Earthquake or The Towering Inferno but it fits in the case of Poseidon.Still, there are several aspects that can't be seen in a non-sarcastic way, I, myself, couldn't take seriously the sight of Leslie Nielsen as the Captain, although I'm aware he started in serious roles. I laughed at the one-dimensional managing businessman who orders to increase the speed, I wanted the kid to shut his mouth sometimes and act like a real one who'd be more scared than thrilled by this adventure, not like the blonde singer mind you because that one who almost got on my nerves. Or maybe I was too distracted by the panties of Stella Stevens, or some campy lines such as one passenger who says the pursuer is right with such passion and intensity, it obviously serves to underscore Scott's position as a misunderstood loner. But I didn't laugh very long because the basis of the adventure and the efficiency of the special effects really grabbed me.I also didn't laugh because I felt concerned by some characters, and that's another positive consequence of the minimal casting that gives another edge over the other disaster films.Without spoiling the events, it's obvious that there are more deaths to go during the heart- pounding journey, but one of them, and the reaction it inspired from Gene Hackman touched me deeply in the heart.

Movies audiences met with a new kind of cinematic hero through the ground-breaking The French Connection, Shaft and the most emblematic of all, Dirty Harry, directed by Don Siegel and starring Clint Eastwood as the ruthless Police detective with unconventional methods Harry Callahan. The film was released at a convenient time, during the Nixon era and less than two years after the Mansion massacre put a deathblow on the whole dream of 'peace and love' inherited from the hippie counterculture. Dirty Harry had such a huge psychological impact that it was even described by the distinguished critic Pauline Kael as a 'right-wing fantasy' with some explicit glimpses of fascism. Dirty Harry became an American icon for the wrong reasons, and the no- less iconic weapon, the Magnum .44 that inspired the lucky speech became the unlikely symbol of a new kind of law enforcement. And viewers responded to that symbol, and it's not surprising that the Magnum .44 occupies the screen during the whole opening credits sequence of Magnum Force, the sequel directed by Ted Post. But it's important to get back to the context of the first film. In the pessimistic (or nihilistic?) 70's, people looked for figures such as Harry Callahan, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle or John Shaft in order to keep faith on their safety rather than the agonizing legal authority, as if it was better to be safe than let the chaos infect the American lifestyle, it was not a cynical but rather a practical view of life during a cynical period. It was the birth of 'vigilante' movies, a sub-genre of the cop-thriller that would reach a fantastic paroxysm with Taxi Driver, from young director Martin Scorsese and would end in style with Abel Ferrara's explosive directorial debut Mrs. 45. After that, the genre would decline to the level of mindless bloody B-movies such as the dreadful Death Wish II and other Golan-Globus productions.The vigilante practice takes its origins from America's most obscure times, when the arm of the Law couldn't reach the smallest towns or interfere with such common practices as mobbing and lynching. The phenomenon was accentuated with the development of gangsterism and the progressive use of mass murdering weapons like machine-guns, and the growing political immunity of powerful criminals, Mafia bosses and other Al Capone-likes, who made Law look either powerless or accomplice of a corrupted system. The substantial philosophy governing the vigilante groups was that fighting crime implied the use of the same weapons, a sort of ends-justifies-the-mean necessity that leads to the paradoxical state where the best way to uphold the Law is to act against it for its own good.Naturally, the eye-for-an-eye principle goes against the progressive nature of civilization, and should not be tolerated because no one could ever see where it ends and in fact, only the strong could take advantage from it. To give you an example, if the United Nations Organization is supposed to interfere when a country plans to invade another one, then how come the Iraqi War happened in 2003? The same goes in microcosm in the Streets of San Francisco, law is here to protect everyone, and even if it does protect criminals, the system would still be the least imperfect of all. The irony is that the same Harry Callahan, who seemed to be the incarnation of the vigilante figure in Dirty Harry, fights against it in Magnum Force and the contradiction is so evident that it can't be coincidental.Indeed, Magnum Force works like a sort of self-defense cry addressed to those who labeled the first film as a 'fascist' movie that legitimated the use of violence or cruel methods when it was against criminals. The film confronts Harry Callahan to an organization that coordinates the murders of unpunished criminals; it opens with the gruesome murder of a Mafia boss who's just been acquitted for a technicality. The execution is so cold-blooded that you'd almost feel bad for the bad guys, and the executioners, all traffic cops, look so clean that it's hard to believe they are the villains. But it's an interesting twist in a series that caricatures to the extreme the fascist allegations and confront them to Harry, a way to say these are the real fascists, good old Harry can't be one of them.And that's the strength of Magnum Force, not only it takes some distance from the first film by providing an original villain, much more difficult to reach because it's a group, but it also does an effort to rehabilitate Harry Callahan, without changing much in the character, as cool and charismatic as ever. The main difference is that he's not fighting a dangerous psychopath cruel enough to awaken his most sadistic impulses, he's like confronted to his inner demons, to people who think like him and even more, and that adds a redeeming dimension of depth in the character. One of the film's most repeated lines is A man's got to know his limitations, and it's very true to the story, because Harry himself questions his own beliefs in justice, by understanding their limits, and so do we.The villains, among which, David 'Hutch' Soul gives a passably memorable performance, are less 'impacting' than Scorpio but the film is saved by the supporting presence of Hal Holbrook as Lieutenant Briggs who doesn't play the typical incompetent angry superior. The film is beyond movie stereotypes and thanks to an intelligent screenplay from John Milnius, who'd write Apocalypse Now, Magnum Force is an insightful continuation of one of the most controversial series made in the 70's, with enough guts to disobey some aspects that forged the initial fascination for Harry Callahan, and chill down the feverish minds that adulated him for the wrong reasons. By demonstrating that the noblest impulses can determine 'evil' actions, Magnum Force creates a sort of revisionist quality that certainly rehabilitate the series.

Basically an old man is telling a story to a bartender after getting into a fight, and we flashback to this man younger, Christopher Dubois (Van Damme), a pickpocket living in 1925 New York who was orphaned as a child and runs a gang of orphan children pickpockets who also con and steal to get by. They get found by gangsters but Dubois manages to get away, but he does get the attention of the police as well, but he promises to return to the children before stowing away on a boat, but he is found by the crew and forced to be a slave by the pirates aboard. He is saved a few years later by mercenary Englishman Lord Edgar Dobbs (Sir Roger Moore) who agrees to help him get home to America, but in fact he sells him off as a slave on the island of Siam where he gets trained in Muay Thai fighting for a scheme that is coming up. Six months pass and Dobbs with his partner Harry Smythe (Jack McGee) are shocked to see Dubois fighting in the Muay Thai fighting ring, but they see he has become a skilled fighter, so they buy his freedom so that he will represent the USA in the Ghang-Gheng worldwide fighting tournament held in the Lost City of Tibet. Other countries competing in the global event include China, Japan, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey, Greece, Spain, Africa, Korea, Soviet Union (Russia) and Scotland, all are eliminated round by round, and at the end of the tournament the winning country will receive the prestigious and valuable statue the Golden Dragon. As the contest goes on Dubois gets to know American reporter Carrie Newton (Janet Gunn) and heavyweight boxing champion Maxie Devine (James Remar) who give him advice and tips, and after winning against apposing countries the biggest challenge comes in the final round when he faces Khan the Mongolian Fighter (Abdel Qissi) who is savage. At the end Dubois ultimately wins the tournament, and refusing the Golden Dragon he wins the freedom of his friends Dobbs and Smythe who were sentenced to death after they tried to steal the golden statue, he returned to New York and got the children off the streets, Devine trained great fighters in his future, Dobbs and Smythe went deep into the Amazon to open a trading post, and Carrie wrote the story of everything called The Quest. Also starring Aki Aleong as Khao, Louis Mandylor as Riggi, Chang Ching Peng Chaplin as Master Tchi, Ryan Cutrona as Officer O'Keefe, Peter Wong as Chinese Fighter, Kitao Koji as Sumo Wrestler, Habby Heske as German Fighter, César Carneiro as Brazilian Fighter, Takis Triggelis as French Fighter, Azdine Nouri as Turkish Fighter, Stefanos Miltsakakis as Greek Fighter, Peter Malota as Spanish Fighter, Winston Ellis as African Fighter, Ong Soo Han as Korean Fighter, Brick Bronsky as Russian Fighter, Ip Choi Nam as Korean Fighter and Mike Lambert as Scottish Fighter. Van Damme is relatively interesting as the pickpocket turned strong fighter, I will be honest and say that I was paying more attention to Moore though with his charming mannerisms and overall English good nature, I have only seen a few of Van Damme's films, many of them are meant to be involving fighting, so as one of them this is I suppose a good enough one, the story is simple enough and the fight sequences are certainly gripping, it is an alright martial arts action adventure.

Van Damme is relatively interesting as the pickpocket turned strong fighter, I will be honest and say that I was paying more attention to Moore though with his charming mannerisms and overall English good nature, I have only seen a few of Van Damme's films, many of them are meant to be involving fighting, so as one of them this is I suppose a good enough one, the story is simple enough and the fight sequences are certainly gripping, it is an alright martial arts action adventure.

Basically an old man is telling a story to a bartender after getting into a fight, and we flashback to this man younger, Christopher Dubois (Van Damme), a pickpocket living in 1925 New York who was orphaned as a child and runs a gang of orphan children pickpockets who also con and steal to get by. They get found by gangsters but Dubois manages to get away, but he does get the attention of the police as well, but he promises to return to the children before stowing away on a boat, but he is found by the crew and forced to be a slave by the pirates aboard. He is saved a few years later by mercenary Englishman Lord Edgar Dobbs (Sir Roger Moore) who agrees to help him get home to America, but in fact he sells him off as a slave on the island of Siam where he gets trained in Muay Thai fighting for a scheme that is coming up. Six months pass and Dobbs with his partner Harry Smythe (Jack McGee) are shocked to see Dubois fighting in the Muay Thai fighting ring, but they see he has become a skilled fighter, so they buy his freedom so that he will represent the USA in the Ghang-Gheng worldwide fighting tournament held in the Lost City of Tibet.

It is a moving but disturbing horror-drama, unique and frightening in every way. Since film adaptations of King's novels are mostly hit or miss, this story had to be made correctly and with enough class and scares to mark a memorable place in the film-goer's mind. Unsurprisingly, Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation of Carrie is brilliant.Working from a script by Lawrence D. Cohen, the film brings us the story of Carrie White, a mousy, quiet high school misfit who suffers at the hateful hands of her peers and takes tremendous physical and emotional blows from her overly religious psycho of a mother. Only one adult, gym teacher Miss Collins, truly looks out for her. After a terrible experience in the girl's locker room, classmate Sue Snell takes it upon herself to fix things for Carrie by persuading her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to ask Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts, and at first, prom night is an exciting and engaging experience, until someone pulls another joke, a prank that goes way too far. Then people begin to laugh. That's when Carrie takes her revenge. The school doesn't know that Carrie has a secret power, and tonight, she's going to use it to her full advantage.De Palma's Carrie is a respectful adaptation of the book, one that hews closely while making some appropriate changes. There are two ways to view this film as a drama and as a horror movie.From the dramatic standpoint, Carrie hits all the right buttons as the viewer is subjected to what could be the worst case of school bullying ever committed to celluloid. The torture Chris Hargensen and her fellow females inflict upon our poor title character is overwhelming and shocking, especially in the opening shower scene, which is iconic for its heavy amount of nudity. You feel sympathy for Carrie, which is intimidating because of the transformation she undergoes in the third act. She is an ugly duckling, the shy little fish in a big pond.The behavior of Margaret White, Carrie's mother, is arguably as cruel as that of the teenagers at Bates High School. A nightmare of a woman who dedicates her time to tea and the constant reading of the bible, Mama's own sins have convinced her that since her daughter is now a woman (Carrie has her first period at the beginning of the movie), she is equally but unjustifiably guilty.On the flip side of the coin, there's the horror aspect, and boy, is that important. Carrie is a perfect scare show. When it's scary, it's very scary. When it's gory (and it has to be), it is very gory. Certain times, the film is also surreal and hallucinatory. When Carrie gets doused in pig's blood at the prom, are her peers really laughing or is it all in her head? We don't know, but from the look in Carrie's eyes, we tell right away that she is angry. The prom scene is a disturbing, epic sequence where a moment of bliss turns into utter chaos. It's an excellent turning point for the movie.The cast, filled with young talent, is led by the unforgettable performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie as Carrie and Margaret White. Spacek, at the time, was almost 30 years old, but still looked young enough to play a teenager. She was almost not given the part, but her determination and personal makeover earned her the role. She is pitch perfect as Carrie; she puts in the perfect amount of sympathy before taking a hard left turn. It is a wondrous and gut-punching performance that got Spacek a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The same is equally said for Laurie, who viewed Margaret as a satirical look at religious stereotypes. Her performance recalls the portrayal Jack Nicholson put in for Kubrick's The Shining, another Stephen King adaptation. One can't tell if she's being over the top or if her method acting is making her disappear into the character. She scares us probably more than anything that could be prevalent in Carrie's personality. Her monologue at the end of the film is absolutely chilling.Brian De Palma's direction is spot-on and creative. Split-screens are employed with some of the most horrific imagery, and his other sequences are almost dream-like.The movie is finally helped by Pino Donaggio's unsettling score, which, in this viewer's opinion, is one of the best musical orchestrations in horror movie history. It is, at some times, sweet and lullaby-like, but other times screeching (echoing Psycho) and dread-filled. There's really no other score like this one.Overall, Carrie is a classic horror film through and through. Its religious and pubescent metaphors make the viewer cringe, the casting is unbelievable, the scares are palpable, and it does all of this well while sticking closely to its source. There's no movie like it, and after 36 years, it shows no sign of aging. It will have you seeing red in the best of ways. King fans, be not afraid. Carrie is completely worth its status! P.S. The ending still makes you jump!

Meanwhile, he asks her why she didn't take with humor one joke made after a political speech, all she needed was to laugh at a rather benign prank and she would have won the audience. But Katie has no sense of humor whatsoever when it comes to politics and Gardiner hardly believes he can make it as a novelist. Here we are with flawed characters trying to inculcate the very value that lacks in the other detachment and passion. And that kind of complementarity is the true basis of a realistic romance rather than a simple love at first sight or a hate-then-love formula, The Way We Were, directed by Sidney Pollack in 1973, is above all these clichés.The scene I just described encapsulates the whole relationship between the Jewish, passionate and activist Katie Morosky and the classy, WASP and handsome Hubbell Gardiner. She believes in his talent, he's amazed by her passion, she's a burning fire that ignited his heart, and he embodies a sort of perfection only her eyes can value and cherish, and the way she tenderly caresses his hair is more eloquent than any description. The acting from the two leads makes the chemistry so real, so believable, that I even failed to see how the couple could be seen as 'unlikely', although the attraction between opposites is what drives the whole narrative, if not the romance. Granted Barbra Streisand is not the most attractive actress (though she has marvelous eyes, and fingernails that would turn on any fetishist) the film is definitely not about a sort of 'Beauty and the Beast' syndrome.I'm certain of this assessment even more because it's Katie who steals the show, she's the one who orchestrates the whole relationship and plays like a true mentor to Gardiner. And Redford finds the right note to play a character apparently dull, but in fact, only lacking the necessary amount of confidence because everything went too easily for him. Gardiner is like the big and strong guy who was so physically impressive that he was never attacked and then could never develop self-defense mechanisms or brutality and could be dominated by smaller and weaker guys. Gardiner is blonde, good-looking, he's an accomplished athlete, and it was so easy for him to be popular that he didn't even need to build a character. He is a spineless guy and in contrast, Morosky dealt with adversity for so many years that, if not the 'Beast', she's the 'Ugly Duckling' who compensated through her courage, her ability to stand up for her ideals and transcended all her limitations.And what a character by the way, Barbra Streisand illuminates the screen with such an energy we can help but feel her enthusiasm and passion for Gardiner, but not without noticing how desperate it is. For she's the one who cares more for their relationships, and another aspect that confirms it is the whole political subtext that undermines the romance rather than accompany it. Gardiner and Morosky do complete each other but in the sense that one needs to be more passionate and gutsy, and the other more easy-going and cool, but the chemistry is always victim of political interferences. The film spans one decade but probably the richest of American history, it starts with the pre-War period when someone (Katie) could proclaim to be a Communist, to the War and it ends with the Cold War and first manifestations of McCarthysm, the era that would give a deathblow to their relationship. Yet the script isn't quite clear about the way the couple is threatened by the hearings, it widens the already existing gap between Gardiner and Morosky, as he believes that one shouldn't risk to lose everything for such abstractions as principles, people count more yet she believes that People are their principles. The film features a lot of suffering, of misunderstandings, of failed attempts to change the person we love, to elevate him or her and in its own unique way. The Way We Were is the chronicle of a doomed relationship, and Pollack doesn't invite us to take side for one character, as each one is responsible for the marital failure. To a certain extent, the script remains true to a bittersweet quality of life, it doesn't even feature an obligatory 'I love you' line for that matter, and it manages to create situations we all can respond to. But now that I found out some scenes were cut out to relieve the film from its political material, I can't help but blame Pollack for having followed his audience' initial reaction (the issues are covered in the DVD features), because what's left is even more puzzling since we don't know why they broke up. We could see the rupture coming, but what was the defining moment that put an end to everything, remains unknown. And the film is too mature to get away with the excuse of infidelity; Morosky could have closed her eyes on that. At the end, The Way We Were isn't a perfect film, but it's still satisfactory, as if it was trusting the viewers not to focus on its rather anticlimactic ending, and just understand that the two leads had 'their' reasons to break up, and no matter what happens, they'll forever be the most important person of their respective lives.The movie is not without some flaws especially on the editing department, but it's kind of redeemed by the performances, the directing, a dazzling cinematography, and what's more, the sweet nostalgia induced by Marvin Hamlish's score, less emphatic than Doctor Zhivago or dramatic than Love Story, it's tender enough to be listened to without distracting from the story.

He is a spineless guy and in contrast, Morosky dealt with adversity for so many years that, if not the 'Beast', she's the 'Ugly Duckling' who compensated through her courage, her ability to stand up for her ideals and transcended all her limitations.And what a character by the way, Barbra Streisand illuminates the screen with such an energy we can help but feel her enthusiasm and passion for Gardiner, but not without noticing how desperate it is. For she's the one who cares more for their relationships, and another aspect that confirms it is the whole political subtext that undermines the romance rather than accompany it. Gardiner and Morosky do complete each other but in the sense that one needs to be more passionate and gutsy, and the other more easy-going and cool, but the chemistry is always victim of political interferences. The film spans one decade but probably the richest of American history, it starts with the pre-War period when someone (Katie) could proclaim to be a Communist, to the War and it ends with the Cold War and first manifestations of McCarthysm, the era that would give a deathblow to their relationship. Yet the script isn't quite clear about the way the couple is threatened by the hearings, it widens the already existing gap between Gardiner and Morosky, as he believes that one shouldn't risk to lose everything for such abstractions as principles, people count more yet she believes that People are their principles. The film features a lot of suffering, of misunderstandings, of failed attempts to change the person we love, to elevate him or her and in its own unique way. The Way We Were is the chronicle of a doomed relationship, and Pollack doesn't invite us to take side for one character, as each one is responsible for the marital failure. To a certain extent, the script remains true to a bittersweet quality of life, it doesn't even feature an obligatory 'I love you' line for that matter, and it manages to create situations we all can respond to. But now that I found out some scenes were cut out to relieve the film from its political material, I can't help but blame Pollack for having followed his audience' initial reaction (the issues are covered in the DVD features), because what's left is even more puzzling since we don't know why they broke up. We could see the rupture coming, but what was the defining moment that put an end to everything, remains unknown. And the film is too mature to get away with the excuse of infidelity; Morosky could have closed her eyes on that. At the end, The Way We Were isn't a perfect film, but it's still satisfactory, as if it was trusting the viewers not to focus on its rather anticlimactic ending, and just understand that the two leads had 'their' reasons to break up, and no matter what happens, they'll forever be the most important person of their respective lives.The movie is not without some flaws especially on the editing department, but it's kind of redeemed by the performances, the directing, a dazzling cinematography, and what's more, the sweet nostalgia induced by Marvin Hamlish's score, less emphatic than Doctor Zhivago or dramatic than Love Story, it's tender enough to be listened to without distracting from the story. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"16 October 2012","score":"","review":" At the dawn of the campus years, Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford) celebrates the first publication of one of his short stories; and Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) raises a toast to his first novel. Meanwhile, he asks her why she didn't take with humor one joke made after a political speech, all she needed was to laugh at a rather benign prank and she would have won the audience. But Katie has no sense of humor whatsoever when it comes to politics and Gardiner hardly believes he can make it as a novelist. Here we are with flawed characters trying to inculcate the very value that lacks in the other detachment and passion. And that kind of complementarity is the true basis of a realistic romance rather than a simple love at first sight or a hate-then-love formula, The Way We Were, directed by Sidney Pollack in 1973, is above all these clichés.The scene I just described encapsulates the whole relationship between the Jewish, passionate and activist Katie Morosky and the classy, WASP and handsome Hubbell Gardiner. She believes in his talent, he's amazed by her passion, she's a burning fire that ignited his heart, and he embodies a sort of perfection only her eyes can value and cherish, and the way she tenderly caresses his hair is more eloquent than any description. The acting from the two leads makes the chemistry so real, so believable, that I even failed to see how the couple could be seen as 'unlikely', although the attraction between opposites is what drives the whole narrative, if not the romance. Granted Barbra Streisand is not the most attractive actress (though she has marvelous eyes, and fingernails that would turn on any fetishist) the film is definitely not about a sort of 'Beauty and the Beast' syndrome.I'm certain of this assessment even more because it's Katie who steals the show, she's the one who orchestrates the whole relationship and plays like a true mentor to Gardiner. And Redford finds the right note to play a character apparently dull, but in fact, only lacking the necessary amount of confidence because everything went too easily for him. Gardiner is like the big and strong guy who was so physically impressive that he was never attacked and then could never develop self-defense mechanisms or brutality and could be dominated by smaller and weaker guys. Gardiner is blonde, good-looking, he's an accomplished athlete, and it was so easy for him to be popular that he didn't even need to build a character.

It was both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe's last completed film. It was written especially for Monroe, by her last husband Arthur Miller, at the end of their marriage. It also starred Montgomery Clift, who was notoriously unstable following his car accident, and relatively unknown character actor Eli Wallach. Perhaps the only stable part was Thelma Ritter, a well-known, reliable character actor. Even the director, John Huston, was a wild card. The production seemed doomed.THE PLOT The Misfits opens in Reno, Nevada, where young divorcée Roslyn is staying, while waiting for her divorce to come through. She is with her friend, Isabelle, and they stop in a café. There, they meet Gay Langland, a cowboy who has seen better times. Roslyn decides, in the spur of the moment, to accompany Gay to his ranch, in the desert.To avoid giving away too much, I'll describe the rest of the plot in much broader strokes. They spend the rest of the film mainly in the desert, where we also meet Guido, a younger ranch hand, with an instant infatuation to Roslyn. The film also includes Pierce, a Rodeo man, who's gone way past his prime, but continues despite this.THE CRITICISM I'll begin with the actors. Marilyn Monroe was not a great actress, but she fit certain roles. This was not a 'typical' Monroe role, but she does well. I can't help but feel that her performance was desperate, and it works well at times, while failing at others. It is an average performance, but it certainly ranks among her greatest. However the main acting achievement on display here, was that of Clark Gable, in his last performance.Gable was always cast as a matinée idol, and he indeed has great looks and a wonderful screen personality. Unfortunately, he always played the same character, almost. Even Gone With the Wind dosen't fully break the mold. Here, from the start, it's something different. The charm and wit are still there, but buried underneath are layers of sadness. You get a sense that his time is passed, and he can't cope. The scene that shows this best, is when Gable, elated at seeing his kids, comes back to bring Roslyn to see them.They've already left, and he breaks down in drunken agony. It's his best performance. Also we have Thelma Ritter, bringing her usual amount of wit and pathos to the film. Eli Wallach is very slimy and completely one-minded in his obsession for Roslyn. Montgomery Clift is unstable and shaky, playing an unstable and shaky rodeo clown. It's his last great performance.Now to the writing. It is not Arthur Miller's best, he wrote it with the purpose to provide his wife with a good role. The plot is interesting however, and the film itself is well done, so this is not a major problem. The cinematography is equally as desolate, and captures the feeling of time lost, and a world that has moved on, and left you behind. Now, for my last criticism, I turn to the direction.Here, Huston tones it down slightly, and gives us a more subdued film, which is perfect for the subject. He was really a man who knew when to make his film experimental, and when to make it conventional. Here he goes the safe route, while still retaining the beauty of a film about loss. It works. In Huston's career, this may rank as a minor achievement, but the talent on display is undeniable. It is a beautiful film, that ends with one of the most moving moments in Huston's entire catalog.

I could go on and on here, I could talk about the terrible acting, the stupid plot and the historical inaccuracies but I will save it.If you like to hear things go BANG ! and see a bit of blood and guts then this is the movie for you. If however you want a movie with just a little substance to it then please do yourself a favour and avoid this awful movie.I know my review might be a little incoherent in style but I just wanted to quickly get this off my chest before going to bed. This is the first time I have written a review and that is because I have never felt so strongly about a films shortcomings as much as I did for this film.I know the director Fuller served in WWII, but that doesn't prove anything. I respect his bravery in serving his country during WWII but as a director I have no respect for him. This is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen.

The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original.Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

The prologue took place six years previously when the Soviet Union still existed; it featured Bond dramatically breaking into a Soviet installation where he is joined by 006, his friend Alex Trevelyan; the mission is a success but before he escapes Bond sees 006 being shot in the head by General Ourumov.Once the action has switched to the present Bond has a run in with Xenia Onnatopp, a member of the criminal Janus group. She steals a prototype advanced helicopter; it is special because unlike other aircraft it is shielded from EM radiation. The next time the helicopter is seen it is at a remote Russian facility; the home of the GoldenEye satellite based EM pulse weapon. When it lands Onnatopp and Ourumov get out and kill the people working there; with two exceptions; Boris Grishenko, the inside man and Natalya Simonova a programmer who just got lucky and survived.

Encouraging her in this is Jack Lemmon a fancy conman from Chicago. Rebelling against the pressure, Laurie goes to live in an old tree-house and Furlong, Carter and a motley crew of others join her. This kind of behavior just ain't tolerated in Alabama even now, let alone back then. What happens is the rest of the story.Although this is listed as a Lemmon-Matthau collaboration, in point of fact the leads here are Spacek, Laurie, and Furlong. Both of these guys have some memorable supporting roles with Matthau as a retired judge and Lemmon the conman. They have one scene in Roddy McDowall's barbershop where Matthau is correctly sizing Lemmon up for what he is.

Yet his Nixon is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot.Nixon borrows a lot of elements from JFK on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to Citizen Kane, establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood.The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman.

And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background in the poorest farm of California, always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain. This taste for revenge is his inner demon.I'm not comparing two characters, but Nixon kind of reminded me of Downfall in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader.

Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House.

But&#x85;as an adult I feel differently about it.Spanky (Travis Tedford) and his best friend Alfalfa (Bug Hall) are the founders of the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club, a club of little boys who get together and do boy things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship.

Meanwhile, Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the go-cart derby, raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse, and mend broken friendships.This movie is&#x85;weak. The plot itself isn't that bad, and most children who watch it are entertained, but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original Little Rascals shorts, they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's, 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty, hunger, and child abuse as a part of their lives, along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby, Alfalfa singing and the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten, but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them.

Married with child his wife Drew (Lonette McKee) and daughter Vera (Veronica Webb) are seemingly the apple of his eye. When given an assisrant of Italian roots, Angie Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), Flipper initially objects on racial grounds, opting for a black-skinned subordinate. These reservations soon come to pass, when working nights together they soon uncover a growing fascination with each other, despite their differing skin colours. This soon turns into a romance, which crosses racial boundaries, causing a stir in both neighbourhoods and making them outcasts from their families...American film in general still has racial issues. Seeing a mixed couple on screen is a strangely rare occurrence, despite an increase in Afroamerican actors on the front-line. Even when employed the norm is having non-mixed couples, as if to avoid inciting unpopular furore among both sides of the divide. The exceptions to the norm are few and far between, surprisingly most often introduced by non-American directors. Even less widespread is such mixed couples not being the core of the story told - a notable exception is Things We Lost In the Fire by Dane Susanne Bier, where Halle Berry and David Duchovny create a loving couple with race issues never even implied.This speaks volume why Jungle Fever and the issues touched remain poignantly important till this day - the concept of mixed race pairs is so innerly counter-cultural to the American society at large, even more so than in Europe or light years behind the formerly racial South Africa. Spike Lee therefore located a subject mine for a classic movie, which would stay in memory for its breakthrough content. However Spike Lee wouldn't be himself, if he hadn't resorted to some tricks of trade, flashing audiences with subplots, which do nothing but distort the core theme (Flipper's flailing career or an absolutely detrimental story about his brother the narcomaniac).

Seemingly afraid of going the mile Spike Lee finally pulls up and offers a screeching happy ending, but somewhere within this feverish mixed racial love the context becomes diluted.

The exceptions to the norm are few and far between, surprisingly most often introduced by non-American directors. Even less widespread is such mixed couples not being the core of the story told - a notable exception is Things We Lost In the Fire by Dane Susanne Bier, where Halle Berry and David Duchovny create a loving couple with race issues never even implied.This speaks volume why Jungle Fever and the issues touched remain poignantly important till this day - the concept of mixed race pairs is so innerly counter-cultural to the American society at large, even more so than in Europe or light years behind the formerly racial South Africa.
