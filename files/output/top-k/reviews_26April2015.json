[{"date":"26 April 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" To start this off, I have two things to say about Requiem for a Dream. Firstly, this is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. Secondly, it is one of the best ever made. The film is shot beautifully utilizing very unique shots including the split screen shot which allows you to see multiple perspectives of what is happening at the same time whether in the same room or across the country. Another technique is the usage of drug use montages such as the very famous montage of preparing and taking heroin. Never before has a film's style and angle made you think so hard about what is trying to be portrayed. Requiem for a Dream is extremely intense and very hard to watch. It is horribly depressing and really takes the energy out in a very powerful way. It makes you rethink your ideas about drug use and the struggles of many people that use them. The film seems very realistic and the characters are acted to perfection. How these actors haven't gone on to do more contemporary movies is beyond me. For those that find grotesque movies such as this hard to stomach, I think that the movie is similar to A Clockwork Orange. It is very disturbing and upsetting to watch, but it is something so powerful that everyone should experience it. I am generally hesitant to call any piece of art life-changing, but Requiem for a Dream could easily change the way one views the society around them. This is a masterpiece of film and should be experienced by all.

The Edge is this kind of film, where a mediocre screenplay doesn't get any better at all despite putting Hopkins in the leading role, on the contrary. In this a very predictable story where all the miserable tricks are use to make it mostly embarrassing to watch. The bottom was hit when the only rainy sequence so obviously was shot in a studio with lightning flashes from a bunch of 5000 watts spotlights were supposed to do the trick, that the only thing missing were the really artificial sound effects going along. It is so typical B-movie and shows very much what little know how there was in the crew about weather in Alaska. About the cast - I wonder if Mr. Hopkins didn't wonder why and how the caster Donna Isaacson, together with the producer and director somehow couldn't find anyone better than Alec Baldwin to test his actor's skills against. If I were an actor of his caliber, I surely wood. Baldwin is totally lost in the wilderness, but seen from an artistic angle. Every single of my credits go to Hopkins for trying, L.Q. Jones for making the start a bit thrilling, Harold Pirreneau simply for being the black guy dying early in the story, and above everyone else, best actor Bart the Bear. Worth mentioning is also the late Gordon Tootoosis, who doesn't say anything, but still makes the movie better. Yes. it's a digression, but why wasn't Tootoosis casted for the role as Geronimo, in stead of Wes Studi? The rest of the movie is stuffed with logical errors, unlikely events and bad points. On top of that the music seems like something stolen from a test score to another Indiana Jones film, but found too bombastic even for that. All in all, if this was meant to be realistic, dramatic and exciting, the one's behind the screenplay, together with the producer and director would have been much better off making a documentary about themselves really being lost in the wilderness. It could have been exciting.

While I am very familiar with the latter three, I was only familiar with the first of those by reputation before I watched this film, having never either read it or seen it performed elsewhere. As such, I don't know what changes the film's director and co-writer Franco Zeffirelli made to the text. The play is a beautifully told tale of star-crossed lovers whose innocence and idealism is destroyed by their feuding families, who realise only too late the folly of hatred. It also features fascinating treatments of issues relating to fate and time, both of which are frequently referenced throughout. Filmed partly on location in Italy, the film looks fantastic and Zeffirelli's direction of all of its scenes - be they tender, tragic or funny - is top notch. The sets and costumes are lovely and the latter deservedly won an Oscar. To date, it is the final Shakespearean film to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, though several such films since 1968 - most notably Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet - should have beenMuch of the film's success is down to the casting of the leads Leonard Whiting as Romeo and Olivia Hussey as Juliet, who were about 17 and 16 respectively at the time that the film was made. This was the first film adaptation of the play to feature actors who were close to the characters' ages in the title roles. In contrast, the 1936 version - which I intend to watch - starred the 43-year-old Leslie Howard and the 34-year-old Norma Shearer as Romeo and Juliet! Both Whiting and Hussey are wonderfully natural as the young lovers, bringing a great sense of innocence and purity to their roles. I really felt for them in both their joyous and tragic moments. For such young actors, they are able to handle the material with great maturity. Their delivery of the lines is so good that you would almost think that they had entered their heads that very second. Shakespeare's language sounds especially beautiful coming from them as they both have great voices and lovely accents, particularly Hussey. The danger in casting teenagers or less experienced actors as Romeo and Juliet is that they would play them as stroppy teenagers but, thankfully, Zeffirelli had a great eye for casting. Whiting and Hussey, who crucially have great chemistry, are perfectly suited to their roles. Whiting was hailed as the next Laurence Olivier, who narrates this film incidentally, but is not really known for anything other than this as he gave up the screen for the stage in the mid 1970s. Hussey has gone on to have a decent career in film and television but it never reached the same heights again. It's a shame in both cases as, like Orson Welles, they peaked early.The film has a very strong supporting cast as well with the strongest performer being Pat Heywood as the Nurse. She is incredibly warm and provides much of the play's perfectly timed comic relief, which serves to break the tension. I love the fact that, in her first scene, her constant chatter was a major source of irritation to Lady Capulet, played well by Natasha Perry. She seems to be more of a mother to Juliet than her actual mother. John McEnery is very good as the irreverent, fun loving but short-tempered Mercutio, neither a Capulet nor a Montague, who delights in mocking the Nurse when she comes to deliver a message to Romeo. However, I found Mercutio to be the least interesting character in the play as he only really achieves significance in death. The always reliable Michael York gives one of his best performances as the considerably more short-tempered antagonist Tybalt, the source of much of the trouble in the play. He was typecast as sympathetic characters for much of his later career, which is unfortunate as he is so good as the villain of the piece on this occasion. Bruce Robinson, later the writer and director of the excellent Withnail and I of all things, is very good in the supporting role of Romeo's cousin and loyal friend Benvolio. (He was reportedly the subject of unwanted sexual advances from Zeffirelli, who served as the inspiration for Uncle Monty in that film.) One thing that I appreciated about the young male characters in the film was that they interacted in much the same way as young guys do today, something which I felt served to emphasise the universality of the play's themes. Other than those whom I have already mentioned, the actors who stand out the most are Milo O'Shea as Friar Lawrence, Robert Stephens, who has only three scenes sadly, as the Prince and Paul Hardwick as Lord Capulet.Overall, this is my third favourite of the nine Shakespearean films that I have watched since January, after Kenneth Branagh and Laurence Olivier's versions of Hamlet. I intend to watch at least one film or television version of every Shakespearean play before the end of the year. Since I have only seen versions of six individual plays so far, I had better get crackin'! Last month, I watched the classic Oscar winning musical West Side Story, which is based on Romeo and Juliet. As much as I loved that film, I wish that I had watched this one first. While I knew the basic storyline of this play as, well, everyone does, I would have certainly gotten more out of that film if I had been more familiar with the specifics as the parallels would have been even easier to spot.

My personal opinion, after viewing it that the only part I really hated about this movie was Michael Bay's directing. If it were given to any other director I think the film would have been much, much better. It's a cool idea, an R-rated buddy cop movie sounds like a fun time, but the way it's put together is infuriating. First off, I like the characters, I really do. If they were given a little more development I would really love the characters. What I hate is there relationships. IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE COMEDY WITHOUT TWO CHARACTERS FIGHTING? WHAT PURPOSE DOES MARCUS' WIFE SERVE EXCEPT TO ADD TO HIS CHARACTER TO TO FIGHT WITH HIM? Mike and Marcus' relationship is so inconsistent. They fight and brawl and then kill some mobsters and tell each other they love them. the writing is for the most part very generic but the manage to get some pretty funny scenes. Unfortunately it doesn't develop characters or their relationships and the plot is mostly chopped up conveniences. I love the Bad Boys theme, it's really great, and it would work really well if they didn't just throw it on top of scenes for no reason. It is almost never used appropriately. If it was used a little less carelessly it could create a really great atmosphere but it isn't used for the purpose. The sound mixing is pretty awful and I often found myself relying on what I was hearing to understand what was happening because the visuals were a mess, but the audio is often just as much of a mess. The wrong sounds are enhanced and it only served to make me more confused. In addition to this, when soundtrack is introduced to scenes it feels very awkward and out of place. I think the acting that matters (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, the only characters you end up caring about because everyone else is so lifeless) is pretty good, I like what they did with their characters despite, the drawbacks of the writing.By far the worst part of Bad Boys is the way it is presented visually. There are moments, such as the intro, where I felt the visuals were quite good. When I started the film and watched the intro I was pleasantly surprised, I thought that Michael Bay did have the ability to direct well. But everything was downhill from there. During action sequences the visuals are incomprehensible. Did that character die? Yes? No? I can't tell. The editing is just as chaotic. There is a sequence in which a character turns around a corner to shoot another character and then somebody saves the character getting shot. During the sequence the same shot of the shooter running around the corner is played at least four times. I don't know what there intention was but it probably wasn't to make everything as ridiculous as possible. The tone and pacing are out of control. For the whole two hours the film is trying to decide if it's funny or serious or both, and the film changes pace every time it changes it's mind on tone. All in all, Bad Boys feels like a missed opportunity to create a classic buddy-cop film, a really great idea was given to the wrong filmmakers. It's really just an incomprehensible mess, but that's my opinion, I can see aspects of the film appealing to certain groups of people, and I can see people really enjoying it, but I hated it and if you love to analyse films stay away from this one.

Unfortunately it doesn't develop characters or their relationships and the plot is mostly chopped up conveniences. I love the Bad Boys theme, it's really great, and it would work really well if they didn't just throw it on top of scenes for no reason. It is almost never used appropriately. If it was used a little less carelessly it could create a really great atmosphere but it isn't used for the purpose. The sound mixing is pretty awful and I often found myself relying on what I was hearing to understand what was happening because the visuals were a mess, but the audio is often just as much of a mess. The wrong sounds are enhanced and it only served to make me more confused. In addition to this, when soundtrack is introduced to scenes it feels very awkward and out of place. I think the acting that matters (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, the only characters you end up caring about because everyone else is so lifeless) is pretty good, I like what they did with their characters despite, the drawbacks of the writing.By far the worst part of Bad Boys is the way it is presented visually. There are moments, such as the intro, where I felt the visuals were quite good. When I started the film and watched the intro I was pleasantly surprised, I thought that Michael Bay did have the ability to direct well. But everything was downhill from there. During action sequences the visuals are incomprehensible. Did that character die? Yes? No? I can't tell. The editing is just as chaotic. There is a sequence in which a character turns around a corner to shoot another character and then somebody saves the character getting shot. During the sequence the same shot of the shooter running around the corner is played at least four times. I don't know what there intention was but it probably wasn't to make everything as ridiculous as possible. The tone and pacing are out of control. For the whole two hours the film is trying to decide if it's funny or serious or both, and the film changes pace every time it changes it's mind on tone. All in all, Bad Boys feels like a missed opportunity to create a classic buddy-cop film, a really great idea was given to the wrong filmmakers. It's really just an incomprehensible mess, but that's my opinion, I can see aspects of the film appealing to certain groups of people, and I can see people really enjoying it, but I hated it and if you love to analyse films stay away from this one.

Embracing a way of life to its limit.Martin ScorseseDuring the making of New York, New York (1977), which turned out to be a box-office failure, the Roman Catholic director, Martin Scorsese, sank into a spiraling abyss of drug addiction. While he was embracing a way of life to its limit, he almost got himself killed after having some bad coke that caused a massive internal bleeding. Thanks to this wake-up call, he finally kicked off his cocaine addiction with the help of the actor and his close friend, Robert De Niro, with whom he collaborated on all his most notable works. Believing that he would never make another film, Scorsese poured all his energy into making the next film, Raging Bull (1980), which received spectacular success and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's Sight & Sound magazine. Raging Bull is a biographic drama film about an emotionally self-destructive boxer fueled by paranoid jealousy and rage, which lead him to the top of the ring while destroy his life outside of it. The film is not only a redemption, which saved Scorsese from his self-destruction but also a landmark where his film style reached its peak the expressionistic depict of psychological points of view. In his previous hits, Mean Street (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), Scorsese rendered the protagonists' psychotic perspectives using high contrasts and aggressive use of bold colors. Raging Bull, shot in high contrast black-and-white, vividly carried out the raging, masochistic and insecure mind state of Jake La Motta through the perfect combination of visual and audio effects. From La Motta's point of view, his wife, Vickie is always in slow motion when she is close to other men. Through the exaggerated depiction of an innocent event, La Motta's jealousy is visually represented. During the most riveting boxing scenes, Scorsese utilizes not only the punching sounds but also the bull roars, flashbulbs, water-running, and even squelching watermelon sound effects to externalize the bubbling rage deep within La Motta.

There is a lot of bytes of internet space consumed criticising this movie for its Best Actor Oscar, and I can see some justification for it. But I decided it was vital to watch it with an open mind.Scent of a Woman is a great deal of fun to watch, with fine performances, a witty screenplay and a fun atmosphere permeating the whole thing. As weekend\/roadtrip movies go, its right up there. The premise is established from the get-go - Frank Slade is going to have one last good weekend before he commits suicide, and its down to the out-of-his-depth Charles Simms to help him with that battle. Its pretty predictable, but still a heap of fun.It is very difficult to gage Al Pacino in this movie. The first impression that he gives is of an overacted caricature, who behaves like no real person ever would. That will leave a sour taste in your mouth instantly. He shouts every other line and snaps the rest. However, just like the character grows on Charlie, Pacino's performance grows on the viewer. He is effortlessly charming and charismatic and yet completely obnoxious and difficult. He's a burden or a blessing on everyone around him, depending on what he wants. And Pacino is supremely convincing as a blind man - in the scene where he drives the Ferrari, I was almost paralysed in fear. In the end, Pacino has done better work, but I have decided that to call this the least deserving Best Actor of all time is a dramatic overstatement.The rest of the cast slots around Pacino best they can, and a fair few of them get some good moments. O'Donnell is not a bad actor, but he's out of his depth with Pacino, and that suits the film's atmosphere perfectly. Two late acting talents also shine in their smaller roles - James Rebhorn as the uptight and pompous Principal, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's George Willis Jr gives a superb indicator of the magnificent career to come. The screenplay is great fun, full of wit, insults and memorable moments. The tango scene between Donna and Slade is going down as one of my favourites. There are a few sickly sweet and predictable clichés tucked here and there, but we forgive them through satisfaction with the finished product. The pacing is good for the most part - although I feel 20 minutes could have easily been trimmed from the third act. Ultimately, I feel the worst thing that could ever have happened to Scent of a Woman is that it was the film that finally won Pacino his Oscar. Its eclipsed what should have been remembered as the bombastically fun and good spirited movie that it is.

But a villager saves the boy and raises him as his own. The boy is named Dar and grows into Marc Singer with the ability to communicate with animals. When Dar's village is raided and all of the villagers killed, he sets out to get revenge on the one responsible -- Maax. Along the way, he is joined by John Amos, sexy Tanya Roberts, and some furry friends.As with most sword & sorcery movies from the '80s, this bears more than a few similarities to Conan the Barbarian. Obviously it's not as good but the inspiration is clearly there. Beastmaster is very cheesy and hard to take seriously. I mean, at the end of the day, guy who talks to ferrets is a difficult concept to make work as anything other than a punchline. It's also overlong and full of poorly choreographed action scenes. For his part, Marc Singer does fine and knows when to play it tongue-in-cheek and when not to. Rip Torn is a total ham as the villain. Tanya Roberts actually takes her role seriously, which is embarrassing for her but fun for us. She looks great, of course.So yeah it's cheesy and laughable but it's also entertaining. You can shut your mind off and enjoy it as a simple fantasy adventure flick or you can spend a couple of hours poking fun at it. One question I had while watching is why did Dar never try to talk to the horses of the bad guys and make them stop? In the village raid scene and the climax, the bad guys are all on horses and yet the guy who communicates with animals makes no effort to use that to his advantage.

When Dar's village is raided and all of the villagers killed, he sets out to get revenge on the one responsible -- Maax. Along the way, he is joined by John Amos, sexy Tanya Roberts, and some furry friends.As with most sword & sorcery movies from the '80s, this bears more than a few similarities to Conan the Barbarian. Obviously it's not as good but the inspiration is clearly there. Beastmaster is very cheesy and hard to take seriously. I mean, at the end of the day, guy who talks to ferrets is a difficult concept to make work as anything other than a punchline. It's also overlong and full of poorly choreographed action scenes. For his part, Marc Singer does fine and knows when to play it tongue-in-cheek and when not to. Rip Torn is a total ham as the villain. Tanya Roberts actually takes her role seriously, which is embarrassing for her but fun for us. She looks great, of course.So yeah it's cheesy and laughable but it's also entertaining. You can shut your mind off and enjoy it as a simple fantasy adventure flick or you can spend a couple of hours poking fun at it. One question I had while watching is why did Dar never try to talk to the horses of the bad guys and make them stop? In the village raid scene and the climax, the bad guys are all on horses and yet the guy who communicates with animals makes no effort to use that to his advantage.

On the big grand opening, three-hundred people are at the top of the building when a fire breaks out below. The fire chief (Steve McQueen) arrives but he realizes that survival odds aren't that good.Of all the disaster films to come from this era, this one here is perhaps the best for a number of reasons but coming right after THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE the genre was still taking itself rather serious so we got rather good stories, strong performances and great special effects. As the genre wore on these elements became less and less important until we got to some of the worst that the genre had to offer. This film here manages to have some still dazzling special effects, characters you really do care about and there's certainly a terrific cast to help pull it all together.The key to any disaster film is the right disaster. What makes the film work so well here is that everyone has been in a tall building and I'm sure somewhere in the back of their mind they've wondered what would happen if there was a disaster that struck below and you were stuck. Of course, since this movie was released there was 9\/11 where the horrors of this story have an added dread to them. The special effects are certainly the greatest thing here as even after forty plus years they're still quite impressive and believable. Director John Guillermin does a great job at putting you right there in danger so the tension level is high throughout and especially once people are facing their deaths. There are some pretty dramatic rescue scenes here and right till the very end the screenplay allows characters to be killed off so you're always on a heightened awareness that something bad can happen at any moment.Another strong point are the performances from the wonderful cast. McQueen easily takes command of the film and the strongest of the actor really makes you believe him in the part. McQueen, the definition of coolness, really does a commanding job here and you believe that he could really be someone to try and rescue all these people. Newman is also very good in his role as the man who tries to rise up because of the guilt he has. Holden also gets several very good scenes here and manages to pull this part off without a problem. Fred Astaire is excellent in his bit of a con man. Faye Dunaway is pretty much wasted as Newman's love interest. Other cast members include Susan Blakely, O.J. Simpson, Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Richard Chamberland and Jennifer Jones.THE TOWERING INFERNO runs a bit long at 165-minutes but everything you'd want in a disaster picture is here and in high quality. Again, this genre eventually got watered down and ruined by some pretty bad pictures but this here is certainly in a league of its own and with the dazzling special effects and the terrific cast, it's entertainment at its highest.

It begins as a Gothic tale, with a dark old house (and assured teenage sexuality, a domineering girl and her submissive, meek sidekick, decadent patricians and ascending plebeians, hence it promises a story about submission), and it goes on with a sulfurous, _unendearing plot and bleak characters (but beyond that it's reasonably realistic in its set of characters), with certainly glamorous performances from the three main characters; unlike them, the every-men, the townspeople, the bit parts are made in a realistic tone (the policemen, a bartender who cheers Masterson's revenge). One gets the sense it was meant as a cool movie, which 'Love &#x85;' surely achieves. Authors like Milestone and Miklos Rozsa promise a spectacular show; so, a masterpiece with a sense of cool.The dialogs are exquisite, every line, some lines are very adult-themed (from the size of the west land, to becoming a woman officially, 'coming through that window'). Each thing you feel is checked by the script the unburdened Martha seems indeed less sexy than her teenage ego, and she seduces Sam Masterson by appealing to his pity and commiseration. As an adult woman, she seems dry and drained, and the script checks that. Unlike many other noir movies of the age, 'The Strange Love &#x85;' is very crafty, with a set of disconcerting and believable characters, with smoothness as opposed to roughness and fierceness. There are forces at work within each of them, but they are earthly, innate, mundane forces, not a fatality which sweeps them; and when they crush, they crush from the inside, deteriorated, broken, dissolved by their own inner doom.With these movies, some enjoy the template, are eager after the template, while others enjoy the craft, the exquisiteness, the unmistakable uniqueness of the work, the ineffable that renders the template irrelevant.

He traces back two centuries to when he was a suicidal man who was given another way of life by the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise).INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE was, believe it or not, quite controversial when it was first released due to how much graphic violence and blood there was but also because author and screenwriter Ann Rice objected to someone like Tom Cruise playing the lead role. By this time Cruise was already a movie star so I guess you can understand why she worried the film would be watered down or hurt with such a star being in it but it's funny to see that without him the movie would have been much less than what it is. Director Neil Jordan brings a European flavor to the movie but there are certainly several flaws here that keep it from being a great movie or even a really good vampire movie.As for the pluses, there are quite a few including the before mentioned European feel of the picture. Jordan was coming off THE CRYING GAME so it was a good choice to bring him on to director as he managed to create a very dark atmosphere and he also manages to handle some of the black comedy quite well. He also managed to bring a certain style to the picture that set it apart from a lot of the Hollywood pictures out at the time. With that said, I think the film didn't quite go far enough in many aspects. I haven't read the story to know what is different here but I just felt that a lot of the sexuality and some of the darker moments had been tamed.

I thought Cruise did an exceptionally good job here and I really liked the way he played pure evil. The Lestat character is basically just a killing machine and I thought Cruise made you believe that he really was a member of the living dead and someone who has seen centuries of history.

Then you've got Kirsten Dunst who is very good as the young girl who gets transformed into a vampire and also good are Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea.

I'd also say that the screenplay is pretty much long-winded and at times it seems like it should have been edited down and just had a tighter story to be told.
