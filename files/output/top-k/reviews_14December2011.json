On the one hand its being entertaining but on the other it's also being a quite poorly made and simplistically written one. In other words; this movie is pretty much the perfect definition of a fun campy B-movie! No, it obviously is not as great as the 1986 musical version of this movie but that's all because this movie was pretty much being a very fast, simple and cheap one to make. Just like any other Roger Corman production! And Corman did not only produce this time, he also co-directed the movie, no doubt to make sure this movie got done quick and cheaply!I sort of still wish some time and effort got put into it, since the movie its main premise definitely deserved a better and more thought out treatment. Something that did happen for the 1986 Frank Oz movie. It also truly could had benefited this movie, since now instead some of the story developments only work out half and don't seem to be fleshed out fully. It's a movie that seems to be filled with half ideas. Good ideas! But half ones nevertheless.But obviously it doesn't harm the movie all too much. The movie does still has plenty of good comedy in it, which mostly comes from its fun characters. Some of the stuff is pretty random but that's what's making it so fun. It's concept also makes the movie a quite original one to watch. What is it? A comedy? A science-fiction movie? A horror? A little bit of all, which gets beautifully and effectively combined!The cast doesn't really impress all that much. You have the feeling that with a bit more star-power behind it, or some actors with a better sense of comical timing, this could had turned into a far better and also more successful movie, at its time. Just imaging what would had happened if someone like Jerry Lewis played Seymour Krelboyne. The movie would had been huge!But there actually still is a big star in this movie; the 23-year old Jack Nicholson. It wasn't his first movie appearance but it's definitely the earliest one I have seen by him. He's already being very Jack Nicholson-like in this and even though he only was 23 at the time, he's much older looking already. His role is actually really one of the most fun ones and forms one of the highlights of the movie, even though he is only in it for a couple of minutes.Despite everything, this movie still remains a perfectly good and fun one!7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a bit of an odd movie.

At the beginning I was not particularly impressed, but as the film progressed it revealed something special -- that certain it factor that differentiates great films from good or even very good films. Granted, it's packed with lots of Dahlings (apparently that's the 60's version of babe), but if one can get past those frivolities the movie really packs a punch -- not so much as a great romantic epic, but more as a study of human nature, as well as socialite upper crust society (most notably how boredom factors into a lot of what animates and motivates these creatures).I was surprised to see, given the title, that the film actually semi-mocks Tiffany's -- although it does manage to render its mockery in a somewhat heartfelt way. Additionally, I was surprised to hear the words of the main theme song, Moon River, in a completely different light than I'd ever heard when Andy Williams sang it. There's an almost Over The Rainbow quality to that song. Clearly the book's author, (upon which the film was based) Truman Capote, had some interesting things to say about socialite society (as well as some parts of impoverished Texas). More than that, however, it drives home a very valid point that so-called wild rebels can actually be running from themselves, all the while waving (or hiding behind) the flag of stoic independence.The film also highlights quite well the twisted underbelly of relationships in general. It's not what I'd call an easy film to watch, but it is a worthwhile one, IMO. To its credit, it's clearly not your typical Doris Day\/moon June 60's Hollywood fare. In fact, it was surprisingly, if not shockingly racy for a film of its day. It's a shame, however, that it's tainted by an overtly (and unnecessary) stereotyping of Asians in the form of Mickey Rooney's ridiculous character. So while not excusing that clear injustice, along with the aforementioned plethora of annoying Dahlings that permeate and tend to dilute the seriousness of this film, Breakfast At Tiffany's has something to say even 50 years after its initial release. That places it in an elite group of films indeed.

However, It is fairly well organized and well acted.Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant.However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness.However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a plain Jane - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another.Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship.The climatic end is the movie's resolution.Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements.

The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted.The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed.I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version.I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete.This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

Although there talents were appreciate, there was always a tinge of disappointment that their obvious comedic gift was wasted in decidedly low brow comedy. By all rights Planes, Trains and Automobiles should fall into this category, 90 minutes of box office fodder, and yet it doesn't, for this film has an emotional impact to go along with irresistibly funny comedy.The premise reads very much like a particularly uninspired sitcom; two mismatched men are thrust together by a chance meeting on a plane journey and horrifyingly unlucky transport issues, spending 3 eventful days together as they overcome numerous mishaps to make it home to spend thanksgiving with their families. However the film goes much deeper then that, exploring a relationship between two men that very much reflects a friendship accelerated over a couple of days, with an unbreakable bond emerging from a strenuous journey of seemingly insurmountable problems.A pivotal scene in the film is when Steve Martin, tired with a long day of John Candy's incessant ramblings lashes out at the lovable but tiresome character, declaring that an insurance seminar would be light entertainment compared to the jabberings of his new companion. In return, Candy says I'm not changing. I like&#x85; I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get. This outpouring of raw emotion, accompanied by Martin's look of shame sets the tone, that amongst the shenanigans, director John Hughes is delivering character development not often seen in comedy, as Steve Martin's character learns to emphasise and to stop isolating himself from society beyond his own social circle, whilst Candy realises that he is overbearing and irritating, addressing his character to deal with this. And amongst this character development there is classic comedy to accompany, with the highlight being Steve Martins exchange with a car rental agent, in which the word fuck is used 17 times in a minute. Whilst some jokes seem a tad predictable, the majority are outright hilarious, appealing to all ages, highlighting this movie's family film credentials. And whilst the score is atrocious this is insignificant compared to the magnificence of the story John Hughes is tells.TL;DR A well constructed, emotional movie with wonderfully thought out comedic moments. Whilst the musical arrangement is a shocking reminder of the dark side of the 80's and a tiny minority of the gags fall flat, this film manages to deliver consistently hilarious jokes along with a significant emotional impact.

Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like exaggerated and unrealistic to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people.This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle.The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them.Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos.This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?)I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it. Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing.

Filmmakers sometimes seem to have made lazy scenes, such as the fight scenes which looked real amateurish to me. Remake is undoubtedly better, watch that instead!

So I was optimistic going into the movie.The General stars Buster Keaton, one of cinema's first stars, as a Southern engineer during the Civil War. He loves two things Annabelle and his train, the titular General. After a quick, plot- establishing introduction, where we learn why Buster is in his position with Annabelle, the train gets rolling. Union spies steal the General and kidnap Annabelle, and the chase begins.It's a fun and interesting story, with excellent pacing and tension. I found myself laughing a fair bit, not hard but I was enjoying the film. It's not quite as funny or strange as Keaton's Sherlock Jr., but the plot and history makes it a better overall package.The dinner scene and the bear are really great, as well as the climatic battle on the bridge. It's grand, but almost seems too serious. I was reminded of All Quiet on the Western Front, and yes I know it came out later.Buster is great as the main character, always straight faced. The word 'deadpan' perfectly describes him. It's amazing he's 100 years older than me, he's truly a screen legend (and has one of the best cameos ever in Sunset Blvd).The General is a great film, mixing story, action and humour, into a perfect mixture to show as an introduction to silent film.

What else can you offer me. Well that where Scarface takes the cherry, It not only delivers a deep, intellectual character study on an internal level but also presents us with an exciting external narrative, a perfect mix between the two, complimenting each other to ensure boredom is never an issue. The film revolves around a Cuban refugee, who after escaping holding camps in Miami, seeks to rise to the top of the international drug empire. Tony's characteristics and actions take the centre stage throughout the majority of the film, admittedly they are some of the most intriguing I've ever seen, more so then any other recent character I can remember. From act one we are presented with this reckless, dominant and highly ambitious man who doesn't seem to feel fear, he has a certain unstoppable momentum about him, incredible stage presence for a character that in reality is just a mere man. Excellent facial expressions throughout adds to Tony's larger than life persona, he looks so calm, almost bored in the mist of drug deals and shootouts, as if reality isn't worthy of his attention. He is one of those people who is never satisfied, they want it all and will do whatever it takes to get it, possessing a certain warped ego that says the world owes it them. Off course as Tony dreams of grandeur are met, his descent into madness truly begins, he slowly becomes more and more detached from himself and any common values, destroying everything he holds dear. I loved this sense of impending doom, every time a major event occurred to Tony I felt this incredible pressure building, one more string snapping in his head. The actions external from Tony's mind were also compelling, an interesting look at the drug running operations and gang culture of the time. All in all I highly enjoyed Scarface, it had enough action sequences to satisfy my bloodlust along with an array of interesting characters to bring meaning and substance to the film. The message portrayed is one to remember, don't obsess over wealth and power, nothing good ever comes out off being overly materialistic, value what's real.. and coke is a hell of a drug.
