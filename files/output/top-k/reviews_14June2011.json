Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9\/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again.Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal squid recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives.There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words girl power and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous.Great action from two masters - recommended.

Many themes are present, most notably the power of money and greed. The usual suspects are here, and both De Niro and Joe Pesci fit their roles very well; De Niro the suave, level-headed thinker, and Pesci the volatile buttonman.Five minutes in, and an appropriate title popped into my head Goodfellas Part II. All the signature aspects of that bar-setting film are present in Casino smart-talking, wiseguy narrators, constant music in the background, constant action and furious dialogue, swearing (you won't BELIEVE some of Pesci's rants), and dripping mafia style. One thing that isn't the same though is setting Las Vegas.The stakes here are higher, so lots about the movie has been scaled up as well. The plot is rich, with many angles. Goodfellas had a more contained story with less to explain, or it was just explained better. The first 20 minutes of Casino tell you all kinds of Vegas info very quickly. I hope you know your gambling. I don't want to say it's a fault, because it's very necessary, but it seems almost rushed. But it's not like it would affect the runtime, the film is almost 3 full hours. I'm a fan of that though, this is a bog movie with lots to tell. And because of great pacing and exciting moments, it's a 3 hour treat.The content has been elevated too. Violent and vulgar, this is not a film for kids. But it's all important. Pesci's character Nicky does most of the swearing, probably 300 or so f words from him alone, because he's always in a foul mood, which makes him unpredictable. Then there's the violence. Starting with a scene involving a pen, this is super-duper violent, showing just what people do to get what they want, or because they're crazy Nicky.If you told someone this was a Scorsese\/Tarantino collaboration, they'd probably believe you. Scenes with the vice, hammer and bat are right out of the Tarantino killbook, or out of Dead Rising. They keep you on edge and are brutal.Casino takes everything about Goodfellas, minus Ray Liotta, and puts it in Vegas. Except for a confusing start that can't really be dealt with, the only reason Casino didn't enjoy the success of Goodfellas is its bland name and being released 5 years later.

Matt Damon as Will Hunting is the product of children services. He has grown up as a mad and angry child who inflicts his pain onto others from foster home to foster home. As an adult, he continues to allow his anger to control his life. He surrounds himself with local friends Ben Affleck as Chuckie Sullivan, Casey Affleck as Morgan O'Mally, and Cole Hauser as Billy McBride, which gives him the feeling of family and loyalty. Within his journey he has realized that he has a gift in numbers which allows him to decipher equations from the college he is employed at, as a janitor. Gain Will get into another fight and is placed in jail. He sparks the interest from a math professor Gerald Lambeau, which is played by Stellan Skarsgard. Professor Lambeau helps him get out of jail with two stipulations. The stipulations are that Will must go to therapy and work with him doing math. Within this time, he has met a beautiful young lady, Minnie Driver as Skylar, from Harvard a pre-med student that kindles a relationship with him. After many attempt to five other therapist, Robin Williams become his therapist as Sean Maguire. Will sabotages his relationship with Skylar when he realizes it has developed into more, when she tells him she loves him. Within time, Sean breaks down the large walls that Will has built around him, and Will comes to truth about his life, that it is not his fault and that he loves Skylar.The movie takes place in South Boston. The area that resembles poverty, old, run down, and dirty. The colors and lighting are dull and lifeless in the beginning, but as the movie progresses the colors and lighting become more bright and vibrant. Outside become sunnier and brighter. Inside even looks cleaner with more life. You see more reds tones within the movie as it develops. There is even a scene where Will is looking at a picture and he comments about the color and texture of a picture that Sean has painted that sits in the window. The darker scenes are when Will and Skylar are together in her dorm room. The scenes are focused more on their faces and their moods instead of what they are doing.The director Gus Van Sant developed close and distant scenes to pull the audience into the movie and\/or to distant them of the surroundings. He had angles from above looking down at the beginning of the movie when we seen Chuckie coming to Will's house, and then when the boys got into a fight.

Plus, he used close-ups of people's faces to show us their feelings to bring us into the movie and to feel empathy for the actors\/actresses. Just as in Will fighting, you could feel the revenge he felt, Skylar telling Will she loved him as he pushed her away, and the hug that Will and Sean had when he realize he was not the fault of his anger or his life.By Will going to Sean, the therapist, Will finds the cause of his own pain and anger, as the therapist finds insight and passion in himself through working with his patient, like in the movie Equus.The title explains the theme of the movie, The life and times of Will Hunting. Will is a good guy; he just has not realized that he is talented and that he has isolated his feelings from the rest of the world, and that he blames himself. It took the love of a woman and the in-site of a therapist to find his inter-self. This was the first time I had seen this movie, and I truly loved it.

This movie focuses on the confrontation against the health care system, but at times the film tends to drift away from the exciting main plot and quickly drifts away into something more surreal and implausible. In this movie, Washington takes on the role of John Quincy Archibald, a financially inept factory worker who gets bad news upon hearing that his son Mike collapses during a baseball game. John and his wife rush the boy to the emergency room where the doctor reports to them that their son's heart is very large and a heart replacement is greatly needed. the situation takes a turn for the worse when the cardiologist and administrator (James Woods and Anne Heche who look cold and calculated) hands a $75,000 down payment in order for the procedure to commence. John doesn't have a lot of money, as he tries to squeeze out of his workman's insurance as much as he could get out of it, but word comes out that the company switched carriers and the most they have to offer him was $20,000. John goes as far as sell off all of his prized possessions, however that does him justice because he's still short of cash. This leaves John with no other choice to take matters into his own hands. He goes so far as to take the hospital hostage unless his son is placed on the donor's list. John's demands are taken into consideration by the police lead by hostage negotiator, Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Police Chief Monroe (Ray Liotta), who's in the wings for reelection and asks to have John removed from the building in an efficient way. The hostages consist of a diverse group of unfortunate victims such as street thugs, a pregnant lady, another lady who might be or pretending to be a dingy broad, and a foreign woman who can't speak a word of English. Sure the victims are recycled clichés from other films from the past, but when it symbolizes the how health care functions in the United States, it transpires into the most implausible and reprehensible outlooks one could ever encounter. It's even more appalling when they're speaking with a gun near their heads. It takes a turn for the bad as it goes from a tearful drama to a severely cringing thriller with badly caricatured hostages. I'm sure this angle could've had a two-sided perspective to it, but its concentration sticks to this one-sided agenda. It might be due to the limitations of filming or to avoid any further complications so that the audience won't scratch their heads in confusion, or to avoid this movie from looking like a made for TV drama.

The other standouts come from strong support from Kimberly Elise and Robert Duvall.

John Q. overall was a well executed film and would have been better if it stuck to being a medical drama centering on a man going out of his way to save his son's life.

John goes as far as sell off all of his prized possessions, however that does him justice because he's still short of cash. This leaves John with no other choice to take matters into his own hands. He goes so far as to take the hospital hostage unless his son is placed on the donor's list. John's demands are taken into consideration by the police lead by hostage negotiator, Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Police Chief Monroe (Ray Liotta), who's in the wings for reelection and asks to have John removed from the building in an efficient way. The hostages consist of a diverse group of unfortunate victims such as street thugs, a pregnant lady, another lady who might be or pretending to be a dingy broad, and a foreign woman who can't speak a word of English. Sure the victims are recycled clichés from other films from the past, but when it symbolizes the how health care functions in the United States, it transpires into the most implausible and reprehensible outlooks one could ever encounter. It's even more appalling when they're speaking with a gun near their heads. It takes a turn for the bad as it goes from a tearful drama to a severely cringing thriller with badly caricatured hostages. I'm sure this angle could've had a two-sided perspective to it, but its concentration sticks to this one-sided agenda. It might be due to the limitations of filming or to avoid any further complications so that the audience won't scratch their heads in confusion, or to avoid this movie from looking like a made for TV drama. But this painful ordeal to watch which makes you groan in disbelief.Washington has made some remarkable films over the years, but in John Q, his credibility goes down a notch, being that he's been in much better roles than this one. Nonetheless, he still manages successfully to provide one of the most selfless characters on celluloid. Here's a poor working class man going out of way to find the money to pay for his son's surgery and the drama that he possesses is carried out to near perfection. The other standouts come from strong support from Kimberly Elise and Robert Duvall. As for the rest of the ensemble, they're reduced to just nothing more than badly drawn, one-dimensional caricatures. John Q. overall was a well executed film and would have been better if it stuck to being a medical drama centering on a man going out of his way to save his son's life. It sadly falters due to the forceful suspense with cardboard characters, a lopsided script and a manipulative and predictable nature to it.

Phantom of the Paradise definitely falls into that category. A willfully campy stab at creating a Rocky Horror style midnight movie, this film inherently defies critical analysis. Almost everything about it that's goofy or terrible is intentionally that way. All you can authoritatively say about it is that it features a lot of great music by Paul Williams and it shows that Brian De Palma had no freakin' idea what to do when his characters started singing.As the title implies, this is a take off on The Phantom of the Opera but one where the origin of the Phantom is acted out twice in the story. It's also a musical version of Faust where the a main character has actually written a musical version of Faust. Then if that wasn't enough for you, the movie also throws a heaping portion of The Portrait of Dorian Gray into the cinematic stew pot. The end result is an intentionally bizarre muddle that you have to enjoy for its own dreadfulness. William Finley stars as Winslow Leech, the talented musician who is betrayed, disfigured, becomes the Phantom and is then weirdly betrayed again by the same guy. Of course, since Finley looks like the genetic results of a four way orgy of Barry Manilow, Randy Neuman, Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman, he's probably the only Phantom in history to look better after he's disfigured. Paul Williams is Swan, the mega-successful and manipulative record producer who steals Winslow's music to christen the opening of his new theater, The Paradise. Jessica Harper is Phoenix, the young singer caught between Swan and the Phantom. Harper appears to be the only one in the cast to not understand that she's in a deliberately bad film, resulting in her giving both the best and most incorrect performance in the whole mess. There's also George Memmoli as Swan's chief stooge and Gerrit Graham as a glam rocker Swan recruits to perform Winslow's cantata about Faust, which somehow transforms into a rock opera about Frankenstein.I could go on and on about how Phantom of the Paradise sucks in this, that and every other way&#x85;but that would miss the point. Even the abominable 70s fashions on display are so obviously exaggerated beyond what even people in the 70s wore that you can't really comment on it. All I can say is that the music, written but not usually performed by Paul Williams, is quite catchy. If they'd been part of a straightforward musical, even a terrible one, some of these tunes would probably have become standards that get covered over and over again by different artists. The other noteworthy thing about this movie is the direction of Brian De Palma. I t's interesting to see him work before he threw in the towel and became a Hitchcock drag queen, but the experience is somewhat spoiled by De Palma being completely out to lunch when it comes to making a musical. The singing and dancing in Phantom of the Paradise is so blandly staged and lamely filmed that you could show those scenes to the most devoted De Palma fans in the universe and they would never guess he directed them.If you can imagine The Rocky Horror Picture Show starring The Monkees, you have a fairly good idea of what this film is like. If that sounds like something you would enjoy, you can either rent this DVD or get yourself some much needed therapy.

IMO it is among the best of the 'Jack the Ripper' tales I've seen. In fact it may very well be the best. The only other one I can think of that came close is 'Murder by Decree'. From what I've read in the past on the actual Ripper case, i suspect it probably did involve English Nobility and cover ups in some way.The film was wonderfully atmospheric. It reminded me of the recent 'The Wolfman' film in that regard. I really felt I was back in time walking the foggy streets of the Whitechapel slums. And I felt for the poor people living there trying to get money to survive any way they could. A sharp contrast to the rich and privileged who viewed them as worthless expendables. The lives of a few prostitutes were nothing compared to protecting even one noble or the crown. Just fiction here, but IMO historically true in that regard.Johnny Depp did his usual fine acting job here. His inspector reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, even down to the drug use. His sergeant side kick was not unlike Dr. Watson. The story was imaginative and chilling, it was plausible and might actually be close to the truth. I felt bad for those poor women killed just because they had the misfortune to witness a friends wedding. A wedding and a child that were unacceptable to the crown.To be honest I was not surprised at who turned out to be 'The Ripper', it was obviously meant to be a shock, for me it was not. The signs were all there. Ian Holm's was chilling in the role. I'm pretty sure in the scenes where he was in the heat of mad killing his eye pupils seemed a dark gleaming black, demonic in their appearance. In his calmer scenes they did not look this way and were blue or some other normal eye color.The primitive lobotomy scenes were also unnerving. I noticed that as the judges gavel rang out three times it coincided with the three taps on the skull used to lobotomize Jack's brain in the next scene. Just like they had done to the unfortunate prostitute who had bore the princess' child. Queen Victoria herself was also depicted as cruel, when Mary went to the museum with Inspector Abberline she saw a portrait of the queen and commented on the coldness of her eyes. Turns out she was right. I know little about Queen Victory, so this may be unfair to her memory, I don't know. For some reason I keep thinking about the recent royal conspiracy theories associated with the death of princess Diana. I wondered just what the so called Royals might be capable of in the name of protecting the image of the monarchy. I'm not saying I believe those theories about Princess Di, just that it made me wonder what if after watching this film.Thoughts about 'From Hell' will stick with me for quite a while. I wish my wife had watched it too so we could have one of our usual discussions after seeing a thought provoking film I keep going over scenes in it. I particularly liked the ending, the twist that the real Mary Kelly was not killed but lived on in the little seaside cottage she wanted to return to. Sadly the french prostitute was mistakenly killed in her stead. The inspectors reasoning for why he could never join Mary made cold hard sense. Unfortunately I knew in advance the Inspector was going to die from a comment I had accidentally read in a discussion group. At first I thought his was an accidentally death.

He probably was so disillusioned with life, what he had learned, and not being able to join Mary that he decided to end his pain. His job was finished Jack was finished.My wife didn't watch it with me. She was concerned it would be too gory. Turns out that, considering the subject matter, it really was not that bloody. There were a few scenes that were overly graphic, like of a throat being cut, but over all we mostly just heard a chilling slashing blade sound. The Masons tie in was a nice touch too.

Undoubtedly, the finished product did not represent the initial vision of neither director Stanley Kubrick nor Vladimir Nabokov, who penned the adaptation of his own novel, but the result is a film no less challenging.The fact that Lolita had to rely on implied sexuality because anything that so much as visually suggested illegal sexual relations could not be filmed, actually makes the film stronger in ways. It puts a lot more weight on the shoulders of James Mason as Humbert Humbert, the professor inappropriately smitten with his landlady's daughter, to convey his lust without conveying his lust, but it also refocuses the story to the psychological profiles of both Humbert and Lolita (Sue Lyon) rather than what they did or didn't do. Dolores Lolita Haze is the driving force both at times overtly and implicitly throughout the entire story. She lives with her widowed mother Charlotte (Shelley Winters) in the small town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire, where Humbert Humbert intends to spend the summer writing before he begins work as a professor. Looking for a place to rent, he finds the Hazes and agrees to stay after he sees Lolita, who's just 15 but completely physically mature. He's infatuated with the girl instantly and deals with her mother's sexual advances just to stay near her. Upset and implicitly jealous of Lolita, Mrs. Haze sends her away to summer camp. Faced with the possibility of never seeing Lolita again, Humbert marries Mrs. Haze.Lolita seems like an average gum-chewing teenager, but she understands the power she has as an attractive young woman. Even before we first see her, Kubrick's camera-work is restless and frenetic as Charlotte tries to sell Humbert on staying at their home. When they both finally go out back where it happens that Lolita is out sunning in a bikini, the camera stays still on her (no ogling, of course) and everything changes.Humbert's inappropriate motivations regarding Lolita are the most obvious, but even Mrs. Haze lets Lolita get to her. Much like Snow White and the Evil Queen, Charlotte is driven by jealousy because Lolita has her whole life ahead of her and she's young and beautiful, whereas Charlotte feels desperate and unloved in these seven years after her husband's death. Then there's Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers). The film opens with Humbert shooting him to death, with regards to Lolita, and goes back four years earlier to tell the story from the beginning. Quilty appears throughout the story and the implied romantic link between he and Lolita grows stronger as the film goes on, although he remains on the periphery. Not too much, however, because Kubrick devotes a lot of attention to Sellers' performance. He's brilliant (and clearly the inspiration for Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, which would reunited the two a few years later), but his comedy does at times drastically change the tone of the film to humor and detract from the central characters' story.Sellers gets to have all the fun, but the challenge belongs mostly to Mason. He must ride a fine line between open lust and hidden obsession, which makes watching his character a torturous experience. He ultimately gets it right, however, because we actually manage a bit of inexplicable sympathy for the creep. Even as his character turns into a possessive parent figure bent on preserving Lolita's innocence for his own selfish reasons, we still agree with bits of his ideology enough to care about him, sadly. The censorship of the film lends a helping hand here because we never literally see Humbert evolve into the disgusting pedophile we're meant to believe him to be.Lolita has to be a rare instance where a film reaps benefits from censorship. To some extent we don't ever fully understand Lolita or Humbert because we're never offered proof of the consummation of their feelings. Without so much as a subtle suggestion being tolerated outside of Lolita whispering to Humbert in the hotel room about a game she learned from the one boy at camp, the rest is left to imagination and so we can never truly understand why they are making certain crazed decisions. But that lack of tangible evidence does help us realize the power of Lolita, lust and desire as we see in the other characters.

Undoubtedly I was unconsciously infatuated with the vibrant colors, playing against the cold and grainy 'black and white' backdrop. I watched it again recently, however, and it seems apparent to me that this movie has much more to offer me as an adult than the special-effects gimmick.The story is strange but somehow not all too original. A brother and sister who are polar opposites get sucked into their television set one evening just as a Pleasantville marathon is set to start. The show, per its' name, is a mega-sappy boomer-era sitcom comparable to the likes of 'Leave it to Beaver', and this is the world they find themselves stuck in. It soon becomes evident that if the pair neglect to play along with every little nuance of the Pleasantville episodes, it's entire universe would cease making sense. Desperate to keep the innocent folks of Pleasantville intact, David struggles to keep everything routine and orderly like the episodes he's memorized, but Jennifer, known as the school slut back in reality, has other plans.The running time for Pleasantville stretches just over 120 minutes, and while it feels about as long as it is, it is time well spent. The characters are written with remarkable emotional maturity, even for the surreal P-ville residents, some of which are borderline childish in their ignorance (WHERE'S MY DINNER?!), but even such a disposition is portrayed with honest human emotion and a belief in goodness underneath it all. The director commands a subtlety from his actors, and manages to succeed in having them play their sappy archetypes and be themselves at the same time, coming across with a humble ignorance that offers a rich duality. For while they are merely people trying to be people on the inside, the impostors amongst them are people trying to be Pleasants.The colors. Oh, the colors! The use of color is definitely worth mentioning, not just because the film revolves around it. The director knew that if he were to perform a visual effect like this, it would have to be spectacular, quite literally. A burning tree glowing against a pale picket fence, pink cherry blossoms in a gray lovers lane, and (to me) most memorably a black and white greaser runs a vibrant-colored comb through his black and white hair. The effects are done with technical proficiency to the effect of beauty. But the colors are loud in multiple ways because they say so much. They spring up in any of the town residents when something happens, and just what that is could be discussed amongst the audience. On the surface, the colors change when a person changes; a routine, a feeling, a way of thinking. Underneath, a passionate moviegoer can look inside these characters, find the humanity, and pick out how they feel like a familiar outfit. It is in these moments of relation that we connect most with the Pleasants, and it is also when they receive their new colors. I think it was these kinds of moments that inspired the color in Pleasantville, the moments of purity. Another interesting perspective I had of the concept was as a kind of reflection of American culture, ranging from the 1950s generation gap to the later civil-rights movement (check out the No Coloreds sign in a store window).I won't try to nutshell the movie, since the characters endure a whirlwind of change and turmoil. Suffice it to say that it's full, rich, sensitive, and funny. It manages to say a lot and it looks damn good doing it.

A few years later, he'd do it again with THE BIRDS. In 1966\/67, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was released and proved that a low-budget horror film could be successful. In 68, Roman Polanski released ROSEMARY'S BABY. In between, there were countless others that pushed the envelope and shaped what would become the modern horror\/thriller. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the definitive one. Eschewing the need for stars, big-budget special effects, and color footage (not by choice, but due to budget constraints), Romero and his team set out to tell the most terrifying tale ever imagined. By now everyone knows the story, so here's the overview Seven survivors wind up trapped inside a farmhouse as ravenous, undead hordes gather outside and attack them. In terms of on-screen violence, this movie was quite shocking for its time. We get blood dripping down walls, zombies eating body parts, half-rotting corpses, and excellent zombie make-up. The acting is good from all cast members. It's easy to identify and sympathize, but the filmmakers never make any one character out as a true villain or hero. Also, the terror doesn't always come from the zombies. In fact, Romero seems to take delight in showing us man's inhumanity to man, as one-by-one the survivors struggle against, argue with, and ultimately doom themselves. On the television and radio reports, they get assurance that help is on the way, but help might arrive too late. And ultimately, the supposed heroes\/vigilantes are no better than the zombies. Taken from a socially relevant standpoint, the movie works at showing the fear, biases, and turmoils that plagued many Americans during the 60s. Vietnam was in full horrific swing, various movements and revolutions were occurring, crazed gunmen killed people from towers, and at times America was divided against itself. NOTLD works at showing all of that ugliness. Fear saturates every second of this film, and it works because true horror occurs where the tragic and terrifying meet. While nowhere near as graphic as films that would follow (including Romero's own sequels) none has quite the impact as this low-budget black & white film.

A few years later, he'd do it again with THE BIRDS. In 1966\/67, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was released and proved that a low-budget horror film could be successful. In 68, Roman Polanski released ROSEMARY'S BABY. In between, there were countless others that pushed the envelope and shaped what would become the modern horror\/thriller. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the definitive one. Eschewing the need for stars, big-budget special effects, and color footage (not by choice, but due to budget constraints), Romero and his team set out to tell the most terrifying tale ever imagined. By now everyone knows the story, so here's the overview Seven survivors wind up trapped inside a farmhouse as ravenous, undead hordes gather outside and attack them. In terms of on-screen violence, this movie was quite shocking for its time. We get blood dripping down walls, zombies eating body parts, half-rotting corpses, and excellent zombie make-up. The acting is good from all cast members. It's easy to identify and sympathize, but the filmmakers never make any one character out as a true villain or hero. Also, the terror doesn't always come from the zombies. In fact, Romero seems to take delight in showing us man's inhumanity to man, as one-by-one the survivors struggle against, argue with, and ultimately doom themselves. On the television and radio reports, they get assurance that help is on the way, but help might arrive too late. And ultimately, the supposed heroes\/vigilantes are no better than the zombies. Taken from a socially relevant standpoint, the movie works at showing the fear, biases, and turmoils that plagued many Americans during the 60s. Vietnam was in full horrific swing, various movements and revolutions were occurring, crazed gunmen killed people from towers, and at times America was divided against itself. NOTLD works at showing all of that ugliness. Fear saturates every second of this film, and it works because true horror occurs where the tragic and terrifying meet. While nowhere near as graphic as films that would follow (including Romero's own sequels) none has quite the impact as this low-budget black & white film.

This story focuses on Danny Vinyard (Edward Fulong) who is in a white supremacist group which his brother Derek (Edward Norton) had once led. In the movie, Danny had written an English paper on Mein Kampf and now has to redo the paper and write about Derek. He has to analyze and interpret the events that had surrounded Derek's incarceration and how it had impacted his view on life and his family. Through Danny's writing the audience learns that Derek was the leader of the group and had committed crimes of a racial nature throughout Los Angeles. Now, Derek had just finished serving a three year jail sentence for manslaughter, for when he shot, killed, and curb stomped some African American youths for stealing his father's truck. Throughout the story, as Danny writes his paper, he reflects on all the events that had led up to Derek's arrest. Such as the trashing of Archie's Ranch Market, the violence at dinner, and the treatment of his family. However, what Danny does not understand is that during Derek's time in prison he had made friends with an African American named Lamont (Guy Torry), and had acquired a new outlook on life. Danny does eventually learn of Derek's new found look on life and in turn he too decides to leave the cult behind in search for something better not only for him but for his family.This movie had been brilliantly presented by the director Tony Kaye. Through the black and white flashbacks accessible throughout the story, the audience really gets to focus in on what is happening during the scenes, and are able to achieve a deeper sense of depth to the story. The lighting and angles used also had improved the visual perspective, which coupled with the use of the development of the characters to convey the message had greatly enhanced the movie as a whole. In the end, what the viewers are to take away from this movie is the fact that even though the story did not preach about it directly, it is about racism and the hatred that is created from it. The movie is closely related to another movie called In the Heat of the Night which also carries the themes of racism and murder. People should not allow the hatred to consume their lives and essentially destroy not only themselves but also their family. Life is short, so why waste it on an emotion like hatred.

Certainly, Oswald's attorney would have done so in court. But the fact remains that a solid criminal case exists against Oswald. Every day, people are convicted on less evidence (I know; I have served on criminal-case juries three times).

Right off the bat, anyone who thinks the dream girl is perfect and that the popular kid is going to follow through with his promise clearly hasn't seen any teenage movies.The plot Nerdy kid Ryan (West) is desperately trying to get a date with Ashley (O'Keefe), the school dream girl.

The two agree and venture out through double dates and each others' smart advice to win over their love interests.What bothers me is Whatever it Takes does nothing to change the formula. The characters don't act like real-life teenagers at all, they act like poorly created, dim shadows of who they should be playing. West and Franco are not to blame. They are just playing the characters. They didn't write the material they are saying.

Sydney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs an African-American detective from Philadelphia, Pa. He is suspected in the murder of a wealthy business developer from Chicago, IL named Philip Colbert. The film portrays the racism in 1967 Mississippi as the murder investigation develops. Tibbs is faced with a significant amount of racism which is overtly displayed throughout the film. Rod Steiger who plays Police Chief Bill Gillespie is faced with a significant dilemma. He and his officers are untrained and unprepared to investigate a murder of any kind; however, especially the murder of a wealthy businessman who has promised to build a factory which will employ approximately 800 people of Sparta. The dilemma is when Tibbs is brought into the police station by Officer Wood who is played by Warren Oates and it is discovered Tibbs is a police officer and a homicide expert. Gillespie has to decide whether to go it alone regarding the investigation or utilize Tibbs to assist in solving the crime. The story continues with Gillespie and his officers accusing several people who are eventually discovered to be innocent. The investigation continues and Tibbs continues to face death threats, attempts to kill him, and overt racism. Tibbs eventually turns up the killer in an intense scene toward the end of the film.The theme of the film takes on two different paths. A significant theme is the racism which is directed toward Tibbs. Some of the racism appears to be stemming from Tibbs obviously being the smartest and most educated person attempting to solve the crime. However, and underlying theme begins to emerge which depicts how a friendship can develop between two people, regardless of how different they are when they recognize a common goal. Therefore, the main theme appears to be geared toward education about differences and racism which is dramatized through a criminal investigation.A significant theme in the film regarding how Gillespie has begun to change his view and opinion of Tibbs is when Tibbs and Gillespie go to the rich plantation owner's home, Eric Endicott, who is played by Larry Gates and is against the factory Colbert is proposing. Tibbs begins to question Endicott and Endicott recognizes they are not there for a friendly call. Endicott becomes upset when Tibbs questions him about his whereabouts from the night before. Endicott slaps Tibbs across the face and Tibbs immediately slaps him back. Endicott forces Gillespie into the encounter by asking him what he is going to do about Tibbs slapping him and Gillespie hesitates. However, eventually Gillespie only ask Tibbs if he is crazy after they have left the plantation. This is a significant moment in the film which portrays Gillespie's changing opinion of Tibbs. This scene appears to support the theme regarding education about racism and how it can be overcome when people recognize common goals.A film which has common theme regarding racism and education is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 1967. This film causes a man who is a supporter of liberal agenda having to face the reforms he supports within his own family. However, this film maintains the theme of education and how people can overcome their beliefs when they recognize a common goal. The common goal in this film was maintaining the happiness of everyone involved.Lighting was significant to maintain the setting of this film. Lighting was typically low in the film. This supported the lack of education and wealth which appeared to be common in Sparta at the time of the film. This also supported the low opinion most of the community of Sparta appeared to have of Tibbs. Overall the low dim lighting supported the overall theme and plot of the film by making a large portion of the film to appear as if it is taking place at night when it is commonly thought inappropriate things typically occur. The camera angles deployed in the film also captured the intensity of the racism and the desperateness of the people wrongly accused of killing Mr. Colbert. The angles sometimes appear to be looking down from white people on to Mr. Tibbs, regardless that he is a tall man. This affect appeared to be used to make the racism more intense. The camera angles which captured the desperateness of wrongly accused individuals maintained a close up on their faces when necessary to capture the intensity of them portraying their innocence Overall the theme of the film is portrayed well. The film appears to focus on something everyone can relate to which is solving a common problem which benefits everyone involved. With the Civil Rights movement still pushing forward at the time of the film the theme appeared to provide relevance to how all people can live together without racism when everyone respects each other.
