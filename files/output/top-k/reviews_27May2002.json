If you don't wish to take any chances with having anything given away concerning anything Star Wars-related, please read no further.)I'm no Star Wars fanatic, but I do love the series dearly. I stayed spoiler-free and eagerly saw Episode 1 on its opening night...only to leave with a collective sigh of disappointment. I thought it was awfully flat, and nearly fell asleep simply because it seemed so boring due to my not understanding anything significant going on. (My comment here on the IMDb concerning the film wasn't exactly complimentary.) Only later when a co-worker explained that it was showing the Emperor's rise to power, that Palatine was the Emperor seen in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi, and that Queen Amidala was destined to be the mother of Luke and Leia was I able to watch and enjoy it upon a second viewing.So this time, in order to brace myself for whatever I would encounter and not be disappointed again, I prepared well in advance for Episode II. I read the book, for one thing. I also did slight research on some of the background story not explained in the original trilogy so that I'd understand affairs better. I'm glad I did. I was impressed with the story for Attack of The Clones, and thought it would work great in a movie provided it was handled well.I saw it, and I breathed a huge sigh of relief. This film is genuinely fascinating from beginning to end--provided you understand Star Wars lore, that is--and is easily a delightful improvement over The Phantom Menace. That's to be expected. After all, Episode I was basically just setting all the pieces in place for the remaining five films, and it really had its work cut out for it. Plus, the war hadn't actually BEGUN yet! But in this film as the situation grows to a head, the war actually STARTS and things kick into high gear. What was equally impressive was how well the movie thrilled me and kept me in suspense even thought I HAD already read the book!The movie isn't perfect, though. Near the opening scenes, acting is still a bit wooden, although better than TPM. Natalie Portman in particular seems extremely stilted, although I'm honestly still trying to decide whether it's supposed to represent her determination to be impartial to the situations she's facing and finally has her reserve broken down or if it's simply good old fashioned bad acting. Lots of times while flatly reciting the goofy dialogue, she doesn't sound like she's actually trying to put any heart into making the bad lines work and instead seems to have the attitude of, Can you BELIEVE this stuff I'm being asked to say??! Fortunately, the story and its characters are so appealing that it more than carries her.It's Hayden Christensen's outstanding depth-giving performance as Anakin Skywalker, though, that threatens to steal the show. Granted, he doesn't appear to be as excellent an actor as Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also interested in playing this role (I was actually hoping that DiCaprio *would* have gotten the role--not just because I thought he could have really pulled it off, but also because I had thought it would have been hilarious watching obsessed SW fans go into traumatic conniptions everywhere over it!), but nevertheless... he's so perfect for this role. His job was to convincingly sell me the notion that he was the youthful vision of a character I had known nearly all my life, and he succeeded.Darth Vader has always been known as The Coolest Villain in Motion Picture History since his debut. Once this prequel trilogy is completed, he will also quite possibly be known as the best developed one as well in terms of background and characterization, not to mention the most sympathetic and relatable. We will never be able to watch the original three films again without understanding precisely why he's doing all he does, as this film evidences.Simply put, the young Jedi knight who eventually becomes Darth Vader was so desperate to set things right in the galaxy that he went fanatical in his goal as a result.I know that a movie has really involved me personally when I immediately imagine to myself while watching it, What would I be saying to this or that character right now if I was standing there...? How I only wish I could say to them... And that's what happened here. It was during Christensen's best moments in the film, during the entire sequence when he's off to find his mother and afterward, easily the most impressive and moving set of dramatic scenes in the movie. Tears stung my eyes with sympathy and understanding when I watched him throwing things against the wall raging about how he couldn't save his own mother in a gut-wrenching performance during which we also hear the first ominous notes of John William's Darth Vader theme stirring threateningly in the background. I instinctively found myself thinking about several things I thought I could have said to Anakin at that moment to ease his rage and help him get a grasp on everything--all of them comforting and gentle, helping him to remember that Shmi had finally enjoyed freedom with a wonderful husband and a loving family, had been so proud of him and had finally gotten to tell him, of how he had done all in that situation that a Jedi should do and even more so even if he didn't succeed in rescuing her, as well as so many other things I thought he desperately needed to hear--things I was hoping Padme herself would eventually say in the film. And that's when it hit me I haven't felt that way since watching the original three films. I mention this because I see it as solid proof that this movie is in its own way just as good as the classic releases.I also heartily enjoyed Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan, as he is finally allowed to cut loose by Lucas. I HATE it when he does that! he remarks irritably after Anakin jumps out into the middle of thin air. And watch for how he handles a certain pest in a bar. McGregor makes this character so thoroughly HIS that you really do end up believing that he IS the same Old Ben from Episode IV. He and Anakin, in their scenes together, have a Mick Jagger\/Keith Richards relationship which tends to tense up the screen with dark anticipation, not to mention wisecracks.And not only does he have some great one-liners and moments which rival Han Solo's (as Yoda hints to him at one point, Anakin isn't the only one with an attitude problem at the moment), but longtime fans will be delighted to know that Jar Jar Binks is almost completely nonexistant in this film's plot! (You will, however, realize with sheer horror why the idiot is in the series at all). Instead of Jar Jar's jeuvenile obnoxiousness, comedy relief has once again been returned where it belongs, to two of the characters that helped liven up the first three in the first place--C3PO and R2-D2! And man, it's about time! The whole last leg of the film concerning C3PO's predicaments in particular are simply priceless.My absolute favorite line here, though, is made by Anakin during a moment when his lightsabre is chopped in half by machinery in a highly-tense and genuinely exciting moment--seeing it ruined, he had the entire audience roaring as he merely rolls his eyes with annoyance and mutters, Oh no, not AGAIN--Obi-Wan's gonna KILL me!Casual Star Wars viewers might still be a tad confused here without knowing more of the concept's background, and any such confusion will be muddled even further by the fact that paid critics such as Roger Ebert had written comments praising TPM for its visuals and look despite its ultra-slow plot and refusal to explain what's going on to the casual audience member, but turn around and harass AOTC for the *exact* problems found in TPM despite the fact that this second episode has more action, a more involving plot and better acting with smoother pacing (Ebert, did you accidentally get your two reviews mixed up with each other or something? I know, I know, you hadn't seen II yet before reviewing I, but nevertheless your remarks both read as if you did. WHAT on earth are you inhaling?). But I'm pretty positive that they will nevertheless enjoy this one anyway because it has far more variety than its predecessor.An extra note I wish to add if you loved this movie (even if you're already a huge SW fan and enjoyed it as it is!), I want to also heartily recommend R. A. Salvadore's excellent novelization of this episode to use as a companion piece for viewing it. See the movie, read the book and then go back and see this movie a second time. The book works as a perfect companion piece that will greatly enhance your enjoyment of the film even more, adding wonderful emotional depth as well as explaining any confusing gaps not caught the first time around.

McGregor makes this character so thoroughly HIS that you really do end up believing that he IS the same Old Ben from Episode IV. He and Anakin, in their scenes together, have a Mick Jagger\/Keith Richards relationship which tends to tense up the screen with dark anticipation, not to mention wisecracks.And not only does he have some great one-liners and moments which rival Han Solo's (as Yoda hints to him at one point, Anakin isn't the only one with an attitude problem at the moment), but longtime fans will be delighted to know that Jar Jar Binks is almost completely nonexistant in this film's plot! (You will, however, realize with sheer horror why the idiot is in the series at all). Instead of Jar Jar's jeuvenile obnoxiousness, comedy relief has once again been returned where it belongs, to two of the characters that helped liven up the first three in the first place--C3PO and R2-D2! And man, it's about time! The whole last leg of the film concerning C3PO's predicaments in particular are simply priceless.My absolute favorite line here, though, is made by Anakin during a moment when his lightsabre is chopped in half by machinery in a highly-tense and genuinely exciting moment--seeing it ruined, he had the entire audience roaring as he merely rolls his eyes with annoyance and mutters, Oh no, not AGAIN--Obi-Wan's gonna KILL me!Casual Star Wars viewers might still be a tad confused here without knowing more of the concept's background, and any such confusion will be muddled even further by the fact that paid critics such as Roger Ebert had written comments praising TPM for its visuals and look despite its ultra-slow plot and refusal to explain what's going on to the casual audience member, but turn around and harass AOTC for the *exact* problems found in TPM despite the fact that this second episode has more action, a more involving plot and better acting with smoother pacing (Ebert, did you accidentally get your two reviews mixed up with each other or something? I know, I know, you hadn't seen II yet before reviewing I, but nevertheless your remarks both read as if you did. WHAT on earth are you inhaling?). But I'm pretty positive that they will nevertheless enjoy this one anyway because it has far more variety than its predecessor.An extra note I wish to add if you loved this movie (even if you're already a huge SW fan and enjoyed it as it is!), I want to also heartily recommend R. A. Salvadore's excellent novelization of this episode to use as a companion piece for viewing it. See the movie, read the book and then go back and see this movie a second time. The book works as a perfect companion piece that will greatly enhance your enjoyment of the film even more, adding wonderful emotional depth as well as explaining any confusing gaps not caught the first time around.

In my opinion, everything about Ep1 was necessary.  The lead character was a kid - Anakin.  It makes sense that he would appeal to a younger audience as much as an older one.

With the exception of the Darth Maul\/Jedi fight in Episode I, I didn't think much of the rest of the movie, but seeing the fight scene made me very eager to see Episode II where it was rumored to have a lot more Jedi fights, less Jar Jar, and more of a complex plot.Now to Episode II.1) The acting  I'm not going to sit here and trash the acting.  Most of it is done by relative unknowns, like the originals.  At the time of Star Wars, there were still those who would have asked, who's Carrie Fisher? or who's Harrison Ford?  To me, its trademark Star Wars.  Hats off to all of them.  Grade A-2) The graphics\/CGI Lucas has been accused of using far too much CGI to compensate for a weak story and\/or dialogue.  I disagree.  The graphics in this movie are stunning, CGI or not.  Coruscant was amazing - if it was a true vacation destination I'd surely be there.  To trash the graphics in Episode II means you also must in Lord of the Rings.  Lucas has always talked about scenery as a complement to the screenplay, not a substitute. However, if the screenplay's weak and the scenery strong, it obviously looks one-sided.  I thought Yoda was done really well, the backgrounds were amazing, and the space scenes were great.  Grade A+3) The plot & Screenplay  Grade C- a) The Love Story - way too long.  Having already seen their son and daughter in later movies, I can guess that they fall in love.  We didn't need to see so much development here.  An hours' worth could have been told in 20 minutes, plus the scene before the execution.  It would have been good for the strong-willed yet practical and diplomatic senator Padame to be council for Anakin, further challenging where he places his trust and loyalty for council.  Someone he loves, or someone he's supposed to respect? Looking back at the Star Wars' trilogy, we knew of the chemistry\/feelings between Han and Leia via some quick and\/or witty scenes.  The rest was implied.  Should have been the same here.  Oh, credit where its due - Natalie Portman is HOT and dresses accordingly.b) Anakin's Plight - showed him more whiny than truly torn.  Why not show him doing more damage when he's really p***ed?  Could have shown him challenging Obi Wan more, either verbally or perhaps physically.  If they could have shown Anakin using Dark Side traits to win his battles, it would have been more effective and convincing.c) The Clones Story - seemed weakly strung together.  Will probably have to see it again to understand why no one in Jedi royalty saw it all coming.4) The Fight Scenes  I may get flak for not jumping on the Yoda bandwagon, but I thought they were all poor.  Yes, the Yoda scene was good, but quality-wise the Obi Wan fight was better.  My reason?  In every other fight scene with the exception of the non-existent one between Anakin and the Tuscans, the good guys never won on their own merits.  Someone always came in and saved the day, especially in the Yoda scene.  Here I was really hoping for more of the Darth Maul-type scenes from Episode I.  Even two-on-one battles would have been ok if they were handled in that manner. Grade D-In conclusion, I think Lucas missed the mark and expectations of his target audience, if I'm not too arrogant in assuming I'm part of it.  He captured more of what was true Star Wars (from a fan's perspective) than he did in Episode I, but if he would have spent as much energy on the Jedi fight scenes as he did the love story, this would have been an A+ movie.Despite my poor rating, I still look forward to 2005, which Lucas claims will be very dark.

With the exception of the Darth Maul\/Jedi fight in Episode I, I didn't think much of the rest of the movie, but seeing the fight scene made me very eager to see Episode II where it was rumored to have a lot more Jedi fights, less Jar Jar, and more of a complex plot.Now to Episode II.1) The acting  I'm not going to sit here and trash the acting.  Most of it is done by relative unknowns, like the originals.  At the time of Star Wars, there were still those who would have asked, who's Carrie Fisher? or who's Harrison Ford?  To me, its trademark Star Wars.  Hats off to all of them.  Grade A-2) The graphics\/CGI Lucas has been accused of using far too much CGI to compensate for a weak story and\/or dialogue.  I disagree.  The graphics in this movie are stunning, CGI or not.  Coruscant was amazing - if it was a true vacation destination I'd surely be there.  To trash the graphics in Episode II means you also must in Lord of the Rings.  Lucas has always talked about scenery as a complement to the screenplay, not a substitute. However, if the screenplay's weak and the scenery strong, it obviously looks one-sided.  I thought Yoda was done really well, the backgrounds were amazing, and the space scenes were great.  Grade A+3) The plot & Screenplay  Grade C- a) The Love Story - way too long.  Having already seen their son and daughter in later movies, I can guess that they fall in love.  We didn't need to see so much development here.  An hours' worth could have been told in 20 minutes, plus the scene before the execution.  It would have been good for the strong-willed yet practical and diplomatic senator Padame to be council for Anakin, further challenging where he places his trust and loyalty for council.  Someone he loves, or someone he's supposed to respect? Looking back at the Star Wars' trilogy, we knew of the chemistry\/feelings between Han and Leia via some quick and\/or witty scenes.  The rest was implied.  Should have been the same here.  Oh, credit where its due - Natalie Portman is HOT and dresses accordingly.b) Anakin's Plight - showed him more whiny than truly torn.  Why not show him doing more damage when he's really p***ed?  Could have shown him challenging Obi Wan more, either verbally or perhaps physically.  If they could have shown Anakin using Dark Side traits to win his battles, it would have been more effective and convincing.c) The Clones Story - seemed weakly strung together.  Will probably have to see it again to understand why no one in Jedi royalty saw it all coming.4) The Fight Scenes  I may get flak for not jumping on the Yoda bandwagon, but I thought they were all poor.  Yes, the Yoda scene was good, but quality-wise the Obi Wan fight was better.  My reason?  In every other fight scene with the exception of the non-existent one between Anakin and the Tuscans, the good guys never won on their own merits.  Someone always came in and saved the day, especially in the Yoda scene.  Here I was really hoping for more of the Darth Maul-type scenes from Episode I.  Even two-on-one battles would have been ok if they were handled in that manner. Grade D-In conclusion, I think Lucas missed the mark and expectations of his target audience, if I'm not too arrogant in assuming I'm part of it.  He captured more of what was true Star Wars (from a fan's perspective) than he did in Episode I, but if he would have spent as much energy on the Jedi fight scenes as he did the love story, this would have been an A+ movie.Despite my poor rating, I still look forward to 2005, which Lucas claims will be very dark.  Still beats Star Trek!

Trying to be objective, I will admit that the stupidly named movie is better than the average junk that Hollywood tries to pass off as entertainment these days.  It's actually quite entertaining, and features some fairly spectacular special effects.However, for an entry into a series with as much world-wide fanatacism as Star Wars, I cannot help but consider it to be a terrible disappointment.  Not as disappointing as The Phantom Menace I'll admit, but then I was more prepared for disappointment this time.Whilst it has splendid CGI that creates some luscious science fiction environments and spectacular battle sequences, George Lucas really should have surrendered script (and probably directorial) duties to somebody younger and more talented.  Given that everybody on the planet will probably see the movie at some point, there's no real excuse for not spending money on the best and brightest out there.  But it's all too painfully clear that Lucas wanted to keep the spotlight on himself - a spotlight he simply doesn't have the talent to fill.The basic story for Attack Of The Clones is not bad - there's some intrigue, some heroism and some evil.  You can see the pieces falling into place that explain how the situation arose that we find ourselves in at the beginning of the first Star Wars.  The script that delivers the story is just awful though.  It lumbers along like a blind elephant, clumsy and contrived and corny as hell.  And the dialogue - ouch.  Tedious and inane.  A good script writer could have turned Lucas' story into something majestic and moving, but Lucas only manages to hover between 'passable' and 'really embarrassing'.  Perhaps it's because I work in the industry, but I also found it embarrassing where Lucas has clearly planned his action scenes with an eye to the spin-off computer games that pad his wallet even further.  Be sure there'll be at least half a dozen different games released to capitalise on the movie financially.This in itself would have been enough to make the movie disappointing, but our disappointment is further compounded by the acting\/casting.  Who chose Hayden Christensen for Anakin?  *Why*?  The lad is completely wooden, and totally devoid of charisma.  His delivery of the already bad dialogue is so monotonous that he seems to be sucking the life right out of the viewer whenever he speaks.  This is meant to be the young Darth Vader?  The rear parts of my anatomy would have played the part better.  Hayden Christensen is definitely the final nail in the coffin of any hopes that Attack Of The Clones would be a worthy successor to the Star Wars legacy.  Ewan McGregor helps to hammer that nail in too.  He can act very well - he was a great smack addict in Trainspotting - but he is terribly miscast as Obiwan.  Lucas' dialogue for Obiwan is already bafflingly juvenile, and McGregor's delivery adds further incongruity to the character Alec Guinness made legendary.So, yes Episode II is better than average - but the average Hollywood movie these days is completely dreadful, so this is not a great accolade.  With the money Lucas had available to spend, it should have been so much more - but he was obviously unwilling to sacrifice some of the limelight by spending the money on writers with talent.  Ultimately, I'm sure he'll make enough money not to care too much, but let posterity show him to have grown to be something of an ass.

This because I had been told it was considerably better than Episode I, with much less Jar Jar presence etc.During the first 1 - 1.5 hours of the movie, I thought it was rather slow most of the time. Especially so during the scenes with Amidala and Anakin. At times it was actually slow to the point of being outright boring.When I left the cinema after the movie, someone asked me what I thought of it. It then struck me that the thing I liked the most about the entire movie, was the sound effect used for the seismic charges among the asteroids.Naturally, there are other good things about the movie, but that was the one thing in the entire movie that felt perfect, or close to it.One part of the movie I liked was the water world with the tall aliens. These felt right (quite possibly because they look like aliens are supposed to look like according to other movies etc). They didn't feel so over-the-top like some other creations in the movie do (the thing Obi-Wan talked to at the diner for example).One other thing. During some scenes, I almost started looking for the gamepad controller infront of my seat. The whole look and feel of the scenes presented, was very close to those of a platform game. I'm refering to the scenes with Amidala and Anakin in some processing facility.And Jar Jar ... well, he wasn't in the movie that much. But everytime he's on screen, and especially when he's talking, I feel that I'm about 20 years too old to be in the target audience for the movie.I think Jar Jar is something that only young children can really appreciate, and I'll go out on a limb and say that pretty much every other viewer of Episode I thought that his presence made the movie worse than it would have been without him.So ... why am I not so thrilled about this movie? Well, I think the plain truth is that I've become too old for Star Wars. I was 10 years old when I first saw Return of the Jedi on cinema. I was blown away by the movie, and found the Ewoks fascinating instead of annoying. Now, 20 years - and thousands of movies - later, I'm expecting much more from a movie. Now, I can detect sub-par dialogue and acting.Episode I and II, to me, feels like movies that are made almost exclusively for children (unlike, for example, LoTR).

I first saw this on video as a teenager, although I do remember the original trailer on TV and thinking 'I wish I could watch adult films!'. -It scared the cr*p out of me!The story itself (from a 1930s sci-fi novella) is a fantastic idea alone. An alien creature that can assume the identity of any organism it 'comes into contact with' (this is a very mild expression next to the slime-fest we're exposed to in the film!). Not only that, but it can assume the form of any, part of, or all the things it has *previously* come into contact with.. And this Thing has been around!  We know this as it arrives via Flying-saucer-in-trouble some time before the dawn of mankind.  This is shown right before the titles giving this film one of the most memorable intros I've seen (to match the memorable ending - see below).Thus we are given arguably the best monster to ever appear on celluloid.This film will be compared to 'Alien' a lot simply because the premise is similar (close-knit group of vulnerable people in claustrophobic prison-like environment, locked in with unknown man-killer) and they were released at a similar time.  BUT the *big* difference you have to recognise between the two monsters is that The Thing can look like anything and therefore you don't know who the monster is, and Alien was ultimately, a bloke-in-a-suit which has been done since the dawn of cinema!Now we have established why the monster is so good in concept, you have to go on to talk about Rob Bottin's gruesome realisation of the monster. These have to be amongst the most violent and disturbing creature effects ever made, along with possibly the original Evil Dead, An American Werewolf In London and, of course, Aliens.This guy was 20 when he started his work on The Thing.  Yes *20 years old*. Obviously he's read a lot of sci fi and comic books, and the excellent DVD will tell you he worked on The Howling before this movie, so knew his stuff where latex and goo was concerned.  This guy helped to create one of the most memorable movie scenes ever made (the infamous resuscitation scene).  His effects are a work of genius and even the filmmakers had doubts he could pull some of it off.  To my mind this stuff is more difficult and gives better results than the modern CG equivalent.  One of his creations was described as 'beautiful' and 'a work of art' by cast and crew. Those images will stick in your minds forever once you have seen this movie, I guarantee it!  Even after watching the DVD extras you have to marvel at what they pulled off and how it was accomplished.Rob worked so hard on this movie he was sent to hospital for nervous exhaustion after working 18 hrs a day, 7-days a week for months.  That's when the second-unit effects team were called in to do some of the kennel scene - led by Mr Terminator himself, Stan Winston.Next mention goes to Kurt Russel.  Personally this is my favourite Kurt film and to be honest, one of a very few genuinely good films he's been in. His understated Macready character is immensely watchable, and more importantly believable, as the alcoholic ex-Nam copter pilot who is forced into becoming the reluctant leader. Whenever I hear the name Kurt Russel now I always think of this bearded character standing in the snow with a flamethrower and a squashed mexican sombrero!Next we have the rest of the cast who do a great job of getting across the potential flashpoint mix of all-male characters. Yes there are no women in this movie and in my mind it's better for it.  So we have this initially confined group (who never seem to do any work!) tolerating but knowing very well each other's habits, becoming an intensely paranoid and potentially murderous bunch of frightened men looking to their leader to deal with this Thing. This changeover from friends to enemies happens over the course of one maybe two scenes and so becomes great cinema, without the monster.Next the sound and music.  For some reason Carpenter mentions Ennio Morricone's music once in the DVD extras, and does not mention the sound effects at all!  Russel actually asks him in the Director's Commentary how they got a certain sound and Carpenter laughs the question off with 'who knows'. Shame on you John Carpenter!  For the sound effects are some of the most disturbing I've heard in a movie, especially when the dogs are suffering, and also at the conclusion of the blood test scene.  The violence that comes across in this scene is carried 50% in the screaming of the men, the smashing furniture, the coughing of the broken flamethrower ('Windows, blast him!!') and the horrible gurgling of the Thing itself.I am still confused as to how much of the main musical score in the film is John Carpenter and how much is Mr Morricone.  It certainly sounds more Carpenter than Morricone, with that trademark simple sinister baseline and dread-inspiring chords.  Whoever it is the soundtrack is also extremely fitting and memorable, right from the first credits.Mention has to go also to the set designers and builders who create this incredibly realistic environment, perfect for the story, in snow-covered British Columbia.  They built it in summer when there was no snow so that by the time it came to filming it would look as real as possible.  Much of the internal shots were done in refrigerated sets in a very hot LA summer. I still wonder how much research was done into, er, research posts - especially with regard to the amount of firepower they store in the film! - racks of shotguns and 2 flamethrowers!!  Maybe those copters take a little more defrosting in the mornings than most ;)  Anyway we worry about the details after the film because the flamethrowers are such an integral part of the action and fire is the only method our victims know of killing this Thing.Last mention to Carpenter himself who does a great job of realising the vision of the original story, bringing some great performances out of the actors who didn't have a lot to work with, and giving us one of the most memorable endings to a movie the last 2 survivors sit in the burning wreckage of the base, exchange a bottle of whisky, knowing they eventually will either freeze or be eaten by their colleague and Macready says 'lets just see what happens..' Fade to black. Fantastic stuff!So, 20 years on, a lot of sci-fi, monsters and computer graphics have passed us by but The Thing still lives on as a very disturbing but believable take on the alien takes you over nightmare. I had very real nightmares for years which were a cross between this version of The Thing and the 70s version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Perhaps Kurt Russel, Rob Bottin and John Carpenter's finest hours. Buy the Collector's DVD!!

This guy helped to create one of the most memorable movie scenes ever made (the infamous resuscitation scene).  His effects are a work of genius and even the filmmakers had doubts he could pull some of it off.  To my mind this stuff is more difficult and gives better results than the modern CG equivalent.  One of his creations was described as 'beautiful' and 'a work of art' by cast and crew. Those images will stick in your minds forever once you have seen this movie, I guarantee it!  Even after watching the DVD extras you have to marvel at what they pulled off and how it was accomplished.Rob worked so hard on this movie he was sent to hospital for nervous exhaustion after working 18 hrs a day, 7-days a week for months.  That's when the second-unit effects team were called in to do some of the kennel scene - led by Mr Terminator himself, Stan Winston.Next mention goes to Kurt Russel.  Personally this is my favourite Kurt film and to be honest, one of a very few genuinely good films he's been in. His understated Macready character is immensely watchable, and more importantly believable, as the alcoholic ex-Nam copter pilot who is forced into becoming the reluctant leader. Whenever I hear the name Kurt Russel now I always think of this bearded character standing in the snow with a flamethrower and a squashed mexican sombrero!Next we have the rest of the cast who do a great job of getting across the potential flashpoint mix of all-male characters. Yes there are no women in this movie and in my mind it's better for it.  So we have this initially confined group (who never seem to do any work!) tolerating but knowing very well each other's habits, becoming an intensely paranoid and potentially murderous bunch of frightened men looking to their leader to deal with this Thing. This changeover from friends to enemies happens over the course of one maybe two scenes and so becomes great cinema, without the monster.Next the sound and music.  For some reason Carpenter mentions Ennio Morricone's music once in the DVD extras, and does not mention the sound effects at all!  Russel actually asks him in the Director's Commentary how they got a certain sound and Carpenter laughs the question off with 'who knows'. Shame on you John Carpenter!  For the sound effects are some of the most disturbing I've heard in a movie, especially when the dogs are suffering, and also at the conclusion of the blood test scene.  The violence that comes across in this scene is carried 50% in the screaming of the men, the smashing furniture, the coughing of the broken flamethrower ('Windows, blast him!!') and the horrible gurgling of the Thing itself.I am still confused as to how much of the main musical score in the film is John Carpenter and how much is Mr Morricone.  It certainly sounds more Carpenter than Morricone, with that trademark simple sinister baseline and dread-inspiring chords.  Whoever it is the soundtrack is also extremely fitting and memorable, right from the first credits.Mention has to go also to the set designers and builders who create this incredibly realistic environment, perfect for the story, in snow-covered British Columbia.  They built it in summer when there was no snow so that by the time it came to filming it would look as real as possible.  Much of the internal shots were done in refrigerated sets in a very hot LA summer. I still wonder how much research was done into, er, research posts - especially with regard to the amount of firepower they store in the film! - racks of shotguns and 2 flamethrowers!!  Maybe those copters take a little more defrosting in the mornings than most ;)  Anyway we worry about the details after the film because the flamethrowers are such an integral part of the action and fire is the only method our victims know of killing this Thing.Last mention to Carpenter himself who does a great job of realising the vision of the original story, bringing some great performances out of the actors who didn't have a lot to work with, and giving us one of the most memorable endings to a movie the last 2 survivors sit in the burning wreckage of the base, exchange a bottle of whisky, knowing they eventually will either freeze or be eaten by their colleague and Macready says 'lets just see what happens..' Fade to black. Fantastic stuff!So, 20 years on, a lot of sci-fi, monsters and computer graphics have passed us by but The Thing still lives on as a very disturbing but believable take on the alien takes you over nightmare. I had very real nightmares for years which were a cross between this version of The Thing and the 70s version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Perhaps Kurt Russel, Rob Bottin and John Carpenter's finest hours. Buy the Collector's DVD!!

I first saw this on video as a teenager, although I do remember the original trailer on TV and thinking 'I wish I could watch adult films!'. -It scared the cr*p out of me!The story itself (from a 1930s sci-fi novella) is a fantastic idea alone. An alien creature that can assume the identity of any organism it 'comes into contact with' (this is a very mild expression next to the slime-fest we're exposed to in the film!). Not only that, but it can assume the form of any, part of, or all the things it has *previously* come into contact with.. And this Thing has been around!  We know this as it arrives via Flying-saucer-in-trouble some time before the dawn of mankind.  This is shown right before the titles giving this film one of the most memorable intros I've seen (to match the memorable ending - see below).Thus we are given arguably the best monster to ever appear on celluloid.This film will be compared to 'Alien' a lot simply because the premise is similar (close-knit group of vulnerable people in claustrophobic prison-like environment, locked in with unknown man-killer) and they were released at a similar time.  BUT the *big* difference you have to recognise between the two monsters is that The Thing can look like anything and therefore you don't know who the monster is, and Alien was ultimately, a bloke-in-a-suit which has been done since the dawn of cinema!Now we have established why the monster is so good in concept, you have to go on to talk about Rob Bottin's gruesome realisation of the monster. These have to be amongst the most violent and disturbing creature effects ever made, along with possibly the original Evil Dead, An American Werewolf In London and, of course, Aliens.This guy was 20 when he started his work on The Thing.
