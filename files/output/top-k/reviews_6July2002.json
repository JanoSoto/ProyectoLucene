I gotta see that!? And then when you actually do see it, it's nothing like your expectations? It actually EXCEEDS them? Well, Rat Race is that kind of movie!From the opening credits, when those goofy little cutouts of the cast are dancing around and beating each other up, I knew we were in for a treat. And what a treat it was... one that built up with each laugh, each scene, making you want more, more, more, until the climax at the very end where we see that these screwballs are really great people after all.Now, first off, I would like to note that this movie would NOT have been so great if I had not watched it with our TV Guardian (which is a handy little machine that filters out bad language by reading the closed captioning). I can tell from the many times that the TV momentarily muted out that the language in this movie is quite heavy, but if you have the capability to watch it without hearing the cussing I say go for it! However, just so nobody gets the wrong idea, there ARE a couple of things that credit a quick averting of the eyes.Anyway, now that I have my moral problems with this movie out of the way, I can continue with my review! I was so impressed by the immense talent of this cast- John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Breckin Meyer, Kathy Najimy, Jon Lovitz, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Rowan Atkinson, and yes, even Seth Green were all magnificent. Their excellent portrayals of these completely whacked-out people somewhat make you wonder what their real personal lives are like! And the star cameos, such as Dean Cain, Paul Rodriguez, Wayne Knight, and the always great Kathy Bates, were done to hilarious lunatic perfection.One thing that really struck me about the way this movie was done was that each team had so many mini-adventures... and each was funnier than the last! Randy and Bev and the kids visiting the Barbie museum, stealing Hitler's car, and crashing the WWII vet reunion; Vera and Merril's ride on the rocket car, trip with the mentally ill, and scafuffle with the Squirrel Lady; Enrico's sleeping problem, his ride with the EMT and chase after the heart, and his bug-like splatting on the train... the list goes on and on.  Normally, it seems like in a movie such as this, after every excursion the characters go on, the movie looses something of its charm and originality. Not in this one! The exact opposite is true here... every time they sidestep danger, we wait expactantly to see what will happen next... and each adventure is always better than the last one.I'd have to say that my favorite scenes were on the bus full of Lucy impersonators. I have always been a big Lucille Ball fan and the idea of having an entire bus full of Lucys was a stroke of true genius. The part when they all start crying like Lucy (Waaaaaaaaah!!!) cracked me up. Also, as I'm sure you can guess by the title of this review, I really enjoyed the Kathy Bates character and subsequent crash down the cliff. And of course, who could forget one of the greatest running gags in comedy history... the cow and the balloon. Boy, I sure would like to shake the hand of whoever thought that up.Anyway, all in all, it was a pretty great movie, full of memorable characters and impressive performances. I really liked the ending, too. Altho some people have said it was preachy or too contrived, I say it was the best way to close out what had been two hours of nonstop riotous laughter. And the ending shot, where the cast is being held up by the audience in the concert... priceless!! However, the inappropriate language and the other things (Randy and Bev's accidental signal to the biker, Harold's rather inappropriate request to Vicky, and the Pierced Girl's... um... unshyness) prohibit me from giving this a perfect 10 rating.

You all probably know the plot, but for those who haven't seen the film, don't go in thinking this is a huge action film like the trailer boasts. Don't get me wrong, there is action, but it doesn't over populate the film. It focuses on character and story. And all the better for it. As always, the brilliant John Williams is on music duty, and instead of driving the movie with his score, he makes it more suttle and quiet, providing a backdrop to a scene, that is quite frankly, gorgous. And Spielberg again, shows why he is the best director in the business. Some of the camera work and design of the shots are fantastic, and the acing which he gets out of the actors is superb. Tom Cruise is great as the flawed drug abusing John Anderton, but he has competition in the best actor stakes. As an opposing federal agent, Colin Farrell steals almost every scene with his cool, determind gum chewing character Danny Witwer. He plays the role with such confidence, it's hard not to dislike him. After the first two hours of mayhem and confusion, it slows down a gear, which for some people may drag the film down. I certainly felt a bit funny when it changed from ace futuristic thriller into an almost cliched who-dunnit crime drama, and maybe Spielberg played his all too familiar sentiment card too much, but it certainly weakens one of the best films in recent years. But despite the change of pace, on second viewing, the ending does work, but it still felt just a tad too long. But by the end, you are willing to forgive it for the minor setback, because the previous 2 hours are just brilliant, in every possible way. Can Spielberg make a bad film?

You all probably know the plot, but for those who haven't seen the film, don't go in thinking this is a huge action film like the trailer boasts. Don't get me wrong, there is action, but it doesn't over populate the film. It focuses on character and story. And all the better for it. As always, the brilliant John Williams is on music duty, and instead of driving the movie with his score, he makes it more suttle and quiet, providing a backdrop to a scene, that is quite frankly, gorgous. And Spielberg again, shows why he is the best director in the business. Some of the camera work and design of the shots are fantastic, and the acing which he gets out of the actors is superb. Tom Cruise is great as the flawed drug abusing John Anderton, but he has competition in the best actor stakes. As an opposing federal agent, Colin Farrell steals almost every scene with his cool, determind gum chewing character Danny Witwer. He plays the role with such confidence, it's hard not to dislike him. After the first two hours of mayhem and confusion, it slows down a gear, which for some people may drag the film down. I certainly felt a bit funny when it changed from ace futuristic thriller into an almost cliched who-dunnit crime drama, and maybe Spielberg played his all too familiar sentiment card too much, but it certainly weakens one of the best films in recent years. But despite the change of pace, on second viewing, the ending does work, but it still felt just a tad too long. But by the end, you are willing to forgive it for the minor setback, because the previous 2 hours are just brilliant, in every possible way. Can Spielberg make a bad film?

Interesting concept. To function in society, he must write important things down and take Polaroid pictures of people and places in order to 'remember' them later.

Sadly, not many people will be open to rediscovery after the initial viewing.Gena Rowlands stars as Marion Post, a 50ish philosophy professor whose life is in order. She rents an apartment to work on her latest book. By accident, she discovers that through the heating duct, she can hear all conversations from the psychiatrist located in said building. At first, she covers the duct with cushions to block the sound, but she decides to listen in after hearing, by accident, the testimony of a young pregnant woman. This sets in motion a chain of events that changes Marion forever.Woody has said that he originally conceived the idea as a comedy and indeed, it could be played that way (on a smaller scale in Everyone Says I Love You). But here, Allen resists the temptation to play it for laughs. In fact, there is not one single moment of comedy relief in his film. I think that is a wise decision. I was so absorbed by Marion's journey that comedy would have broken the mood of the film. This film is another venture into Bergmanesque cinema and Another Woman can compare with the very best Bergman.Gena Rowlands hasn't had a role this good since the films of her late husband John Cassavetes. This in fact, shows another side of Rowlands; a more restrained, mannered character than the fiery, passionate characters in the Cassavetes films. It just shows the different types of roles Rowlands can play so well. She deserved an Oscar nomination for this.In fact, the whole film is well cast by Allen. Gene Hackman is great in a mellow part as Marion's ex-lover. Blythe Danner makes a return to form as Marion's best friend. It is great to see Danner do what she does best, especially following the horrible Brighton Beach Memoirs in which she was underused. Ian Holm is superb as Marion's husband, who as Roger Ebert puts it must have a wife so he can cheat on her. In his final film, John Houseman allows himself to appear weak and frail; quite a change from the pillar of strength in The Paper Chase and a good cap to a great career.I mentioned at the beginning that not many people will be open to rediscovering Another Woman. I think that is correct. Here are my reasons why. First, the film is deliberately paced, even with a short running time of 81 minutes. Most viewers' attention spans won't be able to tolerate the long takes Allen is famous for. Second, the film doesn't offer any instant gratification or closure. Allen's story is one of those stories that just can't have a typical happy Hollywood ending. Third, there is T&A, even though adultery plays a large part in the story. So if you're looking for a fast paced film with T$A and guns and action and a happy ending, you might as well move on.Another Woman is one of those films in which rediscovery is necessary. Allen packs so much into 81 minutes that multiple viewings are necessary to absorb it all. If you make the effort to see it again, you might find that Another Woman is a film of great power and feeling that works better every time you see it.**** out of 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2002","score":"43 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":"  Woody Allen's Another Woman is, upon rediscovery, a film of great power and feeling.

Most viewers' attention spans won't be able to tolerate the long takes Allen is famous for. Second, the film doesn't offer any instant gratification or closure. Allen's story is one of those stories that just can't have a typical happy Hollywood ending. Third, there is T&A, even though adultery plays a large part in the story. So if you're looking for a fast paced film with T$A and guns and action and a happy ending, you might as well move on.Another Woman is one of those films in which rediscovery is necessary. Allen packs so much into 81 minutes that multiple viewings are necessary to absorb it all. If you make the effort to see it again, you might find that Another Woman is a film of great power and feeling that works better every time you see it.**** out of 4 stars ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 July 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  At the beginning of the film, Timothy Hutton's character is coming back home for his high school reunion.  How long will he stay?  Will he go back to his girlfriend in the big city?  Will he become an office equipment salesperson?  As the movie progresses we see Hutton's old high school comrades all stuck back at home in dead end jobs in small town New England with their glory days well behind them.  This especially holds true for  Dillon's character who was Joe popular in high school and is now being used by his former high school sweetheart who left Dillon to marry a wealthy man.  Yet, the Dillon's ex girlfriend still uses him for sexual purposes from time to time.  We actually see the entire cast of male characters in this film evolve (some more than others and as much as certain characters are capable of doing).  We see the largest transformation in this film with Hutton's character.  Hutton's discovery eventually, is that his current life is actually pretty good and he as a person is a lot better off than if he had stayed in small town New England with his high school cohorts.  He accomplishes this transformation with the help of a 13-year-old girl who lives next door and Uma Thurman's character.  We also see Dillon discover that he wants a long term commitment with his current girlfriend and the character that plows snow into his ex girlfriends driveway eventually starts removing snow by the movie's end.  We also see the aggressive character realize that physical violence is not always the answer and that the man he was going to beat up but did not, was someone's father.  There was also the character that had photos of models in his room stating that he wanted to marry someone that looked like that eventually realizing that it probably would not happen.  Every male character in this movie grew up in this film some to lesser and or greater degrees than others.  Hutton eventually decides to go back to Chicago?, New York? (there were New York license plates on the Saab) with his girlfriend after an altercation on the night of the reunion.  One of his friends states, (I can't remember who), as Hutton is leaving the hospital, we'll all be right here waiting for you if you ever decide to come back and visit.  That statement is not hard for the viewer or for Hutton's character to believe.  Hutton then walks out of the hospital, leaves the viewer sensing that Hutton is happy that he is moving on, and not stuck behind with his less well off high school friends in small town New England.  In short, the movie is about personal growth and growing up and then maybe moving on like Hutton's character did.

He landed near middle of 30000 NVA troops who were launching an offensive.  This film is based upon that event, via a book that I believe is a fictionalized version of the actual events.  The film is excellent, but what I know of the real story would have perhaps made at least as compelling a movie.  Still, taken as a sort-of-based-on-a-true story kind of thing, Bat 21 succeeds on all levels.  It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over, and have.The acting is superlative, from all involved.  Gene Hackman is always excellent and here he's in fine form.  Danny Glover, too, is great in his role as the 'Bird Dog' spotter pilot who remotely helps  Hambleton through his ordeal in Vietnamese 'Indian country.'  Jerry Reed, the talented Nashville guitar-picker (his 1967 and 1968 work on Elvis Presley's sessions resulted in some of the tastiest material that Elvis ever produced) who achieved movie fame with his trucker roles in Burt Reymolds' good-ole-boys projects, is perfect as the CO of the air-rescue team.  He was also instrumental in getting this movie made.  Other actors in smaller roles are also great, particularly the 'Jolly Green' pilot played by David Marshall Grant.The character that Gene Hackman plays is singularly unprepared for his surroundings -- a departure from the kinds of roles that he had in films like The French Connection, The Package, Mississippi Burning, etc -- and is forced to face the reality of death up close for the first time in his death-dealing professional career.  the whole hiding-in-the jungle, avoiding-the-NVA, trying-not-to-get-impaled-on-punji sticks experience that he goes through is wearying and paranoia-inducing to behold.  The cinematography and use of locations in this film is spectacular, too, and really heightens the narrative effect.  It seems amazing that a combat-green 53-year-old golf addict could survive the conditions of the Vietnamese jungle, let alone while being hunted by North Vietnamese troops, let alone for as many days as he lasted.  On top of it all -- as in reality -- he called in air strikes on a crossroads at which men and materiel were massing.Among the more poignant scenes are his killing a Vietnamese man -- the failure to communicate that led to the fatal incident is a metaphor for US failure to understand the people that they were charged with protecting and fighting -- and his speechlessness when silently confronted by the man's family.  Also fairly profound is a scene in which the wounded Hambleton, about at the end of his tether, is saved from a booby trap by a young boy. That and other incidents, including the panicked flight of a Vietnamese soldier before an American carpet-bombing attack, highlight the inherent inanity of war and the price of the ultimately pointless Vietnam conflict. On the other hand, I defy anyone to watch the bad guys' treatment of the downed Jolly Green crew and not feel anger toward them.  Sure, that didn't happen (at least not in the real rescue of Hambleton), but it sure enough gives you a better understanding of how soldiers might torch a village and even commit 'war crimes' in retaliation.  All too good an understanding, actually.The real story was perhaps even more remarkable, with Ham on the run for 12 days in April of 1972 before being rescued by a team that consisted of a Navy SEAL (later awarded the Medal of Honor) and an ARVN Ranger.  The recovery of Colonel Hambleton was the biggest rescue operation of the Vietnam War.  The protracted rescue resulted in the award of 234 medals and the downing of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, including a second bird-dog and a 'Jolly Green' rescue helicopter.  Eleven people died to retrieve Hambleton, two were captured, and five aircraft were shot down. On the day that Ham was shot down, two of the helicopters sent to pick him up were also shot down.  Lieutenant (not Captain) Mark (not Bartholomew) Clark (grandson of a well-known WWII general...to further distance reality from the film, I believe that Clark was of Caucasian extraction), spotting from an OV-10A Bronco in support of the rescue mission, was shot down the very next day (with another officer, the actual pilot, who was captured after a few hours) and ended up evading capture almost as long as did Ham.  I know that the facts might have been changed to focus on the interplay between two men but that's a pretty big change and I suspect that the movie would have been just as great with both leads on the ground.  Hambleton WAS encouraged by the FACs in the Broncos and I guess that the producers (or the man who wrote the original book) decided to roll them all up into Danny Glover's Clark.  By the way, Hambleton was rescued by following a golf-based code but I believe that the idea originated with someone back at HQ rather than from the downed officer.  Okay, so it's all fictionalized, and I guess it's still 'based on a true story.' LOOSELY based, though.  William Anderson, who co-wrote the screenplay, wrote Bat 21 as a novel, so it's not that Hollywood took it upon itself to fictionalize because the tale was already so.Ironically enough, Hambleton is called Ham in the film but was known to his friends in real life as Gene, as in Gene Hackman.

Frank is a Typical Movie Texan such as one might meet in any trailer park Paunchy, ugly, brutish and violent, with an instantly obnoxious drawl and the obligatory Cadillac.

Karen escapes and eventually winds up fleeing from Frank on foot and wouldn't you know it, she happens upon a conveniently located secret facility that turns out to be a time-travel machine. The facility obviously took a small army of skilled builders and technicians months to build, but of course there is no security except an electronic door, and only one person inside Brian, the inventor, who clearly deserves the Philo T.

The other guy is something of a schmuck, looks a bit like Tommy Dorsey, and goes along with the gag at first. Then he finds that he is actually falling for the victim and tells her the truth about the game being played on her, handling the whole nasty business very badly.

Acting is excellent, cinematography is original, really fantastic, gave the film a stylistic twist on the jump cutting of your usual thriller.

So not only is The Bourne Identity sleek, told with flair and creativity, it's also got an excuse for it's old -hat plot; that's something most movies don't have, an excuse. The music's great, too, if a little retro-seventies French pop. I've been what you might call a rabid fan of Powell and Gregson Williams for a while, and this stuff by Powell is really good.

Whether it be the Animal House or Porky's or more modern ones &#150; I hate almost all of them!  So when I watched this I watched it with a certain fear.  However the plot makes redresses the balance by having us support the nerds!  It's well plotted so that it isn't just them becoming just like the jocks but instead learning their own lessons.  Of course it is rude at times and does fall into being just silly and slapstick, but it's mixed nicely with some good sentiment and more gentle laugh.The cast is great (in retrospect).  Anthony Edwards is a real surprise in this post-ER time.  Likewise Busfield is strange after 30-something and West Wing.  Less so but Moonlighting's Curtis Armstrong is funny to see.  And lets not forget James Cromwell (or Jamie as he was called then!), John Goodman and black 1970's star Bernie Casey!  The nerds are all good &#150; rising above their caricatures to start to bring out characters.Overall this is a spin on the frat-comedy so it is a little juvenile and silly but the fact that it is spun towards the nerds makes it that little bit refreshing to watch compared to so many where our `heroes' are arrogant, annoying jock-types who sponge off mummy and daddy just to get drunk at college.

Anthony Edwards is a real surprise in this post-ER time.  Likewise Busfield is strange after 30-something and West Wing.  Less so but Moonlighting's Curtis Armstrong is funny to see.

The nerds are all good &#150; rising above their caricatures to start to bring out characters.Overall this is a spin on the frat-comedy so it is a little juvenile and silly but the fact that it is spun towards the nerds makes it that little bit refreshing to watch compared to so many where our `heroes' are arrogant, annoying jock-types who sponge off mummy and daddy just to get drunk at college.  Not a great movie but much better than anything else post-Animal House - I'm with the nerds!
