I think in order to assess it properly, we have to make some distasteful concessions.There was really virtually no chance that the leads would be played by Asians in a Hollywood film in 1937. For starters, the book was a major bestseller, and it did not come cheap. Add to that an epic story line that involves at least one extended crowd scene (it is in fact the scene of a riot) and the locust invasion (God only KNOWS how they pulled that one off).So they were sinking serious money into this project, and the brutal truth was that they needed names. Paul Muni was at the top of his game in 1937, and Luise Rainer had won the Oscar the year before as Anna Held in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. Some decisions are made with the eye firmly on the cash register.So it comes as a great surprise that this movie turned out to be so good. Yes, you have to overlook the fact that many of the actors are about as Asian as apple pie (though to be fair, the makeup department probably got them as close as anyone could to looking the part), but the funny thing is that the mixed bag of ethnicities in the cast quickly becomes lost in a grand, sweeping, brilliantly filmed and acted epic story of a Chinese peasant farmer and his family.Muni, who was in a sense the male Meryl Streep of his day, scores big as Wang Lung. He was too tall, and they could not do anything about that, but they wisely did not try, and before long, thanks to Muni's deeply committed performance, suspension of disbelief becomes that much easier.But at the end of the day, this film belongs to Luise Rainer. As O-Lan, she would become the first actress to win the Best Actress Oscar two years in a row. The first one was for THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, another splendid performance, though the role was so small that it really belonged in the supporting category. As O-Lan, she is triumphant. I read the book many years ago in high school, and loved it, so I sort of avoided a movie that contained so many Western actors in Asian roles. But Rainer plays the stolid, silent, and uncomplaining O-Lan exactly as she is written in Pearl S Buck's novel; it is almost at times as if she is channeling her. A good many people at the time thought Garbo was going to win for CAMILLE, but I've never been able to stand her; an old-guard over-actress if ever there was one, she chewed more scenery than Davis, Crawford, and the notorious Miriam Hopkins put together.The rest of the cast, thanks to Irving G Thalberg's taste and eye for quality, is equally good. This was to be Thalberg's final film before his premature death at thirty-seven, and it was dedicated to him as his last great achievement. Not without reason. Despite the slight awkwardness in the casting, and a script that toward the end veered into sentimentality (quite unlike the novel, but for a Hollywood movie it's a small deviation), this is a mesmerizing film that takes a good close look at the harshness of poverty. In that sense it can be considered a precursor to John Ford's THE GRAPES OF WRATH three years later. And while Ford's film is clearly superior to its predecessor, it is quite possible that without THE GOOD EARTH, THE GRAPES OF WRATH would never have been made. Hollywood in those days liked fluff and happy endings; it would be several more years before realism became more commonplace in American cinema, largely due to the film noir movement.I have to say it I love this movie. It captures the heart and soul of the book, and falters only slightly at the end, and despite the casting, has not dated nearly as badly as one would have thought. And for a Hollywood film with mostly non-Asian actors playing Chinese peasants, that really IS something of a miracle.

Based on the book written by Michael Crichton. Jurassic Park is about a man named John Hammond who does the impossible, he genetically engineers dinosaurs to serve as attractions in his upcoming amusement park Jurassic Park. But before Jurassic Park can open to the public it must be proved to be safe for visitors. John willingly invites the top minds of their respective fields of Paleontology, Mathematics Theory and Paleobotanist. But little known to John Hammond there is trouble brewing right under his very nose...And troubles name is Dennis Nedry the parks underpaid and disgruntled computer programmer who attempts to commit industrial espionage which sets off the chain of events that take place at Jurassic Park.Jurassic Park scores so high for me because it is a truly high quality movie, from the wonderful script to the wonder actors that portrayed their characters as any fan of the book would expect. And the music...This musical score on this movie is worth its weight in gold. This movie also features some very early use of CGI and its actually done quite well, Even watching it today the CGI stands up good to the test of time.Jurassic Park also features what I consider to be THE best animal attack scene ever filmed in the history of movies. ''Spoiler Ahead'' And that scene is when the Tyrannosaurus Rex breaks out of its containment paddock and attacks the visitors Safari Explores which are parked right next to the disable electric fence that once contained the T-Rex. There is no music in this scene, its filmed to portray the attack as if it were happening to you...And believe me it does well with that.Many people die in Jurassic Park...Yet it remains relatively gore less. Which might not be a bad thing...Over goreing a movie just looks like you're trying to cover up bad scrip writing and acting. When people get killed in Jurassic Park the camera does not show you exactly what is going on, but lets you see just enough for you mind to make up its own picture of whats unfolding. A nice touch considering many movies today don't let you're mind work for itself. The Book however is quite gruesome in its death descriptions.I honestly can't think of anything really wrong with this movie...If anything some of the dialog might come off a bit slow. The movie discusses some of the scientific aspects of how the dinosaurs were created and what have you...If you're not interested in this kind of thing, this might seem like a slow part in the movie for you.

Mr. Levinson has given us some really great flicks over the years like rain man and diner, as well as some real stinkers like Sphere, envy, and of course Toys. So which camp does this one fall into well it was good, not great but good. So this movie could have been great I mean what a cast which includes Deniro, Patric, Pitt, and Hoffman. And the list keeps going. This movie is supposedly a real life fictionalized version of events that happened to the author of both the screenplay and the novel this film was based on, writer Lorenzo Carcaterra. The only problem there are zero records to back up this statement something the film disclaims at the end. Well what about the plot, well this is one of those flicks you should just watch, I think I was better for not knowing most of the plot going in and anyone else should be as well. There are some moments in this film that are not for children so just be aware of that before you sit little Billy or Betty down beside you to watch this. Also there is one plot point I will mention, half of this film takes place when the characters are young while the second half takes place when they have all grown up. So what did I not like about this film, well there were flashbacks which were useful, but just were a little too much and just complicated an already complicated story. There was also the narrative, normally I am a fan of narrative but here it didn't work for me. Besides from that this is a highly watchable film, and one that was filmed in the 1990's and takes place between the late 60's and early 80's, and holds up now some 15 years later. So finally is this film for everyone, well it's not very chicky and not lighthearted, its a guys film, but not like say insert generic action flick or crime flick here, it is slightly cerebral. I recommend it, but it is not in my top Levinson film picks by a long shot. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http\/\/raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"4 September 2011","score":"","review":" So I watched the star studded film from 1996 called Sleepers, and directed by academy award winning dude Barry Levinson.

I'm a big Arnold fan myself but even i have to admit that this film is pretty silly and kinda... well not kinda, it is corny. Arnold is the reason you watch this movie really but thats not to say Danny Devito doesn't hold his own, his wit and personality always explodes on the screen no matter what he's in. You could quote this movie with your friends and family but again they would be all Arnold quotes. Its not all bad though, there bits that make me laugh like the when you see Arnold come across a picture of Sylvester Stallone as 'Rambo' and laughs mockingly. They were big action star rivals at the time which is why its not Arnolds character 'Julius' laughing at Stallone, its Arnold! which is why it always makes me laugh. Also when when Schwarzenegger is singing 'yakety yak' very badly is funny. Also the 'I've only been driving an hour!' line makes me chuckle simply because of the way he says it. The other jokes are a little too obvious which feels like its really meant for a younger audience.

He made Predator the year before (best action film ever by the way) so he, at the time, was becoming a bigger and bigger star. I'm a big Arnold fan myself but even i have to admit that this film is pretty silly and kinda... well not kinda, it is corny. Arnold is the reason you watch this movie really but thats not to say Danny Devito doesn't hold his own, his wit and personality always explodes on the screen no matter what he's in. You could quote this movie with your friends and family but again they would be all Arnold quotes. Its not all bad though, there bits that make me laugh like the when you see Arnold come across a picture of Sylvester Stallone as 'Rambo' and laughs mockingly. They were big action star rivals at the time which is why its not Arnolds character 'Julius' laughing at Stallone, its Arnold! which is why it always makes me laugh. Also when when Schwarzenegger is singing 'yakety yak' very badly is funny. Also the 'I've only been driving an hour!' line makes me chuckle simply because of the way he says it. The other jokes are a little too obvious which feels like its really meant for a younger audience. As a kid watching this i loved it but with older eyes i still love it but i now watch it mainly for nostalgia value. If you want an 'comedy' staring Schwarzenegger then watch Commando, its excellent ) To some up, if your an Arnold fan you will watch this and like it all the same. Its a little dated now but if its on TV on a weekend evening and your having a night in, you'll watch it and enjoy it. Also Kelly Preston is smoking hot in it!.

Its such an interesting premise I would LOVE to see this movie remade with a good director and a large movie budget! As that would be GREAT! Screamers did have a OK script, it had a great story, OK character and storyline development. All in all it was an OK 1995 film. As most sci-fi goes it is not the worst at all!

It's an adaptation of Frank Herbert's '60s sci-fi novel and watching it is a huge undertaking you're drawn into a whole new mythological universe with its well established peoples, planets and nations, along with the divides, loyalties, heroes and villains that well-established fiction brings. It brought to mind seeing LORD OF THE RINGS for the first time in the sense that there's a great deal to take in (much more than in the comic-strip style STAR WARS).Watching this, it soon becomes that DUNE is needlessly complicated and better care needed to be taken in adapting a lengthy novel into a filmed version (even a film this long). There are so many characters vying for screen time that I struggled to make sense or indeed care about what I was seeing, and Kyle Maclachlan's young and upstarting hero is far too one-dimensional to be much interest. A lot of the early scenes are stagey and feel cod-Shakespearian; I'm sure they're integral to the storyline but I just found then dull beyond belief.It's not all bad. The storyline picks up as the film progresses, with the last hour a fairly exciting mix of action and suspense. David Lynch does the best he can with the material and adds some much-needed weirdness to the alien creations (also watch out for some early CGI, extremely crude by today's standards but a benchmark nonetheless). And what a cast! At least two dozen familiar actors from the era are present in myriad roles and it's a shame that none of them get much of a look in aside from Kenneth McMillan's grotesque villain.In the end, DUNE feels like an interesting failure there are elements of intrigue, suspense and plotting that work, but in the end it proved too taxing for the masses and subsequently bombed at the box office.

Clarence (Christian Slater) marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after knowing each other one day and when he goes to her pimp (Gary Oldman) to get her things he ends up killing the pimp and running off with half a million in cocaine. Soon the new couple are on their way to California to try and sale it but gangsters are hot on their trail. TRUE ROMANCE, at its heart, is a love story between the couple but with Tarantino's name attached you know it's not going to be your typical romance. Instead we get a foul-mouthed, non-stop violent and at times insane action picture that starts off weird and just keeps getting nuttier as the film goes along. As I said, you know you're in for a wild time when you've got Dennis Hopper playing the most normal person. It should also be mentioned that the mad man Hopper gets a terrific scene with Christopher Walken, which is worth the price of admission. I mean, the two craziest guys of their era in a scene together? Tarantino's screenplay is full of everything people have come to love about him including the references to older movies and the dialogue itself is just so sharp and fresh that you'll have no problem connecting to these characters even when the majority of viewers would never have come into contact with their type in real life. The all-star cast is another major plus with Slater and Arquette doing a terrific job together and they really come off as a wild and crazy couple.

The violence in the film is pretty brutal from start to finish with the pimp really getting a workout and the ending, which features the good guys doing battle with not only drug dealers but also gangsters and the police. The incredibly violent shoot out is so unrealistic but it's so stylishly done that you have no problem turning off your brain and enjoying. Some of the violence goes a tad bit too far and especially a sequence where Arquette gets her entire body broken to a pulp. There are a few minor issues with the story including how this comic book nerd could turn into a mad man over night plus the fact that it seems like the police are always missing no matter how crazy everything in the story gets.

Actually, it was fun hearing songs of my youth once more, especially long forgotten novelty tunes like The Thing and It's in the Book. I'd forgotten about grandma's Lysol that cures about anything when applied behind the ears.All in all, the movie's a beautifully observed elegy on a dying Texas town bypassed by post-war America. The town itself is a dusty husk, almost like an abandoned movie set, except it's not. Worse, there's no sense of future for the youth of the town. In fact there's very little to do except make-out and go to the movies. Of course, the girls won't go all the way without a wedding ring, which accounts for the many hasty marriages that don't appear to work out well. So that leaves the guys basically two choices&#x97; rush hormonally into married life or join the military. On the other hand, the girls have no choice at all. Hardly, it appears, is this a valentine to 1950's small town America.The screenplay spreads the dynamic over two or three intersecting stories. In the hands of lesser filmmakers the material could easily have descended into teary or titillating soap opera. However, Bogdanovich and McMurtry manage to capture an odd visual and emotional poetry from the damaged lives, thanks in part to exceptionally sensitive performances from Bottoms, Johnson, and Leachman. As things turn out, it's their three characters who are deepened emotionally despite the many dispiriting influences surrounding them. I suspect it's no accident that the most superficial of the lead characters Jacy (Shepherd) migrates to the city instead of reaching out for real relationships. There's a feeling that no matter where she goes, she'll end up like her mom, unhappy. I guess if there's a moral to the stories, it's something about emotional hurt being the necessary price for personal growth.Anyway, in my book, the movie's richly deserving of its many awards. Despite the 2- hour run-time and a general lack of action, I was never bored. Also, kudos to the filmmakers who filmed in gritty b&w and refused to prettify anything, while at the same time, capturing a level of rural life that Hollywood seldom bothers with.

I'm not a fan of aliens or horror films so perhaps these people are judging it by those standards. Maybe they came in expecting Alien or Nightmare on Elem Street, so if that's what you're into you definitely skip this film. But if you're looking for a soulful, delicate and powerful film that makes you think about the bigger questions (God, coincidences, faith and hope) and offers some actual ANSWERS (something films have little of these days) you'll enjoy this film even if you aren't into aliens or horror.Basically, it's about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), an Episcopalian priest who has just suffered a horrible tragedy that has made him lose his faith in God. He lives on a little farm with his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin)and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One morning he wakes up and discovers crop signs in his corn field. He at first thinks its just some neighborhood boys horsing around but soon it is discovered that there is a full-scale alien invasion underway all over the world. The best thing about this film is how realistically the character's respond to this emergency. I think if anything this insane were to actually happen people would at first be wholly unbelieving, then skeptical, slightly anxious and then full-blown terrified. They would sit and watch the news all day, holding their loved ones close, board up their homes and hide in the cellars or pack up the car and drive as far away from the trouble as they could go. Most alien films move right to the aliens wreaking carnage after the first ten minutes and therefore they lose something, they become a simple fight\/flight ride that we never really required to think about. This film for the most part never showing the aliens, only in glimpses, and therefore our imaginations are allowed to enhance the fear and tension. This makes it a slow-moving film, but it never loses that sense of anxiety, the feeling that somewhere out-there, something is watching you and waiting to pounce...The message of the film is a universal one at one point Graham asks his brother what kind of person is he, one who believes in blind luck and happy chance, that you are all alone in this world, or are you a person who believes that there are no coincidences and that there is Someone up there, watching and taking care of things? I myself am a Christian, but I think no matter what your religion, you will be able to take something comforting away from this film. I have seen many Christian films that do not give such a powerful display of faith as this one and I respect Shyamalan for being able to pull this off without it once seeming cheesy. The acting in this film is wonderful; the performances or subtle and quiet, these are everyday people still fragile after a tragedy, yet powerful and genuine. I know Gibson has been criticized and judged these past years, but he is without a doubt one of the best actors out there and his performance is the linchpin of this film, he character is so obviously damaged and insecure, yet when called upon he gives such strength and power. Phoenix is a great supporting role, he is quirky and rather simple, but no less strong or deep than his brother. The children are great, Culkin and Breslin work to together seamlessly and exude genuine love and tenderness for one another. Cherry Jones has a small part in this film but she is excellent in her scenes and even Shyamalan himself has a small scene, a very emotional one and he is actually very good. When I first saw this film I was unsure if I would enjoy it, the slow pace and the subtly of the performances, but by the end all this payed off I knew each character deeply and I was invested in their story, and the ending was one of the most moving experiences I have ever seen in film.

In the snug atmosphere of the theater she can let the woes of her job as a waitress and the brashness of her big galoot of a husband drain away as she transports herself to a world of glitz and glamor, adventure and romance. One week, she finds herself particularly taken with the character of the dashing explorer Tom Baxter from the motion picture The Purple Rose of Cairo. Though a side character, he seems the heart of the film, and her wide eyes are always on him. Imagine her surprise (and the surprise of the audience around her) when she finds that his eyes have also been on her! Mia Farrow is sublime as Cecilia, endearing and instantly likable. She brings such adorability and sweetness to this poor little waitress, at the same time infusing her with such humanity and believability, that it seems no wonder that a movie character would want to descend from the screen to meet her. And as that character, Jeff Daniels is charming and hilariously innocent; his goofy scenes acclimating to the 'real world' are amongst the funniest in the film. Daniels also does a fine job in the part of the actor who plays Tom in the 'real world'.But Woody Allen's screenplay is the real star of the show. Bright and inventive, it sucks in the viewer in a manner similar to the way Cecilia comes to be sucked into the motion picture within the film. It introduces a world where the inexplicable and magical can occur without explanation &#x96; which only makes it all the more wondrous &#x96; and is chock-full of memorable quotes and sequences.

This movie was cheesy and not at all what I was expecting from such a creepy box cover. But the comic does exist and made me dislike this movie even more! The comic was absolutely dreadful, and I mean that in the best way possible. It was dark and depressing which was exactly what James O'Barr was trying to do. It was supposed to express the unbearable pain of Eric Draven losing the love of his life to criminals. The comic conveys this pain very well, and that makes the comic truly dark and scary. The movie, however, did no such thing.Brandon Lee did a very poor job acting as the Crow with his cheap jokes and cheesy rock session. I was appalled at what I saw when I saw Draven rock out with his guitar. Lee did not bring the character of the comic to life, and instead delivered lines so poorly that it made me cringe at times. I honestly am in support for the reboot because I am HOPING they can express the true darkness that is in the comic.Not all of the blame goes to Lee though.

Together these three films represent the very best film noirs that ever was to come out of Hollywood or ever would again. Of the three however OUT OF THE PAST arguably stands a toe in front of the others as the all time favourite. Why is this? Perhaps it's because of its meatier narrative and story line with its palpable unrelenting dramatic thrust together with its extraordinary camera setups and its remarkable use of light and shadow or perhaps because of its faultless screenplay matched in interpretation by inspired casting. No matter what the reason OUT OF THE PAST simply manages to stand out as the most sublime and mesmerizing thriller ever made. Produced for RKO by Warren Duff it was splendidly written for the screen by Geoffrey Holmes which derived from his novel Build My Gallows High (the picture's title in England). Stunningly photographed in Black & White by Nicholas Musuraca it was arrestingly scored by Roy Webb (The best thing he ever did) and the picture was directed with a positive flair by Jacques Tourneur.Jeff Markham, alias Jeff Bailey, (Robert Mitchum) a man with a past ekes out a living running a filling station outside Bakersfield. One day out of the blue - and out of Jeff's past - arrives Joe Stafanos (Paul Valentine) the strong-arm henchman of shady businessman Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). He's here with a message for Jeff that Whit wants to see him again. Some time ago Jeff was a private eye and Whit had engaged him to go to Mexico and hunt down his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who had absconded with $40,000. In flashback we see Jeff finding her but unwittingly the vulnerable Jeff falls in love with her and they go on the run together. But not for long, Whit sends Jeff's estranged detective partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) to find them both but when he does Kathie shoots and kills him and disappears leaving Jeff to return to the states alone. He gives up the detective business and buries himself in Bakersfield running a gas station. Now Whit has located him and wants to see him. But it's only a ruse to have Jeff framed for Fisher's murder in retaliation for his disloyalty. Jeff goes anyhow to meet Whit at his mansion on Lake Tahoe and is astonished to find Kathie there (Kathie's back in the fold again declares a weaselly Whit). Later Kathie gets Stafanos to kill Jeff who fails in the attempt. Then she double crosses Whit and kills him. And the picture ends with Kathie making up to Jeff and wanting him to go away with her and start over again where they had left off in Mexico. Jeff pretends to agree but unbeknown to her he calls the police who set up a roadblock in which tragically they both perish. Jeff Bailey had finally gotten even with the woman who had lied, cheated, murdered and double crossed just about everyone for her own devious ends but in doing so he paid the ultimate price.Performances are superb throughout. Here the dozy eyed Mitchum - in his first starring role - solidifies his playing of the private eye. But he also shows he could cut a wholly acceptable romantic lead helped along by his mellifluous and soft voiced atmospheric narration. One scene in particular is very effective where he is waiting for her on the beach at night and when she arrives Mitchum's voice is heard gently on the soundtrack ....Then she'd come along.....just like school was out and everything else was just a stone by the sea. The wonderful Jane Greer is the quintessential femme fatale. Her gentle saintly beauty belying her treacherous, underhanded and calculating evil. And a young Kirk Douglas - here just feeling his way in movies - is fine as the courtly but odious villain. Adding greatly to the whole thing is the marvellous score by RKO resident composer Roy Webb which features a memorable and lingering main cue that becomes a tender love theme for the love scenes and is transformed into an exciting big band jazz number for the black nightclub sequence.OUT OF THE PAST is the archetypal film noir! An outstanding document of what Hollywood could achieve in their golden past.

Of the three however OUT OF THE PAST arguably stands a toe in front of the others as the all time favourite. Why is this? Perhaps it's because of its meatier narrative and story line with its palpable unrelenting dramatic thrust together with its extraordinary camera setups and its remarkable use of light and shadow or perhaps because of its faultless screenplay matched in interpretation by inspired casting. No matter what the reason OUT OF THE PAST simply manages to stand out as the most sublime and mesmerizing thriller ever made. Produced for RKO by Warren Duff it was splendidly written for the screen by Geoffrey Holmes which derived from his novel Build My Gallows High (the picture's title in England). Stunningly photographed in Black & White by Nicholas Musuraca it was arrestingly scored by Roy Webb (The best thing he ever did) and the picture was directed with a positive flair by Jacques Tourneur.Jeff Markham, alias Jeff Bailey, (Robert Mitchum) a man with a past ekes out a living running a filling station outside Bakersfield. One day out of the blue - and out of Jeff's past - arrives Joe Stafanos (Paul Valentine) the strong-arm henchman of shady businessman Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). He's here with a message for Jeff that Whit wants to see him again. Some time ago Jeff was a private eye and Whit had engaged him to go to Mexico and hunt down his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who had absconded with $40,000. In flashback we see Jeff finding her but unwittingly the vulnerable Jeff falls in love with her and they go on the run together. But not for long, Whit sends Jeff's estranged detective partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) to find them both but when he does Kathie shoots and kills him and disappears leaving Jeff to return to the states alone. He gives up the detective business and buries himself in Bakersfield running a gas station. Now Whit has located him and wants to see him. But it's only a ruse to have Jeff framed for Fisher's murder in retaliation for his disloyalty. Jeff goes anyhow to meet Whit at his mansion on Lake Tahoe and is astonished to find Kathie there (Kathie's back in the fold again declares a weaselly Whit). Later Kathie gets Stafanos to kill Jeff who fails in the attempt. Then she double crosses Whit and kills him. And the picture ends with Kathie making up to Jeff and wanting him to go away with her and start over again where they had left off in Mexico. Jeff pretends to agree but unbeknown to her he calls the police who set up a roadblock in which tragically they both perish. Jeff Bailey had finally gotten even with the woman who had lied, cheated, murdered and double crossed just about everyone for her own devious ends but in doing so he paid the ultimate price.Performances are superb throughout. Here the dozy eyed Mitchum - in his first starring role - solidifies his playing of the private eye. But he also shows he could cut a wholly acceptable romantic lead helped along by his mellifluous and soft voiced atmospheric narration. One scene in particular is very effective where he is waiting for her on the beach at night and when she arrives Mitchum's voice is heard gently on the soundtrack ....Then she'd come along.....just like school was out and everything else was just a stone by the sea. The wonderful Jane Greer is the quintessential femme fatale. Her gentle saintly beauty belying her treacherous, underhanded and calculating evil. And a young Kirk Douglas - here just feeling his way in movies - is fine as the courtly but odious villain. Adding greatly to the whole thing is the marvellous score by RKO resident composer Roy Webb which features a memorable and lingering main cue that becomes a tender love theme for the love scenes and is transformed into an exciting big band jazz number for the black nightclub sequence.OUT OF THE PAST is the archetypal film noir! An outstanding document of what Hollywood could achieve in their golden past. Unfortunately they now seem to have taken a wrong turn off that road that so often led to greatness.Classic Mitchum adage from OUT OF THE PAST............... If anyone's gonna to die baby......I'm gonna die last.

The speed and horror of crashing are well communicated, as is - strangely enough - the simple thrill of racing. Harlin does a good job with the action sequences, making the moment of impact truly impressive. Racing relies so much on instinct rather than preplanned thought; the pit crew and support staff can only prepare and plan so much - the race still revolves around the driver. Racing is an old sport, and any tried-and-true fans who rent or buy this film hoping accurate, down-to-the-nub details will be disappointed. Harlin and Stallone take plenty of dramatic license. The famous chase through the streets of Chicago? Come on. While obviously something like that would never happen, I understand that Harlin and Stallone were trying to communicate the rage of a rejected young man in a unique and forceful manner. I can allow for that; but the chase went on far too long, almost as though it were enjoying the spectacle for its own sake.

Doesn't believe that anyone could ever love her. She hides from the world. Suffers a nervous breakdown.Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is born of a selfish, cruel, and heartless mother. Gladys Cooper as the mother is so realistically vicious, I felt my own psyche deflate with her verbal abuse. In her eyes, the daughter is not a human being &#x96; she is a servant, a slave, not permitted to have her own feelings or thoughts, and beholden to the mother for bringing her into the world despite the fact that she was unwanted. A compassionate psychologist (Claude Rains) comes into Charlotte's life and she learns that she is indeed human, deserving, and can think for herself. She begins to come alive.

The Kelly in the movie the lost world, is a 12ish black girl...In essence they combined Kelly and Arby from the book into one character. I've actually heard this was their intent. In the book Thorne was sort of the unsung hero, He kind of took on the role in this book that Dr. Grant took on in the first book. Though oddly Thorne is absent from the movie release of The Lost World...Instead he's replaced by the Greenpeace hippie Nick Van Owen (AKA Vince Vaughn). Don't get me wrong I got nothing against Vince Vaughn...But Thorne or at least a Thorne like character seemed more appropriate for this application. Richard Levine makes a few appearances in the movie...In the book he was ''sided'' with the good guys who just wanted to observe. However in the movie he's sided with the ''bad guys'' who want strip mine the place and make a zoo out of the animals. In the book Levine survives the event's...Barely. In the movie, he's eaten by the Tyrannosaurs while still on the island.

In the book Thorne was sort of the unsung hero, He kind of took on the role in this book that Dr. Grant took on in the first book. Though oddly Thorne is absent from the movie release of The Lost World...Instead he's replaced by the Greenpeace hippie Nick Van Owen (AKA Vince Vaughn). Don't get me wrong I got nothing against Vince Vaughn...But Thorne or at least a Thorne like character seemed more appropriate for this application. Richard Levine makes a few appearances in the movie...In the book he was ''sided'' with the good guys who just wanted to observe. However in the movie he's sided with the ''bad guys'' who want strip mine the place and make a zoo out of the animals. In the book Levine survives the event's...Barely. In the movie, he's eaten by the Tyrannosaurs while still on the island. All and all...this isn't a bad movie; though I didn't hate the San-Diego scene with the T-Rex...I have to admit it was a little goofy. Overall a good sequel to a great movie. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 September 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For one reason or another some people seem to have it out for this movie. The general reasoning seems to be that it's not as original as the first Jurassic Park movie, and that's the truth...But not a reason to warrant this as an awful movie. Lets start with what I think is good about it.(The Good) Jeff Goldblume was born to play Ian Malcolm. Reading the Jurassic Park books I totally get a Jeff Goldblume vibe from the way Dr. Malcolm is portrayed in the books. Another good thing about this movie is that its chocked full of dinosaur action, T-Rex attacks Velocraptor's in the grass, Its got all in the way of deadly dinosaurs.(The Bad) I've found that I prefer Jurassic Park to be set on an island...The whole city rampage thing didn't really work out for me. A lot of the characters are mixed and matched in this movie with characters from the book and that generally doesn't work out.(My Thoughts) I feel there's a couple of things that need explanation here...In the book, There were initially seven main characters. Malcolm, Thorne, Eddie, Sara, Richard, Kelly, Arby. In the book Kelly was a 12 year old white girl and Arby was a 10 year old black boy.
