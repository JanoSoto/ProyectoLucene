When it came out there was no doubt that people would be disappointed by Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow up to his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. People thought by some miracle that Jackie Brown would be the masterpiece that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was. Sadly, it was not the case and Jackie Brown did not receive half the critical praise or the box office that Pulp did. Unfortunately, while Jackie Brown is entertaining in its own right, has a brilliant performance by Samuel L. Jackson, and has some great lines of dialogue, it is not a masterpiece. The good news is that it is a good film and definitely worth watching. It was just unfortunate enough that it would be compared to Pulp Fiction. The difference between this and Tarantino's other films is that this is an adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch. Admittedly, I have not read the book so I can't compare the two. Leonard is supposedly famous for the snappy dialogue he writes. Tarantino admits that he is somewhat influenced by Leonard. So its kind of hard to tell if the dialogue here is Tarantino's or if its Leonards but there are some great lines here. Theres actually a conversation that really stands out. Its a conversation about hiding in a trunk, whether this is Leonards or Tarantino's, its got classic written all over it. Unfortunately, while there are some great lines here, theres not nearly as much as there was in Pulp Fiction.Samuel L. Jackson has always been one of my favorite actors. I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance. His work as Ordell Robbie ranks with the best I have seen from him. Its a compelling, mesmerizing performance that rivals his performance in Pulp Fiction as his best work.No one in the cast matches Jackson's performance but they give solid support. Many people have said that the best performances given in the film were done by Pam Grier and Robert Forster. While I thought that both did solid jobs, I didn't find anything remarkable about their performances. Despite being somewhat underused, Robert De Niro gives an entertaining performance. Bridget Fonda is also well cast as a pothead.Stylistically, this is a toned down Tarantino film. The film moves at a slower, deliberate pace. Tarantino does use a split-screen but only once and briefly. The most intriguing thing Tarantino does is show a crucial sequence in the film from three different perspectives. I am not exactly sure of the reason behind this but it was interesting. Overall, Jackie Brown is an entertaing film that even though its not a masterpiece I would still like to see it again. I did think it could have used a little trimming towards the end but perhaps its because I saw it on TV and it was with all those damn commercials. I may review this film again after I watch it on DVD. So if I do feel different in anyway expect a changed review.

I had loved the Dave Stevens comics since I first encountered them (ironically, at the same time I had read about Bettie Page in an article about Bunny Yeager, in a photography magazine).  The comic captured the spirit of 1930's aviation pulps, as well as the Doc Savage crowd.  It also brought along that Republic Studios flavor.  I couldn't wait to see this as a movie.The movie captured the spirit of the comics beautifully.  Sure it was disappointing that Doc Savage couldn't be included, but Howard Hughes made a sensible substitution.  I was a bit annoyed that Disney felt they had to change Betty into Jenny, but with Jennifer Connelly in the role, I was in a forgiving mood.  The film was full of action and humor, cliffhangers and character; just like Stevens' creation.  If there was anything to criticize, it was the toning down of Betty\/Jenny.  Yeah, I know, this is Disney, and she was far tamer in the comics than the real Betty\/Bettie Page; but, hey, a guy can hope.Bill Campbell was perfect for Cliff Secord.  He had that All-American look, with an impish twinkle in his eye.  Watching the movie, you could see the excitement when he was flying, and that he was head over heels in love with Jenny.Alan Arkin made a great Peevy, although he was far less cantankerous than his print counterpart (incidentally, Peevy was based on Doug Wildey, creator of Jonny Quest).  He was more of a Connecticut Yankee than grouchy mechanic.Timothy Dalton made a great pseudo-Errol Flynn.  I wasn't too happy that they trotted out that Flynn-as-Nazi Spy nonsense; but, it works beautifully for the story.  Paul Sorvino made a great 30's mobster, too.  Add Tiny Ron as Lothar, modeled after Rondo Hatton, and you have some pretty fun villains.Then, there's Jennifer Connelly, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood.  As I said, I had hoped for a little sexier character; but, the compromise was still pretty good.  Connelly brought both a wholesomeness and sex appeal to the role.  She looked great in the period clothing, too.Everything about this film worked.  The period detail was first rate, from the costumes, to he set design, to the slang.  The only thing that would have improved this would have been to make more films.

In short, it was painful for me to watch, being a huge fan of the novel. For starters, Valjean was a man in his 60s by the climax of the story...Liam Neeson in his early 40s with apparently no aging from the beginning of the story to the end.  Fantine sold her teeth and hair in the novel. Where the bejeezus do these adaptations conjure up a locket?  Is it that hard to make it look like her teeth have been knocked out?  Uma Thurman physically makes a wonderful Fantine. She has the look that at one point in time she may have been pretty.  I did not care for her portrayal.  She is sweet and gentle throughout the movie, and lacks the desperation and neurotisism found in the book. Also I would have liked to see more background information on her, as found amply in the novel. And the attempt to make some sort of love story between Valjean and Fantine was sickening. She is supposed to be a dying prostitute with no hair and no teeth. Valjean cared very much about her in the book, but it was certainly not meant to be of romantic interest. Javert in the novel is stern but sympethetic; the evil of good In the movie he is portrayed as somewhat of a lunatic that you want to slap ten minutes into it.  The Thenardiers, a MAJOR part of the book, have been reduced to approximatley 5 minutes of the movie.  Their children, Eponine and Azelma, also integral parts of the storyline appear to be missing.

I could go on all day, but I've written quite a bit so I'll just breifly cover the rest of the characterizations that piffed me off.

So my opinion of this movie may be somewhat biased. I realize things have to be adapted, edited etc, but still...I believe this adaptation to be dreadful.  Where do I begin?  Oh, yes.  The absence of major characters integral to the integrity of the original work, horrible British accents, characters misinterpreted.  In short, it was painful for me to watch, being a huge fan of the novel. For starters, Valjean was a man in his 60s by the climax of the story...Liam Neeson in his early 40s with apparently no aging from the beginning of the story to the end.  Fantine sold her teeth and hair in the novel. Where the bejeezus do these adaptations conjure up a locket?  Is it that hard to make it look like her teeth have been knocked out?  Uma Thurman physically makes a wonderful Fantine. She has the look that at one point in time she may have been pretty.  I did not care for her portrayal.  She is sweet and gentle throughout the movie, and lacks the desperation and neurotisism found in the book. Also I would have liked to see more background information on her, as found amply in the novel. And the attempt to make some sort of love story between Valjean and Fantine was sickening. She is supposed to be a dying prostitute with no hair and no teeth. Valjean cared very much about her in the book, but it was certainly not meant to be of romantic interest. Javert in the novel is stern but sympethetic; the evil of good In the movie he is portrayed as somewhat of a lunatic that you want to slap ten minutes into it.  The Thenardiers, a MAJOR part of the book, have been reduced to approximatley 5 minutes of the movie.  Their children, Eponine and Azelma, also integral parts of the storyline appear to be missing. They managed to get their son, Gavroche in there, but in a minor role with no indication to his parentage. Ugh. I could go on all day, but I've written quite a bit so I'll just breifly cover the rest of the characterizations that piffed me off.  Little Cosette was not ugly as she should be, Grown Cosette is not as pretty as she should be.  Claire Danes gave the absolute worst performance I've ever seen from an A list star in my life.  With her wandering British accent and scary eye whites, she was completely wrong for the role.  Marius seemed like a stalker, and the movie put him in charge of the ABC rebellion group, with Enjolras completley missing. (Note to directer- pronounced Ah-bey-sey, not ABC.  It was about that point that I really missed Eponine...I'll be the first to admit I love love triangles, and something of interest was really needed then. Anywahoo...there are a thousand other inconsistencies that undermine the original intent of the novel and make for a poor adaptation, thereby making it a poor film.

This approach is portrayed in the film-in its `best form'--by the character Lacombe, the international UFO investigator professional. Neary (and Barry) portray the approach of a ready-openness to reality-wherever-it-leads.  Neary, who just walks into it all by chance meetings, has only one desire; he `just wants to know that it is really happening'-at the risk though of everything, including life and limb.Contemporary physics has concluded that the material world itself is not really mechanical.  It is a strange paradox how our sentiments are sometimes so out of step with this reality.  This film, though a visual fantasy, has gone far in putting our imaginations in touch with the world as it really is.  As it is in physics, so it would be with alien encounters-and so it is, and will always be, in life.  Even machines can only be `man-handled' so far (if we want them to work, that is).  If we don't want to fry our microwave ovens by cooking things which don't belong in them, or then go on to burn the same food, by trying to make the conventional oven produce the `instant' results we wanted from the microwave, then we had better make some room for `reverence.'  At any rate the aliens are wise enough to know only to play with our machines, like Barry's toys, since they were not constructed according to their purposes.  After waving hello to Lacombe,  the alien is beautifully portrayed as gracefully awestruck, looking upon all of us.Neary and Barry do have the failing of not being notably articulate. Neary even once quotes Barry in trying to describe the UFOs as `like an ice-cream cone'-adding only that its flavor was `orange.'  Jillian, more sensitive to the interpersonal side of things, calls the visits in the sky `Halloween for grownups.'  Neary was `special' in the end because he was the only one who happened to persevere (in the right attitude) that far--partly by the chance meeting with Jillian, for he was helped by her hand when he couldn't make it on his own.  It's when Barry gazes directly at Neary, then turning up to his mom, that we glimpse humanity in its full dignity.  At the sky-port, Barry's mom, Jillian, had `stayed back' and off to the side with Barry, as she wasn't quite ready to go for any rides and didn't want Barry to wander off again.  Here Neary returns the favor; this was the moment that she was perfectly happy to stay on earth, `at home' Though Neary is about to leave, Barry, this time, does not cry when he sees the ship getting ready to leave! When Barry merely thought the aliens were leaving, before Neary was ready, Barry and (thus) Jillian cried (and cried).  Now Jillian has tears of joy.

Maybe people were expecting the thrills and chills of The Sixth Sense. This a muted film, dripping with quiet moments and an overall feeling of sadness. Yes, there were a few scenes I would've cut given the chance (Dunn's son and the gun, especially,) but mostly, this is a simple movie with a theme that is both simple and thought-provoking. It's about comic books, archetypes, and modern myths. It's a superhero origin story that doesn't go for something flashy. Yes, if you were expecting the color and spectacle of Superman\/Spider-man\/Batman, etc., you'd be really disappointed. This is about a regular guy played perfectly by Bruce Willis discovering that he has super-strength. You see Dunn go from an average man to a hero, a mysterious, cloaked iconic sketch on the front page of a newspaper. He is living in a world of comic book figures that are still familiar in the real world. He discovers a mentor of sorts in Elijah, the comic store owner who suffers from a rare disease. The twist that this director loves to put in his movies really shocked me.Unbreakable is the origin story of a villain, too. The total opposite of Dunn's superman. I loved Jackson's line Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. Of course Elijah is the villain - he's lonely, he's disfigured, he's an outcast, and he has crazy ideas. But the lines between his genius and insanity are very, very blurry until the last few minutes. I felt a huge amount of sympathy for this character, until Elijah shared his criminal secrets. He is the total opposite of Dunn, not just physically, but morally as well. The little coda at the end was perfect, too, with Elijah going to an asylum for the criminally insane. He goes to Arkham! If this movie were a comic book, naturally, Elijah would escape to cause more mayhem, like all great evil geniuses.This is a wonderful movie for comic book fans, people who enjoy the myths of superheroes, and enjoy seeing those same formulas twisted around in an interesting way.

Just do your best as a screenwriter on one storyline and I'll do my best to pay attention to one story. I really and truly don't need three or four or more story lines to keep my interest.

I mean a lot. It's not cute or intellectual. Actually, all this type of story telling really is, is short attention spans masquerading as plot twists. It's annoying. It only serves to make the audience distrust the current storyline because it probably will only wind up being a setup for another storyline. Hmm let's see, what else. Ah yes, the dreaded F word.

Call it what you will, I think the brave choice for film makers today making adult drama would be to actually try to express a strong emotion without the use of profanity.Now we must address sex. All roads lead there after all. Or do they? Is sex what mainstream movie directors really want to show in their films? Or is it relationships? Again, I guess I'm just an old fashioned, hypocritical slob but if I want to see sex in a film, I'll just rent an adult film. Otherwise, I'd just as soon as not see sex scenes in a movie. A kiss, a clinch, a fade to black.. It works for me, what can I say? I just somehow feel that it doesn't really take all that much talent to take your clothes off and pretend to have sex. All these kind of scenes do is make my mind turn to sex and gee wizz, wouldn't you think your average director would want the audience to concentrate on the movie instead of their inflamed loins? Whenver I see an actor strip I think to myself would Katharine Hepburn & Spencer Tracy have felt the need to disrobe to play a part? Anyway, I wound up watching most of Full Frontal but just couldn't make it to the end. I tried though, I really did.....

I was stunned that here was a movie that had Jessica Lange AND Michelle Pfeiffer (with a small appearance by Jennifer Jason Leigh) that I had not seen.  I don't think I had ever even heard of it before.  Well, this is exactly the kind of find that I dream about since I have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me.  With a few exceptions (Neither of us can even get them to consider watching the Lord of the Rings movies, but my Dad LOVES the Matrix trilogy -- GO FIGURE), we have very similar tastes in movies.It was a particularly AWFUL day today, weather-wise.  It poured rain all day, so I popped in this movie and shortly after I was mesmerized.This has to be one of the all-time best sleepers I have seen.  Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are GREAT in their roles especially since they are playing very different types.  Jessica Lange's character is a people-pleasing follower who, despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role.  Rather, she bows to her father (Jason Robards) and sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is hell-bent on teaching her little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow suit.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very STRONG willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained.  This movie is five years prior to White Oleander, mind you, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong, angry character.I would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. However, true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them.  I don't know how I missed seeing this movie before now, but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!

With no leads in the case, Captain Edelson offers Officer Steve Burns the chance to go undercover on the basis that Steve looks similar to the victims that the killer tends to pick.  Steve goes undercover with no badge and no gun, only reporting to Edelson; meanwhile the murders continue as Steve begins to lose himself little by little.I had never seen this film until just a few weeks ago but I was looking forward to it as I remember it being one of the movies that was reviewed by critic Mark Kermode on his `cult corner' he used to do as a weekly part of a radio 1 show - he liked it and generally I trust him.  The film opens with a similar enough premise cop goes undercover to try and catch a killer.  We have all seen this genre before and think we know where it is going to go - cop will start to `go native' gradually and will struggle with it even after he has caught the killer - right? Well, yes and no.  The film tries to do this but it manages to make a real pigs ear of it throughout, coming across like it really didn't know what it wanted to do.  I am aware that there is another version of this out there somewhere and that this was mercilessly edited but I cannot know that that would be any better without seeing it.The film is all over the place.  Burns' investigation goes nowhere for the vast majority of the time and just seems to focus on gay clubs with lots of men in leather or jock straps.  Meanwhile the killer continues to carry out his murders and the rest of the police sort of float around in the background.  It is difficult to really get into the film because the narrative is so very disjointed and it is almost impossible to have anything to follow or care about basically the first 90 minutes is `there's a guy out there killing and a cop going to gay clubs - oh, look what they do' and then the final 20 minutes is `oh, we got him now' - and that's it!  So with no traditional narrative I assume that the film wanted us to follow the character of Steve. However, Steve is a nonentity, even being played by Pacino!  He has no character and we see nothing to suggest that he is really being either attracted or repulsed by the life he sees.  The end of the film is so open in regards him and just doesn't make sense.  With these two threads going nowhere, all that remains is a film that looks at the gay scene in the city.In this regard I was worried that it was going to be all PC when the film opening with a disclaimer that I assume was put on to placate gay groups. However I immediately understood why the makers had put this caption onto the film - and it wasn't even enough!  The homosexuals in this film are, to a man, deviants who all hang out in clubs having anonymous sex with multiple partners in clubs and parks.  I know the film apologises for this but it doesn't excuse the sheer lazy clichés that it wheels out and seems to just hope that we are shocked by the repeated graphic image.  The seedy nature of the film means that it hasn't lost it's shock ability (even with gay relationships no longer a taboo in the media or normal life) - but if this is all it has then it is hardly worth it.  If Friedkin had a vision then it has been lost because there is no sign of life in this film - by the end of the film everyone seems to have given up on it and it just, well, grinds to a halt.  I won't even go into the various threads that just seem to go nowhere - DiSimone turning up all over the place for no reason for example.Pacino is a great actor but he cannot do anything with a character he cannot understand.  He is absent from the film and is given nothing to work with. Certainly the `slow burn' he is required to do is not fitting his style, but it is made harder considering the script doesn't know about Steve either and Pacino has nothing to build to.  Sorvino is OK but has nothing to do, likewise Allen is just floating around as well.  The only thing that really kept my interest was how many famous faces were in early roles here - Powers Booth, Mike Starr, Spinell and Weeks to name a few.Overall I was looking forward to this film and wanted to enjoy it. I was not let down when it failed to do the usual things I expected from the genre set-up, but I was letdown by the fact that it did nothing else with it. The plot is all over the place and the performances are poor simply because they have no characters - Steve is impossible to understand and every gay character is a cliché.

When I learnt about it's release three years ago, I was going through a very anti-American stage, and as a result the sight of this film had turned my stomach. Skip forward to 2004 and the terrestrial television premiere. Sitting there watching this film, I pondered how accurate it was (this is not a period of History I pretend to know a lot of details about, I'm more of a renaissance Europe fan myself) and I groaned occasionally at awful lines. Over all though, I actually quite liked it.In Pearl Harbour, we're introduced to young Rafe and Danny (Affleck & Hartnett), two friends who grew up together and are like brothers. The two army fly boys spend all their time flying and hanging out together. Then the Nazi's invade Poland, WW2 in Europe begins and Rafe travels to England to join the good fight. Add to this situation the female input of the delectable Kate Beckinsale as a nurse and Rafe's love, and a three way love triangle develops. As the film progresses, the three experience first the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the entry into the war of America and then America's retaliation on Tokyo.Like I'd said before, this film took a beating at the Box Office due to it's historical inaccuracy. I'll admit I'm not sure how inaccurate it is, although I'm sure it's not as bad as Gibson's farcical The Patriot or U-571, but ultimately as long as you question every fact you see in the film, it doesn't matter.Aside from historical questions, the other criticism of this film is that it's just generally not very good. For this point I must confess, I really disagree. Whilst there are some really awful lines in this film, and it's so ridiculously over patriotic, for graphics, plot (or sub-plot if you want to put the War as the main story ahead of the romance) and the vast ammounts of intensity, I feel it delivers. So it'll never be as dark or powerful as other war films (Saving Private Ryan to name one), and compared with other love stories it also falls short, all in all it's not as bad as everyone says.If your looking for a film which combines the better parts of awful films (the boat & graphics from Titanic, the romance from Armageddon), then watch this film. If your going to be touchy and condemn anything with even the most remote historical inaccuracy, or your going to insult any film which isn't Oscar material, then yeah ok avoid this. For a blockbuster to relax to on a Monday night though, it does the job quite nicely.

As the film progresses, the three experience first the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the entry into the war of America and then America's retaliation on Tokyo.Like I'd said before, this film took a beating at the Box Office due to it's historical inaccuracy. I'll admit I'm not sure how inaccurate it is, although I'm sure it's not as bad as Gibson's farcical The Patriot or U-571, but ultimately as long as you question every fact you see in the film, it doesn't matter.Aside from historical questions, the other criticism of this film is that it's just generally not very good. For this point I must confess, I really disagree. Whilst there are some really awful lines in this film, and it's so ridiculously over patriotic, for graphics, plot (or sub-plot if you want to put the War as the main story ahead of the romance) and the vast ammounts of intensity, I feel it delivers. So it'll never be as dark or powerful as other war films (Saving Private Ryan to name one), and compared with other love stories it also falls short, all in all it's not as bad as everyone says.If your looking for a film which combines the better parts of awful films (the boat & graphics from Titanic, the romance from Armageddon), then watch this film. If your going to be touchy and condemn anything with even the most remote historical inaccuracy, or your going to insult any film which isn't Oscar material, then yeah ok avoid this. For a blockbuster to relax to on a Monday night though, it does the job quite nicely.

When I learnt about it's release three years ago, I was going through a very anti-American stage, and as a result the sight of this film had turned my stomach. Skip forward to 2004 and the terrestrial television premiere. Sitting there watching this film, I pondered how accurate it was (this is not a period of History I pretend to know a lot of details about, I'm more of a renaissance Europe fan myself) and I groaned occasionally at awful lines. Over all though, I actually quite liked it.In Pearl Harbour, we're introduced to young Rafe and Danny (Affleck & Hartnett), two friends who grew up together and are like brothers.
