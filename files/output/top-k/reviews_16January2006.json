To me at the time, a young film addict, it was an amazing film. My initial thought after it finished was that if i ever could make a film i would remake this one. When i was sitting at a bus stop in Perth faced to face with a poster of Damon under the title 'The Talented Mr Ripley' i was unimpressed. I missed my chance i felt and i decided not to pay any attention to the film, and not to see it. Years later when i was with Shazrina my closest friend i found out she had a Jude Law obsession, an actor who i had not really watched much. She referred to him in Ripley as being a Bronzed God. At this point i had grown an affinity for Damon as well, after re-watching Good will Hunting, Oceans etc.. so i decided to bite the bullet and watch The Talented Mr Ripley. The first thing i liked was the music, the switching back and forth from the jazz and whimsical score to the sadder notes, the darker shadows of the score. I didn't watch the film expecting to see a remake of the Delon film, i knew that this film played Tom as gay unlike the Delon film so i expected it to follow a different set of triggers. I loved the colors in the film... it is a beautifully filmed picture, just like the Delon film, but where Delon is always alone and always expects to be alone Damon try's to be a part of something but fails. To me both movies tell only half of the motivation of Tom Ripley as told in the Highsmith novel. I really enjoy re-watching The Talented Mr Ripley because of its beautiful locations, grand music and well acted characters (but i still fell like an observer unlike the Delon film where while watching you almost become Delon). But this movie was made to be observed, certainly the killing of Dickie and the tension of the continuous escapes by Tom are captivating and well done, but i watch it every time for its beauty. (If it wasn't made meant to be watched for its beauty then why cast Jude Law, huh Shaz?) It's strange to find a murder film that you can relax to. The beauty does tend to over run the film at times. Having said that, one of the best scenes in the film is where the two main characters are in the forefront- when Tom kills Dickie. The camera is a close up shot and the beautiful background is actually pushed to the back.. here we finally see what Dickie feels about Tom and we see what type of a person Tom really is.. its important that we see nothing but the characters and the use of eliminating the beautiful background is done well, if only for a moment.The thing i like about the Ripley story is that despite how beautiful everything looks non of the characters are perfect... Marge is too needy, Dickie is too selfish and Tom is homicidal. There is so much more to say about this and the Delon film, they are both great films but they speak differently, arouse different feelings and reactions. To me neither are exactly like the book so the prospect of making the film again is a possibility for this once upon a time film addict. (though the film means more to me for different reasons..), if you want to watch a stunningly beautiful film with relaxing music and interesting characters, a bit of tension thrown into the mix and you don't want it to be a foreign film or a merchant ivory production than this is your film. To make the film more enjoyable try speaking with Jude Laws fake American Accent for the rest of the day, its fun, try it! 'Marge, Marge! You've got to hear this!'

This film is neither. Truffaut's main goal in making this film was to show the uncontrollable downward spiral of one boy. We are shown this through the boy Antoine eyes. Whether reflected in multiple mirrors at his mom's vanity or from the bottom of a spinning carnival ride, it is his view and perspective of the world that we see. The adult world is conspicuously absent except for the occasional villain or incompetent who happens to pass through Antoine's life. This film is shocking today, with our modern views on decency and political correctness. It was not designed to shock its audiences at the time. The idea of a child being disposable is a lost concept in today's world. The end of the film is especially important in the fact that Antoine, alone on the beach, could be interpreted as having reached his end. He has, throughout the film, sunk lower and lower no matter how hard he tried to better himself. By the end, we are led to believe he has reached his end, both figuratively and literally. My feeling is that instead of despair, he is faced with hope. The beach represents not an end but beginning, and one of limitless possibilities and a chance to begin again. This film is a timeless story of hope and the possibilities of redemption. Truffaut's style is modern and creative for its time. He stays away from stylized techniques that would have only dated this film. If this film was in color, I feel that an audience of today would have a hard time differentiating 400 Blows from a modern movie.

It was the sentimentality that made this such a fine film. The character Alfredo says it best when saying goodbye to the young Salvador, Don't give into nostalgia. The film is about what is lost in time. It's about coming home again. The Italian film Cinema Paradiso is about the life of a Fellini-esc movie director who must return to his home village after leaving thirty years prior. The film is told from his perspective with memories and flashbacks of his time as a young boy and through his teenage years. What is most remarkable about this film is that in his years away from his home village, the world he new so well (and one that I think he expected to be identical to his memories) has changed so dramatically. The movie house, The Cinema Paradiso, once the center of the village and where he first found his love for film and met his friend (and surrogate father) Alfredo, is now no more then an afterthought. Nothing more then a forgotten ruin waiting for the wrecking ball. It is as if with the death of Alfredo, his link with the past is cut for good; only to leave the now grown up Toto truly alone.The first time I saw this movie my feelings were that it was good and entertaining but otherwise unremarkable. Then came THE END....In the center of the world that is Rome we find the great Director Salvador De Vita, busy at work. Almost as an afterthought he hands over an old, worn out film reel left for him by his dead friend Alfredo to view. With this the film is catapulted into greatness.This film, if not for anything else, is interesting to watch. We see a portrayal of an Italian village and lifestyle as it was. It was a closed world that relied on itself for life, religion, news, and entertainment.

The film is told through the use of multiple characters that inhabit a one-block section in New York's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood. This is a case study of people who are forced to live together and the ways that they interact with each other. This hood is made up primarily of such un-stereotypical African American characters that in any other setting might not be believable. There is The Mayor, the local drunk and unofficial eyes and ears of the neighborhood. He interacts with Sister Mama, a crotchety old busy body of a woman that judges her world from her kitchen window. Also found on the block is the three men on the corner who think they know all and are more then willing to share their views with everyone who passes. The stuttering Smiley who spends his time selling post cards. Radio Raheme, a local tough who spends his time wandering the hood with his boom box and playing the same song over and over. There are numerous others that add to the mix of personalities on this street. The star of the film, Mookie (which is played by the director Spike Lee), a young, directionless man who works in the local pizzeria, which is owned by a white Italian man and his two sons. It is this white owned business in a predominantly black neighborhood that is at the center of this story.I liked this film in spite of the ending that I felt was designed to do nothing more then evoke controversy. This film, despite the ending, is just a slice of life tail about a neighborhood and the people who inhabit it. Spike Lee tries to make a statement about race relations and prejudice by inserting a riot in the end. Not only does this seem terribly out of place, but also unnecessary to the story. I felt that referencing Dr. Marten Luther King and Malcolm X in the end of the film was only a shallow justification to the addition of the riot scene. Maybe Spike Lee felt that he would not be taken seriously by making a nice, lighthearted comedy on his second time out directing. By adding this violent end he transformed a pleasant, fun film into a controversial statement. This may not be the politically correct way of seeing the film but that's how I saw it.

It is in the same vane as films such as Death Wish and numerous westerns, where a lone gunman must set things right by doing what the law either can't or won't. This film is about a man who, after the murder of his daughter, feels he must track down her killer to impart his own form of justice. The characters in this film are nothing new. We have the father (The Limey), a cockney accented, British ex-con. He teams up with a tough Mexican con that is going straight after doing time in the joint. The dead daughter's friend, a straight-laced, wanna-be-actor (who drives a Volvo, as if we couldn't figure out how very straight laced and domestic she really is). Leading the bad guys are the ageing sixties record producer complete with his California vanity and ex-flower child deep sounding but otherwise shallow advice. His partner, which is the films real bad Guy, complete with a cold stair, black Mercedes-Benz, and a sawed-off shotgun. He surrounds himself with the typical assortment of mafia looking goons; fat and dumb so we wouldn't mistake them. This film, despite the unimaginative, overused story line and stereotypical characters is great. The director's use of the camera and his masterful editing stand out. This is a tremendously violent film that never actually shows much violence. Lots of people die, and we are tricked into thinking we have just witnessed these acts, when in reality we never saw a thing. The directors use of flash backs serve to make the main character's memories almost dream like.

Most only serve to give the viewer two hours of grand battle scenes interspersed with mostly forgetful introspective moments by the main characters. Then there is the film Paths of Glory directed by Stanley Kubrick. It could have been a grand World War I spectacle with a cast of thousands and sets rivaling the war itself. Instead, Kubrick brings us a story of a failed battle told from a personal side rather then the often used long shot of war, shown on a grand scale, so often used in lesser films. Paths of Glory is the story of an egotistical Generals failure and the lengths he is willing to go to protect his reputation. What a truly grand film this is. Even though this is one of Stanley Kubrick's early films, his genius is plainly evident. In one of the first scenes in the film he took what could have been a long, dull conversation between two Generals and choreographed their movements, along with the cameras, in such a way as to keep the viewers attention. Also, the long dolly shot that followed the General through the trench is purely Kubrick. One of his signature moves that he has incorporated in all his films.The film ends with a scene of a frightened captured German woman being forced to sing to the French troops. On first thought I wondered why this scene was in the film. Looking back this scene provides much more incite to the situation then first at hand. She puts a face on a faceless enemy, thus humanizing them. We see her fear and realize that the French troops, who are soon off to another battle, are just as scared and unsure of their own futures. She is the only person of beauty in a world filled with horror. The palaces that the Generals occupy are grand, but also cold and lifeless. She is alive and out in the terrible world alongside the men in the trenches. War is hell, not only for the soldier but also for all of humanity, and the only Paths of Glory shown to us in this film is the one taken by the three men. This is what the film is truly about.

I found it a bit slow and uneventful. As one grows older, priorities change, certain matters not considered when younger begin to take precedence. When I watch this film now, I find the time travel angle plays out differently for me; yes, it's still an interesting take on how to travel backwards in time, without machinery (as in The Time Machine - all versions). But, I realize now the entire focus of the story is on the mystical depiction of timeless love surfacing for the two main characters, played by Reeve and Seymour. It's a romance of the most old-fashioned kind, bridging decades, and enhanced by the whole premise of traveling further to achieve that romantic connection than most would ever dream of.Obviously, the task for Reeve's character, that of making the connection, appears simply impossible. We've all read stories or seen movies about some character traveling over half a continent or even half the world to make such a connection. We root for them, of course - for them to beat the odds. The odds here are seemingly insurmountable not traveling across land, but time itself. Well, he makes it; it's an incredible feat. And he pursues his dream, an exotic, to say the least, fantastic dream. She's worth it Seymour is truly beautiful in this film, and gets more so with each viewing. Just her photo portrait in this story manages to capture a serene, mysterious type of beauty. She's touched with a melancholy sadness and Reeve is there to balm her wound. Writer Richard Matheson knows how to write good stories, romance included, and didn't need to fall back on contrived side plots to 'energize' the script, as is often the case nowadays. It's a straightforward, unfussy story, the kind they don't produce anymore.

The film also stands head and shoulders over other horror films due to the 'Who did it?' element that is maintained throughout.

What sounds like a fairly average monster confrontation, it achieved so much better due to its way of thinkingLess is more.... but when you want more, you go over the top!It may not be expected but there are actually few monster scenes during 'The Thing'. Suspense is drawn and a huge amount of time is given for the characters to develop, particularly the way they interact with one another. As well as each member being very believable, you can imagine that such a team actually exists. As with the more well known 'Alien', seeing the characters goof around by eating, playing pool and the like draws you into the experience far deeper than just letting an actor play a stereotype. Some of the script is also hilarious, such as the captains suggestion on the couch.Once the scene has been set, the fairly sedated start wakes up with one hell of snarl. You have never seen any monsters before like this, not ones which look so realistic. Todays audience is constantly bombarded with CGI effects, to the point where we can instantly tell when they are being used. 'The Thing' is 'Old School' with its effects, displaying some truly unbelievable anamatronics. For todays audience, we are able to spot the flaws in these effects, but at the time I imagine that the audience would of been absolutely stiff in their cinema seats. To put it straight, these are some of the best effects ever to grace a film. Its worth bearing in mind that 'The Thing' was beaten to the Oscar for special effects by 'E.T, the Exrta-Terrerestral'. Hmm.Saying this, we all know effects don't make a film. But they certainly add to the atmosphere. If the film was remade with CGI effects, it just wouldn't have the same effect. The film also stands head and shoulders over other horror films due to the 'Who did it?' element that is maintained throughout. You will be constantly guessing who 'The Thing' really is, adding another physiological element to the film. However, there are some aspects which stops 'The Thing' from being truly great. The music throughout is fairly dire, and laughable when you give it attention. The ending to the film is also quite a disappointment, snatching a satisfying conclusion just from the viewer at the last minutes. When viewing the film as a whole however these points are particularly minor, especially considering what this film has going for it.'The Thing' is a film that will not leave the viewers memory for a long time, and is one you will certainly be telling your friends you watched last night.

Robert Redford brings us this perfect world with its perfect people only to show us the imperfections that are so well hidden and are never supposed to be seen. Ordinary People is the story of a families struggle to accept the death of a son and its consequences on all who are left. The main character that is highlighted in the story is the younger son Conrad. Having recently returning home from a mental hospital after an attempted suicide, he is the primary victim of this tragedy. He was on the boat when his brother Buck drowned, and he blames himself for his death. The parents are almost polar opposites. The father is desperately trying to keep the family together and to understand what is happening, while the mother is seen to ignore everything and continue to uphold all the pretense that is her life. Also featured in this film is Conrad's psychiatrist Dr. Burger who serves as a means of telling the background story as well as to help the family in realizing their true situation. I first saw this film twenty years ago as part of a high school field trip. The theater was filled with high school seniors and we wondered who thought up the bright idea of seeing this Boring film. This thought went on for about the first ten minuets then we were all engrossed in it.

The gasp was voiced from a room full of Conrad's twenty years ago where this time we were a room full of parents sympathizing with his plight.

Well my friends, I have seen the devil, and its name is From Dusk Till Dawn.This movie follows the rest of Tarantino's catalog and centers around a couple of lowlife thugs. In this case, it's the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie (George Clooney and Tarantino himself). They're on the run from the law and about to cross the border into Mexico and Freedom. Their ticket out is the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu, and Juliette Lewis) also heading into Mexico. The Gecko brothers take the family hostage and, after making it across the border, hang out at the designated meeting place a topless bar.Now for the fun part. It turns out that the bar is a late-nite hangout for vampires. And guess who's on the menu tonight?Appalled yet? I am. It's not that I'm against the idea in the first place, but these are two different movies duct taped together by one dance sequence. Sorry guys, it just doesn't work.When watching this movie, I felt like I was driving in a car that, for no reason whatsoever, suddenly jumped into a higher gear and took off at full speed. The first hour of the movie was more than watchable; it was pretty damn good. I loved the characters of the Gecko brothers and I thought that the movie would be about the conflict between the calm, calculating Seth and the unpredictable Ritchie, who will shoot or rape whomever he pleases. In fact, when he first sees Juliette Lewis' character, he imagines her asking him for oral sex. Ritchie, in my mind, was the time bomb of the movie, waiting to go off and throw the plot into a tailspin. Whoo boy, was I wrong.The second hour of the movie is the schlockiest of horror films you've ever seen. After seeing Robert Rodriguez' Sin City, I knew that he had a taste for on screen violence. Well, this movie is more of the same. The vampires of the movie are the best that 1996 special effects could produce. That doesn't really say much, but man, are they gory. People's arms are ripped off their bodies, heads are hollowed out by shotguns, and one vampire is vanquished by having his heart ripped from his body and staked by a toothpick. Fun wow, huh?The first half of the movie had Tarantino's trademark element of humor. For instance, the first time we see Seth and Ritchie, they are trying to get out of a liquor store that a cop has just entered. Once the cop leaves to relieve himself, Seth and Ritchie, guns drawn, start having a discussion about whether or not the clerk tipped the cop off. It's hilariously funny and timed to perfection. Those first scenes should set the tone for the rest of the movie. And as I've probably spent too much time belaboring, halfway through, the film takes a sharp left turn. Over a bridge. Down a ravine. And into a tar pit.I wouldn't be so livid if the second half of the movie was well done. The vampire sequences in From Dusk Till Dawn have all been done before in other vampire movies, and frankly, the new parts just don't make any sense. While watching the film, I counted the following elements that caused my jaw to hit the floor, only to be reeled back up and let go again 1. A cross composed of a shotgun and a baseball bat. 2. A hydraulic stake 3. A Holy Water Super Soaker (Can you say Bordello of Blood?) 4. Characters having personal moments while being devoured hoagie-style by vampires. 5. A mariachi band that, at the moment of truth, morphs into a band of mutants with bloody corpses for instruments. 6. Lines like Okay Vampire Killers, let's kill some f***ing vampires! 7. Multiple appearances by Cheech Marin.See what I mean? What isn't tired is plain ridiculous. And there are more examples of absurdity in this movie. You could find them yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you.Harvey Keitel, who's had a history with Tarantino, plays Jacob Fuller, a priest who lost his faith in God when his wife died. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this character or how he's portrayed, but tell me this, why is it that whenever there is a story concerning evil or Satanic creatures, the local priest chooses to question his faith then? Juliette Lewis plays his daughter. Honestly, I wish I could've gotten to know her better. Lewis is a very talented and beautiful actress, but I guess when you're stuck with a part that is basically a young girl reacting to the situation around her, it's like putting a ballet dancer in a full-body cast. The only defining personality trait about her is that she gets really good with a crossbow when the going gets tough. I mean, really, she's like the Teenage Terminator! (Not a bad idea.) And I can't really call it a defining personality trait because everyone gets it at the same time in this movie.From Dusk Till Dawn just plain does not work. Tarantino and Rodriguez are very talented filmmakers, and they've proved that time and time again, but they have given both their resumes a black eye with this mutated hybrid of Reservoir Dogs and Assault on Precinct 13.

You could say that no wonder it's good, it was originally a book...but I tend to think it's the work of director Gus Van Sant, who really makes the film as good as it is.Nicole Kidman, really is 'To Die For' in this movie, and her performance is as well.

The 1974 film is the antithesis of the slick, MTV-influenced, cynical cash-in mentality that informed the later remake. The fact that the remake's target teen audience (well, at least some of them) appeared to lap it up is just a sad reflection of how far standards have fallen since the heyday of the horror film in the 70's. But Hooper's CHAINSAW is more than just a classic horror film. With its print in the permanent collection at the NY Museum of Modern Art, it truly is a classic of cinema. I've shown this to Bergman fans, Tarkovsky fans and, yes, horror fans too - none of them have been prepared for its power, its inventiveness, its willingness to push the envelope of what cinema can do. And, with its simple story and powerhouse, unstoppable delivery, it is as open to interpretation as any piece of modern art - whether it be from the vegetarian treatise angle, or the post-Vietnam traumatised America school of thought. But, as I was on my first (of several) viewings, those I have introduced to this movie have been bowled over by the quality of the film-making, and the filmic techniques (soundtrack, editing, startling images) used by Hooper to capture his waking nightmare on screen. It is something I really don't think any other film has quite achieved, though many have tried.Now, of course, there is a fluke element at work here. Hooper never came close to achieving anything like this again, and many, though not all, of the film's fascinating resonances are a product of the era and the filmmaker's unconscious sensibilities. What he obviously had as a director was the kind of daring to take the visceral power that cinema can deliver so well to the limit, to the the edge of acceptability, skirting on exploitation. That the film is so unrelentingly dark and so unbelievably sadistic in its second half, and yet fascinates even as it traumatises, is a definite testimony to the skill of its director. What could have been sleaze is instead a horrible nightmare experience, sure enough, but one that borders on the transcendental.

I have to say first off that this is one of my favorite films of all time. I don't particularly like horror films (I don't like to be scared) and so when this movie came out at the theater my sister tried to get me to see it and I refused because I thought it would scare me.Needless to say when it came out on VHS she talked me into watching it and I regretted not going with her to see it in the theater. The story is unique and well told. I read some comments on this forum and people accuse it of being a knock-off of some films such as Ghostbusters. This story and the cinematography of this film have absolutely nothing in common with Ghostbusters. They both have ghosts as a central theme, but the similarity (or lack thereof) stops there.I have to admit that there are some small gaps in the plot that may leave questions in your mind if you watch the original release (especially if you watch it more than once because you always catch more the second time around), but I never found it enough to be that distracting. Part of this comes from them trying to cut the film down to less than two hours. If you really must know what was intended then watch the three hour and forty-five minute making-of documentary on the Director's Cut DVD.I could go on about the story, but I'm more of a Visual Effects person and so I think that for me, that's also why I like this movie so much. At the time the effects that they used were revolutionary. Many of the effects, such as the ghost crawling under the carpet in the beginning utilized proprietary code that was written specifically for this movie. Also the compositing was awesome. There were only a couple of spots in the movie where I could tell that the lighting wasn't quite right, and that was out of well over five hundred visual effects shots. To keep this in perspective, this movie was being filmed around the same time the first Toy Story was released, so that was the level of computer generated imagery that they had to work with. I think that they had fewer errors in their work than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe that was just released. I saw more incorrect lighting and bad animation in Narnia than in The Frighteners. It just goes to show you that advanced technology does not always make a better movie.Also, the release of this movie was pushed up by four months, which caused them to rush with wrapping up production. The DVD is also well worth buying if you're at all interested in film making, visual effects or any similar field. The documentary has a ton of behind-the-scenes footage, a tour of the early WETA computer and props department, and three full compositing breakdowns that show how they put the special effects together.I wouldn't say that you should buy this movie if you haven't seen it because everyone's tastes are different, but I would definitely borrow or rent it so you can decide whether you want it or not. Before the Director's cut was released, the original release on DVD was selling on eBay for thirty dollars or more because it was out-of-print and people were desperate to find it. I wound up paying nearly twenty for a used copy. Obviously this movie has a big cult following at any rate and that makes me happy, because I think that this film has been overlooked and underrated.

Yet, I think I can safely say that there is not a wasted shot in the whole film. Leone is able to use each scene to perfection. He uses wide shots at the right time. He uses close-ups when he needs to. He puts in long shots for the perfect effect. This is such a well constructed movie. Many people might consider it sloppy and rough. I think it is amazing. There are many shots in which Leone isolates the characters. I don't remember many shots where more than one character are in the frame at the same time. When they are, there is almost always space between them. His characters are out for themselves, and for no one else. Their connection with other characters exist only in their desire and drive for gold. There are many shots in which a character stands surrounded by vast nothingness. Leone's characters are in control of their own wills, but they are not in control of their destinies. Consider the scene where Tuco is about to kill Blondie in the hotel. A canon hits the room before he can accomplish this. Blondie seems to be the only person who controls his fate, and he doesn't have ultimate control. The acting is superb. Eastwood doesn't little enough to give his character tremendous depth and mystery. He isn't merely stoic and squinting. He is a true character with many levels. Wallach is extreme and not other the top. It would be very easy for the character to be cartoonish. Yet Leone and Wallach are able to give him many different facets. Angel Eyes is truly evil. I like the hat that van Cleef wears. It makes his face seem very slim and his eyes very narrow, very snake-like. The music is good as well. This is a masterpiece.

Yet, I think I can safely say that there is not a wasted shot in the whole film. Leone is able to use each scene to perfection. He uses wide shots at the right time. He uses close-ups when he needs to. He puts in long shots for the perfect effect. This is such a well constructed movie. Many people might consider it sloppy and rough. I think it is amazing. There are many shots in which Leone isolates the characters. I don't remember many shots where more than one character are in the frame at the same time. When they are, there is almost always space between them. His characters are out for themselves, and for no one else.

Peter Sellers uses this film as a way for us to view our society from a different perspective; the perspective of the simple minded Chance the gardener. Even thought Peter Sellers was only the actor, he is responsible for translating what could have been a lifeless, dull character into a seemingly clever and deep individual. Chance is a half-witted gardener who has spent his entire life apart from the rest of the world tending the plants of an aging millionaire. After the death of the old man and the closing of the house that has been Chance's world, he is forced out into an alien society that he has only viewed from the safety of television. He is so unprepared for this new world he finds himself in that fear is not even a consideration. Through a series of accidents and misunderstandings, Chance eventually finds himself in the centers of power. Presidents and the leaders of industry come to ask him advice thinking that his explanations about gardening are some kind of deep analogy for the economy or politics. By the end of the film the powerful are discussing Chance as the next presidential candidate. This film asks us the question is our society so shallow that a simpleton could be mistaken for a leader? This film is a great statement on the modern world. I do think that we as a society make so many assumptions as to believe anything. In the end Chance wanders off into a forest and we see him walk on water. Are we being led to believe that he is of so pure as to be Christ like or just lucky to have found an unseen sandbar? The film worked for me up until this point then I find myself being forced into considering some supernatural explanation.

If it's funny, it's funny, or what? OK, this is quite trashy, but I think this is good trash, and not as boring as many other stupid films made nowadays (I don't want to name examples, but think for example how bad are recent horror films, just the same as many serious dramas for that matter). Why couldn't you watch it like some trashy scifi movie from seventies, sixties, fifties, eighties, whatever? Maybe it's too near (=Too new). I actually feel very good, when I see special (computer) effects done non-perfectly. It's quite unusual these days. And anyway, I haven't seen one single movie, not even the most expensive, that has really realistically looking landscapes, people or any creatures, that has been made with computer. They just look totally dead, not even dead, just computer-animations, every single time. (It's little bit hard to understand why, but that's not the issue to talk here and now...) Computer-made effects and pictures in this film look quite sympathetic to me. I think sympathetic would maybe be the word that best describes my feelings to this movie overall. It's one man's serious effort, and I respect that. He has really tried, and really failed. And that (to even seriously try) is more than some artists manage (\/have courage) to do even once in their careers. It's a bit of a mystery, how can these good actors (Travolta and Whitaker) can act so bad in this movie. That makes the movie even more (funnily) worse. How can it be, you may ask yourself many times during watching. Could a REAL bad director ruin everything, also REAL good actors? But apparently in U.S. the producer has often more power than the director, so you can blame Travolta for everything, if you need a scapegoat. He's a joke character to many people anyway, just the same as some David Hasselhoff. The story is the same as in every hero\/scifi\/adventure-trash film, but who cares if it's stupidly funny (and bad enough)? And the prison's food looks good! Is it spinach? Chill out and enjoy.(I give ten, because everyone else seems to exaggerate in the other direction. Just for some balance.)
