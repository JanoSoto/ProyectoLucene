When Polley withdrew, he had to backfill with Kate Hudson who is not really an actress. Hudson plays the same character she always plays, Kate Hudson.

Since Penny is important to the story, the film is not all that it could have been.However, the Polley backfill had one positive aspect because the excellent Zooey Deschanel replaced Hudson as the sister.

But in the end we are comforted because everything works out. We like this because it supports our dreams of living a life of benign irresponsibility, where none of our lesser actions have negative consequences. Like movies during the depression, Crowe sells tickets by telling everyone that they'll live happily ever. So in Almost Famous everyone ends up fine, no lasting effects from drug use, no social diseases, Russell does not fall off the roof, the airplane lands safely, and the characters happily bond in the final scenes.

It's about the past, how it pervades our lives for the rest of our days, and how we assimilate it into our futures.Many have complained that the film is convoluted, that when the key revelation comes (I ain't givin' that away) you miss the impact of it. I strongly disagree with this. I for one had actually figured out the revelation before it happened - this didn't bother me because I wanted so much for it to be what I had thought it was going to be. And when it comes, it's so subtle you could almost be forgiven for missing it. It's lovely, so comforting in a very ironic way.All I'll say is, pay attention to the scene where Jake (Nicholson) goes to see Kahn (the unmistakable James Hong). Something about the flowers...Anyway, I'm drifting. The Two Jakes is subtle, well-crafted, and when all is revealed, so very simple. The 'convoluted' events in the plot serve to illustrate what a single, simple desire can cause.Just watch it.

Life is safe, life is familiar and life is secure. However a power failure starts changes and tensions within the city and their community as looting spreads and the police cannot cope. As the fear reaches them their friend Joe encourages them to take action to either prepare for the worst or try and escape the city before the whole thing collapses.Opening with a couple of wolves tearing at the corpse of another wolf, this film had the potential to be an interesting and engaging character piece that would force its own audience to ask questions about itself and about its idea of society and morality within that idea of society. It starts reasonably well by setting up a couple of stock figures that we can sort of identify with (the white couple, the black people, the rough men etc) and initially does something with them before letting the average plot overtake the characters. The narrative sees them facing obstacles and dealing with them 9or not) in a way that follows a fairly ordinary thriller sort of path. This is so-so but nothing special since it never gets exciting in its own right and still suggests that we should be looking at the characters for our interest instead. However the inability to really draw out a tapestry of people and reactions (not to mention a convincing picture of suburbia under pressure) is where the film falls down.The actors are partly to blame even if the material wasn't there for them. MacLachlan starts out well with a typically start no trouble white professional but soon forgets being true to his character and just does what the script tells him. Shue is poor from start to finish and I doubt that she would have done much more even with the material. Mulroney is OK with a basic character but perhaps that was just the fact that he is the hothead in the mix that made him more interesting to me when I was just looking for something to happen. Jones doesn't do much and a cameo from Rooker only made me wish that the film had been following his character instead.Overall this is an average film that takes an interesting premise but does nothing at all with it. The basic plot seems to forget the character piece that it suggested it would be at the start and the more it does, the less interesting it becomes. The cast features some familiar faces but none of them can raise the material or make it about their characters and eventually they just get on with driving the plot.

However Junuh is knackered &#150; he had a very bad war and has lost all ability he once had, although he knows he should step up to the tournament.The terrestrial television premier of most big films in the UK is usually an event and it is only after multiple screenings that see it gradually slip into being filler material in less key timeslots. So with this film I should have smelled a rat with the fact that it premiered on a normal Friday afternoon &#150; far from being the prime slot that the names involved would suggest it deserves. However bookended with two sentimental TV movies seems a pretty fair place for it to be resting given that it essentially a mushy piece of fluff that will mainly appeal to those that like that sort of stuff. The story is told as a memory, which only serves to make the mush and the sentiment easier to produce (not a good thing) and it does it in spades &#150; a fact not helped by the very slow pace that the whole thing is delivered by. I can forgive it being corny if it doesn't take itself too seriously but my god but it does; line upon line of dialogue are written like scripture and as if they have deep meanings &#150; this stops it being fun or light and just makes it come off as pretentious.Of course it is still watchable despite this &#150; just.

However his character looks like it was crafted in detail compared to Bagger Vance and Smith can do nothing with that. At best he just turns on the charm and hopes that he doesn't choke on the amount of corn he has to say &#150; he nearly does it but not quite. Outside of this it also requires a forgiving viewer to ignore that whole Uncle Tom aspect of it and the fact that, in this film, racism does not exist and this stops the period being real.

I don't care what anyone says, Moncrief was pretty poor, a standard cute kid from start to finish.Overall this is a polished film but it has nothing beyond cheap mush, sentiment and guff that often borders on the pretentious.

Little Mo and Max actually have a duel of sorts, much like the Arthur Smith composition adapted as 'Dueling Banjos' for 'Deliverance'.Another great scene is the one where Max shows where he got his ideas for routines by dancing in the streets of New York while construction is going on.And there is the scene where 11-year-old Lewis is teaching Amy's dance class above Sonny's.There was plenty of good music here, but surprisingly, a lot of the dancing was done without music--though what I like most about tap is the music made by the dancers, much like the percussion style of Buddy Rich. I especially liked the arrangement of 'Cheek to Cheek' which started out as elevator music when Max and Amy were dancing ballroom style, but changed over to jazz when they switched to tap.

It stars Peter Sellers whom I love in the Pink Panther movies, and enjoyed in Dr. Strangelove and Lady Killers, but there're a lot of his movies I don't like. I've found that, unlike Robin Williams, Peter Sellers seems to work best with directors that keep a tight lease on him and have a clear vision of their own. This movie came at the end of Peter's career, and he fought for nine years to get a studio to make it. I believe that it's his best work. Sellers' character, Chance, tells the plain and simple truth throughout the movie but everyone hears only what they want to hear. The lack of any true interaction between the characters reflects my own warped vision of the world and I marvel that Jerzy Kosinski's novel was able to make it to the screen. For that, I have to credit the director, Hal Ashby. He manages to show Chance as both a simpleton AND an innocent, but not an object of pity - something that is very hard to do. As the story unfolds, every life touched by Chance is enriched, as each character mistakes him for a genius. We, the audience, smirk knowingly as we watch the same mistake take place again and again, until the final scene where we become humbled and delighted at our own preconceptions. Every time I watch this movie I marvel at how much raw talent parades across the screen. I love acting when it's done well, and it's done very well indeed in this story. Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but they never eclipse Sellers. So I guess what it boils down to is this is a great story told by a great writer and brought to life by a great director. The entire cast shines, but Peter Sellers goes out with a supernova.

The first one was The Remains of the Day, the second one this The Golden Bowl. Much to my surprise I must say that I liked both, although there was a big difference in the two. While the first one was very compelling and sometimes close to perfection, I didn't always have that feeling with this movie.In the early 1900's Adam Verver, an American billionaire, lives with his daughter in London. When she is introduced to the Italian Prince Amerigo, it doesn't take long before they get married. But the prince has a secret. He has a relationship with Charlotte Stant, Maggie Verver's best friend. Because Maggie doesn't know that Amerigo and Charlotte know each other, she sees no harm in introducing her to her widowed father and therefor allowing her to become a member of the family once she marries him. Charlotte is very happy with this match of course, because all she wants is to be close to Prince Amerigo. All this leads to one big masquerade full of deception, lies and unhappiness which can't be revealed...Despite the fact that I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies, I must say that this one was OK. Especially the acting made it all worth watching. Thanks to the famous, but also well-acting cast which includes people like Kate Beckinsale, Anjelica Huston, Nick Nolte and Uma Thurman, I was able to enjoy this movie. Does that mean that it is a perfect movie? No, not exactly. The story for instances sometimes lacks a bit in power, making it not always very interesting to keep watching this movie for more than two hours. But on the other hand I must also say that it all could have been a lot worse. The story was perhaps not exceptional, but it sure was decent enough.In the end I don't think this is a movie that will appeal to the average fan of period movies. First of all is the time period not exactly correct. I believe that those movies situated in the early 19th century are a lot more popular than one which is situated in the early 1900's. But since I'm not such an average fan and because I've always been interested in the time period 1900 - 1950, this was quite interesting for me. It's only too bad that the story wasn't a bit more exceptional. Now I give this movie a rating in between 7\/10 and 7.5\/10, mostly because of the fine performances.

The sisters and their mother live in their large home as their money runs low but their spirits remain high. Filled with kindness and love the girls all have different challenges &#150; Jo wants to be a writer in a world that is dominated by men, Meg longs for a man while Amy just wants a different nose. Their play and games continue as a result of their solidarity in the face of harsh reality, but can the family withstand the challenges of time?Those sitting to watch this film will probably ready be prepared for the fact that it is rather sentimental and highly likely to turn to mush with the slightest touch, so complaining about this is a bit unfair and it may be a matter of buyer beware in that regard. Having said that though, the film does just about manage to avoid becoming unwatchable mush and remains polished sentiment thanks mainly to the writing and development doing the work rather than relying solely on rising music and easy weepy tricks. You do need to be of a certain mood to enjoy it but the stories of the March family are engaging and manage to be of interest to modern audiences while also being well set within the period.Another major reason it succeeds is the work of the roundly good cast. Ryder is a solid narrator and has the plum role of being the feistiest of the sisters, a character she takes to well and seems to have been the foundation of the film. Danes and Alvarado play much more ordinary characters and although they are good, they have less of the limelight as a result. Dunst is suitably precocious and when she is replaced by Mathis, it is our loss. Sarandon is hard and she greatly helps drive out the mush in some scenes but occasionally her wisdom-spouting gets a bit old. Stoltz is quite uninspired; Bale is good but seems too old for the role, while Byrne is OK but often seems to be putting more work into his accent rather than bringing out a character &#150; but his chemistry with Ryder carries him.Overall this is a fine version of a story that was always going to at least a little sentimental. It never goes so far as being mushy and manages to be an engaging and enjoyable tale as a result.

Today too there are a lot of young American idealistic men who join the military, because they are in a hopeless situation when it comes to finding a job, because they constantly hear, read and see that only a soldier is the true hero of the nation or just because they are hoping to win some medals without thinking of all the possible consequences. Today the war isn't situated in Vietnam anymore, but Afghanistan and Iraq aren't all that different. Both wars are just as endless and impossible to win, whether they like to hear that or not. The only difference is that this time there is almost no-one who protests against it.Born on the Fourth of July tells the story of Ron Kovic. As a young man who is about to graduate from high school, who's good at sports, who's willing to fight for his country against the communists and who wants to make a difference in the world, the offer to become a US Marine is about everything he could dream of. After his military training, he is immediately sent to Vietnam. When they approach a village, everything appears to be quiet and peaceful at first. But little do they know that they are about to get trapped in an ambush. While running for their lives, one of his comrades is shot - Kovic is convinced that he did it - and soon after he too gets hit by a bullet. Once in hospital he finds out that he will be paralyzed for the rest of his life. While trying to deal with his handicap, he becomes more and more convinced that America never should have gone to war in Vietnam in the first place...Personally I didn't have any problem with it, because I'm anti-war myself (even though I'm not a lefty as so many of you will probably think), but I'm convinced that too many people will see some ultra-left anti war propaganda in it. Personally I don't think that was what Oliver Stone had in mind. I believe that he wanted to show that many young men go to war with the idea that they will do an honorable job by defending their country, but once they have returned to that same country, they realize that what they did wasn't always that honorable and the leaders of the country couldn't care less for their pain and trauma's. And let's be honest, were they heroes because they came back from Vietnam? I don't think so. Does that mean they all should have died back there? Certainly not, but are you a hero when you do your job? No you're not. The only difference is that they do it because some president sends them. Once they return (in a body bag or not doesn't really matter), they aren't all that important anymore. But by the time that they realize this, it's already too late. Personally I really appreciate that message and I hope that it might make some guys think twice. It's perhaps the only counter weight left in a balance that is dominated by nothing else but pro war propaganda. Or how would you call the fact that the Bush administration didn't even allow that photographs or other images from the coffins that returned from Iraq and Afghanistan were shown? They didn't want a second public rebellion against their war. But enough about politics, hidden messages and stuff like that. Let's talk about the acting, the directing,... I guess most people will agree with me that this is not only a very fine war movie thanks to the story, but also thanks to the great acting from Tom Cruise. This was one of his best performances ever - he has had some other great roles like for instance in Magnolia, but they were almost never as big as in this movie - and lifted this movie to a higher level. The other actors were interesting to watch as well, but if it hadn't been for Cruise, this movie might have gone by pretty much unnoticed. Most of them aren't famous at all and the name Oliver Stone wouldn't have been enough to convince the audience, although the man certainly knows what good (war) movies should look like. Just watch Platoon, JFK, ... yes even U Turn and Natural Born Killers, if you don't believe me. The problem with Stone is that so many people seem to take all his movies so personal. Somehow a lot of people don't seem to understand him or see him as too left and therefor uninteresting. All in all this is a very powerful war movie with an excellent Tom Cruise and some very fine directing from Oliver Stone. I already liked Heaven & Earth and loved Platoon.

Yeah, it has zombies, but it also has a genuine love story, a sympathetic antihero, an engaging storyline, a random killing spree, and a great ending, all wrapped up into a nice little package. Michele Soavi gives us one of the most original and thought-provoking horror movies of the 90's.Rupert Everett gives a superb performance as the tortured caretaker Francesco, who goes through life day by day, burying people and killing the occasional 'returner.' He knows that there's nothing worth living for, since 'everyone ends up here eventually.' The performances are excellent from the other relatively unknown actors, most notably the characters of Gnaghi and She. Gnaghi (na-gee) is great as Francesco's sidekick \/ helper. He only says one word, but manages to be a funny and likable character. The character of She represents how evil women can be and plays three different characters that break Francesco's heart. Claudio, The Mayor, and his daughter do a good job, along with everyone else.This movie is a very interesting way to look at both love and death. Here they are interconnected because every time a character finds love, death follows close behind in one form or another. There cannot be love without death. It can be interpreted either positively, that in order to love, death must be a part of one's life, or negatively, that love is evil and should be taken care of with death. You figure out how you want to interpret it.The movie also has many things that are completely irrelevant to the plot, but are entertaining and effective nonetheless. There are blue flying orbs that zoom around the cemetery. Francesco goes on a violent killing spree, only to have the credit taken by someone else. Death manifests itself in a cemetery statue every now and then to talk to Francesco. The film is filled with macabre humor as well, which is very enjoyable. These things have no real point, but make for a great addition to the movie.The gore and special effects are well done. Being the protégé of Dario Argento, Soavi injects the film with visually stunning imagery and over-the-top violence. All of the scenes in the cemetery at night are eerie, as well as the scene in the ossuary. There are some excellent moments of gore, especially when a group of teens on motorcycles get squished by a bus (one of which later reanimates complete with a 'death cycle'). There are also some bloody headshots and a nasty split head. Gorehounds will not be disappointed.I also have to mention the ending. I really thought it was a very clever way to end the film. Most people shrug it off because it doesn't make much sense, but I loved it. Great job Soavi!The Bottom Line A very entertaining, thought-provoking film that mixes zombies with a twisted love story.

I didn't just break up with my girlfriend, so it wasn't a choice of movie that seemed to be right for the moment.Rob is in his thirties and is the owner of a record-store that is situated in one of the worst neighborhoods to start a business in because there is almost no-one passing by. He doesn't have too much clients and his two clerks aren't exactly a great help either. But he doesn't really care, because he has other, bigger problems on his mind. He isn't a teenager anymore, although he sometimes still acts like one and he finally realizes that it's about time that he starts to grow up. His girlfriend has left him and in order to deal with the pain he starts to make a list of the five worst break-ups in his life. And while doing so, he recalls each break-up, tries to reconnect with his former girlfriends in order to find out why they dumped him...If the ladies are looking for an insight in the mind of the average man in his late twenties, early thirties, this might be a good movie to watch. And for us men it's nice to see that you aren't the only one who still seems to think like a teenager from time to time, even though you're already past that age for at least more than a decade. It's all recognizable and that's what makes this movie so funny. We all went (some of us probably still are) through such a 'crisis' and it's always nice to see a comedy that makes fun of it.

I've seen several romantic comedies lately and seeing one as good as this one is a rarity, believe me.That it is so good also has a lot to do with the acting of course. John Cusack, Todd Louiso and Jack Black, who were really perfectly cast for their roles, really did a very fine job. Their three characters together made it perfect. If one of them would have been left out, this could never have been the same fine comedy. But they weren't the only good ones in this movie. A nice 'surprise' was Iben Hjejle. I had seen her once in Mifune's Last Song, but I didn't know that she had played English speaking roles as well. She really did well and I hope to see her in similar roles soon.All in all this is one of the best examples when it comes to romantic comedies. This may well be one of the few that will appeal to women as well as to men, because it all is so recognizable and not sweet at all. I certainly liked it and that's why I give this movie a 7.5\/10.

I finally reached that conclusion after seeing this film several times. When I first saw Starship Troopers back in'97, I was taken with its exciting depiction of the future - I'd guess 200 years from now - where-in young gung-ho soldiers, led by older scarred veterans, begin to wage war against giant interstellar bugs. This was a scale of combat rarely, if ever, seen on the screen, with the very survival of our species at stake. It was based on Heinlein's science fiction novel, which I read as a teen and which was written straight - serving in the military was the most honorable thing a person could do, as such an individual takes responsibility for the safety of the human race. If you're a left wing filmmaker, the idea of a military government is an automatic means of depicting a sly form of fascism. The fascism in this film ends up being directed at the alien bugs, as it turns out. As shown by the filmmaker, human beings themselves in this era have no problems with each other; no one looks suppressed or oppressed, everyone has their own opportunities. If you don't want to join military life, that's fine; you're not accorded 'citizen' status, whatever that means, but no one forces you into anything and you lead a comfortable life. Of course, we're shown a surface gloss of what life is like on Earth, but it seems very pleasant - when not bombarded by asteroids from alien bugs. But, it could be that, 200 years from now, a government run by the military may not be the same thing as we would be subjected to now. Verhoeven never shows any sinister signs that all may not be what it seems to be and citizens are somehow mind-controlled or duped.After seeing the film a couple of more times, a few bothersome details became noticeable and thoughts crept into my brain. Take these military outposts set up on bug planets - aren't they the most ill-conceived pieces of crap for an advanced military civilization? I'm not even asking for force fields which maybe no one perfected yet, but what about at least some extended roofing? Some futuristic version of barbwire? (I believe the sequel actually had something like this). And the grouping of the spaceships so that they all get wiped out together above a planet? There're two possibilities the filmmaker threw aside such logic to depict cool carnage; or, you have a government bureaucracy far more sinister than what was first believed. This would be a government willing to sacrifice millions of citizens, including their own soldiers, for a long range plan of dominating a galaxy. You motivate the citizens enough into hating the enemy and your long range plan will succeed eventually. I don't really understand it all and maybe that's the whole point; it's never explained clearly how the war began - how & why did the bugs throw an asteroid on Buenos Aires and why weren't orbital defenses set up before this? No one knows except...hey, who is the head of our planet anyway in this future? So there you have it certain filmmakers can throw together a real chaotic brew of futuristic paranoia disguised as a war picture. You check out the over-the-top propaganda in the recurring newscasts, dripping in dark satire, and it doesn't take more than one viewing to get a semblance of where the filmmaker stands. One thing from the outset that never changed for me though I would start the film dreading those scary giant bugs, by the end of it I'm feeling sorry for them after the relentless onslaught by these fascistic humans. It's a human being galaxy, my friends; no bugs allowed.

The fascism in this film ends up being directed at the alien bugs, as it turns out. As shown by the filmmaker, human beings themselves in this era have no problems with each other; no one looks suppressed or oppressed, everyone has their own opportunities. If you don't want to join military life, that's fine; you're not accorded 'citizen' status, whatever that means, but no one forces you into anything and you lead a comfortable life. Of course, we're shown a surface gloss of what life is like on Earth, but it seems very pleasant - when not bombarded by asteroids from alien bugs. But, it could be that, 200 years from now, a government run by the military may not be the same thing as we would be subjected to now. Verhoeven never shows any sinister signs that all may not be what it seems to be and citizens are somehow mind-controlled or duped.After seeing the film a couple of more times, a few bothersome details became noticeable and thoughts crept into my brain. Take these military outposts set up on bug planets - aren't they the most ill-conceived pieces of crap for an advanced military civilization? I'm not even asking for force fields which maybe no one perfected yet, but what about at least some extended roofing? Some futuristic version of barbwire? (I believe the sequel actually had something like this). And the grouping of the spaceships so that they all get wiped out together above a planet? There're two possibilities the filmmaker threw aside such logic to depict cool carnage; or, you have a government bureaucracy far more sinister than what was first believed. This would be a government willing to sacrifice millions of citizens, including their own soldiers, for a long range plan of dominating a galaxy. You motivate the citizens enough into hating the enemy and your long range plan will succeed eventually. I don't really understand it all and maybe that's the whole point; it's never explained clearly how the war began - how & why did the bugs throw an asteroid on Buenos Aires and why weren't orbital defenses set up before this? No one knows except...hey, who is the head of our planet anyway in this future? So there you have it certain filmmakers can throw together a real chaotic brew of futuristic paranoia disguised as a war picture. You check out the over-the-top propaganda in the recurring newscasts, dripping in dark satire, and it doesn't take more than one viewing to get a semblance of where the filmmaker stands. One thing from the outset that never changed for me though I would start the film dreading those scary giant bugs, by the end of it I'm feeling sorry for them after the relentless onslaught by these fascistic humans. It's a human being galaxy, my friends; no bugs allowed.

I finally reached that conclusion after seeing this film several times. When I first saw Starship Troopers back in'97, I was taken with its exciting depiction of the future - I'd guess 200 years from now - where-in young gung-ho soldiers, led by older scarred veterans, begin to wage war against giant interstellar bugs. This was a scale of combat rarely, if ever, seen on the screen, with the very survival of our species at stake.

When Romeo (a Montague) gatecrashes the Capulet ball in disguise, he slights upon a beautiful women, Juliet, who he is shocked to find is a Capulet. The two flirt and fall for one another and the enormity of their circumstance is not lost on them as they try to keep their growing love a secret. Meanwhile, tensions on the streets start to spill over into violent confrontations.Although my age would suggest that the modern, MTV-friendly version of this story would be much more accessible to me, I must admit that I was surprised by how good this version was and how much I enjoyed it. Far from the updated telling of 1996, this version is distinctly set in the period of the story and is much more of a traditional telling, lacking anything in the way of excessive flair and style. Zeffirelli directs well, using the large sets well while also drawing good performances from his surprisingly young cast. The story will be known to everyone so it is left to the delivery to ensure that we are still drawn into the romance while also steeling ourselves for the tragedy; in this regard it does well enough, with the silly, illogical love of teenagers being convincingly painted to the point where it did matter to me that it would all end with such loss and pain. The only major problem I had with the delivery was one that has come with time &#150; the use of music. The dominate tune has since been hijacked to be played under Simon Bates Our Tune on the radio where he reads out terrible cloying stories before playing a song; every time it comes on, that's all I could hear and it took away from the film as I'm sure many UK viewers may agree.The cast are a strange lot; occasionally they all seem to be hamming it up a little bit too much but mostly they are all pretty good and fit with the Shakespearian type of acting that comes with this sort of film. Whiting and Hussey took a few minutes to convince me because they aren't familiar to me and they seemed too young. However they did win me over in the early scenes of playful love and desire. Neither is as good in the more demanding scenes of pain etc but even these they just about do enough to convince (although Hussey's weeping is at times very weak). The mostly young and unknown support cast are also good, with fine work in particular from McEnery, Robinson and a young York. Mostly, the gamble of having a very young cast has paid off but it isn't without some unconvincing moments.Overall this is a very good, traditional telling of the story and it should not be dismissed out of hand in favour of the flashier modern version. Both are worth seeing for different reasons but this one is much more sturdy and period set, with a convincing love story that leads to tragedy. The young cast display some weak moments but generally work well while Zeffirelli works well with them and the impressive sets and locations he has to film.

Bobby doesn't take him seriously of course, but takes the money all the same; however after seeing and experiencing some strange things, Bobby begins to believe.Despite the negative press on this film, parts of it are actually quite good. For too long the film is a fairly typical coming-of-age film with a slightly mysterious air in the background. It also moves very slowly. So far, so dull; the mystery is too thin to engage and the story is too dull to care about. However in the final third of the film, the mystery comes to the fore and, although it isn't great, it certainly provides some much needed movement to the story. It doesn't make a great deal of sense and it is a case of perhaps a bit too little much too late, but it did improve as the focus changed.The cast are all pretty good but don't seem to be connected to the material well enough. Hopkins is a good presence but he plays it in whisper mode from start to finish. Yelchin is not too bad but is still a cocky kid performance and he can't do anything with the coming-of-age\/first-kiss stuff that he is expected to carry on his own.

Morse is underused as always but he does his best with a bookend role and a bit of narration.Overall this is an OK film that gets better as it goes on.

In a new reincarnation, the glorious 1939 musical is back, remastered to be presented in 2013 3D IMAX technology, and what could have been another gimmick turns out to be quite an enhancement. It doesn't distract from the original masterpiece because every single element remains strong, as a reminder of what it made The Wizard such a landmark in the cinema world, especially outstanding because 1939 was probably one of the best years in cinema.There are so many elements to like in this film, from its very simple and touching story of a quest back home. In the story a simple Kansas girl travels to the land of her dreams, only to realize home is where the heart is. During her trip, she is joined by the most amazing friends she could have. She is accompanied by a smart friend, a sensitive friend, and a friend who needs a little more confidence. In other words, with her innocence and them, we have the perfect person.The marvelous score includes If I had only a brain, a heart... We're going to see the wizard... Follow the yellow brick road... If was king of the Forest, never faltering, hitting the wrong notes. It is a great collection of tunes that easy to love, hum, and most importantly support and advance the story. Of course, Over The Rainbow leads the way into the wonderful world of Oz, and the rest of the score must keep up with the high standard of the classic.Who will ever fail to appreciate the flawless performances by Garland and her supporting team Bolger, Hamilton... Everyone is wonderful. There are the amazing special effects, which even in the grandeur of the IMAX screen are still quite remarkable for the period. This movie is by all means, a treasure, a classic, something to be loved for the ages.

It doesn't distract from the original masterpiece because every single element remains strong, as a reminder of what it made The Wizard such a landmark in the cinema world, especially outstanding because 1939 was probably one of the best years in cinema.There are so many elements to like in this film, from its very simple and touching story of a quest back home. In the story a simple Kansas girl travels to the land of her dreams, only to realize home is where the heart is. During her trip, she is joined by the most amazing friends she could have. She is accompanied by a smart friend, a sensitive friend, and a friend who needs a little more confidence. In other words, with her innocence and them, we have the perfect person.The marvelous score includes If I had only a brain, a heart... We're going to see the wizard... Follow the yellow brick road... If was king of the Forest, never faltering, hitting the wrong notes. It is a great collection of tunes that easy to love, hum, and most importantly support and advance the story. Of course, Over The Rainbow leads the way into the wonderful world of Oz, and the rest of the score must keep up with the high standard of the classic.Who will ever fail to appreciate the flawless performances by Garland and her supporting team Bolger, Hamilton... Everyone is wonderful. There are the amazing special effects, which even in the grandeur of the IMAX screen are still quite remarkable for the period. This movie is by all means, a treasure, a classic, something to be loved for the ages.

Then its author revealed that he had spent American currency hiring the video and I thought aha, so that's why.This film partly celebrates a piece of rural, Northern England and it really does help if you live there, which I do. (I could even take you to the railway station where the early scenes were shot, featuring incidentally the most unconvincing screen rain I have ever seen! it also stars in the first Harry Potter movie) The delicious soundtrack could only have been composed by someone steeped in Elgar, Delius and Vaughan Williams. Only a man who knows if not at first hand then at least by intimate report the rivalry between church and chapel - which still persists in these parts - could have written that scene in the organ shop.It's not an action movie but rather one that moves with the languid pace of a summer that feels as if it should be Edwardian, but that era is a dream now. There are dark ripples below the sunny surface. Birken's nervous tic, the nightmares of the trenches, the casual debauchery of Moon, are the aftertaste of WW1's horror. What of Christian faith after such slaughter? There is the simple Phillistine chapel culture, its weary preacher still ranting at his congregation about their sins, unaware that the war has made private transgression seem utterly trivial. There is the cold liturgical worship offered by the pious, buttoned up, tight-fisted Rev Keach. Birken finds no meaning in either, and immerses himself in the work of restoring a masterpiece from an age when faith still gripped the psyche, hoping perhaps to draw something of its historic power into himself. Moon - Branagh's character - is shallow by comparison, idle, serene, detached.The scenes with Birken and Alice Keach are little gems of implication and understatement, she - it seems knowingly - playing Eve, complete with temptress's apple, to Birken's Adam. The potential for an affair is manifest, but we sense nothing will come of it, and in the last scene of the movie Birken is seen throwing away an apple core.Branagh would go on to greater things; this is Colin Firth's film and while his celebrity rating has soared since he made it, I doubt he will ever turn in a performance that surpasses it in subtlety and richness.But to end as I began this is not a movie that I would expect to travel well. You really need to be English appreciate it - heck, I've seen American movies that washed right over me because I don't understand the rules of baseball!
