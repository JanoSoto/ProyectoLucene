I actually liken this movie more to Fight Club, both because it resonates in a strange way with my own life experiences and because it bears the same message.I saw Reality Bites right after my 2nd year in college, making me a tad younger than the characters; nonetheless I was exposed to the exact same larger issues (heterosexual AIDS, homosexuality (anyone here remember Coming Out Day 1993?), crappy job market) and I was also fighting for my own sense of identity during a time when there was virtually no positive attention being paid to my generation. It also helped that I grew up in east Houston and knew most of the landmarks both physical and cultural. However, it didn't perfectly jive with my life either frankly, I grew up too poor to get a free car from the parents, or be able to go to Rice University(!), or purchase a video camera, or even just drive on a whim to downtown Houston to get to the top of a skyscraper. And living in an apartment? Not for another three years. Still, I enjoyed the film at the time and even more so now that I just turned 30. The soundtrack has been in my collection for a long time just for U2, Lisa Loeb, and the Juliana Hatfield Three.As plenty of people have pointed out, the characters ARE whiny and privileged without realizing it and make plenty of dumb decisions about changing the world. Coming out to your parents -- in conservative Houston -- before you get a job and established is stupid. Choosing to date the high-IQ slacker rather than the kind-hearted guy moving on up is stupid too, as is sleeping with dozens of people or selling yourself out for both money and whacked-out neurotic chicks. None of these people are ultimately heroes, but that's why for many of us who are near their demographic they relate so well. The only people I've known who are the right age but still really hate this movie are those for whom (to be blunt) it strikes too close to home super-ambitious business types selling out to their companies and workers with retail McJobs who know they could be so much more but can't see how to get there.I think the real point of the movie is the same as Fight Club identity is important but cannot be mediated by your purchases or chosen social markers. We all WANT to be unique individuals and publicly recognized as such, but paradoxically the only way to achieve that goal is to stop searching for it. We all WANT to change the world but will only do so within our usually-quite-small circle of influence. Railing against consumerism while walking the mall is amazingly self-blind.Stiller and Hawke did an excellent job making this movie just enough in all the right directions. The love triangle -- required for a movie to get funding -- wasn't too overdone in the end, all the characters get a lot of screen time, and we get to see in a direct way that friendship really is the only support in their lives. (We also see as in Threesome how much such a close circle can cut out those on the outside -- Stiller's character never had a chance without the acceptance of Ryder's character's friends.) Everyone gets to display both their weaknesses (such as Ryder's character trying to alter the TV show she works for) and their strengths (such as Hawke reducing the whole existential angst crap to 5 bucks and a coffee). It's not a film I would put on every day; much like American Beauty it's only right for certain moods but nonetheless perfect for those moments.Finally, I should refer to both St. Elmo's Fire and Singles. Neither of those similar-themed movies really get to me, in fact the former I really despise because the characters are even more obliviously privileged and self-centered than those in Reality Bites. And Singles just seemed too West Coast for me -- few people outside Seattle and California really got to see the grunge scene or sensitive new-age pony-tail guys in real life. Plus Kyra Sedgwick's character just grated on my nerves. I mention these because I think they show the one fatal flaw in Reality Bites if you aren't the right age for this movie, it just won't feel right.

Sure Batman & Robin is possibly the worst movie ever made, and it did kill a multi-million dollar franchise, but is that truly all we think about on the mention of his name? I myself will admit to keeping a stigma of hack whenever Schumacher is talked about, however, along with some decent films of late, his track record in the 80's was full of pure, nostalgic gems. I finally got the opportunity to check out one of my mother's favorite films, St. Elmo's Fire. Made at the height of Brat Pack fame, this film really gets the angst of college graduation and the life of responsibility and work that waits in the future right. While not as quotable or memorable as say The Breakfast Club, Schumacher still is able to take a moment in the youth of society and make something meaningful out of it. Maybe I can relate to it having just graduated from college two years ago, but I think that it would be relevant later on as well. Even if not, it is an accomplishment to last over twenty years and still be relatable to someone in that same position in the present day.So the film is chock full of stereotypes and clichés, does that make it not true? We have our striver for fame and notoriety at the expense of his ideals, the girlfriend who wants to make a career before settling down as a stay at home mother, the troubled artist who can't leave school behind for a real life, the self-obsessed flirt who would rather self-destruct than ruin the façade she has worked so hard to build, the love-struck indecisive one stalking a past love and changing himself to try and win her over, and the confused souls not quite sure what they want to do with their new independence. We have the drug use, the sleeping around, the comradery, and the heartbreak. Through it all, though, you can really buy into it and see moments in your own life that mirror the events on screen almost perfectly. I think a lot of this has to do with the times and the ability to use actors that are actually the age of the characters they are playing. This is a film about 23 year olds trying to find themselves, and the authenticity of having people that age, going through those things in their real lives, helps the performances to be truthful. Nowadays this would have been changed to a post- high school story with the 18 year olds played by actors 25 or older. It's the vulnerability and the childlike appearance that makes you buy into the story and want to follow it to the end to see if the friendships can remain intact.The star-filled cast does a great job throughout, and a film like this makes you wonder where these guys have gone. An actress like Ally Sheedy, who had the talent and the looks, pretty much fell off the map once the 80's came to a close. It is her and Andrew McCarthy that really carry the film. He is another that disappeared after Weekend at Bernie's. It is always nice to see this troupe of acting talent and what they were capable of in their prime. Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, and Judd Nelson are all pitch-perfect in their roles along with Mare Winningham playing the friend that is so totally different from everyone else in the group, yet believable because we all have a friend like that. The only weak spot, in my opinion, is Rob Lowe, who at many times seems a bit out of his element as the drunk, party guy cracking jokes and getting into trouble. I don't discount his performances totally, though, because when he has moments of clarity, like when he talks Moore down after her total collapse, he is really excellent.Everyone goes through a moment of time in his\/her life like the characters on screen in St. Elmo's Fire. Schumacher should be given credit for giving us a poignant study into the lives of those souls on the cusp of a new chapter in life and the decisions that need to be made to continue forward without regrets for what is left behind. The dialogue is realistic and it all ends in a conclusion that makes sense in the scheme of the character's evolutions. Your friends will always be there for you, through thick and thin, however, as you grow older, the roles each play in your life changes.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it tremendously. I even came away with the deliciously horrible song, Telling the Truth is Dangerous Business, running through my mind. (The film's credits disclose that many of the music by the fictitious songwriters of the film were original songs written by famed Oscar-winner Paul Williams.)One of the reasons critics panned the movie so much could have been it was an enormously expensive, over-budget film. As a result people were expecting something spectacular, which it isn't. It is possible that a reason the panning was so severe was because the director is a woman, but I hope no critic used that as a basis for his opinion. I think female directors were rare at the time. Ishtar was directed by Elaine May, who by 1987 had been an established highly respected comedian. With Mike Nichols (before he became a major film director), her partner in comedy records, they have been said to have revolutionized the landscape of American comedy. So it isn't surprising to find that she displays in Ishtar her great sense of humor.How can I describe the kind of movie Ishtar is? It is, of course, a comedy, somewhere between a satire and a farce. But what kind of comedy? It certainly isn't a romantic or bedroom comedy of the Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts or Jennifer Aniston variety. Nor is it slapstick farce of the Chevy Chase or Steve Martin variety. What comes to my mind for reference comparison are the comedy recordings of the Elaine May, Mike Nichols duo (e.g.,the pay phone caller who lost his dime and is trying to get the operator to place a call for him), and the early Martin and Lewis movies. But the comedy style of the latter is totally different so I'm not sure why it comes to mind except that you have two guys getting into jams together. The second time I watched Ishtar it brought to my mind a Bing Crosby, Bob Hope film called Road to Morocco. Although the plots are totally different, Hope and Crosby could have played the lead roles in Ishtar. The film begins with struggling unpublished songwriters Lyle Rogers (Warren Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Dustin Hoffman) trying to put together the lyrics and music to an original song. They are two schnooks who have harbored dreams of being songwriters since they were teenagers (which was very long ago.) Did you get the joke of the name of the duo, Rogers and Clarke? They are running out of resources and reluctantly accept a paying job their agent finds for them, but it is in the Middle East. When they arrive they immediately get themselves embroiled in espionage and revolutionary conflicts. Naturally a beautiful young woman, Shirra Assel (Isabelle Adjani), is involved. Even before they get out of the airport, one of the naifs is recruited by a CIA agent and the other by Shirra Assel, who's life is in danger. She is involved in a religious conspiracy to overthrow the evil Emir. A secret map and a legend that some day two strangers sent by God will arrive and lead a revolution is the main theme. There is also a blind camel, heroes stranded in the desert with too little water, and everyone trying to kill the heroes.One of the silent jokes in the film is that Dustin Hoffman, whose previous roles included Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy, plays a man women find interesting, while Warren Beatty, who has the reputation of a womanizer, plays a dork who's shy around women.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it tremendously. I even came away with the deliciously horrible song, Telling the Truth is Dangerous Business, running through my mind. (The film's credits disclose that many of the music by the fictitious songwriters of the film were original songs written by famed Oscar-winner Paul Williams.)One of the reasons critics panned the movie so much could have been it was an enormously expensive, over-budget film. As a result people were expecting something spectacular, which it isn't. It is possible that a reason the panning was so severe was because the director is a woman, but I hope no critic used that as a basis for his opinion. I think female directors were rare at the time. Ishtar was directed by Elaine May, who by 1987 had been an established highly respected comedian. With Mike Nichols (before he became a major film director), her partner in comedy records, they have been said to have revolutionized the landscape of American comedy. So it isn't surprising to find that she displays in Ishtar her great sense of humor.How can I describe the kind of movie Ishtar is? It is, of course, a comedy, somewhere between a satire and a farce. But what kind of comedy? It certainly isn't a romantic or bedroom comedy of the Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts or Jennifer Aniston variety. Nor is it slapstick farce of the Chevy Chase or Steve Martin variety. What comes to my mind for reference comparison are the comedy recordings of the Elaine May, Mike Nichols duo (e.g.,the pay phone caller who lost his dime and is trying to get the operator to place a call for him), and the early Martin and Lewis movies. But the comedy style of the latter is totally different so I'm not sure why it comes to mind except that you have two guys getting into jams together. The second time I watched Ishtar it brought to my mind a Bing Crosby, Bob Hope film called Road to Morocco. Although the plots are totally different, Hope and Crosby could have played the lead roles in Ishtar. The film begins with struggling unpublished songwriters Lyle Rogers (Warren Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Dustin Hoffman) trying to put together the lyrics and music to an original song. They are two schnooks who have harbored dreams of being songwriters since they were teenagers (which was very long ago.) Did you get the joke of the name of the duo, Rogers and Clarke? They are running out of resources and reluctantly accept a paying job their agent finds for them, but it is in the Middle East. When they arrive they immediately get themselves embroiled in espionage and revolutionary conflicts. Naturally a beautiful young woman, Shirra Assel (Isabelle Adjani), is involved. Even before they get out of the airport, one of the naifs is recruited by a CIA agent and the other by Shirra Assel, who's life is in danger. She is involved in a religious conspiracy to overthrow the evil Emir. A secret map and a legend that some day two strangers sent by God will arrive and lead a revolution is the main theme. There is also a blind camel, heroes stranded in the desert with too little water, and everyone trying to kill the heroes.One of the silent jokes in the film is that Dustin Hoffman, whose previous roles included Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy, plays a man women find interesting, while Warren Beatty, who has the reputation of a womanizer, plays a dork who's shy around women.

Although I like Pulp Fiction immensely, I FAIL to see to comparison between the two films. Besides, WHY do you have to compare it to anything? Why does it have to be the British Pulp Fiction? That's just stupid!! Lock, Stock is my favorite film of all time - and that, for a film buff like me, if a HUGE call. It has everything in it; comedy, wit, action, style, a great soundtrack, wonderful acting (the sexy Nick Moran being my favorite), perfect direction and cinematography and an even more perfect script. Now, the two things about this film that make it as perfect as it is, is the witty and intelligent script and the wonderful characters. Through the script and the great acting, the characters, although many, are able to really be developed, and developed well. We get to know not only the main four; Ed, Bacon, Soap and other characters like Winston, Plank, Rory and Harry so quickly. We really get a sense of who they and what their intentions are from just a short period of time with them. There are so many wonderful and clever lines in the script and they are quick and easy to miss sometimes. I would recommend watching this film at least twice (Or like me, over one hundred times) in order to gain full understanding of the dialogue.

To be honest I don't care about his string of not-so-good films after Snatch, which I must say, I didn't like as much as Lock Stock. To me this film stands alone as the film he became to writer\/director for. I also don't care about his affiliation with Maddonna, that's his personal business and nothing to do with me. None of that stuff matters to me because this film is perfect as far as I'm concerned.I have seen and enjoyed this movie many many times over.

The wolf scene in the beginning really did not have any correlation with the movie; although it suggested he may have been hesitant about taking lives, it was clear that he had no such qualms after the first 20 minutes.The script was one of the worst I have seen. Despite Jude Law being a terrible selection for a war movie in the first place, they didn't have to give him a head start to his sub-par performance by providing him with laughable dialog. Some of these reviews talk about authenticity; what the hell did the director expect to accomplish by giving his actors cheesy lines that they read in accents completely opposite to what they should have been. I mean, we know Jude Law's British...let's not make it agonizingly obvious by making him use his normal accent as a Russian... By far the worst performance was the Russian with no teeth that gets shot in midair... I was actually laughing at his dialog because it was so forced and pathetic.And if this weren't enough validation for me to slam this film, the director decided to throw in another forced element a corny, trite love story. As if we needed another Pearl Harbor... As far-fetched as it was to have a female elite sniper that was moderately attractive and somehow in contact with both Law and Fiennes, Jean-Jacques Annaud decided to have her fall in love with Law and add some facetious gap-filler to his movie.Seriously...the movie probably could have been squeezed into about 15 minutes and it would have been just as eventful; the only interesting parts were the battle scenes (which is where the three stars came from), which I thought portrayed not necessarily a historically accurate view of Stalingrad but a visually stunning one nonetheless. Props to Annaud for the one thing he did right. But his empty, implausible storyline that just made me sit back in my chair and wonder how much longer it would be until the pain was over absolutely ruined this movie. The nail in the coffin was finding out that the girl that got blown up by an artillery shell actually survived so that the movie could have a fairy tale ending.

Superman fared well for the first couple of movies, and the Burton Batman line did okay for the first couple of installments, and Judge Dredd does hold potential for a successful franchise line. However, this was done well before the current technological CG age, and it shows something awful. The dialog is trite and glib, delivered with about as much reality as plastic, and comes off like they were trying SO hard to have fun that they couldn't actually have any, if you can understand that.Coupled with the fact that this work takes itself far too seriously, Stallone in particular considering he was the ONLY serious thing about the work, Stallone comes off as an over-dramatized ego maniacal schmuck. A. Asanti does portray a competent villain, and Stallone contributes a decent performance, all things considered. I think it was more...everything else, that went wrong with this production...Rob Schneider, for one.Whose idea WAS it to cast that moronic imbecile in a Judge Dredd movie? Is it possible that some idiot considered him the comic relief?! Not possible when one realizes that Rob Schneider is about as funny as a bad case of syphilis. He drug it down, if that is possible.The set designs were another thing. The budget existed to have built good sets, but these looked worse than some of the original Star Trek episodes' sets and props! In places, it looked good, but for the most part, they were pretty cheesy. Blend that with Stallone's over-acting, and trite dialog, Rob Schneider's presence, and everyone else just milling about as if there was no point to the plot, and you've got a pretty bad movie. Fun, but still pretty bad.The sound track and the plot (when it is discernible) are the only enjoyable elements of this work. Unless you're a die hard Stallone fan, I'd suggest you pass on this one.

It is one of those films where form and content, style and substance, merge to form a great work of art.The character of Cleo, a beautiful young singer forced to accept a possible diagnosis of cancer, is both iconic and true to life. I love the shots of her walking the streets, shot from a birds' eye view and you hear the comments of men as she's walking by. Varda's objectifies her from this angle as she pops out from the scene with her puffy wig and polka dot dress, and in the background is just this incredible music. The camera-work is so varied and so strong throughout the film. There are objective angles, subjective angles, there are playful movements of the camera to go with the music, a back and forth with the mirrors in the cafe, in the hat shop, slow, soft, out of focus movements in bed as she waits for her lover, zoom transitions as she sings her song, Slow pans in the art studio. One scene I liked especially was the scattering of the birds as she's walking down the street. It seems to signify, so well, to me a sign of a bad omen tied to almost a mythological scale.

It is based on a true story and the book Wiseguys. The story is great with just a few minor strayings from the true story which it is based off of.Acting The acting is great. Ray Liotta gives what should have been an Oscar-Nominated performance as Henry Hill. He narrates as Henry Hill as well. Joe Pesci gives an Oscar-Winning performance as the brutal and vicious Tommy DeVito based on Thomas DeSimone. Lorraine Bracco gives a great performance as Henry Hill's wife, Karen Hill. Robert De Niro didn't give as good of a performance as he did in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull but still gave a fantastic performance.

There is the usual nerdy girl- Jamie Sullivan (played by Moore) and the hot, egotistical popular bad ass- Landon Carter (played by West). At first he looks down upon her and then, magically falls in love with her defending their relationship against his friends.Yeah, like that will ever happen.And yet, I still fell in love with the movie despite its predictability. The plot is interesting, although i felt like i was watching a daytime soap opera and any minute she was going to overlook her views of abstinence (this is before i knew that they were going to get married!) and get pregnant before she died of leukemia.Jamie teaches Landon about faith and love, and you practically fall in love with Landon as he goes the extra mile to impress her by fulfilling some of her goals on a list of things to do before she dies. However, Landon doesn't realize how soon that will come. As they delve deeper into their relationship with some heartwarming, sappy scenes of flirt and dating, Landon finds out that Jamie doesn't have long to live since she has leukemia (i knew this was too good to be true). Then, he tries to make the time he has left with her priceless, and, you guessed it, he romantically proposes to her and they marry. And of course she just had to die, the movie just wouldn't work if she didn't. After watching it I looked up the songs and bought them on iTunes. They are very relevant to the story, and whoever picked the actors did a great job. They were perfect for their roles and i wouldn't be surprised if they ended up dating after the movie. I would definitely watch this movie again...and i do admit that i cried at the end when the older Landon says Our love is like the wind. I can't see it, but i can feel it. This movie is the ultimate guilty pleasure with its corny sappy lines that make you wish you were in the movie, and of course you cant get over Shane West and Mandy Moore!

The filmmakers followed a pattern established in earlier Trek films, in that they selected the best villain from the TV series (a la Khan in the 2nd Trek film) to confront the heroic crew. So, this film functions mostly as a sequel to the TNG episodes The Best of Both Worlds parts one & two, from 1990, in which the cyborg-race the Borg nearly succeeded in assimilating Earth. The Borg also assimilated Picard, temporarily, in those episodes, a process likened to a futuristic version of rape and slavery, so the most powerful elements of this story involve Picard revisiting this trauma; and this results in some of his less-civilized behavior, raising questions of just how far mankind has really evolved in the past 300 years. The Borg are sort of upgraded for this film, but this mostly involves giving them a more gritty look, superficially emphasizing the horrific aspects of their threat. Frankly, I preferred their appearance in the episodes, such as in Q Who?, where their skin merely lacked any pigmentation, rather than this mottled effect here. They were unique back then, whereas now they seem derivative of other sci-fi franchises, such as the Terminator films. Also damaging their unique qualities is the intro of a Borg Queen, created to have meaningful one-on-one dialog with Data and Picard. The concept of a queen ruling a hive is nothing new in science fiction, unfortunately; what always impressed me about the Borg before this was the lack of any central control - that is what really made them unique. But, enough with the negatives.Overall, the film is a blast. The first scene is a case study of how to begin a sf adventure - talk about transfixing an audience in the very first minute! The danger is that this first minute would overwhelm the rest of the film, but the script and first-time film director Frakes manage to provide a relentless pace for the remainder of the show, an almost non-stop action thrill ride to reflect the unstoppable nature of the enemy. Early on, we are thrown into the middle of a spectacular space battle (showing the Star Wars influence a bit more than the earlier movie Trek battles). It may be my favorite of any movie space wars, outdoing even the later Star Wars prequels. Of course, the filmmakers resorted to a time travel angle again (what is it with this obsession with time travel by Trek-makers since the eighties?), but they ended up selecting an interesting, pivotal moment in Trek history to wrap the story around - year 2063, to be precise. We are re-introduced to the famous Zefram Cochrane, the 'inventor' of warp drive, which resulted in the whole Starfleet\/Federation civilization we first saw on the original Trek series in the sixties (Cochrane was first seen as a different actor in the original episode Metamorphosis). I found the reinterpretation here of Cochrane bordering on cliché scripting - the re-used 'loser-turnaround-to-redeem-himself' plot; this type of story always makes me wonder how a guy who is out-of-his-mind drunk half the time manages to out-think all the clear-headed scientists. But, the bottom line is that it's an exciting, even thrilling storyline, with Stewart's best moments as the angry, yet in-charge, even ruthless Captain Picard. His scene with actress Woodard towards the end, when parallels are drawn again with Capt. Ahab and Moby Dick, is worth the price of admission by itself. Of the regulars, Sirtis as Troi, Dorn as Worf and Spiner as Data also get to shine in their scenes. There are also some entertaining cameos by characters from the other Trek series.

The Borg also assimilated Picard, temporarily, in those episodes, a process likened to a futuristic version of rape and slavery, so the most powerful elements of this story involve Picard revisiting this trauma; and this results in some of his less-civilized behavior, raising questions of just how far mankind has really evolved in the past 300 years. The Borg are sort of upgraded for this film, but this mostly involves giving them a more gritty look, superficially emphasizing the horrific aspects of their threat. Frankly, I preferred their appearance in the episodes, such as in Q Who?, where their skin merely lacked any pigmentation, rather than this mottled effect here. They were unique back then, whereas now they seem derivative of other sci-fi franchises, such as the Terminator films. Also damaging their unique qualities is the intro of a Borg Queen, created to have meaningful one-on-one dialog with Data and Picard. The concept of a queen ruling a hive is nothing new in science fiction, unfortunately; what always impressed me about the Borg before this was the lack of any central control - that is what really made them unique. But, enough with the negatives.Overall, the film is a blast. The first scene is a case study of how to begin a sf adventure - talk about transfixing an audience in the very first minute! The danger is that this first minute would overwhelm the rest of the film, but the script and first-time film director Frakes manage to provide a relentless pace for the remainder of the show, an almost non-stop action thrill ride to reflect the unstoppable nature of the enemy. Early on, we are thrown into the middle of a spectacular space battle (showing the Star Wars influence a bit more than the earlier movie Trek battles). It may be my favorite of any movie space wars, outdoing even the later Star Wars prequels. Of course, the filmmakers resorted to a time travel angle again (what is it with this obsession with time travel by Trek-makers since the eighties?), but they ended up selecting an interesting, pivotal moment in Trek history to wrap the story around - year 2063, to be precise. We are re-introduced to the famous Zefram Cochrane, the 'inventor' of warp drive, which resulted in the whole Starfleet\/Federation civilization we first saw on the original Trek series in the sixties (Cochrane was first seen as a different actor in the original episode Metamorphosis). I found the reinterpretation here of Cochrane bordering on cliché scripting - the re-used 'loser-turnaround-to-redeem-himself' plot; this type of story always makes me wonder how a guy who is out-of-his-mind drunk half the time manages to out-think all the clear-headed scientists. But, the bottom line is that it's an exciting, even thrilling storyline, with Stewart's best moments as the angry, yet in-charge, even ruthless Captain Picard. His scene with actress Woodard towards the end, when parallels are drawn again with Capt. Ahab and Moby Dick, is worth the price of admission by itself. Of the regulars, Sirtis as Troi, Dorn as Worf and Spiner as Data also get to shine in their scenes. There are also some entertaining cameos by characters from the other Trek series.

For me, it's not long enough. I wish it crossed the three hour mark just to stick it in the eye of all the movie's detractors about the movie's length.When they've crossed the finish line in Paris, I feel very happy being through such an enjoyable and hilarious adventure, but at the same time, I also feel sad that it's now over. Clearly the movie left it open-ended for a possible sequel after Professor Fate, feeling he had received a hollow victory, challenges the Great Leslie to another race -- Paris to New York. It's too bad this sequel never materialized.This movie is without doubt, my all-time favorite movie -- and I like a lot of movies! The reason I say this is my favorite is that it stands up to viewing after viewing after viewing and it has never lost my interest. If anything, it has grown even more to be my favorite since I can recite so many of its wonderful, classic lines before they're said -- sort of like fans do in the cult favorite The Rocky Horror Picture Show.The cast was perfect. I cannot imagine ANYONE else in these roles. Just as there is only one actor that IS Superman, Christopher Reeve, and only one actress that IS Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter, so too can no other actors and actresses, other than those cast in The Great Race, be imagined in these classic roles. Every single actor and actress in the movie delivered his performance spot-on! I enjoyed every minute of the movie.I think The Great Race is a true classic. The sets and locations are wonderful -- a visual feast! From the opening scene with that beautiful red, white and blue hot-air balloon, to the Wild West locations of the American Southwest, to Potzdorf's Prince Hapnik's sumptuous palace and grounds and Baron von Stuppe's menacing castle where he sword-fights Leslie, and finally to the streets of Paris -- all great visuals one will always remember, long after the movie is over.The costumes too, are a visual feast -- superb and sumptuous! One can really tell that they poured a lot of money into the costumes. It really shows that they definitely got their money's worth as to what ended up on the screen. The costumes of the Potzdorf nobles there at the Royal Ball when they waltz, is simply amazing. The uniforms of Potzdorf's guards too, look great. Let's not forget the great costumes back in Boracho -- from those sexy dancing showgirls in the saloon, singing It looks to me like a big night tonight, big night tonight. When the old cat's away, all the mice want to play! And it looks like a big night tonight! to Lilly Olay's sexy, form-fitted, yellow, satin dress as she sings, He Shouldn't A Hadn't A Oughtn't A Swang on Me (my favorite song in the movie. Thank you Johnny Mercer for your awesome lyrics in this song!) to all the rest of the town's residents in their authentic-looking and well-tailored Western outfits.The film clearly had masters in the arts and science of cinematography, production design, costume design, stunts and the great Henry Mancini for the movie's great and unforgettable score. It's a shame that this movie was not recognized at Oscar time, for its great achievements in all these categories.The Great Race is one very under-appreciated movie. It has the BEST pie fight scene in cinematic history; it has the BEST barroom brawl scene in cinematic history; it has one of the BEST sword-fighting scenes in cinematic history, and yet it never gets mentioned or alluded to in today's pop culture or even to be hailed by film critics as one of the greatest film comedies of all time.

The main reason I watched it is because a lot of my friends at school liked it, so I decided, what the hell? Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.I really appreciate the fact that Ten Things I Hate About You is, for the most part, a notch above most teen comedies. While its plot is cliché, it is lacking in gross-out\/scatological humor (there's some but not an excessive amount). I appreciate the comparatively intelligent humor, and the very well-written script and characters. I loved Patrick's song-and-dance number at the soccer practice - perhaps the funniest scene I've yet seen in a teen film - and Katrina's sparring with her English teacher (Daryl Mitchell) over Hemingway, Shakespeare, and related topics (I do similar things at school so I really appreciated that). The ties to The Taming of the Shrew didn't really catch my interest - I mean, you can only stay so faithful to Shakespeare in a modern-day high school setting, though I appreciated the effort.The big problem I usually have with teen comedies, past and present, is that I find it hard to relate to any of the characters. The American Pie films feature teens who obsessed with sex and nothing else. And while that subject is certainly on the minds of teens quite frequently, with school, college, extracurriculars, etc., it certainly isn't the ONLY thing we think about. (If American Pie was funny I'd be more willing to let that slide, but that's another review.) Even movies like The Breakfast Club and Footloose which feature less clichéd teenagers don't really engage me.However, with Ten Things, while I couldn't personally relate to any of the film's characters - I'm probably closest to Cameron, though the odds of my getting a girl like Bianca are slim to nil - I was able to sympathize with them, perhaps because they didn't spend the whole film ejaculating into a pie or talking about it afterward. They were all believable characters, and ones I can recognize from school. I've known many, many girls who are like Kat, and so hers was probably the most believable of all.The film's depiction of adults is not too bad, and that's always a plus for me. It's not a big deal, but I don't like the fact that most kid\/teen movies portray adults as martinets or idiots. Mr. Straford is strict and somewhat dorky, but at least we get to see he has his daughters' best interest at heart. And the characters of Mr. Morgan (Daryl Mitchell) the black militant English teacher and Ms. Perky (the always-wonderful Allison Janney), the sex-obsessed guidance counselor, provide amusing scenes, brief though their appearances are.The acting is not Paul Scofield holding a skull (to quote Roger Ebert), but it's good enough for the material. Julia Stiles creates a very believable character as Kat, a tough outsider who is at heart an insecure girl with inner demons to combat. Heath Ledger is also a standout as Patrick, the bad boy who's really not so bad. Larisa Oleynik, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Andrew Keegan, David Krumholz, Susan May Pratt and Gabrielle Union all create believable characters, though they're somewhat overshadowed by the leads.

Ten Things I Hate About You deserves credit for transcending the teen movie genre and just being a really pleasant and enjoyable film.
