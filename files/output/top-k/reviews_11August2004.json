Big full-color pictures of Keanu Reeves and Bridget Fonda smile back at me. My wife is charmed. I'm thinking disaster.But it's not a disaster. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not good or anything, but the cinematography and music are too good to be called a disaster. Plus, it's the story of Buddha himself - how bad can that be, even in such an abbreviated form?The only thing that makes the movie remotely watchable is the presence of real Tibetan monks in key roles. That and the sweeping shots of India and Bhutan.Of course, the great cinematography tries to hide a completely ill-advised script. It starts with a good idea - could an American child be the reincarnation of a key Tibetan monk? But the movie then really doesn't know what to do with itself. Is it the Greatest Story Every Told for Buddhism (Tibetan in particular)? Or is it a morality play, e.g., what would you do if two monks swept in out of nowhere and said your child was the reincarnation of a great Buddhist teacher?It would have best if the director stuck with one or the other. As a result, you get this sort of mess, where you get scenes like the child narrating the scene of Buddha's birth. The child actor reading the part clearly has no sense of what he's reading (nor would you want him to -- about the details about how the Prince's mother had to go into the woods to birth him). As a result, we disconnect. It can't be taken seriously.And, Keanu. The inarticulate surfer-dude himself as a divine figure. It's not the worst bit of miscasting in the history of cinema, but it's awful close. Making matters worse, he's frequently in the presence of real Indian actors, which only serve to make you even more aware of his inauthenticity. Seeing him butcher an Indian accent is just pure pain to watch -- curiously, since you'd think the 'goof factor' of seeing him do that would provide moments of inadvertent humor. But he's supposed to be delivering important lines. The only reason I can think of casting him in this role is during one scene in the movie, where he's in a deep trance, shutting out the visions of the daughters of the devil sent to tempt him from finding enlightenment. Yes, that vacant stare into space, his mind free of thoughts. That must have been why he was cast.It's not like casting dopey Bridget Fonda as the boy's mother and casting the monosyllabic Chris Issak as the boy's father were really bright ideas either. But it's truly hard to make a judgment on their acting ability because the script has given them nothing to do. You have this vague sense that Fonda has some undetermined career and Issak is an architect of some sort, and the kid - who in Seattle is never seen with any friends - is their son. And that's it. The characters are not developed anywhere beyond that.The kid, basically, doesn't act like any kid I have ever met. His only focus in life, and in this movie, is to read the story of Buddha with rapturous fascination. The parents, basically, don't act like any parents I've ever met. Send the kid off to Bhutan? Raise the questions about taking the kid out of school, going to a foreign country? Sure, why the heck not? It's a movie, right? Not my real son?Finally. Couldn't the director have put any humor in the movie at all? Just anything to alleviate the ponderous nature of so much of the film. He tries to do show some humor with kids playing together, with some success, but such moments are few and far between. Show the poor kid with some friends in his hometown.

The glowing red light above the doorway in which she enters, can be looked at differently in many ways. Perhaps I am looking into it too much, but that is what I do. I love film, and love all the underlying symbolism, even if it is not intentional. This film, however, lacks cinematography, and that is intentional. This is not a film that needs that, nor would it even be important. Cuckoo's charm lies in its character development and comedy. In no dramatic comedy have I ever seen such well crafted characters in the true comedic form.Randle Patrick McMurphy is a committer of sins, but we love him anyway. He has a back-story of statutory rape (though backed up with a considerable explanation), five counts of assault, and is lazy. Brought to a state mental institute for a study to determine if he is crazy, Mac encounters someone just like him who seems to be faking it also, who is Chief. Mac does not know this at first until gum is brought into the mix. From the beginning, Mac begins to communicate with all the others on his ward. His popularity with the fellow loonies is garnished through his indifference. They all give in to his charm like that fierce fish to bait on the end of Taber's line. He represents hope, in their little pathetic lives and gives them something to live for. They party, get drunk, go fishing, play basketball, and visualize a 1963 World Series.McMurphy absolutely despises the head nurse, and rightfully so. She is the disguised devil with her hair covering her horns; the one who assumes the position as the silent, antagonistic witch from hell. Symbolism of Ratched as the personification of evil is everywhere, just look for it. Fletcher takes this role in stride becoming one of the cinema's most well-known character villains. Her beliefs, up until the climax, determine the downfall of everything in the flick. So Fletcher succeeds in the viewer hating her. Good for her.To be honest, this film is Chief more than anybody. The traditional Indian-like theme song wreaks of him, and by that you can sense that he will be the culminating factor in the outcome of the film. Him and Mac develop themselves into acquaintances post-juicy fruit, and plan to break out and head to Canada. Nobody on the ward seems to notice that Chief has gone straight, which is kind of funny, since he is now smiling and carrying out friendly conversations with Mac. But nonetheless, it creates a flaw, which no great film can be without. Off topic, Mr. Bromden's escape makes for one of the greatest film endings ever.Much like two trademarks in the film, the flick is juicy fruit and at the same time peculiar we get a movie that is a strangely amazing. Lame analogy? Yes, perhaps, but it is true. That was my first impression of the film, and the reason why it is near the top of my list. Milos Forman's masterpiece, Douglas's greatest strive at an involved production, and Nicholson at his absolute peak. It is no wonder that this film swept 75' or why it still sweeps film-goers today. It is a rare blend that may never be matched in its own field. Through comedy, the breakthrough of this film is Taber and Harding's meaningless arguments. The therapy scene really stands out.

This is only good because it has forced QT to focus on the story and the relationships and not to some gimmicks like the three separate stories in Pulp Fiction or the huge battle scenes in Kill Bill vol. 1 (not to say of course that these movies aren't great too). Small cast and a simple setting in an abandoned warehouse bring the best up. Keitel and Roth are great and Madsen and Buscemi have the best roles in their whole career. And even the smallest roles are noteworthy; Stephen Wright as the bored DJ of K-BILLY always makes me smile. It has been said that this movie is not an important one because everything in it has been taken from another movie. You know, the color codes from Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, the set up from the Killing etc. But I disagree. If not else, this movie introduced the world what the new generation of movie-makers was capable of. The one, who has grown up watching old movies from TV. And of course every movie maker in the world can learn how QT makes the characters more human by making them have normal discussions about Pam Grier or Madonna's songs or tipping or anything like that, what we discuss every day or his choice of music. Normally music is suited to the movie to depict the emotions or to strenghen the scene or to earn more money with soundtrack albums that have new songs by hit artists like Jerry Bruckheimer does. On QT's soundtrack there is some old music from the 70's which was so out of fashion in 1992 as possible. But it works. The music choices are of course great and they also succeed in bringing up an eerie feeling when they are used in an improper scene. Like Stuck in the Middle with You in the ear-slicing scene.

I am also interested in seeing if Christopher Nolan and Christain Bale can make a film better than Burton's 1989 version.I believe to this day that Batman (1989) is the definitive version of Batman. The campy sixties show while humorous to watch today probably made Bob Kane turn over in his grave several times. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin probably made Bob want to rise from the grave and strangle anyone involved in those films-and they shouldn't be called films.First of all Tim Burton is one of the greatest Directors of all time. Some criticize him for being too quirky or relying too much on visuals. I argue that his style combines the fantastic, escapists kind of feel necessary in going to the movies, with the engrossing meaningful and artistic side that makes film-making a modern art. There is also no Director, not even Spielberg, who can make a scene scary, funny, romantic, sad, and exciting all at the same time. Edward Scissorhands is Burton's greatest triumph and there is no better example of his ability to combine all emotions into one or two shots.His seriousness and quirkiness create a world in Batman that combines every element that originally conceived the character. The first Batman comics were dark but still had somewhat of a campy feel to them. They were comics after all. Burton and Michael Keaton-who is the best Bruce Wayne\/Batman ever to grace any screen-effectively combine the campy elements of all comic book heroes with the deep, psychological issues that make Batman not only the most believable super hero, but the coolest and darkest super hero of all time. He is a real man who faces real problems. Batman (1989) shows this through Wayne's struggle with Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger-really the only weakness of the film)-and of course the constant torment of his parent's death. The other thing that makes Batman the greatest comic book hero is that it is actually important that no one learns his secret identity. No one cares if a twenty-year old loser freelance photographer is Spiderman. Spiderman 2 proved this when half of NY saw his face in the middle of the film, one of that movie's many ridiculous faults. And it really doesn't matter if a mild mannered reporter turns out to be Superman. But Bruce Wayne, a well known businessman who is the most admired face in Gotham, if it turned out that he was The Dark Knight that would not only devastate his personal life and career, it would shock the city and the world.And getting back to Superman, he's an alien who has all the powers in the world and only one weakness. I love Superman, but relating to a guy in a blue leotard who crumbles at the sight of a little green stone, and always fights for truth, justice, and the American way isn't the easiest thing in the world to relate to. I'd like to have all those powers, but I never will. I don't want to have some of the anger and loss that Batman does, but I always will. We all will and therefore we can all relate. Many who love comics love them because they want to have super powers and that's understandable but eventually that shallow desire will fade with age. Batman is a constant because he could exist if someone put the effort into it. And if one forgets how easy it is to relate to the character and just looks at the facts By day, he's a billionaire play boy who could have any woman he wants, by night, he's a dark avenger dressed in black who looms on every rooftop and stalks evil in every form all to drive his personal need for revenge-what's cooler than that?Well, I apologize for the rant. This should be a review of the movie. Burton gives us a dark world in Batman that comes right out of Kane's earliest comics and he also gives us the campy elements of random sword-wielding bad guys jumping over fences, thereby giving us a definitive Batman. But, even as we see thugs jumping out of places they couldn't possibly be, we are so engrossed in the world that we believe it, and who doesn't want to see Batman give a roundhouse to the jaw anyway.I've said enough. Batman (1989) will always be the best Batman film, except for maybe Batman Mask of the Phantasm, a movie based on The Animated Series that will never get the credit it deserves. Music, shots, acting, action, humor, drama, excellent writing, it's all there. It is the best comic book movie for one reason It's NOT a comic book movie. It's a drama that just so happens to have Batman as its main character and that makes it not only a great film, but also the perfect homage to the character.

We get romantic comedies, but those usually involve calling people the wrong name in bed. But epic romances a la Gone with the Wind are basically, um, gone with the wind. That is, before Richard Linklater came along. I'm not calling his Before Sunrise an epic romance by any means, but it's a nice, small romance that actually has believable characters in a believable circumstance. You can't really get that from a recent romance. What Linklater (and co-writer Kim Krizan) create is an engaging love story that, unfortunately, has never heard of too much of a good thing.Taking a train through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) starts talking with Celine (Julie Delpy). He convinces her to get off of the train in Vienna to spend his last European night with him. They wander around the town, talking about life, the universe, and everything, as the clock winds down, because Jesse has to catch a plane.Before Sunset, the sequel to Sunrise, has basically the same format. The conversations in both are very interesting and entertaining, but I'd say that Sunrise's conversations were more varied. Some were more interesting, some were less interesting, and some were mediocre. But it's the conversations that make both Befores such great movies. They let you get inside of the characters, realize what they're thinking and how much like real people they are. And not only is the dialogue entertaining, but it's thought-provoking and all natural. It all seems ad libbed, which it isn't, which finalizes the humanity and the true-to-life qualities of these people.But where the second one succeeded, the first one failed. The second came in at a quick 80 minutes, which was 80 minutes of dialogue shown in real time, creating a very intimate bond between the audience and the characters. In Sunrise, it's not in real time (which is okay, but not up to par with the sequel), which allowed unnecessary establishing shots to be put in. But what was the worst about this movie was its inability to end. Instead of doing something like the short 'n sweet 80 minutes of the second film, after 80 minutes is up, Sunrise isn't over yet! You've had enough of these characters and you want the movie to end (in a good way), but the movie keeps on chugging along. It goes on for 20 more minutes, and it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. Obviously, you should see this movie before the sequel, but I think it's safe to say that Sunset is the better movie overall.My rating 7\/10Rated R for language.

What Linklater (and co-writer Kim Krizan) create is an engaging love story that, unfortunately, has never heard of too much of a good thing.Taking a train through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) starts talking with Celine (Julie Delpy). He convinces her to get off of the train in Vienna to spend his last European night with him. They wander around the town, talking about life, the universe, and everything, as the clock winds down, because Jesse has to catch a plane.Before Sunset, the sequel to Sunrise, has basically the same format. The conversations in both are very interesting and entertaining, but I'd say that Sunrise's conversations were more varied. Some were more interesting, some were less interesting, and some were mediocre. But it's the conversations that make both Befores such great movies. They let you get inside of the characters, realize what they're thinking and how much like real people they are. And not only is the dialogue entertaining, but it's thought-provoking and all natural. It all seems ad libbed, which it isn't, which finalizes the humanity and the true-to-life qualities of these people.But where the second one succeeded, the first one failed. The second came in at a quick 80 minutes, which was 80 minutes of dialogue shown in real time, creating a very intimate bond between the audience and the characters. In Sunrise, it's not in real time (which is okay, but not up to par with the sequel), which allowed unnecessary establishing shots to be put in. But what was the worst about this movie was its inability to end. Instead of doing something like the short 'n sweet 80 minutes of the second film, after 80 minutes is up, Sunrise isn't over yet! You've had enough of these characters and you want the movie to end (in a good way), but the movie keeps on chugging along. It goes on for 20 more minutes, and it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. Obviously, you should see this movie before the sequel, but I think it's safe to say that Sunset is the better movie overall.My rating 7\/10Rated R for language.

HJO did a fantastic job, K Spacey and Angie D were provocative & delightful. HH just isn't a compelling BIG Screen presence - she has the same 6 facial moves in every role she gets, and they just don't always work. This 'mom' part is way too gritty for her - contrast that with Angie's incredible grit & tenacity in the Grandma part.The time-shifting written into the screenplay seems to be a distracting and unnecessary ploy, trying to make the story more mystical than it really is. And the score, if you can call it that, is truly vapid. A single 2 bar 6 beat phrase, beaten to death throughout the movie. Puh-leeeeeze.The idea of Pay It Forward is a great idea. Never gonna happen in the real world, but a nice gesture. The strong classroom scenes, and very convincing & fine work by HJO & Spacey are worth the time spent. During the 'setup' (first half or so of the story) it really seems like it will turn into a great movie. The characters are interesting enough, and the story is increasingly compelling.After that it just begins to unravel... too many scenes of 'mom' self-destructing and methodically over-(re)acting. If she's in this much constant crisis, how does she hold it together to work 2 jobs? Contrast that to the character flaws which develop in Spacey's role, actually drawing us into more curiosity & caring for him.The sub-plot of the reporter is injected using 'is this a time-shifting scene or not' so much that in itself it detracts from the story. Too obviously, in the end it becomes a false reward for the compassion & brilliance of the young hero.Finally, without giving a spoiler, the ending must be mentioned. It could've been written SO much better, and not have dumped ALL the momentum the film had developed. That 7th grade class could've done a superior re-write on this!

One agent (Hackman) is 'old school', sly, and knows his enemies a little too well.  The other (Dafoe) is a naive Kennedy fire-eater, ready to bring the full force of the FBI and military down upon this small town's head.

Even the famous scene was just Fonda lying on the floor looking stupid while Stanwyck tricks him into loving her.  In fact I can barely remember the context of her speech let alone any funny\/memorable lines from it (and i just watched the movie).  Now I realize that modern taste in comedy is a lot different from what was considered funny back then; but movies like Bringing up Baby most of the Marx Bros. films and Abbott and Costello are all funnier to me then this.  Fonda is especially bland and unfunny (oh wait, he's always bland and unfunny) in his role as the overly stupid wealthy bachelor.  He trips over stuff but has no funny lines and is vanilla as per usual.  Stanwyck is much better, and keeps things lively on her end.

Even the famous scene was just Fonda lying on the floor looking stupid while Stanwyck tricks him into loving her.  In fact I can barely remember the context of her speech let alone any funny\/memorable lines from it (and i just watched the movie).  Now I realize that modern taste in comedy is a lot different from what was considered funny back then; but movies like Bringing up Baby most of the Marx Bros. films and Abbott and Costello are all funnier to me then this.  Fonda is especially bland and unfunny (oh wait, he's always bland and unfunny) in his role as the overly stupid wealthy bachelor.  He trips over stuff but has no funny lines and is vanilla as per usual.  Stanwyck is much better, and keeps things lively on her end.  Also to the films credit the pace is quick and things move along.  The movie wasn't horrible or anything like that, but I don't see why this particular movie became as famous as it did in front of any of the hundreds and hundreds of other studio releases from the same time period.  If your video store still caries old vhs tapes why don't you try out this experiment...Rent The Lady Eve, and then rent like 3 other old comedies from the late 30s and early 40s.  Then ask yourself, does this movie standout from the others; and if so why?  If you answer yes, come back here and explain it to me, I'd love to know why.Zoopansick   ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"11 August 2004","score":"25 out of 32 people found the following review useful","review":"  In 1975, I was 11 years old.

At the time, he didn't have that many films under his belt, (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice) and he was still finding his footing as a director. But Burton managed to effectively recreate Gotham City from Bob Kane's original ideas rather than the campy 60's series, and put a forbidding, Gothic metropolis on screen.Gotham City is a town wracked with crime. Murderers and muggers are everywhere, and the police are run ragged trying to keep a lid on things. But there is something else in this city that is much more ominous. There are stories of a giant bat that appears out of nowhere, captures criminals, and disappears. This bat creature (who calls himself Batman) has come to the attention of Gotham Globe reporters Alexander Knox (Robert Whul) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger). They both believe there is a story behind the rumours.Hoping the chief of police Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) can provide some answers, they catch up with him at a charity ball hosted by billionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). Bruce is rather eccentric, and is quite taken with Vicki. But there is more to Bruce than meets the eye. He is the mysterious Batman. This begs the question, why would a billionaire dress up as a giant bat every night?On the criminal side of Gotham City, the crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) wants to get rid of his right hand man Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), who is having an affair with Grissom's mistress Alicia (Jerry Hall). He sends him to a chemical plant, then tips off the police. But Batman learns of the break-in, and tries to stop it, making himself public for the first time. But things go horribly wrong. Batman accidentally drops Jack into a vat of chemicals, and leads to the creation of a new menace, the Joker.With the acid giving him a permanent leering grin, green hair, and a twisted personality, the Joker intends to wreak a terrible vengeance on Gotham City. He invents a new substance called Smilex, which kills its victims, but leaves them with a permanent grin on their face like the Joker's. Batman is the only one who can put a stop to the Joker's reign of terror.Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as Batman\/Bruce Wayne. He gives a very convincing performance of a man who has to deal with duality (something Val Kilmer and George Clooney were never able to master). His actions throughout the film raise a lot of interesting questions. Is Batman on the side of good? Is he a vigilante willing to abuse his own power to satisfy his own ends? Is he psychotic? These are all questions that are never completely answered, but the possible answers are hinted at, and the audience is forced to come up with their own conclusions. One thing is certain, he is a lot more like the Joker than he is willing to admit.Jack Nicholson is over the top as the Joker, but he manages to be an impressive screen presence. There are some intriguing aspects to his character too. He doesn't think of himself as a murderer, but as an artist. He transforms people into (un)living works of art. But his art is so ghastly, that you really see how psychotic he is. He even seems genuinely hurt that the people of Gotham City regard him as a madman, when he believes Batman is the real maniac. The truth is, I'm not so sure he's wrong. After all, Batman is the one who unleashed the Joker on the city. All the people that have died are on his head too.As the film progresses, we learn why Bruce Wayne became Batman. When he was a child, his parents were gunned down right in front of him. This is obviously a vengeance crusade for him, even though he is not ready to admit it to himself. It is always interesting to see whether he will step over the line into complete and utter madness.Although action films are not Tim Burton's field, the action scenes are well handled. They're even artistically done. Cool! The Batmobile is stunning to look at, as is the Batcave, which is as dark as Bruce's own personality. Burton's vision of Gotham City as a twisted, hulking, menacing Halloweenesque town is very impressive. He was definitely more suited to the series instead of Joel Schumacher.Bruce's relationship with Vicki is not that interesting, and they don't have great chemistry (compare it to Keaton and Michelle Pfeiffer, no contest). She is pretty much a screamer and is just the token love interest. The film could have done just as easily without her.Michael Gough is very good as Alfred, and his surrogate father relationship with Bruce is great to watch. Sometimes it seems he is the only one who has a clear insight of what is going on in the world that makes up Bruce's troubled mind.The final confrontation between Batman and the Joker is fairly reminiscent of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Batman's instability really comes to the fore here, and is ably matched by the Joker's. The death of the Joker is very spooky, because it almost seems he is laughing at the world from beyond the grave. That is a death artistic enough that even the Joker himself would approve.The first of the franchise, and when the series was still decent. Its a shame Tim Burton was eventually replaced as director, because his vision was too dark for some. But I think his vision was perfectly suited for bringing the surrealistic, Gothic world of Batman to life. Burton permanently carved out a niche for himself as one of Hollywood's most distinctive, and visually striking filmmakers.Terrific stuff.

Murderers and muggers are everywhere, and the police are run ragged trying to keep a lid on things. But there is something else in this city that is much more ominous. There are stories of a giant bat that appears out of nowhere, captures criminals, and disappears. This bat creature (who calls himself Batman) has come to the attention of Gotham Globe reporters Alexander Knox (Robert Whul) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger). They both believe there is a story behind the rumours.Hoping the chief of police Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) can provide some answers, they catch up with him at a charity ball hosted by billionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). Bruce is rather eccentric, and is quite taken with Vicki. But there is more to Bruce than meets the eye. He is the mysterious Batman. This begs the question, why would a billionaire dress up as a giant bat every night?On the criminal side of Gotham City, the crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) wants to get rid of his right hand man Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), who is having an affair with Grissom's mistress Alicia (Jerry Hall). He sends him to a chemical plant, then tips off the police. But Batman learns of the break-in, and tries to stop it, making himself public for the first time. But things go horribly wrong. Batman accidentally drops Jack into a vat of chemicals, and leads to the creation of a new menace, the Joker.With the acid giving him a permanent leering grin, green hair, and a twisted personality, the Joker intends to wreak a terrible vengeance on Gotham City. He invents a new substance called Smilex, which kills its victims, but leaves them with a permanent grin on their face like the Joker's. Batman is the only one who can put a stop to the Joker's reign of terror.Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as Batman\/Bruce Wayne. He gives a very convincing performance of a man who has to deal with duality (something Val Kilmer and George Clooney were never able to master). His actions throughout the film raise a lot of interesting questions. Is Batman on the side of good? Is he a vigilante willing to abuse his own power to satisfy his own ends? Is he psychotic? These are all questions that are never completely answered, but the possible answers are hinted at, and the audience is forced to come up with their own conclusions. One thing is certain, he is a lot more like the Joker than he is willing to admit.Jack Nicholson is over the top as the Joker, but he manages to be an impressive screen presence. There are some intriguing aspects to his character too. He doesn't think of himself as a murderer, but as an artist. He transforms people into (un)living works of art. But his art is so ghastly, that you really see how psychotic he is. He even seems genuinely hurt that the people of Gotham City regard him as a madman, when he believes Batman is the real maniac. The truth is, I'm not so sure he's wrong. After all, Batman is the one who unleashed the Joker on the city. All the people that have died are on his head too.As the film progresses, we learn why Bruce Wayne became Batman. When he was a child, his parents were gunned down right in front of him. This is obviously a vengeance crusade for him, even though he is not ready to admit it to himself. It is always interesting to see whether he will step over the line into complete and utter madness.Although action films are not Tim Burton's field, the action scenes are well handled. They're even artistically done. Cool! The Batmobile is stunning to look at, as is the Batcave, which is as dark as Bruce's own personality. Burton's vision of Gotham City as a twisted, hulking, menacing Halloweenesque town is very impressive. He was definitely more suited to the series instead of Joel Schumacher.Bruce's relationship with Vicki is not that interesting, and they don't have great chemistry (compare it to Keaton and Michelle Pfeiffer, no contest). She is pretty much a screamer and is just the token love interest. The film could have done just as easily without her.Michael Gough is very good as Alfred, and his surrogate father relationship with Bruce is great to watch. Sometimes it seems he is the only one who has a clear insight of what is going on in the world that makes up Bruce's troubled mind.The final confrontation between Batman and the Joker is fairly reminiscent of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Batman's instability really comes to the fore here, and is ably matched by the Joker's. The death of the Joker is very spooky, because it almost seems he is laughing at the world from beyond the grave. That is a death artistic enough that even the Joker himself would approve.The first of the franchise, and when the series was still decent. Its a shame Tim Burton was eventually replaced as director, because his vision was too dark for some. But I think his vision was perfectly suited for bringing the surrealistic, Gothic world of Batman to life. Burton permanently carved out a niche for himself as one of Hollywood's most distinctive, and visually striking filmmakers.Terrific stuff.

I liked this film mainly because I liked the book. The acting is very good, especially Harvey Keitel, Mekhi Phifer, Delroy Lindo, and Keith David but several details from the book were missing.The book and movie are very similar, you get a sense right away when reading the book that Harvey Keitel is Detective Klein. You get a feeling that Rodney can be played by Samuel L. Jackson, but Delroy Lindo who is known for playing a gangster performs very well. You also sense Mekhi Phifer as Strike. The main differences are that all of Strike's crew have different names and they deal more with some other gangs in town. There is a shootout against a Puerto Rican crew which is completely ignored in the movie. Also the whole concept of playing with Trains is something completely new. However I think Spike Lee did well in using the trains to portray Strike's humanity a little bit better. The book does a much better job describing Strike's frustrations and resentment over his life and his current position in life. Finally the book takes place in New Jersey while the movie takes place in Brooklyn. I feel this move was actually good it not only gave the audience a more familiar setting but because Scorsese and Lee both are much better adept to Brooklyn than many of directors.On to what was done right. First and foremost Harvey Keitel pulled off a performance as Detective Rocco Klein that no other actor could have pulled off. You get a sense the whole time that it's an easy natural role for him. Pulp Fiction was an act for him, Clockers was not. He seemed to do very well throughout the film, especially the parts where he is pressing Strike for information. John Turtorro does a good job as Rocco's partner Mazilli. After seeing him in other Spike Lee movies, it is almost no surprise to me that he would fall into the role of Mazilli. One performance that I thought was done really well was Keith David's role as Andre The Giant. He played a community-oriented Black Police Officer who was one of the few cops out there that really cared for this particular Black Community. Spike Lee directs most of the White Cops as he does in all of his movies, for the most part not giving one damn either way about Black People. His portrayal of Andre was critical mainly because the audience needed a sense that Cops were actually interested in helping the community. Andre is the type of Cop every Black Community wants. He is caring, supportive, unabusive, protective, and tough on the real criminals. He is the only officer who can successfully date one of the kid's moms (Tyrone's mom) and not even have the drug dealers view her is traitor. In the book, Andre is much bigger so I thought at first someone like Ving Rhames or Michael Clarke Duncan would play Andre based on size, but Keith David was a much better actor to play this particular role. This movie was a perfect way for Mekhi Phifer to begin acting. This role defines him through many of his other movies and there was no better place for him to start out than in a ghetto drama such as this. Delroy Lindo gave the second best performance of the movie. Seeing Malcolm X; Blood In, Blood Out; and Romeo must die, I knew he'd be perfect for the role of Rodney. Like Keitel, he seems really natural at his role especially when he gives Strike the speech about what Crack Cocaine will do to someone. His whole attitude as Rodney is perfect being an uncaring, relentless, intelligent drug dealer who ran this particular set of projects. Isaiah Washington did well as Victor but I think he wasn't the only one who could have played Victor. He was believable as a working class citizen trying to leave the projects but he didn't stick out naturally like Keitel or Lindo. Michael Imperioli (Chris from The Sopranos) had a nice contribution to the movie too playing the crooked Detective JoJo. I couldn't stop laughing when he told the kids from Connecticut about 12 baboons in a cage calling you Mary all night long for refusing to give up the drugs they came to buy. He was a little foul mouthed at times and insensitive like in his speech about Dinkins being out and Guiliani being in, but he contributed a nice minor performance. Overall the acting was very good and too natural for some of the people performing.Overall, I liked the story because it is a true description over the crack dealing that goes on in inner city America. I think the movie could have easily been an hour longer but in the condensed time frame, it did what it could. I think it was good for Lee to display people who dealt drugs only to go somewhere better in life and to display the damage that crack does to people. Unlike Do The Right Thing and Jungle Fever, I think Lee did a better, more realistic display of the relationship between the Police and the Black Community during this day and age. In those two movies he shows two stereotypical White Italian Cops who actually play the same role in each movie (Rick Aiello and Miguel Sandoval as Officers Long and Ponte) who are quick to beat up and slow to control themselves against Alleged Black Criminals who get treatment worse than they deserved (Flipper Purify gets a gun to his head for friendly roughhousing and Radio Raheem gets purposefully strangled to death). In this movie, he shows a Black Cop who cares, some White Cops who are beat out by what goes on in violent neighborhoods and who start to care when someone they think is innocent is going to be sent to jail. I do think the added line by Mekhi Phifer about cops not caring over Black on Black violence was needed because it is the way that most of Black America really feels about Policing. Overall it was well acted but poorly directed for the quality of actors and directors in the film, 7\/10.

Isaiah Washington did well as Victor but I think he wasn't the only one who could have played Victor. He was believable as a working class citizen trying to leave the projects but he didn't stick out naturally like Keitel or Lindo. Michael Imperioli (Chris from The Sopranos) had a nice contribution to the movie too playing the crooked Detective JoJo. I couldn't stop laughing when he told the kids from Connecticut about 12 baboons in a cage calling you Mary all night long for refusing to give up the drugs they came to buy. He was a little foul mouthed at times and insensitive like in his speech about Dinkins being out and Guiliani being in, but he contributed a nice minor performance. Overall the acting was very good and too natural for some of the people performing.Overall, I liked the story because it is a true description over the crack dealing that goes on in inner city America. I think the movie could have easily been an hour longer but in the condensed time frame, it did what it could. I think it was good for Lee to display people who dealt drugs only to go somewhere better in life and to display the damage that crack does to people. Unlike Do The Right Thing and Jungle Fever, I think Lee did a better, more realistic display of the relationship between the Police and the Black Community during this day and age. In those two movies he shows two stereotypical White Italian Cops who actually play the same role in each movie (Rick Aiello and Miguel Sandoval as Officers Long and Ponte) who are quick to beat up and slow to control themselves against Alleged Black Criminals who get treatment worse than they deserved (Flipper Purify gets a gun to his head for friendly roughhousing and Radio Raheem gets purposefully strangled to death). In this movie, he shows a Black Cop who cares, some White Cops who are beat out by what goes on in violent neighborhoods and who start to care when someone they think is innocent is going to be sent to jail. I do think the added line by Mekhi Phifer about cops not caring over Black on Black violence was needed because it is the way that most of Black America really feels about Policing. Overall it was well acted but poorly directed for the quality of actors and directors in the film, 7\/10.  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"11 August 2004","score":"","review":"  I usually like Spike Lee films, but with Scorsese, one of the greatest movie directors of all time working beside him, the directing could have been much better. I liked this film mainly because I liked the book. The acting is very good, especially Harvey Keitel, Mekhi Phifer, Delroy Lindo, and Keith David but several details from the book were missing.The book and movie are very similar, you get a sense right away when reading the book that Harvey Keitel is Detective Klein. You get a feeling that Rodney can be played by Samuel L. Jackson, but Delroy Lindo who is known for playing a gangster performs very well. You also sense Mekhi Phifer as Strike. The main differences are that all of Strike's crew have different names and they deal more with some other gangs in town. There is a shootout against a Puerto Rican crew which is completely ignored in the movie. Also the whole concept of playing with Trains is something completely new. However I think Spike Lee did well in using the trains to portray Strike's humanity a little bit better. The book does a much better job describing Strike's frustrations and resentment over his life and his current position in life. Finally the book takes place in New Jersey while the movie takes place in Brooklyn. I feel this move was actually good it not only gave the audience a more familiar setting but because Scorsese and Lee both are much better adept to Brooklyn than many of directors.On to what was done right. First and foremost Harvey Keitel pulled off a performance as Detective Rocco Klein that no other actor could have pulled off. You get a sense the whole time that it's an easy natural role for him. Pulp Fiction was an act for him, Clockers was not. He seemed to do very well throughout the film, especially the parts where he is pressing Strike for information. John Turtorro does a good job as Rocco's partner Mazilli. After seeing him in other Spike Lee movies, it is almost no surprise to me that he would fall into the role of Mazilli. One performance that I thought was done really well was Keith David's role as Andre The Giant. He played a community-oriented Black Police Officer who was one of the few cops out there that really cared for this particular Black Community. Spike Lee directs most of the White Cops as he does in all of his movies, for the most part not giving one damn either way about Black People. His portrayal of Andre was critical mainly because the audience needed a sense that Cops were actually interested in helping the community. Andre is the type of Cop every Black Community wants. He is caring, supportive, unabusive, protective, and tough on the real criminals. He is the only officer who can successfully date one of the kid's moms (Tyrone's mom) and not even have the drug dealers view her is traitor. In the book, Andre is much bigger so I thought at first someone like Ving Rhames or Michael Clarke Duncan would play Andre based on size, but Keith David was a much better actor to play this particular role. This movie was a perfect way for Mekhi Phifer to begin acting. This role defines him through many of his other movies and there was no better place for him to start out than in a ghetto drama such as this. Delroy Lindo gave the second best performance of the movie. Seeing Malcolm X; Blood In, Blood Out; and Romeo must die, I knew he'd be perfect for the role of Rodney. Like Keitel, he seems really natural at his role especially when he gives Strike the speech about what Crack Cocaine will do to someone.
