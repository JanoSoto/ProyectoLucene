Indie Directors may work quite closely with a script-writer of their choice right from the start and this gives the procedure a better chance of ultimate success; but too often the storyline for a book that one may read over a period of days or weeks is almost incompatible with the requirements of a two hour movie. Charlie Kaufman was a script writer who learned this the hard way, and who has since become respected by cinema-goers throughout the world for the very challenging original scripts that he has created. Human Nature was the second of these; but to better appreciate its unusual structure and meaning, it is helpful to first take a birds eye look at what his works are typically about. He learned his trade working for television, often episodes of established serials, and then amazed the cinema world by writing a new and very different script which became the enormously successful film Being John Malkovich. This was so bizarre that it is almost impossible to describe before it has been viewed, but essentially it features the concept of a number of different individuals sharing the same personality simultaneously. I am amazed (although very grateful) that it was able to attract investors and actually reach the screen. Its success showed there is an unsatisfied demand for films which make us think deeply about our own nature, and it helped Kaufman to write and co-produce Human Nature (2001). This perhaps remains his most ambitious film, and is the first I am commenting on for IMDb, but a overview of all his works remains helpful when considering any Kaufman film. 1992 brought a semi-autobiographical film in which he clearly outlined his approach to preparing a film-script. Columbia had film rights to Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief and had commissioned him to prepare a film-script. After months of work he was convinced this lengthy and rambling book could not be effectively condensed into the span of a movie. With considerable trepidation he submitted a fictional script based on his struggle to create a work of art, but contrasting this with that of an imaginary twin brother who became rich by shamelessly churning out scripts for stereotyped action thrillers. To his relief this script was accepted and became the film Adaption in which Kaufman explores the conflict so many experience between artistic, commercial or scientific integrity and financial gain. By this stage he had gained a cult reputation for scripts which examined what it was in human nature that could sometimes raise humanity above, and sometimes force it below, the level of other animals. His later films, including Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which examines the implications of an ability to selectively erase specific memories) or Synecdoche, New York (with many targets including formal religion and the need to exploit every chance for personal fulfilment during life) have only added to this. Cinema-goers may love his films or hate them, but few will remain indifferent.To those who have not seen any of his films the only sensible recommendation is -Try one. This lengthy introduction should give some idea what to expect. The most conventional is probably Adaption but I would suggest Human Nature because, whilst not the most profound, it is among the most comprehensive in its chosen targets and yet it does not seem overloaded or obtuse, also it includes a great deal of deliberate comedy which maintains both interest and enjoyment. The story involves a young woman, unhappy with her hirsute appearance, who abandons society and reverts to nature; but also writes a very successful book about her experiences which finances her to return to have her problem corrected.. She then becomes mutually attracted to a nerdish repressed scientist struggling to teach mice good manners. On a field trip they encounter a youth brought up in the forest as an ape by a father who threw up a good job in order to revert to nature. They take him back to the laboratory too see how easy it will be to teach him normal human manners. Much of the film is devoted to the strong pulls he experiences both towards his new cultured life and back to his previous uncontrolled environment. These of course become particularly severe when he becomes involved with young women. Such sequences bring out a favourite Kaufman theme - the necessity for personal fulfilment if one is to avoid mental breakdown.This summary does little to explain the charm of the film, but to say much more would spoil it. It discusses a wider range of issues than most of his works, has an easy to follow story and is full of very amusing sequences; so I would have expected it to be the most popular. Instead it's IMDb rating (currently 6.9) is lowest. I cannot help wondering why; but Patricia Arquette as Lila (the hirsute young lady hero) displayed her unusual although not unattractive fur covering during several of the earlier sequences in the forest, explaining why it is R rated only in US theatres, so we can suspect the widespread North American distrust of any displays of nudity in films. Maybe there are other reasons that I did not notice, but I would be interested to know if it was also less successful in Europe where nudity is less of a concern.One big question remains How many other script-writers have also created outstanding stand-alone scripts they have never been able to bring into production?

Ang Lee had mentioned quite a few times that he wanted to make a Wu Xia film, and I don't see why he shouldn't, it sounds like a very interesting scenario that would definitely attract some audiences. Finally he followed through with it in the year 2000 and received immaculate results from both Chinese and American viewers. It went on to being nominated for 10 Academy awards, coming out victorious in four categories including Best Foreign Language Film.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a wonderful experience with excellent production qualities and a near perfect line up of Chinese actors. There's so much to like about this film that it makes it almost impossible to deny its brilliance.Crouching Tiger is a story of passion, revenge, tradition and above all things, love powered by three main characters. Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien are two warriors and long time friend's that both have deep feelings for each other, but past and current events keep them from admitting their true feelings. Jen Yu is the young governor's daughter who is unsure of where or who her heart and loyalty lies with, her master, her love, or herself. Jen seems like a confused mind. She makes rash decisions and jumps from place to place with no real intentions, which is actually something I noticed in a lot of the characters in this movie. The decisions they make don't seem to keep within their character very often and their intentions are seen as unclear throughout most of the film. The story progresses somewhat aimlessly making it difficult to appreciate, never the less it doesn't stop the story from taking toll with the themes nor does it lower interest in the invigoratingly romantic scenes and the oddly appealing conflicted relationships between characters.Like I said, it's really hard not to like this movie. There so much to offer that it stages out all possible criticisms and eliminates any doubt that it will appeal to audiences of all kinds. Like for example if your one of those action folk that are not really into the touchy, feely love story, no worries, your needs will be satisfied with Crouching Tiger. The martial arts choreography is kick-ass fantastic that matches some of the best Matrix inspired films, and while I found the wire-work in this movie to be way to obvious it was nice to see an action flick that wasn't ruled by visual editing, I guess that's Ang Lee's take on traditional Wu Xia film making. He takes us back to a time where we didn't have advanced computer programs to distract people from the decreasing population of good storytellers. Mr Lee proved himself to be a good storyteller for that very reason and I applaud him for it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is in my opinion Ang Lee's best achievement ever.

There are some major plot holes, most characters are caricatures and the acting isn't the best around, but if you manage to ignore this there is a lot to like about this film.Being raised in a Flemish labor class family, my cultural background is very much like that of the two main characters. As such, I found the motivations, the philosophy, the personalities and humor of the main characters very recognizable and very appealing. I suspect this may also be a major reason why there are so many haters. If you do not have any affinity with Irish labor class culture or mentality, then you may just not get it. I'm not saying you must be a factory worker to like this film, though. My own job is programming web applications.Then there's the visuals. Duffy opted for a non-linear way of telling his story that with a unique combination of fast-paced action, some experimental editing and a matching music score. While Pulp Fiction undoubtedly inspired Duffy's style, it's still far too different from Tarantino's typical style or anything else I've ever seen to be considered a rip-off. Tarantino based his own style on the dozens of films from the '70s he saw as a teenager, but does that make Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction any less original or unique?Most of all, though, The Boondock Saints is just fun. Invite some of your friends over, grab a few beers and just enjoy the fact-paced action, the sometimes very foul-mouthed or very dark humor and debate with your friends whether you'd think it would be a blessing or a curse if The Boondock Saints were actually real and not just a story made up by Duffy.

I'm most definitely among the lovers out there and the reason for this is simple  out of all action films I've ever seen, The Boondock Saints seemed the most entertaining, the most visually appealing, the most original and the funniest to me.Sure, The Boondock Saints is no Citizen Kane, but that's something I never expected in the first place. There are some major plot holes, most characters are caricatures and the acting isn't the best around, but if you manage to ignore this there is a lot to like about this film.Being raised in a Flemish labor class family, my cultural background is very much like that of the two main characters. As such, I found the motivations, the philosophy, the personalities and humor of the main characters very recognizable and very appealing. I suspect this may also be a major reason why there are so many haters. If you do not have any affinity with Irish labor class culture or mentality, then you may just not get it. I'm not saying you must be a factory worker to like this film, though. My own job is programming web applications.Then there's the visuals. Duffy opted for a non-linear way of telling his story that with a unique combination of fast-paced action, some experimental editing and a matching music score. While Pulp Fiction undoubtedly inspired Duffy's style, it's still far too different from Tarantino's typical style or anything else I've ever seen to be considered a rip-off. Tarantino based his own style on the dozens of films from the '70s he saw as a teenager, but does that make Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction any less original or unique?Most of all, though, The Boondock Saints is just fun. Invite some of your friends over, grab a few beers and just enjoy the fact-paced action, the sometimes very foul-mouthed or very dark humor and debate with your friends whether you'd think it would be a blessing or a curse if The Boondock Saints were actually real and not just a story made up by Duffy. For me, that's the perfect setting for a film like this.

Anyway ghost tells the story of a manhatten yuppie couple Sam wheat(Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jensen(Demi Moore) who have just moved into a fancy apartment and wanna spend the rest of there lives together. There is that classic love pottery scene I was talking about where Sam and molly really show how much they love each other while the classic tune unchained melody by the righteous brothers plays on the disc jockey. Sam works at a bank along with his friend Carl bruner(Tony Goldwyn) and Sam notices something fishy going on at the bank when Sam discovers too much money is magically appearing in his accounts. Sam Molly are walking home from a movie later that night until a man Willy Lopez(Rick aviles) approaches them with a gun and asks Sam for his wallet and they fight and the gun goes off and shoots Sam. Sam can be seen running down the street but it's his ghost as he looks down at his dead body. Molly is saddened deeply by his death and later Sam's ghost sees his killer break into there apartment to look for Sam's wallet. Sam then teams up with a psychic lady Oda Mae brown(Whoopi Goldberg) to help him connect with molly to warn her that she's in danger from a similar fate. Soon Sam finds out that his so called friend Carl was behind Sam's murder all along and that he hired Willy to steal his wallet which had the mac code for Sam's account. Sam cannot move things and watches in disgust while Carl hits on Molly. Sam then turns to another ghost who haunts the subways of new york and is able to touch things and Sam ask's for his help and eventually learns to move things with his mind. Sam then takes Oda Mae to pose as a a fake customer by the name of Rita miller to close the account that Carl was supposed to get four million dollars. The bad guys then soon come after Molly and Oda Mae and Sam has to protect them and both bad guys end up dead and taken to hell and finally Sam gets one last moment with his beloved one before going to heaven.One of my most favorite movies of all time it is a mixture of romance, action, comedy, and thriller. Patrick swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg all give brilliant performances. Tony Goldwyn and Rick aviles were also terrific as the villains of this story. Classic movie and highly recommend it for everyone.

To be honest I didn't know the kind of film it was so I was expecting something more (anything,at least!!), and having George Kennedy and Richard Crenna leading the cast made me have some expectations.I'm not too keen on terror films and that's the perfect movie to reinforce me or anybody in that opinion. That's the kind of movie that keeps average terror cinema quality well below minimums.Well... maybe if you are one of those terror-film fans looking avidly for some cheap crap to worship as Cult Masterpiece no matter the ultra-low quality of every single aspect of the film this is the flick for you; if you are in the other 99.99% of the human race and are expecting for at least a minimum level of quality then you'll find this film is a real insult to Cinema and to the intelligence of the spectator.I'd like to comment the negative aspects of the film but as I said EVERYTHING is just appalling and done carelessly From the minimal and unnatural dialogues, reactions and actions of the void characters to the Ed Wood-like sea scenes made against a still of the ship. The cruiser the characters are supposed to be on in the beginning is not seen in any moment from the outside!!, not even when it is sinking!!, except for a few distant lights in a night shot that could be anything. The whole part of the pleasure cruiser sinking is specially bad and confusing... the sinking is not seen AT ALL, just the ship collides (well, that's what we're told at least) and the next moment they are in a life raft in the middle of nowhere, apparently next morning because it's clear sunlight, and then the captain is found underwater - has he stayed there the whole night or what?? Then after being adrift for some hours... ta-dam! they're EXACTLY where the big still picture of the mysterious ship is in the background.

FOR GODS SAKES! What is at stake here is Satre's principle (people are hell). You are my hell. Even when you do what I want you to.. you are my hell. Does man really enjoy suffering? Do YOU... ENJOY.. SUFFERING? Are you ever really satisfied with what you have? Oh yeah? for how long. I see in this movie gobs of really powerful principles at work. LOVE Isn't ENOUGH! I hate to, and am unable to admit I really need you! GOOD GOD MAN! This movie is an exploration into SELF via these two vessel SELVES -> Marvin and the jap guy. I mean I want to scream at the jap and tell him GET REAL WILL YOU? STOP PLAY ACTING! CANT YOU ACT NORMAL! I want to scream at the religious fanatic clowns of this world and tell them the same. GET REAL! STOP PLAY ACTING! Cant you see you're living a role assigned to you by some very rich people that are making a living off of your sweat? and I hate you because you don't see it!!! But how do I wake you up? We live in a society where the people who do the least work make the most money. NO! I Don't NEED SCHOOLING TO KNOW WHAT INSANITY IS. And then as George Carlin put it so aptly my god has a bigger stick than your god.. which translates to.. Im right you're wrong therefore kindly do what i want you to. But these are power plays.. and roles assigned to US by others like cheap clothes. Yeah.. those clothes you're wearing right now. Oh Mister King.. your erpidermus is showing. The king who wore no clothes. YEAH.. I SPELL EPIDERMIS-- ERPIDERMUS.Question is.. what do to about it? And so men go to war for a wealthy few who can pay there way out of war. A long time ago.. you could bribe a priest, rabbi, guru whatever... to give you holy passage clear to the next life.. AND problem is YOU STILL CAN TODAY!!!! Its called a democracy, a monarchy, a 3rd world.. its all the same. POWER PLAYS. I power play you because I don't want to face the self in me that id rather not see. This is what is written in invisible ink here my friends.. right here in this movie. Its here.. it really is ring a bell? This is what is written between the lines.. the words that are not spoken and yet.. are spoken here.Here we see our relationship with our self and our relationship with our other self.. YOU. PEOPLE. You who are a part of me.. (you who read this) and from whom I cannot escape nor would I want to. Sooner or later, in this life or the next, we will be here again on this island. You and me.. and we will war.. you and I.So.. what do two men do, who find themselves alone on an island? do? See those quotation marks.. take a good look at that. So there you are, you're with yourself and with your inevitable other self... other people. HELL IN THE PACIFIC IS EVERYDAY LIFE.. IT IS HAPPENING NOW. YOU ARE ON THAT ISLAND M'FRIEND.. AND IM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU JUST WAITING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL OR YOU MINE. But wait.. little lord Bush.. and he's really gonna make our lifes hell.. oh gee I just love to suffer! WHATS THAT?? oH M'GOD.. Our Lord King George Bush (who by fraudelent means stole the presidency from al gore.. yeah him) has now transmorphed into Lord King Obama! (a.k.a. oh hell they won't mind my fake birth cerificate obama baby) hmm interesting trick! Great THEATRICS. HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

How many actresses would kill for a star vehicle like this? How many actresses have been able to build entire careers on a breakthrough romantic comedy? This was Janeane Garfolo's shot, her ship had come in, her time had arrived&#x85;and I sincerely hope that after she finished shooting The Matchmaker, she tracked down each and every single person responsible for making this film and beat them all like rented stepchildren.Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems.1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town.2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love.I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the big city of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career.Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet.This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities.It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen.You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her.Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made.

Released theatrically only four months after the original Missing in Action in the US I can see why the producers switched the films around, while I wouldn't say there's a huge difference the original is slightly better. There's a lot of predictable clichés going on here, from the evil Vietnamese General to the tough US soldier who stands up to everything thrown at him, the first hour is just General Yin torturing Braddock in order to try & get him to sign a war crimes confession (the details of the war crimes that Braddock was supposed to have committed are never revealed despite the whole plot revolving around it) while the last half an hour is the all American hero victory against the enemy as Braddock totally obliterates the camp & all the bad guy's which is a clear attempt at a political statement by saying how great & morally strong the US is as it stands up for good against the evils of the world. Unintentionally quite funny at times Missing in Action 2 The Beginning is quite fun on a mindless level, it moves along at a decent pace & there's just about enough going on to sustain ones interest. Take it for what it is & don't expect a masterpiece then Missing in Action 2 The Beginning is a reasonable time waster but little else.The action is competent but nothing special, the explosions & shoot-outs are OK but I have seen better. There are one or two funny aspects to Missing in Action 2 The Beginning though, Braddock's US army issue uniform he is captured in seems to be holding up surprisingly well after ten years of imprisonment in a POW camp & why do the Vietnamese guard the only rope & wood bridge across the mountain with a huge flamethrower? Surely the Vietnamese need to cross it so it being set on fire & burnt with a flamethrower isn't going to help anyone? Why not just put a guy with a machine gun there? Then there's the classic scene with Chuck Norris hanging upside down from a tree, General Yin orders his men to put a big Rat inside a bag & stick it under Chuck's head which they do. After a struggle & lots of squeaking & thrashing about blood seeps through the bad & it is removed only to show Chuck Norris unhurt with the now dead Rat in his mouth! A scene that needs to be seen, it really is quite funny even though it's definitely not meant to be.Filmed in Mexico the lush green jungle locations look nice, the action is alright but again like the original Missing in Action a little bit wimpy, why when Chuck Norris throw's a grenade into a wooden hut at the end & it goes off does the hut not even catch fire? With a supposed budget of about $2,500,000 like the original this has decent production values & one feels it was made to cash-in on Rambo. The acting is bad, Chuck Norris can't act & that's all that needs to be said.Missing in Action 2 The Beginning was indeed meant to be the beginning & be released before the original but as it stands it's good for a few laughs & some nice jungle scenery but little else.

Unintentionally quite funny at times Missing in Action 2 The Beginning is quite fun on a mindless level, it moves along at a decent pace & there's just about enough going on to sustain ones interest. Take it for what it is & don't expect a masterpiece then Missing in Action 2 The Beginning is a reasonable time waster but little else.The action is competent but nothing special, the explosions & shoot-outs are OK but I have seen better. There are one or two funny aspects to Missing in Action 2 The Beginning though, Braddock's US army issue uniform he is captured in seems to be holding up surprisingly well after ten years of imprisonment in a POW camp & why do the Vietnamese guard the only rope & wood bridge across the mountain with a huge flamethrower? Surely the Vietnamese need to cross it so it being set on fire & burnt with a flamethrower isn't going to help anyone? Why not just put a guy with a machine gun there? Then there's the classic scene with Chuck Norris hanging upside down from a tree, General Yin orders his men to put a big Rat inside a bag & stick it under Chuck's head which they do. After a struggle & lots of squeaking & thrashing about blood seeps through the bad & it is removed only to show Chuck Norris unhurt with the now dead Rat in his mouth! A scene that needs to be seen, it really is quite funny even though it's definitely not meant to be.Filmed in Mexico the lush green jungle locations look nice, the action is alright but again like the original Missing in Action a little bit wimpy, why when Chuck Norris throw's a grenade into a wooden hut at the end & it goes off does the hut not even catch fire? With a supposed budget of about $2,500,000 like the original this has decent production values & one feels it was made to cash-in on Rambo. The acting is bad, Chuck Norris can't act & that's all that needs to be said.Missing in Action 2 The Beginning was indeed meant to be the beginning & be released before the original but as it stands it's good for a few laughs & some nice jungle scenery but little else.

Back home in the US although hope remains that prisoners of war still survive the men are classed as 'missing in action' & rescue efforts cease, ten years pass & Colonel Braddock & some of his men are still being held as POW's by Vietnam under the false pretence of war crimes. Imprisioned in a POW camp in the middle of the jungle run by the strict General Yin (Soon-Teck Oh) & left to rot there by the country they once served there seems little hope of escape, but Colonel Braddock is a strong man & when the time is right will make his move in a bid for freedom...Directed by Lance Hool this supposed sequel to the original Missing In action (1984) was actually filmed first & chronologically is set before the original Missing in Action but the producers (probably the executives at Cannon) felt the original Missing in Action was the better film & decided to release that first & promote Missing in Action 2 The Beginning as a prequel.

Today, I take full responsibility for subjecting my parents, whom I forced to take me to the show, to this nightmarish experience. This film had completely destroyed everything I loved about Jaws and I have long since declared this to be the worst movie ever made.The only redeeming quality about this movie is that it stands as the benchmark for which movies should be deleted out of existence. Therefore, if a movie is found to be worse than Jaws the Revenge, all copies of such a movie should be burned and all of those who have seen said movie should be quarantined. Having said this, the other night I decided to subject my girlfriend to this film in order for her to gain a greater appreciation for every other movie ever made.And now on to the meat. The opening of the film begins with your usually underwater sequence with the Jaws music playing. In this movie, however, the style of the title and opening credits gives it a very made for T.V. feel. We are soon to discover that Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) has died of a heart attack, or as it was suggested in the film, from fear of the shark (the same shark he destroyed in the first film). Martin is survived by his wife and two sons. His youngest son, who followed in daddy's footsteps and is now the chief of police in Amity Island, is quickly eaten during the first ten minutes. This leads to a chain of events where Mrs. Brody (Loraine Gary) develops psychic powers to be able to feel when the shark is present and becomes convinced that the shark is out to get all the Brodys. Mrs. Brody now decides to move to the Bahamas to live with her marine biologist eldest son Michael. Next the film tries to expand itself with some awkward character development featuring scenes with Michael's wife discussing their sex life with his mother and the entrance of Michael Cain as Mrs. Brody's love interest. That's right, I said Michael Cain! Michael Cain, a great actor, can be seen here collecting a paycheck. For some reason, Michael Cain has a habit of doing bad movies, and this one is definitely no exception. Somehow the shark discovers that the Brodys' are now in the Bahamas and quickly, and I mean quickly, makes the 2,000 mile trip down. At this point the viewer becomes confused as to whether this shark is a cousin of the original shark, or as the movie seems to suggest, is the same shark! The shark appears to have no interest in anyone except the Brodys; therefore, the film loses its fright factor because as long as you are not a Brody, or near a Brody, you are safe from the dilapidated rubber mess they try to pass off as a shark. The film continues to limp along, I will not even begin to point out the many flaws as others have mentioned, blatantly plagiarizing many scenes from the original film. The film concludes with one of the worst endings in film history. Mrs. Brody, Michael, Mario Van Peebles, and Michael Cain are trapped on a boat being terrorized by, what appears to be, a slow moving rubber mess with its own psychic powers to locate members of the Brody family. Mario Van Peebles is eaten but manages to convince the shark to swallow a strobe light. Michael then begins to use another strobe light, that is somehow connected to the strobe light the shark swallowed, to drive the shark crazy and make it roar like a lion while leaping 15 feet out of the water. Finally, in one of the most confusing scenes I have ever witnessed, Mrs. Brody impales the shark with the bow of the boat and the shark appears to explode. To accomplish the exploding shark effect, the director simply pasted the shark death scene from the original Jaws onto this film.If the Jaws sequels were intended to be a contest as to who could make the worst installment in the franchise, this movie is a crowning achievement.

I forced myself the second time and it really is slow. The main characters had me pulling my hair out - you just want them to die as quickly as possible because they were so annoying We don't care about your relationship problems, we are supposed to be watching a slasher flick. Even the uncut version has very tame gore. Some of the characters seem to be immune to chainsaws - very strange. The blood looks like clear strawberry syrup.

I don't know what other reviewers saw, but this movie takes forever to get moving and even then it is so mild and boring that the first time I tried to watch it, I turned it off because I was falling asleep. I forced myself the second time and it really is slow. The main characters had me pulling my hair out - you just want them to die as quickly as possible because they were so annoying We don't care about your relationship problems, we are supposed to be watching a slasher flick.

An intellectual and happy couple (played by Allen and Mia Farrow, ironic because it was their last film as a couple both real life and on screen) starts to reevaluates their marriage after the sudden and enthusiastically break up of a couple (played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis) friend of theirs. After that a roller-coaster of emotions takes place in the story and the character's thoughts and feelings on relationships, break-ups, new beginnings, love affairs, happiness, loneliness, age and several other things are presented in many dramatic sketches and in some very subtle funny moments. Juliette Lewis, Liam Neeson, Lysette Anthony all play the love interests of the broken couple (including Allen and Farrow) throughout the film.Allen and the questions his characters asks in the course of the movie is very down to earth. I think many people who had been involved in a love relationship must have asked some questions like Do you still love me?, Did you ever cheat on me? and that kind of thing, and the other one seemed to be shocked with the interrogation. A movie about trust or the lack of it between a couple; it's a movie about doubts; judgments and misled feelings (Pollack's comments about how he got bored of his wife after so many years; then after he leaves his younger girlfriend he follows the same direction). To Allen our heart isn't logical, so you might wonder where did this is going to take us, thoughts in one side wanting to fulfill expectations (many of it wrong), our hearts following other path, always wanting other things. An enormous and continuous contradiction. But as it was showed here after many of the couples were going right, then going wrong, and everybody searching for the real loved ones, we always must give it a try on love and try our best to get happy (or don't). In the end whatever works! Another great ensemble casting with positive good performances (Davis nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe), Husbands and Wives is wonderful, a work of a genius, right in the target on the subject without suffocate the viewer with too romantic modisms. It's a very truthful work. By the way I loved the movements of the hand held camera in the beginning when Pollack and Davis are so happy talking about the end of their marriage and Allen and Farrow are devastated by that. So non typical of Woody Allen. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Woody Allen invites audiences to watch the ups and downs of love relationships in Husbands and Wives.
