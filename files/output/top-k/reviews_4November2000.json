And that's why I liked it.  Though similar to the original (Charlie is still the incomparable John Forsythe, and the three leading ladies still kick ass), this version of Charlie's Angels is a notch higher than the original in the action sphere.  The amazing special effects were enough to keep my rapt attention and were somewhat reminiscent of The Matrix.  I'll admit, the plot was not exactly original, but I don't think the makers of the film ever intended it to be the centerpiece.  I think that this movie was meant to showcase powerful women doing extraordinary and fascinating moves.  And fascinate they did (albeit half naked...I guess that was to bring in the male viewer.)  The actresses all played their parts perfectly, with the right combination of strength and whimsy.  The triumverate had great chemistry and played well with Bill Murray, who turned in another brilliant comic side-kick performance. (He's getting good at that.  See Wild Things for another similar performance.)  The villians were all a bit one demensional, but again I think that this effect was intentional in a movie that is more about eye candy and being a charicature of itself that it is about plot and character development.  While I expected it to be somewhat lacking in seriousness, I was pleased to see that the makers purposely set out to create this effect, creating a movie that has fun with itself.  For proof of this, just watch the scenes of what the Angels did pre-Charlie.  Also, look for a great comedic performance by Drew's new husband as The Chad.This flick set out to do exactly what it wanted  entertain.  Granted, it was all light hearted entertainment, but sometimes that is exactly what I am looking for.  And I found it in Charlie's Angels.

So in a way, MI2 has done something right in the end.Wolverine is without a doubt the main character of the movie. Singer has improved the concept of his claws coming out of the knuckles and being bigger, they look staddier. Good job.For the rest not the best plot ever, but in this movie, the plot's not important. It's the characters that come to life, the great music, the strong cast and fantastic special effects. This movie is about the best comic book adaption ever and it's the start of a new line of such movies. X-Men 2 and 3, Spiderman, Spawn 2 (come on, part 1 sucked, it should've been more like the comics), Blade 2, Fantastic Four, etcetera. What I really mean is that the Stan Lee-style was not in this movie. I don't mean to disrespect Stan Lee, after all he created it, but his characters are always a little bit unreal and too happy and the uniforms look colorful and unrealistic. That's why I like the new X-Men suits.What I also liked, were the references and quotes humor. Toad imitating Darth Maul and thus imitating himself, the yellow spandex, Logan's disbelief about the names, and so on. Some details from the comics may have been changed or lost, but the result is great.Conclusion X-Men is an amusing, fascinating and good movie that's made for a sequel.

First, there is the complaint that this movie is unfairly compared to the original Blair Witch -- HELLO!! ITS CALLED BLAIR WITCH 2!! They are giving the impression that this movie is a continuation of the first (for example, that it would be scary or suspenseful)....it is natural to expect similarities to the first movie.

The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad.

To me it had an almost documentary feel due to the wobbly, slightly de-saturated. camera shots & jump cuts. The musical elements are daydreams that just happen to be set to music.Initially the whip pans and jump cuts were distracting but you soon get accustomed to it. Interestingly enough the daydream (musical) sequences were all locked off shots and the colour vibrant.Dancer in the Dark is certainly not a feel good movie, but is extremely emotive. It's impossible not to feel sorry for Björk's character &#145;Selma' as she spends all her days & nights working to save money for her sons eye operation before she herself goes blind from a hereditary disease. Björk is supremely suited to the role of Selma IMHO. Her child like innocence & totally self-effacing attitude is exploited by one of the characters, which leads to a particularly harrowing twist in the film. All the characters are believable and the acting superb, the 140 minutes runtime of this movie sped by.Dancer in the Dark is definitely one of the best films I have seen.

If you had to describe this film in one word, it would be blah. Overall the movie is somewhat slow and incoherent.  The first part of the film drags too much, while the second half moves too quickly. As a horror film, this film isn't too successful.  Most of the horror scenes have all been done before, so the element of surprise is pretty much wasted. As an end of the world film, we need not even comment how bad End Of Days is (the scene where Schwarzenegger ponders whether he has until 1200 in general or Eastern Time till the world goes to hell says it all.) As an action movie, End of Days does even worse. For an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, its somewhat surprising that the action isn't as intense or crammed with the classic overkill factor that most viewers have come to expect.  Not to sound sarcastic, but when Arnold is on the loose, you almost expect the bad guys to show off how 'bad' they really are, only to be surprised a second later when Arnold shows up in an AV-8B jump jet guns ablazin. (Just think about how bad Arnold messed the Predator and imagine what he could have done in End of Days.)

It also has the best direction in a movie ever. Subtlety is high and convention is low in this drama about one man's personal revenge on the world. It sounds a bit like Taxi Driver, and sometimes the movie captures the poetic style of a John Woo film, but this movie is a peerless masterpiece, with an absolutely heart wrenching ending.
